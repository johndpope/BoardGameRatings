			<description>You know, when you debate whether you should help that little old lady cross the street or instead run to catch your train on time? It&amp;rsquo;s the little Angel and Demon on your shoulders, whispering in your ears, both trying to influence you on a daily basis. &lt;br/&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s about time the roles got reversed. Dilemma allows YOU to influence Angels and Demons! You can help decide which side will end up victorious!&lt;br/&gt;Win the game by choosing the right side and collecting the most Feathers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dilemma is a card game for 4 to 9 players, and takes about 5 minutes per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over 5 rounds. In every round all players choose an Angel or a Demon card from their hand. In their turn, each player chooses another player to interact with. Depending on the outcome of the encounter, players will gain or lose Feathers, and/or will make Dennis the Dove move on the Dilemma track. If Dennis reaches a new card, an event will be triggered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the 5th round, Dennis will declare which side is victorious,depending on the side he ended on: Angels or Demons. &lt;br/&gt;Out of the players who chose the victorious side, the TWO players with the most Feathers in their possession are declared the winners of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
