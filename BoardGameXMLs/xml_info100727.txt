			<description>You are in the world of the Middle Ages, the age of the Crusades. Bitter religious conflicts and economic struggles have caused decades of oppression on the people fighting for predominance in the world. Many warriors have already paid dearly by losing their lives on the battlefield. However, participation in these wars has often brought honour and glory to many people and made them rich beyond their dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game is free. When you register, you decide if you fight as a Christian Crusader, Muslim Saracen or Pagan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through assaults, plundering and protecting you will gain experience points. If you reach a certain number of experience points, you rise up to a higher level. To become a better fighter, you not only need a weapon, a shield, a helmet, armour and a horse, but you also have to train your property values and those of your horse (if you have one) upwards. To do this, you need gold coins. To get the gold coins, you can work, plunder, protect or fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also earn many pieces of gold by recruiting new warriors! To do this, use your own link, which you can find under Status &amp;gt; Diplomacy. Send this link to your friends, put it on your website (you can find banners under 'Download') or use it as a signature for your forum contributions. If somebody clicks on your link and registers at Holy-War within 30 minutes of clicking the link, you will recruit a new warrior! From then on, you will always receive 10% of the gold coins that your recruited warrior wins in warrior vs. warrior fights or in order battles. The 10% is an extra bonus for you! Your recruited warrior will not be charged or put at a disadvantage by being your recruit. Additionally, everytime one of your recruits redeems a ticket you receive 3 days premium status. If you are already enjoying premium status, your premium status will be extended by 3 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player registers for the game through your recruitment link, they'll receive 9 days beginners premium status, rather than the normal 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
