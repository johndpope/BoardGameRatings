							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Meints Index to Glorantha</name>
									
			<description>A comprehensive index and discussion of products in the Glorantha setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;Playing in or collecting literature about Glorantha has often been a challenge. What is out there? What does each thing contain? Within these pages I ope you will find many of the answers to those types of questions. In the long gone days of yore when the second edition of RuneQuest was still in print, the choices were far fewer and you paid the retail prince. In today's collector's market knowing what to pick and choose from is essential if you want to save some time and/or money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As much as I could, over the last decade or two I have rummaged through auctions, pestered various experts, raided numerous collections and spent many a night at my computer compiling this list of products, supplements and articles. I have tried to be as accurate, complete and organized as possible, while sometimes even being a little humorous. In the end, I hope gamemasters, player, collectors and the sentimental types (like me) will find this second edition useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Product Descriptions- which include an overview of each item's contents and an inventory of the cults, miniatures, spells, skills, scenarios and creatures the author detailed.&lt;br/&gt;     Hundreds of illustrations- over 100 of the products are depicted with their cover art so you know what to look for and can also see how vividly they brought Glorantha alive.&lt;br/&gt;     Article Listings- so much of what has been written is scattered through a wide variety of magazines. This ever-growing list is organized to help you find your way through the stacks. &lt;br/&gt;     Alphabetized Lists- every cult, scenario, spell, skill and creature detailed in all of the products have been organized into lists of their sources. You will no longer have to hunt for their details. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
