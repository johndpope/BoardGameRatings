			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Battlemap of an Pier, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The lamp posts are flickering&amp;hellip;not now! All hands brace for impact, I can&amp;rsquo;t see the shoals of the pier!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DramaScape&amp;rsquo;s Pier is now open for dockworkers, fishermen, sea dogs, tourists, and Player Characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pier is a single exterior map of a shoreline dock with an attached bridge raised up from the water by stone pillars using a rocky shoal as its foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pier is intended for use in modern games due to the presence of lamp posts and the life preserver in the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pier makes an excellent companion map to our River Barge and The Lighthouse products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Hook for use with the map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Put Out the Lights?: The lamp posts mysteriously flicker at night before going out completely, sending a ship crashing into the rocky shoals. The crashing ship wakes up the villagers and they rush to save as many lives as they can. The Player Characters can first get involved by helping with the search and rescue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the initial event, the Player Characters may be asked to help in the investigation by the villagers. The villagers are likely to trust them if they helped the rescue operation in the middle of the night. The surviving captain and crew need interviewed and any other witnesses out on the pier last night. The power plant is fine if investigated with no power surges or outages recorded last night. The lamp posts themselves have burned out bulbs but the electrical wiring seems fine. The villagers replace all the bulbs once the Player Characters finish investigating them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That night though, the same flickering occurs and shorts out all the lamp post bulbs. After the lights are out, one of the crewmen and his midnight rendezvous are attacked in the middle of the night on one of the benches. Their bodies are discovered tossed onto the rocky shoals the next morning. Someone or something is targeting this particular crew and those that associate with them but why? And how are they shorting the bulbs out without any other damage to the lamp posts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it sabotage by a local crime boss eliminating shipping competition for his smuggling? Or is it some sort of ghost with a grudge against this captain and crew? Or is it something far more ancient and malevolent awakened by the rays of light penetrating its once dark domain at night?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
