			<description>From the web site:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Cool Factors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amazing 12+ Games in one!&lt;br/&gt;    Fast, stimulating game play!&lt;br/&gt;    Fun for the whole family - always fresh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh My Word&amp;rdquo; is not just one game, but is 12+ games in one, with more being developed and added frequently! You can play any of the games with the same deck of cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most fun and exciting games ever created is &amp;ldquo;Battle of Words!&amp;rdquo; It comes in &amp;ldquo;quick start,&amp;rdquo; &amp;quot;basic,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; versions. The basic version can be mastered in a matter of minutes and is fun for the entire family. The play consists of forming words, lengthening existing words, combining words, and stealing words from your opponent(s). The advanced version is easy to learn but will stimulate and challenge even the most astute word gamers. In addition to the basic play, there are 20 action cards that create all kinds of excitement and dynamics between the players. In either version, each player competes for high score through word values, word length values, bonus letter values, bonus word values, other word bonuses, and the number / quality of words acquired by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also play the following;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cross Words&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to a crossword puzzle game, without the limits of a regular game.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Play On Words&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to a 3-D crossword puzzle game, without standard limitations.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Finding the Right Words&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to a cubed word game, without the grid or cube.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Last Word&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to a word jumble or word search, with strategy &amp;amp; scoring options.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Simple Words&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to solitaire, but played with words and is more entertaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can even play poker style games that involve many more strategies and scoring options, such as;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Word For Word&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to Texas Hold 'em.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Keep Your Word&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to 7-Card Stud.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Choose Your Words&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to 7-Card Draw.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hold Your Words&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to 7-Card No Draw.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;A Few Words&amp;rdquo; - plays similar to 7-Card No Peek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, you get &amp;quot;Your Words, Not Mine&amp;quot; which creates several more variations of game play, allowing you to play many of the games backwards! Rather than competing for high score, each player competes for low score by transferring their words / scores to other players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck comes with 176 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
