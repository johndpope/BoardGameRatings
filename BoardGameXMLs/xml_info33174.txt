			<description>&amp;Auml;lyp&amp;auml;&amp;auml;! is based on the most popular Finnish internet trivia game. At first you'll have to estimate to how many multiple choice questions you can answer correctly. Each correct answer brings you points and reaching your estimate gives you a bonus. The questions are of three different difficulty levels and in the beginning you're answering easy questions and in the end the really hard ones. During the game you can once skip answering a question, once delete a wrong answer choice and once ask for a clue. The board has two sides: On one side the winner is the player who has given most correct answers, on the other side the winner is decided by points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
