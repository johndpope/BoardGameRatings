							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Watch</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Watch is Powered by the Apocalypse. These quick to learn and intuitive rules are designed to get everyone at the table straight into the game as soon as possible. Character creation is quick, cooperative, and fun, and you can run the game from start to finish with little-to-no prep. We've seen brand new and veteran tabletop gamers try out this system and in every case they've taken to it right away. The Watch can be taught to newcomers in just a few minutes but the rules are robust enough to scratch that mechanical itch that so many of us enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
