			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrow of the Culder is the initial adventure in the dangerous land of Provincia. Carrying on from this month&amp;rsquo;s free adventure, this scenario brings the adventuring party together in the small community of Merrydale. Two PCs will be meeting on the hill outside of town and then move forward to find additional members of the group as well as their first challenge. One PC will have received a job to find a missing minor artifact and have orders to gather any assistance&amp;hellip;hence the party forms and has a common goal! After gathering their equipment they will follow a hidden trail to the final resting place of the feared warlord named the Culder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Provincia Campaign for an initial to low level group of adventurers.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for several one shot adventures or a continuing campaign setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
