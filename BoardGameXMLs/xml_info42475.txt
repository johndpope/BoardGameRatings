							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pest Control</name>
									
			<description>A (very) quick playing real-time rummy style game the aim in Pest Control is to clear your hand of pests (cards) before the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a hand of 7 cards, which they play down by making nests (melds) of 3 or more cards either of the same type or in sequential order, i.e. a run. Cards may also be added to nests played by any player. On their turn players either pick up a card off the draw deck or the entire discard pile, they then discard a card. However cards may be played down by any player at any time during their turn or other players turns,in other words the game can end at any point, meaning you have to keep a close eye on what the other players are doing and how many cards they have left. Cards left in the hand score negative points, the person with the lowest points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pest Control is a print &amp;amp; play game which can be tried out first with an ordinary pack of cards if you are only playing 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decks can be easily printed at Artscow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pest Control Creepies Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.artscow.com/share/r9a406xevpm3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.artscow.com/share/r9a406xevpm3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pest Control Creepies Deck Crawlies Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.artscow.com/share/7ys9l128kc5s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.artscow.com/share/7ys9l128kc5s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are only planning on playing 2-4 players you can print and play with either deck, if you plan on playing with 5-8 players you will need both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
