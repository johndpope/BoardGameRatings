			<description>Ah-Sitake HA! The ninja battlin', card spinnin', flingin' flangin' action game of well, battling ninjas, spinning cards, and flanging flingings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simultaneously choose your battle focus card, then toss it out onto the table and see whether your attack attacked, your counter countered, your block blocked, your throw threw, or your weakness got punched squarely in the junk!  Battle multiple opponents at the same time.  But be careful!  A successful attack on one opponent may leave you exposed in a very sensitive spot!  With every angle there is an equal and opposite re-angle... and yours may just be your undoing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle your friends until they become your enemies!  If anyone is left standing after one round, special attack and block cards come into play to give those that are behind the ability to hopefully SAVE their behind, or more efficiently KICK someone else's!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready for some fast-paced, ninja animal, card battling?  Oh you think so, do you?  Well, you'll just have to find out.  I say to you, sir (or ma'am), &amp;quot;Ah-Sitake HA!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
