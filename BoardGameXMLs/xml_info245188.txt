							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Train Simulator: PRR GE 44 Loco</name>
									
			<description>The GE 44-ton switcher is a small but tough switching locomotive first built in the 1940s, and is now available as a Pennsylvania Railroad switcher for the Horseshoe Curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built by General Electric specifically to weigh no more than 44 short tons in order to fit in with the labour agreements for train crews in those days, the GE 44-tonner was created during the early days of the transition from steam to diesel freight haulage in North America and found work on railroads across the country. Regulations at the time said that any locomotive weighing more than 44 tons must have a second crewman in the cab: the GE 44-tonner could be run with only a driver, saving money for the railroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 350 examples were built up until 1956, with various power units being fitted over the years, and around 20 still exist in preservation across the US and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed for Train Simulator by Digital Train Models, the GE 44-ton switcher comes in PRR black livery with scenarios for the Horseshoe Curve route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 scenarios for Horseshoe Curve:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ins and Outs at Altoona&lt;br/&gt;    Pullin' out of Picardi&lt;br/&gt;    Out of the Shed&lt;br/&gt;    Rarely on the Main&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the General Electric 44-Tonner switcher diesel locomotive in Pennsylvania Railroad black livery, featuring opening cab doors and windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
