			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have escaped Hirshbeck Estates and made it to nearby Sanctuary. Pursued by raiders, genetically modified dogs, and massive numbers of Living Dead, they lost several friends along the way and barely survived; but it appeared as though safety and security were once again within reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After watching Michael and Selina succumb to the infection, they were barely able to rest before UniMed attacked the underground camp in force. Left with no choice but to flee deeper into the tunnels, the characters were pursued by the soldiers and their dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caught in the middle of a terrible war for survival, will the characters be able to live long enough to escape the city?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
