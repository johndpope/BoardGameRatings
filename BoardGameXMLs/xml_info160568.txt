			<description>Roll with the punches!&lt;br/&gt;There's a rowdy ruckus in the land of Leprechauns. &lt;br/&gt;Perhaps it's their penchant for porter, or maybe it's because they're giddy for gold. Either way, it's time to play. Pick up your Shillelagh and join in the frey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leprechaun is an all out battle for gold. It's a dice rolling game with a bit of press your luck. Players represent Leprechauns gathering gold coins, fighting over gold coins, and bolstering by drinking beer and gathering 4 leaf clovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play consists of drawing 3 dice from the bag, choosing an action showing on the dice and then deciding if they wish to press their &amp;quot;luck of the Irish&amp;quot; by drawing additional dice from the bag, or they may bank what they have already acquired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather, Fight or Bolster your way to the most gold to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
