							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Champions New Millennium: Bay City</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Welcome to the Big City, hero.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based in a post-Quake San Francisco, Bay City describes in depth the default setting for the Champions: The New Millenium roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of the book is taken up by 46 area descriptions, each of which includes one page of description written as if for a travel guide, one notable NPC, and one to five story seeds.  Some of the settings are distinctly combat-oriented (the description of Viper nest, of a hidden super combat arena, or of a Guard station), while some are purely there for color and non-powered roleplaying (like Nicky's On Third, a restaurant styled like a mob-run Prohibition speakeasy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next major section includes descriptions for major heroes (Crusader, The Marksman) and enemies (The Masters of Fortune, Foxbat and Friends - yes, Foxbat has decided it's time for him to build his own supervillian group).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book ends on a four-page rule section, including errata, weapon tables, new skills, and new powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
