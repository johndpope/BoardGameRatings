			<description>Party game. Each guest is given a card with 3 different games on it. It is best played as a 'speed-quiz', i.e. first to solve each section will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1. Odd One Out - similar pictures are grouped in three's. One is very slightly different and your task is to find that 'Odd One Out'.&lt;br/&gt;Game 2. Two Alike - another observation test. There are 12 pictures of a dog. All of them look the same at first glance. However only two are identical, so players must find that pair.&lt;br/&gt;Game 3. Safari - Players are given 9 different sentences. Hidden within the sentence is a name of an animal. Example; Near the wall a bystander looked on; Answer WALLABY. I am sure this type of word-play has a name but I can't recall it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
