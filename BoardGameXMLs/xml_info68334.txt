			<description>A moral race game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment required: counters of glazed earthenware marked with the letters A to H, teetotum of bone marked with red and black numbers 1 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a teetotum and small blocks marked with letters of the alphabet. A player chooses his letter, then spins the teetotum and his block is placed upon the number turned up, of course, according to the directions on the other side. It is best to choose a chairman and allow none to touch the blocks but him. As each player spins, he should call out '6' for 'A' or '2' for 'B' and no persons should spin till the former spinner's move has been made. The coloured squares mark the numbers to which any advantage or disadvantage is attached. If the player makes more than 79, he must count the over plus back - 78,77, and no one is the winner till he has made the exact number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
