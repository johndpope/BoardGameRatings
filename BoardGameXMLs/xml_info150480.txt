			<description>Takuran means &amp;quot;Brood Parasite&amp;quot; in Japanese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Takuran is a game played with 20 illustrated cards. 5 cards can be combined to complete an illustration, and there are 4 sets. The cards are shuffled, and each player receives 5 cards. The players then say how many cards they need to exchange in order to complete their set. The players have to decide who they will exchange their chosen number of cards with. This is done twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the second exchange of cards, the player that completes their set, or has the most complete set, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
