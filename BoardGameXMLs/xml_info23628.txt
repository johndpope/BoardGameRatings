			<description>(&amp;quot;Cross-country - The Flying Musketeer&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game published by the German Pilsener beer brewery Wick&amp;uuml;ler in 1973. Theme is an Airship race across North Rhine Westfalia, one of the largest federal states of Germany (the theme is hardly surprising, as NRW was the brewery's location - and is, after an owner change - and their main means of advertising in the 1970s was a large blimp, named the Flying Musketeer, with their logo on it - three musketeers  - cruising around the state).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players move their dice- and action cards-driven silver plastic airships and plastic player tokens around a large map, reaching several cities in a predetermined order, while completing different tasks. Their tokens (plus same tokens in other colors representing items such as beer barrels and tow ropes) can be stacked below the airships in order to raise them above ground, which gives a good indication of who is on the winning path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game had extremely good manufactured components, oversized dice and playing cards printed on thick game board stock. Probably manufactured by Schmidt-Spiele.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
