							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cityscape Tiles: Parking Lot</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The urban jungle is more dangerous with the Cityscape Tiles: Parking Lot. With any good action setting there is going to be a time where you need a good get away vehicle chase and this is where it starts. This PDF contains two sets of 6 six by six inch tiles; one with typical 1-inch square grids usable in most D20 game systems and one with 1-inch hexagon grids usable for Hero Games and miniature gaming; that can be assembled to create any downtown parking lot. Either of theses maps are suitable for all the most popular RPG and miniature games on the market today. All the artwork in this product is by Brian Dalrymple. Color and grayscale versions are included for both tile types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
