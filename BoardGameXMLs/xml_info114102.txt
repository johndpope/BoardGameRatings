			<description>In the distant future, man will establish colonies on other planets. For now, man stands on the verge of what will likely be his final war on earth:  a nuclear war. Man&amp;rsquo;s two previous wars to end war never truly solved the problem. This time, the weapons are much larger and more destructive. The ruling nuclear powers have decided that Earth is only large enough for one of them; they consider shared power a waste of time. Resources grow scarce; diplomats and the U.N. have failed. Your power can only survive to lead humanity by eliminating all other powers that stand in its way.  Speed of launch is life or death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rocket Die is primarily a dice (or die, rather) game for 3-6 players. Each player controls a nuclear-capable nation of the future, called a power. Each turn is divided into three phases:  deployment (aiming weapons at other powers), roll out (cycling repeatedly to decide which power will launch) and launch (validating and executing the launch, damaging other powers).  The goal is for your power to be the first to initiate launch each turn, since only one power gets to launch per turn.  The game ends when all players but one are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
