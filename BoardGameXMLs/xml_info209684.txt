			<description>Monopologs  was developed  in the RAND Logistics Department. In it, a player or group of players  manages a simple simulation of the Air Force supply system consisting of one depot and five two-wing bases, which phase in during the game.  The players thus &amp;quot;practice&amp;quot; inventory management and gain insight into inventory-control problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player acts as the inventory manager for  the &amp;quot;Widget&amp;quot; -- a high-value depot-reparable spare part -- and makes principal decisions of inventory control that such a manager has to make in reality.  Aware of the given costs and lead times for each of his actions, he initiates procurement, plans repair schedules, and sets inventory and distribution policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;True to practical Air Force experience, the demand for the &amp;quot;widget&amp;quot; is a random variable beyond the player's control.  He is given certain limited information on the basis of which he must predict demands and establish inventory levels.  He makes decisions, and in time learns their consequences.  The game runs through a simulated period of 31 months, at the end of which he computes his score: the total costs his actions incurred.  Some of the scores of past groups are included for comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many different groups have found Monopologs highly educational.  The Air Force has found it useful for giving a broader management picture to many officers, particularly those concerned with only one phase of management, such as procurement or repair.  Aircraft contractors have used it to acquaint employees with their customers' problems.  At RAND itself, the game has helped to orient new employees and to stimulate logistics thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
