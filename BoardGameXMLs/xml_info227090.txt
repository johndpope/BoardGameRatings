							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horrible Hordes</name>
									
			<description>A Fantasy Board game for 1-6 Players played over 20 rounds on a 10x10 square grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game tiles are placed on to the grid randomly in a checkerboard pattern.  There are 50 Terrain Tiles, 10 for each of the 5 Types: &lt;br/&gt;Mountain (Stone)&lt;br/&gt;Forest (Wood)&lt;br/&gt;Farms (Food)&lt;br/&gt;Hills (Metal)&lt;br/&gt;Swamp (Magic)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pool of Horde Counters.  Each is unique.&lt;br/&gt;Each Counter has the name of the Horde plus 4 Traits: &lt;br/&gt;1. Type (Humanoid, Undead, or Monster)&lt;br/&gt;2. Attack (Target roll this Horde needs to get or higher to hit)&lt;br/&gt;3. Defence (Subtracted from player attack rolls vs this Horde)&lt;br/&gt;4. Hits (Number of Hit Counters placed under this Horde)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of Army Tokens and Settlement Markers of a unique colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common set of Castle Markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common set of Resource Chits: &lt;br/&gt;Stone (Grey) &lt;br/&gt;Wood (Brown)&lt;br/&gt;Food (White)&lt;br/&gt;Metal (Blue)&lt;br/&gt;Magic (Red)&lt;br/&gt;Gold (Yellow)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a Player Sheet which includes&lt;br/&gt;- The Kingdom List&lt;br/&gt;- The Ability List&lt;br/&gt;Players should mark off what Kingdom they are and what abilities they have when they get them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player settlements are placed randomly on the board (as determined by a dice roll).  Settlements cannot be within 2 spaces of each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each player 1 Horde is placed on a board (also determined by dice roll).  These starting hordes cannot be placed on or adjacent to a settlement and not on another horde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns. &lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 11 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;1.  Event Phase &lt;br/&gt;-   Roll once (1D10) on the Event Table and resolve. &lt;br/&gt;2.  Resource Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Gain 3 free resources of any type. &lt;br/&gt;-   For each terrain occupied by one of your settlements gain 1 extra resource of the type produced by that terrain. &lt;br/&gt;3.  Trade Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may convert 2 gold into 1 resource of any other type. &lt;br/&gt;-   You may trade/gift resources with other players who have settlements adjacent to yours.&lt;br/&gt;4.  Settle Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may build 1 settlement. The cost to build the settlement is 2 food and 3 wood. &lt;br/&gt;5.  Fortify Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may build 1 castle on one of your settlements.  The cost to build the castle is 4 stone. &lt;br/&gt;6.  Train Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may build armies on one of your castles.  The cost to train an army is 1 food, 2 metal, and 1 wood. &lt;br/&gt;7.  Move Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may move your armies to an adjacent space.  It costs 1 food to move all the armies in 1 stack (max of 4 armies). &lt;br/&gt;8.  Attack Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   If your armies and a horde occupy the same space, there will be a battle. Gain a Victory Token every time you destroy a horde stack. &lt;br/&gt;9.  Research Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Pick one ability from the Research List. &lt;br/&gt;-   You may gain an extra ability for the cost of 10 resources. &lt;br/&gt;10. Spawn Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   A new horde appears on the board. &lt;br/&gt;-   After turn 10 two hordes appear on the map!&lt;br/&gt;11. End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Max resource chits you can hold is 7. Discard excess chits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a round (when all Players have taken 1 turn) there will be a Horde Segment and a Raid Segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horde segment&lt;br/&gt;-   Each Horde will move under a prescribed set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;Raid Segment&lt;br/&gt;-   This is handled exactly like Attack Phase except that now castles and settlements are involved in the Battles.  They function similar to Armies except that Settlements hit on a roll of 8+ and Castles hit on a roll of 7+. Victory Tokens are gained every time you destroy a Horde Stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game (20 rounds), the player with the most Units (Settlements, Armies, and Castles) plus Victory Tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
