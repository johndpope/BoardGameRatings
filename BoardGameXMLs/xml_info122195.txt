			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action/adventure game heavily inspired by John Carpenter's Escape From New York movie. New York has been turned into a gigantic prison. You are Snail Lispken, a criminal sentenced to life imprisonment in New York. You have been offered an amnesty if you can bring back the president of the USA, whose plane crash-landed somewhere in New York a half hour ago. You have 24 hours to accomplish your mission. If you fail, the bombs implanted in your body will detonate and end your life in a very messy fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts at the foot of the World Trade Center. You have a tracker indicating the direction of the president, an Ingram submachinegun and grenades. You can talk to the many inhabitants of New York, but most of them will be hostile. You can also drive vehicles and collect useful items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
