							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clusterfight!: And Whose Army? Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clusterfight is a party game of hypothetical battles for 3-12 players. If you've ever stayed up into the wee hours debating the finer points of Freddy vs. Jason, or Kirk vs. Picard, this game's for you. And seriously, who really thinks that the landmark case of Alien vs. Predator settled anything? Nobody even stopped to ask, &amp;quot;What if Predator had laser eyes?&amp;quot; Each round in Clusterfight, players throw combatants into the ring, then change the dynamics of the fight with &amp;quot;battle cards&amp;quot;. Sure, Batman could beat up the Pope, but what if Batman was &amp;quot;Vomiting Uncontrollably&amp;quot; and the Pope was &amp;quot;Fighting Mad&amp;quot;? Everyone has a chance to bet on the outcome, then a judge decides the winner and bets are settled. When all players have judged twice, the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;50 card expansion to the popular party game Clusterfight!  New Battlegrounds, Items, Actions &amp;amp; Statuses and Fighters.  All cards created by our Kickstarter backers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
