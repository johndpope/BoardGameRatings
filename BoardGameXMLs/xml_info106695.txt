							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shooot2: Revenge of Square</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooot2 is the second in the Shooot Series from Flash developer Tonypa.  Once again you play a square and you are trying to shoot down all the circles on screen, while collecting powerups and not getting touched by circles.  The catch here is that your square is constantly rotating, changing to direction its bullets will head in, requiring you to constantly readjust your location to hit the targets.  In addition, it continues to use the mechanic of your weapons power decreasing with every hit, and of different colored circles moving differently.  The game continues until you have lost all your weapon's power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
