			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, Oh My! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Mesoamerica brings you an awesome array of marauding monsters and exotic encounters from the myths and legends of Central and South America and the Caribbean from the jungles of the Yucatan to the peaks of the Andes. These lethal legends of Latin America range from CR 1 to 30, including such Aztec-inspired creatures as eye-gouging ahuizotl and the apocalyptic harbinger from the stars, the tzitzimitl. From the Mayans we present the beautiful dreamflower xtabay and from Peru the deadly jungle stalker, the tunche. The legends of Chile, from the Araucana to the Chilote and more, bring us the accursed guecubu arisen from its grave with misfortune in its wake, as well as the volcanic cherufe and the shapechanging serpentine peuchen. Classic pulp and fantasy writers like Robert E. Howard have brought us monsters like the hate-fueled zuvembie and the saguaroi catcus-folk, inspired by the myths, legends, and landscapes ofMesoamerica. Creatures of genuine Caribbean legend are also well represented, including the blood-sucking chupacabra from Puerto Rico; the deadly sea monster of the Bahamas, the lusca; and even the very real (though now titanic) giant mantis shrimp! As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the brand-new Xipe Totec, a dread demigod flayer of skins and destroyer of destinies. Plus, for your players, the plumed servant prestige class serves the wise and benevolent rainbow-feathered serpents of the jungle pyramids, uniting arcane and divine magic with the subtle weavings of plumes and the watchful gaze of their eternal teachers. This includes both the core prestige class for any Pathfinder campaign, as well as mythic equivalents for making your rainbow servant a legend in her own right!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
