			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Entry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         This RPG item was a submission to the #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge.  It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Stage One: Nick Wedig; Stage Two: James Iles; Stage Three: Ryan &amp;Oacute; Laoithe &lt;br/&gt;Stage One and Two Title: Unexplained&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember what happened. Your memories are in fragments, out of synch or missing. But there is one thing you know for sure; it was beyond this world. Something took -abducted- you. Whisked you away from the mundanities of day to day life.  And now, some vague-yet-menacing government agents want to have a word.&lt;br/&gt;You each play one of the abductees. You each have a story to tell about your experience, but they are jumbled. You each have different memories of what actually happened. Your stories overlap and intersect, but they never quite agree. Sometimes, they are even contradictory.&lt;br/&gt;Play cuts between each of the players are they are being interviewed by the vague-yet-menacing government agents. When one player is the focus, the other players take on the role of these government agents, in order to probe and question the abductee, and maybe figure out what to put into the official report on the incident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
