							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Irregular Magazine (Vol. 2, Issue 1 - Spring 2015)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, we didn&amp;rsquo;t know whether we&amp;rsquo;d ever make it back again, but here we are!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a couple of years of not being able to produce an edition of Irregular Magazine due to a combination of changing personal circumstances and a lack of contributions, we&amp;rsquo;re finally able to bring another edition back to the internet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reflect our hiatus, we&amp;rsquo;ve restarted our numbering, but recognise the great magazines that we produced before by making this Issue 1 Volume 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We think it is a pretty damn good issue to bring us back to publication. We have a look at how our editor is trying to build an army on the cheap &amp;ndash; and we all want cheap armies, right? There is an unnerving sci-fi short story from our good friend Taylor Holloway; Alex is back with more great advice on scratch building and this time it is a Star Destroyer for X-Wing!! and Vet Sgt gives some great advice on building alien scenery. We have a review of the D&amp;amp;D 5th module, The Rise of Tiamat and the contribution that Marc Miller has given us over many years with his Traveller series of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time to get reading &amp;ndash; go on, download your copy now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
