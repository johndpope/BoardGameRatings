							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ironclads: Divided Waters</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Civil War saw the dawn of modern naval warfare, as technological advances in weapons, metallurgy and engineering allowed ironclad warships to take to the seas. It also saw an emphasis on economic warfare, as Confederate raiders tried desperately to erode the Union's enormous financial advantage by attacking Northern trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironclads: Divided Waters is a complete boxed game in our series of Industrial Age naval combat. It's based on the Confederacy's program of long-distance commerce raiding, with action taking place around the globe. Famous raiders like the Alabama, Florida and Shenandoah take to the high seas in search of fat Yankee merchantmen, while the U.S. Navy upholds its proud tradition of protecting the nation at any cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map covers the entire world, as Confederate raiders attempt to ruin Yankee commerce, while the Union strangles the Confederacy's cotton-based economy with a tight blockade. While the search procedure is very different from Hearts of Iron, given the vastly different map scales, combat is resolved in exactly the same fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS:&lt;br/&gt;44 1.3&amp;quot; x 2/3&amp;quot; long counters; 88 2/3&amp;quot; square counters&lt;br/&gt; 1 34&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; strategic map; 1 25&amp;quot; x 24&amp;quot; tactical map&lt;br/&gt; 1 16 page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
