			<description>Enter Bug Heroes Quest, a spin-off of the critically acclaimed Bug Heroes, by Foursaken Media! Embark on an epic, story-based adventure through a variety of huge environments. Explore, level up, customize, fight, talk, and more! Experience a unique blend of action, adventure, and RPG in a brand new, fully realized fantasy setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bug Heroes Quest is a Universal iPhone game set in the world of Bug Heroes, released on August 3rd, 2011. Unlike Bug Heroes' survival-based, high score-focused gameplay, Quest focuses more on RPG elements, continuous gameplay, persistant elements and the story of the BH universe. Bug Heroes Quest explores the backstories of its heroes, and further explore the world in which the events of Bug Heroes transpire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bug Heroes Quest originally sold at a sale price of $0.99 for the first three days, but is now $1.99 with three IAPs (the new cheats). It focuses on the original three heroes: Ant, Beetle, and Spider, but will still feature the 9 heroes. Only one 'reinforcement' hero appears on the game: Roach the Mechanic. A trailer of the game is available on YouTube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLOT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot begins before the events of Bug Heroes. The scorpions had only just recently attacked, with armies of bugs already captured. The actual game begins when Master Spider, a black widow assassin spider, assigns Spider to kill some rebel ants. Later she is ordered to kill their general ant, but not before she shakes her trust with the other spiders. Master Spider has her interrogate their prisoner which happens to be Worm, who does not tell her a single secret. While the colony is attacked by enemy forces, Spider is told by Master Spider that she needs to kill a beetle general. However Worm mentioned earlier that he could help take away her uneasiness.&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile in the Garden, Beetle, that same mentioned general, begins to fight some bugs that trespassed his village. He then decides to retire. However his fighting career must continue when the scorpions attack the village over night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spider gets to the Garden, but the villiage has already been destroyed. Many beetle corpses are found laying around, with the huts burned down. However, Beetle's body was nowhere to be found. Spider, confused, traveled back to Garage to report what happened. Meanwhile, Beetle somehow awoke in the Kitchen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play is mostly similar to it's predecessor, Bug Heroes. It's a 3D shooter with different characters, and multiple abilities. However, RPG-like elements are added, such as damage shown and upgradable damage (through treasures), and there are much more numerous level-up skills. Unlike Bug Heroes, most of the missions require you to destroy a certain enemy/object or get to a certain place, but some missions tell you to survive for x amount of minutes. Food spawns around the areas, similarly to Bug Heroes, as a healing source. Also, most of the missions contain a treasure, which gives you some ability or equipment to upgrade one of your heroes. It is also more story-driven, progressing as you complete the missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://bugheroes.wikia.com/wiki/Bug_Heroes_Quest&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://bugheroes.wikia.com/wiki/Bug_Heroes_Quest&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
