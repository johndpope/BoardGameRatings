			<description>The game consists of L-shaped tiles which contain squares in up to three of the four colors used in the game. &lt;br/&gt;Each player receives four open tiles, an additional tile is placed openly on the table. The players now take turns adding a tile which has to be adjacent to at least one square in the same color, while different colors have to be separated by at least one square. For each matching color the player gets a scoring chip. A new tile is drawn at the end of a turn. The player with most scoring chips at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
