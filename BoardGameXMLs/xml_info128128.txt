			<description>Following the success of Pillow-Dex, Parker released a more sophisticated (and more expensive) version. With the balloons, this version also has a cord net which you could tie between two chairs, and rackets. Based on the indoor parlor scene on the box, Parker intended for this to be a game for indoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
