							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jerusalem Bus Stop</name>
									
			<description>In Jerusalem Bus Stop you play a tourist wanting to see all the major sites in Jerusalem.  The board, while now outdated, is based upon a map of the city with the major locations spread out by different routes through the city and &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; spaces and bus stop spaces along the route.  You move by rolling a die and when you land on a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; space or a bus stop space you draw a card.  Question mark cards require you to answer a question about Jerusalem correctly and rewards with bonus movement.  Bus stop cards teleport the player around the board to different sites.  The first player to visit all the major sites wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
