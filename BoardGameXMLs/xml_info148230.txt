							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cult Classic</name>
									
			<description>In the humorous card game Cult Classic, players each take on the role of a fledgling cult leader to see who can create the best cult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game you have nothing but your charismatic personality. The game has six cult leader cards, each with his own special power and ideological focus. As the game progresses, you may gain cards representing beliefs that your cult adheres to as well as material assets you've managed to get your mitts on. The beliefs may be in line with your leader or completely unrelated &amp;mdash; just watch out for contradictions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Cult Classic is to be the first cult to reach ten points, thereby becoming the most powerful cult on the block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
