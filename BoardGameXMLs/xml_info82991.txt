							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Football U</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to Football U, the most immersive and irreverent 3D football game, designed exclusively for the iPhone and iPod touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU are the star QB. Run your offense, pick your plays, target your receivers, and make the perfect pass. Nail completions and score touchdowns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each week of the season, a new and more screwed-up teammate gets in your way. Superstition, lady problems, blackmail... the only way to turn this maddening bunch of misfits into champs is to solve their problems for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great football gameplay in the tradition of our favorite sports comedies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
