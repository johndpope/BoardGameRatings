			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claw of the Savage Tiger is a one-page PDF document containing rules that add role-playing elements to another game, Kung Fu Dice.  Generally, the role-playing elements are very light-weight and concern themselves with healing and gaining experience.  A few optional rules are provided to support multiple players and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kung Fu Dice is a stand-alone three-page PDF dice game that simulates kung fu fighting.  It provides the entire combat resolution system for the Claw of the Savage Tiger role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system is exceptionally simple.  Combat proceeds in rounds and all attacks occur simultaneously.  Each opponent rolls a dice pool of D6 and discards any result that matches an opponent's result.  The remaining dice are totaled and delivered as damage.  The recipient subtracts 1D4 from the total (&amp;quot;shrugs off&amp;quot; a little damage) and records the rest.  The first opponent to suffer 30 points of damage succumbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
