							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">POW! Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The POW! Core Rules are the centerpiece of a simple, adaptable game system designed for quick-moving, action-based role-playing sessions. POW! is simple enough for beginners, yet flexible and expandable enough to appeal to the most battle-hardened role-player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POW! is intended for use with POW! Worldbooks, which provide an assortment of settings that can all be used with the same core ruleset. POW! is the skeleton, a framework giving shape and support while allowing many different skins (the Worldbooks) to be wrapped around the outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* POW! is Rules-Light. This means that the engine has very few dice mechanics, very few variables, and almost no specific rules for Dodging Arrows while Riding a Heavily Encumbered War Elk Through a Swamp at Midnight. POW! leaves out many of the crunchy bits in favor of more streamlined gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* POW! is Camera-friendly. Which isn't to say that it photographs well, but rather that the style of gameplay is camera-like. POW! games move along in frames, snapshots of action that give everyone a chance to act, much like scenes from a comic book, or photographs in a scrapbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* POW! is Action-centric. While this is a role-playing game (defined in more detail on the next page), POW! doesn't pretend to be the sort of game which demands that players spend six hours trying to negotiate peace treaties. You can do that if you like, but POW! isn't designed for it. POW! means action, as in SNAP, CRACKLE, CRASH, BANG, BOOM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
