			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this easter special for Dungeonslayers you can give your players some extra candy, preferably around the easter season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a march through the forest each character gets the chance to find a colorful magical egg in the brushwood which produces wondrous effects. To find ones Egg, a PC makes a check (1x/Level MND+RE+perception). As soon as a PC succeeds on one of his checks he will find his Egg. (Each character can only find one Egg). If none of the checks succeed the character won&amp;rsquo;t find his egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To see which kind of egg the PC has found and which magical bonus it gives, the player rolls on the following tables (without telling which effects the egg has, only the color and looks of the egg are told to the player)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
