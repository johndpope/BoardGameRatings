			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest villains in the world have been defeated and the world has come to peace. This peace has extended to all governments and there has been no war for many years. To help the peace keep going a powerful non government organization has come into being. This group is called Happy Nice Cooperative (HNC). The HNC is made up from many companies and dedicated human rights organizations. The HNC has slowly taking over the world gaining great power over even the world government. HNC seems perfectly safe, their agents don't even use guns. They agents use either beams that make people happy or weapons that paralyze a person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
