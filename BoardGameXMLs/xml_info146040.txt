							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sportz Dice:  Soccer</name>
									
			<description>A dice game that has nothing in common with Soccer except the name and terminology. The game consists of three dice which include one &amp;quot;Defending&amp;quot; die and two &amp;quot;Attacking&amp;quot; dice. The first player rolls his &amp;quot;Attacking&amp;quot; die and if &amp;quot;Shoot&amp;quot; is rolled then the 2nd player rolls the &amp;quot;Defending&amp;quot; die trying to roll a &amp;quot;Miss&amp;quot; result, whereupon the 2nd player now posses the ball and begins &amp;quot;attacking&amp;quot;. The game continues a succession of PASS, TACKLE &amp;amp; SHOOT attacks and GOAL, CORNER &amp;amp; MISS defenses with possession passing between the players. Play continues until a predetermined score (agreed upon before the game) is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
