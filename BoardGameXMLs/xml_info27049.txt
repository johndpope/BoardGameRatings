			<description>From the Website:&lt;br/&gt;This brand new game from veteran homeschoolers Greg &amp;amp; Pamela Berthume combines all of the fun and educational qualities of the old-fashioned family favorite board game and celebrates the best of homeschooling. You start out at Home Sweet Homeschool and pass by squares like Public School Tax or Field Trip, and if you land on the right square you might get to purchase a Big Family Bus or a Cool As Can Be SUV!  And of course, you'll want to try to avoid running into the Truancy Officer lying in wait to send a homeschooler to court! Don't worry, you can use your &amp;quot;HSLDA Member - GET OUT OF COURT FREE&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While playing you'll get to buy properties with your favorite homeschool companies and organizations like HSLDA, Rosetta Stone, Sonlight Curriculum, Greek 'n' Stuff, KONOS, Schoolhouse Store, WriteShop, Artes Latinae, Excellence in Writing, Geography Matters, CLASS, Christian Liberty Press, Centrifuge Language Arts, Systematic Mathematics, Cornerstone Curriculum, Rainbow Resources, Homeschooling Parent Magazine, Teach Magazine, World Magazine, God's World News, The Young Scientist Club, Learning Adventures, HomeschoolersConnecting.com and Creation Illustrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page : &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://homeschoolopoly.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://homeschoolopoly.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
