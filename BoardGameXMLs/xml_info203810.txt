			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helgraad is a medium sized nation of the world of Fastivia. It is a feudal world with a standard of development approximately equal to that of England in the late 11th / early 12th century. At the commencement of the campaign (1,007 DD - by tradition 1,007 years after the death of Lord Davon, the governor of the first Imperial Colony on the island) King Gareth II has ruled for the last ten years. His grandfather Gareth I, Count of Helgravia became the first man to unite the island under one rule. His rule is typical of early medieval rule. He rules the islands simply by his ability to maintain the largest army, and to defeat any one Lord in battle. He would not be able to withstand a wide scale rebellion by a number of Lords. His ability to rule diminishes the further you travel from his capital of Helgravia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helgraad was a house setting for a variety of fantasy role playing games, including Maelstrom (Tabletop), Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2nd Edition), and Middle-earth Role Playing (1st &amp; 2nd Editions).  The system is presented as online HTML, and is still available in an archive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
