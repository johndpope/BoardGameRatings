			<description>Criss Cross Quiz was a quiz programme that combined the game 'Noughts &amp;amp; Crosses' with general knowledge questions and aired on the ITV network for ten years from 1957- 1967 and was produced by Granada Television. The show was based on Tic Tac Dough in the States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was basically the same as the American Tic Tac Dough. Two contestants played the game with the champion playing cross (&amp;quot;X&amp;quot;), and the challenger playing noughts (&amp;quot;O&amp;quot;). They faced a Noughts &amp;amp; Crosses (Tic Tac Toe) game board of nine subjects. Player take turns (starting with the champion) picking categories and answering questions in those categories. Correct answers placed his/her symbol in the board and adds money to the pot; the centre box was worth &amp;pound;40 while the other boxes were worth &amp;pound;20. First player to get three in row (across, up &amp;amp; down or diagonally) wins the game and became champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
