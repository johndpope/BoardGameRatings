			<description>This game is similliar to Kimble/Turnee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is abstract, each player has set of pawns of his color. Each turn player rolls a die and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of five or six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is stops in to a same game square , the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick is that the game board is a squere with circles in the corners. The home bases are in these circles. There are also X shaped gates at corners wich turn everytime a pawn goes through it. This way every other pawn would go to the square route and every other to the circle route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
