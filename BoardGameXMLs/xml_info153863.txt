			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nacht Engel is a story roleplaying game about jealous and paranoid authors living under oppressive totalitarian conditions, while selfishly guarding the secrets of their work. With only a few manifestos and state-sponsored works bearing their name, they must convince the others they have written great works of art that push boundaries, while avoiding imprisonment or death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nacht Engel is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
