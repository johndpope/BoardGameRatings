			<description>Olympic tennis, features complete data for all olympic tennis tournaments from 1984 onward. There are data for both singles and doubles, men and women tournaments. The system is a derivation of the one used in Head to Head tennis (TCS), but without cards for each single player.&lt;br/&gt;Basically, after tossing a coin to decide who's to serve, roll a percentage dice on the service value of the player involved, and if the result is in the correct range, he wins the game. Otherwise, the chance to win the game passes to the opponent, that rolls on his Return value. If both players fails, game goes checking other values, until one player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;There are special rules for tie-break and a random event table, that may strongly modify the result of a game, a set or even the entire match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes as a pdf of 28 pages and it is sold directly by Roberto Chiavini (pumaye@gmail.com to contact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
