			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Persian Wars takes place in the Arabian Nights setting. The magical ring of the great king Salomon just fell from the sky into the desert. You play the role of Sindbad a young warrior who, of course, wants the ring for himself. During the game, you'll encounter the three main tribes who dwell in the desert: the Amazons, fierce warrior women, the Nomads and their powerful horsemen, as well as the Gh&amp;ucirc;ls, necrophagous creatures who use strange weaponry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Persian Wars uses the same engine as Black Moon Chronicles. You alternate between a strategic map, where you can build new armies, reinforce existing ones, upgrade your base and move your armies to your next mission, and the mission themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are lots of missions available, ranging from massive battles to treasure capture, oasis raid or protection, alliance with one of the three factions of the game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay-wise, the game plays much like a watered down version of Black Moon Chronicles. Battles are less tactical, units are less varied and the game plays much faster (though you can pause the game to give orders).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
