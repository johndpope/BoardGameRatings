			<description>from the designer's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shello is a game for 2 players, played with chips that are white on one side and black on the other, on a 9&amp;times;9 square grid (or larger, as long as there are an odd number of cells in the grid.  But 9&amp;times;9 is all you&amp;rsquo;ll need for a long time.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with a set board layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces in the corners are called Neutral Pieces.  These count as both black and white. They never move and they&amp;rsquo;re never flipped, but they can be used to flip pieces of either color during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. One player plays pieces black side up, and the other plays them white side up. Starting with Black, the players take turns. On your turn you must either: &lt;br/&gt;A) place a piece on an empty space orthogonally-adjacent to any friendly piece, or &lt;br/&gt;B) move any friendly piece, by a chess queen&amp;rsquo;s move, to any empty space not orthogonally adjacent to any friendly pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. If you have no legal moves, you must pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. After placing or moving a piece, flip all enemy pieces lying in an uninterrupted straight orthogonal or diagonal row between the piece you placed or moved and any friendly pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The game ends when the board is full. The player with more pieces on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
