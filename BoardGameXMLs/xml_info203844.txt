			<description>This is a ring-toss game with an 8&amp;quot; tall caricature cut-out of a Celtic lad held upright by two wooden blocks at the back of the box. The bottom of the box is divided into six colored squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cut-out's pointed ears are worth 6 points each; his club and pipe on the sides 3 points and his hat 4 points. The squares on the board range from minus 4 to plus 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although undated, the style of the artwork suggests 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
