			<description>This game is played on a 10x10 board. On each square of the board, a card is depicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, a player plays a card from his hand, and places a playing piece on a board square corresponding with the card played. Then, he draws a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player (or team) completes a row of five playing pieces (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) he scores a point. All but one of the playing pieces in that row are now turned to their &amp;quot;inactive&amp;quot; side, and cannot be used to build a new row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player/team has scored two or three points (determined beforehand).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
