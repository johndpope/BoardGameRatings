							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tekken Card Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Tekken Card Challenge uses the characters from Tekken 3, plus an exclusive character to the game, Crow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tekken Card Challenge utilizes a system similar to its Pok&amp;eacute;mon counterpart. Two opponents are to fight at a time, with various cards for different maneuvers and a 100 point HP total for damage accumulation. The player begins with a hand of four cards, drawing more as the duel proceeds. The battle system is similar to Yu-Gi-Oh! in that the three types of cards perform in a rock, paper, and scissors pattern. Attack cards are played against each other to compare values with the loser being discarded and deducting HP, an attack card played against a defense nullifies each other (except in the case of a counter), and two block cards cancel each other out. There is also a minor system of air juggling, which can be quite damaging given the correct order of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tekken Card Challenge also provides the player with a variety of game modes. There is a link mode present, 1-player battle, and (the main mode) Adventure, which allows the player to unlock more characters and duel opponents. In adventure mode, the player is given movement of a character sprite in a full environment taken place on a 15 x 15 square grid to traverse. The point of each stage is to defeat each &amp;quot;duelist&amp;quot; given limited number of steps and gain entrance to the exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character list:&lt;br/&gt;    Heihachi Mishima&lt;br/&gt;    King&lt;br/&gt;    Nina Williams&lt;br/&gt;    Hwoarang&lt;br/&gt;    Eddy Gordo&lt;br/&gt;    Ling Xiaoyu&lt;br/&gt;    Paul Phoenix (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Lei Wulong (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Yoshimitsu (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Anna Williams (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Kuma (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Jin Kazama (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Forrest Law (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Bryan Fury (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Gun Jack (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Julia Chang (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Crow (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Panda (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Mokujin (unlockable)&lt;br/&gt;    Ogre or Toshin in Japan (non-playable)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tekken Card Challenge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
