			<description>A co-operative storytelling activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players first use the letters to inspire 5 story elements which are placed into a chronological timeline of when they will appear in the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They then take turns, each saying one sentence (starting with the top letter on a card) and then nominating a word (starting with the lower letter) that the next player must include in &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this way, you have autonomy on your own sentence, but also where it will continue next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all story elements have been used and someone feels the story should end, they simply say, 'The end.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If anyone is happy, everyone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of many rulesets for the Wibbell++ deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
