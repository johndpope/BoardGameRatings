			<description>User review: Players start at Jail (where they have been held for questioning) with five one-thousand dollar bills and three INFO cards. In turn, they roll both dice and move around the gameboard, following instructions from the space on which they land and negotiating with other players whenever it is to one's advantage. The game ends when the bank is depleted and whoever has the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is subtitled &amp;quot;The genteel game of burglary.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
