			<description>The button pushing game of &amp;quot;limited&amp;quot; nuclear conflict for megalomaniacs, optimists and the ecologically retarded from 8-108.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nukery is a political commentary game from the Cold War era that abstractly depicts the rush to assemble enough nuclear weapons to annihilate all other players. Four fictional &amp;quot;blocs&amp;quot; represent the players' home countries. Players move around regions within their country, collecting &amp;quot;nuke/no nuke&amp;quot; cards as they go. When they are satisfied with their arsenal they may attack, trading the nuke cards to draw Strike cards that may obliterate enemy territories or the attacking player's own territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
