			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first step in creating an agent is coming up with a concept: each agent should not only fill a role on the team but have a distinct personality &amp;amp; background. Archetypal thinking is encouraged: a strong image that is instantly recognisable will work better than a complex idea that is hard to communicate to other players. Keep it simple when creating an agent and add depth through play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanically, each agent is described on six index cards to begin with: one skill is recorded on each card and agents may possess the same skill on multiple cards. A skill describes an area that the character is competent in, such as agility, dexterity, knowledge, persuasion, etc. Some of the most common skills are listed on the following page, but this is not an exhaustive list and agents may have other skills not listed here. No skill should ever encompass the domain of two or more other skills however, e.g. no agent should have a skill such as &amp;lsquo;physically fit&amp;rsquo;, encompassing both agility and brawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
