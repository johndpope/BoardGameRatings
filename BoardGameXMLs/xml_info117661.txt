							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sharp Shot</name>
									
			<description>Sharp Shot consists of four separate games: Football Passing, Space Gunner, Submarine and Maze Shoot. In each game, players must push the controller's action button at the right time in order to successfully connect with the target. In the case of Football Passing, for example, points are scored for a successful forward pass, with no points scored if the receiver doesn't catch the ball. Players do not control the movement of their on-screen character, and must simply press the action button when a target passes in range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game is timed, with players attempting to score as many points as possible within the given time limit. The &amp;quot;Space Gunner&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Maze&amp;quot; games are the only games out of the four that allows two players to play simultaneously; the other two games require players to switch off after each players turn, with separate score totals maintained for either player. Player 1s score appeared in the top left, and Player 2s would appear in the top right in all four games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sharp Shot&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
