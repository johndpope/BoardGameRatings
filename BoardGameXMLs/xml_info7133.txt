			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VCR Baseball is the exciting baseball strategy game that can turn an ordinary afternoon into a thrilling day at the ballpark.  Become an actual player and see the outcome of your hits on TV as you watch the video tape containing footage of professional slugging action.  Home runs, double plays, triples, fielding errors, pop-ups...it's all there for you to see and experience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game is quickly learned and fast playing.  Each time you pitch or bat you choose a baseball strategy.  Make your decision just as in real baseball -- depending on what kind of hit you want to get, how many outs there are, and if there are runners on the base.  Then compare your choice with your opponent's and find out what happens.  You could strike out, get a walk, or a hit.  If it's a hit -- you watch the videotape to see the outcome!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And VCR Baseball is actually two strategy games in one.  The advanced game adds more baseball depth.  Your team players have their own batting and pitching abilities, so you can bring in a right-handed pinch hitter to try for a crucial hit off a lefty pitcher.  Or relieve a tiring pitcher.  Intentionally walk an excellent hitter, bunt or steal a base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;- 2 games in one!&lt;br/&gt;- unlimited replayability&lt;br/&gt;- for 2 players&lt;br/&gt;- live footage of professional ball players in action&lt;br/&gt;- fun for ages 12 to adult&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- approx. 30-minute video tape&lt;br/&gt;- colorful game board&lt;br/&gt;- 6 playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;- batting and pitching cards&lt;br/&gt;- playing grids&lt;br/&gt;- score pad&lt;br/&gt;- player cards&lt;br/&gt;- 3 dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
