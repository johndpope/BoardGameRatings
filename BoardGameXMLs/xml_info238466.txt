							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cthulhu Wars: Astral Acolyte</name>
									
			<description>A promo figure for Cthulhu Wars. It glows in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use the Astral Acolyte in the game, all players must agree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Place the Astral Acolyte:&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the first Doom Phase, the First Player takes and places the Astral Acolyte in any Area that has no other Unites. (If no such Area exists, do not place the Astral Acolyte this game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to use the Astral Acolyte:&lt;br/&gt;The Astral Acolyte cannot be Captured, Eliminated, or targeted in Battle. It does not receive Pains or Kills, and is functionally immortal. It cannot be targeted by any Spellbooks or abilities, even beneficial ones from its own Controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Astral Acolyte is in an Area containing a Gate, it must always be placed on top of the Gate, automatically replacing any other Unit on that Gate. While a player Controls the Astral Acolyte, he or she gains the benefit of any Gate the Astral Acolyte Controls: earns Power and Doom from the Astral Acolyte and its Controlled Gate, can Move it in a normal Move Action, and can Summon Monsters, etc. using that Controlled Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Control the Astral Acolyte:&lt;br/&gt;The Astral Acolyte is under the Control of the player with the highest-ranking Unit in the Area. Units rank as follows (1 being the highest): &lt;br/&gt;1. Faction Great Old One&lt;br/&gt;2. Independent Great Old One&lt;br/&gt;3. Terror&lt;br/&gt;4. Monster&lt;br/&gt;5. Cultist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no other Units are in its Area, or if there is a tie between ranked Units in the Area, no player Controls the Astral Acolyte. If the Astral Acolyte is not Controlled, that Gate is NOT considered Abandoned, and therefore gives no Power to any player during Gather Power. When not Controlled, it stays on top of a Gate if one is there, and cannot be removed. It is ignored in Battle, and unaffected by any Spellbooks or abilities as normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an Astral Acolyte Moves, its Controller can change at once. If the Astral Acolyte or other Units in the Area Move, it may switch Control or become Uncontrolled at the end of that Action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This promo figure was released in Game Trade Magazine issue 213 (November 2017).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional transparent Acolyte was included in Game Trade Magazine issue 215 (January 2018).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
