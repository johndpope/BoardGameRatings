							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Morpheus: The Roleplaying System of the Mind&#039;s Eye!</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game:&lt;br/&gt;The dream is of the future. A future where roleplaying has been taken to its ultimate: actual experience. Step into gaming central, lie in the couch, and dream a dream of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within a world:&lt;br/&gt;The neural link promised many advantages to mankind. Of them, few were realized as fully as gaming. The Morpheus Mind Park arose as the leader in mindgaming. Gamers wait their turn for as long as two years for a few short hours in Gaming Central where their dreams can come alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within a Game:&lt;br/&gt;Now you have access to the Mind Park. Morpheus will take you where no other game has gone: the shadow reality of the dream world. Heralded as the best roleplaying system ever developed, Morpheus will allow you the freedom to play the kind of character that you have always wanted. Characters from the future walk side by side with figures from the past and even other dimensions. Players have complete control over the construction and abilities of their characters, and character modification is allowed at any time, even in the middle of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playtested for over four years, Morpheus is finally available to the public. Dreamers, Morpheus is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
