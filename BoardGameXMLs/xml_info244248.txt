							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">99 Names for Space Colonies and Fringe Worlds</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do your players tend to ask where this space freighter was heading to or coming from? Are they chatty in the starport bars and ask a traveller where he was born, in order to pretend to be hailing from just that same planet? Did you mentioned to them that there was an upheaval on a far away mining colony, just to set the scene, and your players now want to know which mining colony exactly? Did they just got themselves some fake ID&amp;acute;s and are now asking you for the names of their &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; homeworlds?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are running a scifi game and find yourself in need of some names for colony worlds and fringe planets, this product is for you. Next time your players ask ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...the space freighter was heading to Shiva and coming from Caesar&amp;acute;s Crossing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;..the traveller was born and raised on Sweatwater, but spend most of his life on Easygirl, working as an engineer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...the upheavel was happening in the mining colony on Hotrock and rumor has it that a lot of the protestors that got caught by the statepolice were deported to Charypdis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...the ID&amp;acute;s list them as being born and raised on Prudence, Mosaic, Fallback and Dervish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;99 names, ready to be used. The product is pay-what-you-want, so feel free to spend as much or as little money on it as you deem appropriate (every thing counts in large amounts...). If you take the free ride and you like what you got, please consider rating the product. Such is actually very helpful, and many thanks in advance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
