			<description>2 knights get called to the Marienburg in 1441. Here they receive the order to secretly inspect the land and to gather information about the balance of the power and the trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this time amber is considered magical and is the most important source for wealth. The players travel to the coast of the Baltic Sea in search for amber. Exchanging amber for goods enables them to influence the councils of the surrounding cities. Shipping amber or contributing it towards castles in order to influence the religious faith can also lead to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a merchant pawn but can also act as a smuggler at the same time. And  do not forget the offerings of the head of the amber's guild. His help can give you great profit. But beware the thugs although even they aren't invincible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains:&lt;br/&gt;1 rulebook, 1 board, 1 start player pawn, 1 ship, 2 smuggler pawns, 4 cards &amp;quot;religious order&amp;quot;, 30 goods, 24 amber chits, 35 amber &amp;quot;stones&amp;quot;, 1 knight pawn, 16 cards &amp;quot;head of the amber's guild&amp;quot;, 9 discs, 1 die, 1 bag, 4 merchant pawns, 4 player discs, 4*25 markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
