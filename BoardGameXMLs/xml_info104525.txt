			<description>Escape from the Dead City is a card game of survival horror, where each player must control a group of survivors trapped in a putrid zombie infested city. Players will have to stock up and prepare as best they can before they escape from this hell full of undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the survivors will visit the city in search of other people, weapons, food, water, vehicles and anything that might be useful. Despite being a competitive game, players can cooperate if they are in the same place, but only one can win. The first player to get Survival Points needed may flee the city, thus winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it will not be easy to escape, because danger lurks around every corner, and zombies are not the only ones who can end the life of the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
