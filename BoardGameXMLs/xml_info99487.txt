			<description>From the Manufacturer:&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to be the first player to flip their 4 tokens from &amp;quot;Stressed to Blessed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tired to Inspired&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Frazzled to Dazzled&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Mad to Glad&amp;quot; simply by looking on the positive side of life! Spin the spinner, find the silver lining, and collect cards to come out a winner. Count Your Blessings is all about finding the &amp;quot;bright side&amp;quot; to each scenario on the cards, no matter how big the challenge, and seeing that every situation in life is full of &amp;quot;blessings-in-disguise&amp;quot;. The Youngest player goes first by spinning the spinner. The corresponding card is read, a silver lining response is given, and in some cases, voted on. See specific card instructions below. Play continues in a clockwise direction until one player wins the game by turning all 4 tokens over to the sunny yellow side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 sun spinner board, &lt;br/&gt;     215 game cards, &lt;br/&gt;     24 tokens, &lt;br/&gt;     6 heads or tails coins, &lt;br/&gt;     1 pair Look on the Brightside glasses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
