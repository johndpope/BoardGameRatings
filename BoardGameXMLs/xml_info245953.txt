			<description>A Devil Game about Sex &amp;amp; Rape&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I was in the third grade, some older kids invited me to play a session of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. That first tabletop gaming session changed my life, forever. I played with them as often as possible. But when I asked my parents for a set of my own books, they said no. &amp;ldquo;Those books are too expensive, and they are satanic, anyway.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, my friends and I set out to make our own role playing game, with our own rules and our own world. We didn't know the first thing about balancing a game, or testing mechanics. But we knew what was fun, and we had plenty of time to try things that we wrote, and we weren't afraid to throw things out, when they didn't work. I am hoping that the spirit of that original game lives on in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A contemporaneous re-creation of an old homebrew system, from the extant notes originally created by a group of adolescent gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
