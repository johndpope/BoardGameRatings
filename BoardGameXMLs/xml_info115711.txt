			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate, the PCs are approached by a member of a local wizard&amp;rsquo;s guild. With the wizard is a small Eladrin girl about 10 years of age. The wizard asks the PCs to accompany him back to his home. If they agree, the old wizard introduces himself as Bergrinn, then leads them a short distance to his home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the group arrives at Bergrinn&amp;rsquo;s home, the old wizard tells the PCs that he has heard of their heroics, and knows all too well of their daunting tasks and adventures. The old wizard sits, the brings the small girl to the PCs. He tells them her name is Sharla, and then asks the girl to go play while he talks to the PCs. The little girl runs off giggling, then the old wizard&amp;rsquo;s tone drops to a very serious level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
