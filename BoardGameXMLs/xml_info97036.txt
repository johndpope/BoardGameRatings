							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twilight Gothic Y2K Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite being a portrayal of the world today, the setting for Twilight Gothic does involve itself with the darker aspects of society. Because of the mature themes involved, reader discretion is advised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twilight Gothic is based upon the World of Darkness, used to describe the environment of Vampire - The Masquerade. For those of you who are new to the game, or have never before role-played, the World of Darkness is, quite simply the world in which you are now living. Human misery and suffering goes unnoticed by an uncaring community and those who are unfortunate enough to be born into poverty usually stay there. It is also a world run by the corporate machine. Vast intellectual businesses that control everything from your household telephone to television networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet there is another side to this bleak world... The supernatural. Far from being the stuff of fiction, the creatures of the supernatural involve themselves with our world in more ways that can be imagined. Werewolves run in packs through the forests, Wraiths and spirits haunt ruin and graveyard alike. While vampires live out their lives on the rain-washed streets of our cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Twilight Gothic works on the fictional idea that vampires exist amongst us, lost in the faceless millions who inhabit the streets by night. Back stabbing and cruel, these creatures squabble and argue amongst themselves, whilst simultaneously trying to gather control of the mortals from which they feed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in Twilight Gothic builds a character for themselves - a vampire whose fate and fortunes they will play out. Once a character has been created the player is thrust into the Twilight Gothic World. The aim of the game? There is no aim. You are immersed in a world in which you are free to do as you wish; free to interact with other characters in whichever way you desire. But be warned - vampires are jealous creatures; as you build and enhance your character, others will plot your downfall. If you're lucky they will simply try to attack you. If you're unlucky, you'll never know they're there... until it's too late...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
