			<description>Trivia game &amp;quot;60 years German Federal Republic&amp;quot;, covering the years 1949-2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 110 cards, 36 betting chips, 4 emergency chips, 6 pawns, one number die, 1 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game: Being the first to reach the final space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it is played: Each player gets a pawn and 6 betting chips. Each round, the active player throws the die, draws a question card and reads the question and possible answers corresponding to the roll of the die. The other players choose one of their betting chips (with values 1-3 on the back) and place it on the answer fields (A, B or C). After the active player has read the correct answer, a player who has put his/her chip on the wrong answer loses that chip. Players who bet on the correct answer move their pawn the number of spaces corresponding the value on the chip they bet. Their chips are returned for further use. Then it is the next players turn to read a question.&lt;br/&gt;If nobody chose the correct answer, the active player gets to move his/her pawn according to the number of players in the game. If a player has lost all their betting chips, he/she gets an emergency chip (value 1). Players can earn back chips if they land on a city space (or they may chose to move 1-3 spaces instead: 1 space if he/she is in the lead, 3 if he/she is currently in last position, 2 spaces in all other cases).&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player reaches the final space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
