			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game where you will play a group of mortal lovers whose relationships are tangled in a web of unrequited love, who stumble into the realm of fairies. You will also play the fairies that are toying with the mortals to confront them with the flaws in their characters and help them find true love. It is a game about people experimenting with identity (and having their identities experimented with) to find out who they are and what they really want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need:&lt;br/&gt; Players: 3-8&lt;br/&gt; Time: 2-4 hours (More players mean a longer game)&lt;br/&gt; Materials: Note-cards, writing utensils, counters (glass beads, poker chips, coins, dice, or something like that)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
