							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oggle Boggle</name>
									
			<description>Very strange game and nothing to do with the more famous Boggle game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the heads on a smooth surface and put an eye-ball in each socket, making sure that the pupils do not show. All players then place a fly disc on their cards in an agreed position, say, at the top of the head. Players then proceed to align the eyes on the fly by moving the card about In any direction or by rotating It. The first to achieve the alignment then decides where all players shall next place the fly. The eyes remain in the position achieved at the end of the first round. The player who is first 3 times is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
