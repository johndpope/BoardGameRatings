			<description>Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 is the North American release of Shutokou Battle 01 and the sequel to the preceding games in the series:  Genki's 1999 game Tokyo Xtreme Racer, 2000 game Tokyo Xtreme Racer 2 and 2001 game Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero. The game had a limited release in North America but was not published in Europe unlike the series' previous episodes. This is the last game in the series to take place on Tokyo Highways. The later games for PlayStation 2 were Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift (prequel) and Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift 2 (sequel) and took place in the mountains of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the game is identical to the previous variants of the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series: you cruise the highways of Japan at night while challenging opponents to impromptu battles.&lt;br/&gt;    Rolling up behind another &amp;quot;racer&amp;quot; and flashing your high beams at him is a call to race. When the race begins, each vehicle has a health meter which slowly drains if your opponent is ahead of you or if you collide with walls, rails, or other vehicles. The race is over when one vehicle's health meter runs out.&lt;br/&gt;    In the beginning of the game you will start with a small variety of cars. As you race other people in the game you can &amp;quot;unlock&amp;quot; the type of car they have. It's advisable to start with a car that is less powerful, but that you can do things to. The car is fully able to tune from anything like body kits, rims, lighting, paint, and even a custom paint shop that you can create your own designs. You can own up to 5 cars which are all personal to how you want them to be.&lt;br/&gt;    The player will race against race gangs that have their own attitude and requirements, and also race wanderers that do not belong to any group. In the end there are a total of 600 rivals within a 2-stage story mode. The cities used in the game are Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. The most complex being Tokyo which includes the inner city, the Wangan expressway, and Yokohama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tokyo Xtreme Racer: 3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
