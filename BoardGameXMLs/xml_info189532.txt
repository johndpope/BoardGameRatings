							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Fleet</name>
									
			<description>War Fleet is a block game designed for massive fleets of starships to battle and still be resolved in a reasonable amount of time. The design focuses on admiral level decisions, such as fleet position, command, and starship configuration. It also allows for variable levels of complexity and could easily be expanded to fit a number of settings. The map covers a vast amount of space which can be everything from a large section of deep space to a lone star system. It is designed to work independently or within a Victory by Any Means campaign game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
