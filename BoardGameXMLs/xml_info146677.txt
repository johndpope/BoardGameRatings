			<description>&amp;quot;Trip Hopeful&amp;quot; is singleplayer board game based on the indie game from PC, &amp;quot;Organ Trail Director's Cut&amp;quot;. It is a experience roleplay. The random will decide the fate of your character (with a dice). The game consist of twenty cards of event, the table-score and map (U.S. map).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will cross the United States to find a safe settlement for win. You'll go from point to point until the end. On each dice roll will advance through these points. There will be large and small roads that will consume different amounts of gasoline and battery. There are also radioactive areas in which you can lose health. Depending on your tierada you can find places you can get a supplies as ammunition or medicines. On your way you will meet shortcuts by which you can cross but all depends on your luck with the dice. You'll dincount or count point while advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available in Spanish and English. And soon, I'll make expansions with more maps and event cards (maybe multiplayer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most importantly, the game is complete and all the rules for the two language&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
