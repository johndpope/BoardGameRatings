							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bits of the Wilderness: Into the Mountains</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tabletop Adventures provides 160 ways to tell your players more than &amp;quot;It's really steep.&amp;quot; This product provides both expansive vistas and menacing details for the use of the Harried Game Master, suitable for nearly any fantasy mountains regardless of the gaming system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lull your adventurers with forested trails and meadows full of wildflowers, then move on to massive boulders blocking the path and towering waterfalls which can be heard for miles. Turn up the pressure with slopes of loose rock which fall for no apparent reason, trails so steep only a mountain goat can be happy, and abandoned stone buildings perched on isolated peaks. Throw in a little mystery, with bones piled at the bottom of a cliff or a body left for the carrion birds. Top it off with a spring thaw that turns all the trails to freezing cold streams, snows that hide both landmarks and dangerous drops, or wind cold enough to freeze the flesh on one's bones, and the true spirit of the mountains really comes through.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This book includes 100 Bits of terrain description, small pieces which can be stuck in anywhere a little description is needed, and numbered so they can be used randomly. Each Bit is also provided in index card format for ease of use by Game Masters. Sixty other pieces portray special features or the variations of seasons and weather. Several scenes are depicted in the original interior art of the Carmona Brothers. In addition, we have again included terrain &amp;quot;Kits,&amp;quot; which can help you make distinctive types of mountains in your world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the interesting details are indexed so a GM can easily find a description to fit a particular need. We have also included a text-only version which can be used to cut and paste directly into your GM notes or sized into a large print version for those who prefer larger type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
