			<description>User Summary: &lt;br/&gt;Fan-generated card game inspired by the True Blood books/HBO series.  Players work to control a number of different characters (human, vampire, werewolf, etc.) and use those characters' special abilities to control others and gain Blood Tokens.  Whomever collects the most Blood Tokens by the end of the game, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: The game cards contain Season 3 spoilers, so play at your own risk.  Furthermore, there are some limited references to sex and drug dealers, so this is not a game for younger kids)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TURN SEQUENCE&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 9 Phases: &lt;br/&gt;1. Influence Phase&lt;br/&gt;2. Initiative Phase&lt;br/&gt;3. Plotting Phase&lt;br/&gt;4. Recruitment Phase&lt;br/&gt;5. Event Phase&lt;br/&gt;6. Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;7. Capture Phase&lt;br/&gt;8. Recovery Phase&lt;br/&gt;9. End Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses two custom card decks.  The Character Deck consists of the various characters, groups and locations from the show.  5 characters are placed face up, and players pay Blook Tokens to recruit them, with bonuses/penalties to to cost of recruitment depending on where the Character is on the Recruitment Track.  Once a Character is recruited, the remaining Characters on the Recruitment Track slide down, and a new Character Card is added to the beginning of the Track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Event Deck is drawn from by each turn by each player in the Plotting Phase to give them special actions that they can use later in the Event Phase.  In addition, each controlled Character has one or more special Actions that players may use in the Action Phase to attack, capture, or control Characters from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bidding is used to control the order of players turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
