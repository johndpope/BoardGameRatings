			<description>Each player has 9 pawns, which he tries to get on the center space. Movement is determined by a die. Pawns are brought into play by rolling a 6. If a pawn gets on an occupied space it is either captured or it captures the other pawn, depending on the color of the occupied space. Pawns that are captured by pawns of their own color can be brought back into play, when a 6 is rolled. The game ends when all 9 slots on the center space are occupied or if one player has no pawns left in play. Pawns on the center space are worth 5 points and captured pawns are worth 1 point. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
