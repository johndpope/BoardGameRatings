							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stone Shepherds Lake</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones float at Stone Shepherds Lake. The water glows. It&amp;rsquo;s odd. But nothing exists in a vacuum, so it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a big surprise that the lake water might be keeping the Sky Island s afloat. That&amp;rsquo;s Tonstin&amp;rsquo;s theory, and he&amp;rsquo;s an expert on the ancient battle that changed the geography of the Moonshield forever.  Now a new altercation is headed for center stage. It&amp;rsquo;s all about Princess Mishana who fled when her dad got booted. She hunkered down at the lake for years - drank the water, too. Now she&amp;rsquo;s an iron maiden, floral in appearance, but tough enough to perforate a man with a single punch, armor and all.  She wants her Dad&amp;rsquo;s throne back and it looks like she&amp;rsquo;ll get it - but only with help. Your role? Stay on her good side, for sure. Sign up. Sip the water. Tough up. Win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
