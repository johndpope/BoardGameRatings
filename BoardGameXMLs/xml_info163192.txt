			<description>Mix it up or match it up and be the first to build a monster and race to the finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to be the first player to return home after building a complete monster (all four monster parts from the same or different monsters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts the game by rolling the die and moving that number of spaces. Player can move in any direction around the board or use the arrows to guide them. If a player lands on a monster space, she draws a monster card from the draw pile and places it face up in front of her. If a player lands on a Mix-Up space, she can trade one card with another player. If a player land on Home space, she can return to the Monster Mix-up home space in the center of the board. If a player land on a Put 1 Back space, she must return one of her monster cards to the middle of the draw pile. Players continue to move around the board, collecting monster cards to build their monsters. Once a player has a complete monster, she races back to the Monster Mix-Up home space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
