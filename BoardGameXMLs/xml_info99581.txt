			<description>Dice cricket is a dexterity and dice cricket game. There are no dates on the box or directions, but the general style suggests that it may be from the 1930s or 1940s. The directions (nothing as common as rules in this game) leave it to the players to decide how to organise the match - innings, numbers of players and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players put the pair of stumps about 5 to 6 feet apart (&amp;quot;the average length of an ordinary dining table&amp;quot; as the directions helpfully tell us). Dice are used as balls in the game. The bowler gently pitches a die (with faces 1, 2, 4, 6, out and NR (for no runs) to the batsman, preferably without the die touching the table. The batsman tries to hit it. If he misses and the stumps are hit, the batsman is out bowled. If he hits the die and it is caught by the bowler, the player is out caught. Otherwise, if he hits it, the result of the shot is shown by the top face of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
