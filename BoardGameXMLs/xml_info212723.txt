			<description>After the experiences of improvised tank destroyer vehicles such as the M3 half-track with 75mm gun, M6 truck with 37mm gun and the M10 tank destroyer (3-inch gun on a modified M4 Sherman hull), the US Army were keen to produce a bespoke tank destroyer to hunt enemy armour. An order was issued in late 1941 to mount a 37mm gun in the requested vehicle. This was to be upgraded several times to 57mm, 75mm and then finally a 76mm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of this development would be the M18 Hellcat - the fastest US armoured fighting vehicle of the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M18 Hellcats served in the invasion of the Phillipines and saw action in Europe during the landings at Anzio in Italy and in Northwest Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellcats were also exported to China where they served in an infantry support role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hellcat could be found in the service of several nations following World War II with the Yugoslav army still fielding them into the 1990s!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
