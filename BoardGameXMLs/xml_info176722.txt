			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TWENTY NEW ITEMS FOR YOUR OLD SCHOOL CAMPAIGN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRIMITIVE FIREARMS AND UNSTABLE POTABLES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Box Books&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tome Four: Doglocks and Draughts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSPIRED by &amp;quot;Swords and Wizardry Apprecation Day&amp;quot;, and written over the WEEKEND despite a HANGOVER from my BACHELOR PARTY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXCITEMENT!!! ADVENTURE!!! POCKETMODS!!! EXCLAMATION POINTS!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESTROY YOUR ENEMIES with the terrible might of GUNPOWDER, assuming it doesn't BLOW UP and DESTROY YOU FIRST! Like JOHN CARTER and SOLOMON KANE, DISCOVER that UNSTABLE FIREARMS have a proper and EXCITING place in your OLD SCHOOL GAMES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe you're MORE INTERESTED in things you can DRINK? Not everyone has the same access to MAGIC or ALCHEMICAL LAB EQUIPMENT, so they have to rely on POWERFUL POTABLES that have both a BENEFIT and a POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IVANHOE UNBOUND is PROUD to present these TEN FIREARMS and TEN MEDICINES for SWORDS AND WIZARDRY WHITEBOX or ANY OTHER OLD SCHOOL GAME based on the 1974 three booklet version of the WORLD-FAMOUS RPG whose name rhymes with &amp;quot;TRUNCHEONS AND FLAGONS!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AND SPEAKING OF BOOKLETS, this supplement comes in POCKETMOD FORMAT. Print out a SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER which can be TRANSFORMED with FOLDS and a single cut into a TINY EIGHT PAGE BOOKLET with EVERYTHING YOU NEED to use these two races in your OSR game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, while THE TINY BOOKLET IS ADORABLE, there's also a couple of larger-size versions so you can KILL MORE TREES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as a SPECIAL BONUS, the actual supplement doesn't use EXCESSIVE CAPITAL LETTERS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
