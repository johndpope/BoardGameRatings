			<description>Foe Hunters is an exciting co-operative, multiplayer deckbuilding/adventure game set in the realm of high fantasy! Players take the role of heroes that are working together to thwart the evil Foe. On their adventure the heroes will work together in an effort to bolster their party and fend off this powerful enemy. The players will harness mighty abilities and powerful equipment while they work as a team to rid the world of this wretched evil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round starts with the Foe, who is autonomous. The Foe has a set action it takes each turn, and then plays cards from its deck. The cards in the Foe deck include Vassals under its employ that also fight the Heroes, as well as powerful abilities that the Foe will use to damage and weaken the Heroes. At the end of the Foe phase, the party of Heroes may collectively choose a card in the city to refresh, making other options available for the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Foe phase is complete, the party of Heroes begin their turns. Turn order starts with whoever the party selects. Each Hero turn plays out very simply, they can play a card from their hand, buy a card from the city (using their experience), and use one of their heroic Feats. Each Hero has a completely unique starting deck and plays totally different from each other Hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the Foe is defeated or the party is destroyed, whichever happens first. In Foe Hunters, players don't use cards to buy cards like most deck building games. Each Hero has their own experience pool that they draw upon to purchase cards, and when these cards are purchased they go directly to hand instead of to your discard pile. This allows you to get answers for problems when you need them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck building element in Foe Hunters revolves around the City Deck. This deck has several cards that are available for purchase. Many of these cards have a class affinity, which allows the Hero that matches the class to purchase the card for a discount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foe Hunters is a new take on co-op that mixes a lightweight system with the complexity of an in-depth deck building game or card game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
