			<description>In Witchland: a seita de Salem, players become peasants who must face witches whose souls have been corrupted by an evil entity, while attempts to prevent a sect from completing its ritual and bringing that great entity into our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect ingredients, create magic potions and use them to fight witches and cultists, overcome them and free their souls so they can finally rest in peace. But remember, the time is short and the ritual must be stopped before it's too late, or be prepared to face a great old one capable of destroying the world as we know it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witchland: a seita de Salem is a semi-cooperative game that unites the complexity and strategy of &amp;quot;euro&amp;quot; style games with all immersion and narrative of &amp;quot;amerigames&amp;quot;. Throughout the game, players should pay attention in their opponents' moves and try to predict their actions so they can take the lead in this great battle, but at the same time, they must work together to prevent the destruction of the village of Salem. At the end of the game, the winning player will be the one with the highest number of victory points obtained by eliminating cultists, releasing the souls of the witches, and other tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
