			<description>This game is attached with Tactics magazine #66 in Japan. This game is fantasy multi-player game covering the era of reconstruction after the long and chaotic war against dragons.&lt;br/&gt; This is the first of Okamoto's triology.  The second is Victory in the Galaxy covering sci-fi and the third is Shadow of K's Birlcess covering horror.&lt;br/&gt;These 3 games are real gem which is truely original at the date.  Unfortunately even in Japan these games are almost forgotten, because these games were attached with not the boardgame issue but with the RPG issue of Tactics magazine.  So that, most Japanese board gamers had no chance to see these games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
