							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Find the Rhyme</name>
									
			<description>Find the Rhyme is an educational matching game for young children, designed to teach the concept of rhyme.  The game consists of 20 pairs of rhyming picture cards, each of which is cut like a puzzle piece on one edge, so that each card only fits with its designated pair, and when fit together will form a rhyming phrase (e.g. &amp;quot;a dragon in a wagon&amp;quot;).  Anywhere from six to twenty left-side cards are laid out in a line.  Each player takes a turn choosing a right-side card and trying to match it with one left-side card to make a rhyme.  If the match is correct, the player keeps the pair.  If not, the tile is returned.  Play continues until all pairs are matched and the player with the most pairs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
