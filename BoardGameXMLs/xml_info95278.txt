			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mouri Motonari: Chikai no Sanya (Mōri Motonari: Oath of the Three Arrows) is the third game in the Eiketsuden series. It is a turn based tactical role-playing title that follows the life and conquests of Motonari Mōri, a prominent leader from the Sengoku period of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to the previous titles in the series &amp;ndash; each stage has the player deploy a number of officers and equip them with items that improve their abilities. Every stage has at least one objective that must be completed to advance, and a story scene precedes the combat which outlines the events surrounding the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city areas where the story scenes occur have been expanded to enhance gameplay. After the conversations have ended, the player may control Motonari and explore the city, performing a number of actions including chatting with the populace, purchasing equipment, visiting the temple, or training officers. The training grounds pit an officer against a random opponent, and if the player is victorious, they will earn cash and experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the previous titles in the series, Chikai no Sanya does not have multiple story paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
