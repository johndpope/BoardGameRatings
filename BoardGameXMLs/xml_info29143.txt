			<description>Each year for the past ten years, purple clouds would appear, and bring disasters to people around the world.&lt;br/&gt;When their village is attacked again Shu, Kluke, and Jiro fight back against the fin that appears to kill the people. However, they discover it is a strange machine. But even after damaging it, it goes back to the flagship, with the three still on it.&lt;br/&gt;There, they encounter constant attacks from metal soldiers until they discover three orbs of light. After hearing a voice tell them to swallow the orbs, they do and discover their shadows grow into monsters; Kluke's becomes a blue phoenix, Jiro's a blue minotaur, and Shu's a blue dragon. They then fight the ship's captain, Nene, and discover that Nene is behind the yearly attacks on their town. He easily defeats them, and they can barely make it to an escape capsule. They then land far from home and must then journey to find a way to save their land.&lt;br/&gt;Following their escape from Nene's air fortress, they encounter more people from towns that have also fallen victim to the purple clouds, and decide that they must try to stop Nene from continuing to bring ruin on their world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a CCG currently with 2 volumes (sets) that plays out in this world...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
