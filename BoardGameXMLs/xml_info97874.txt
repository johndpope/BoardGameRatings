							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Chicks 3: Dangerous Curves</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, it's time to lay out the battle map... the one you're going to be rolling dice over for hours. Why not cover it in even more Hot Chicks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These forty-eight (48!) high-quality &amp;quot;Standees&amp;quot; portray women of the deadliest sort - beautiful in demeanor and proportion, with big honkin' weapons to blow things away with!  Each of these forty-eight dangerous beauties is individually crafted to carry a unique and gorgeous style to the battle map.  From cyberpunk laser-rifle toting dolls to a cheerleader with a Schmeiser, these beauties can represent the pinnacle of danger and the essence of grace all at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, if you're going to be staring at that map and rolling dice for the evening, why not stare at something that looks back seductively over the barrel of a gun?  Why not spend the evening with the ladies of Hot Chicks 3: Dangerous Curves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
