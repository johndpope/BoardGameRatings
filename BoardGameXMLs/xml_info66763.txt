							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank Duel</name>
									
			<description>An umpired, dual blind miniatures wargame of a battle between two opposing tanks. Two four-player teams represent the opposing tank crews, portraying the commander, gunner, loader, and driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The purpose of the game is to simulate, in a simple but realistic way, the problems confronting the crew of an individual tank in combat. To make the game even more difficult, the action takes place between two or more crews, in a sort of stylised 'duel'. Obviously, such one-on-one duels practically never took place, but these games are intended more as a sort of teamwork game, to illustrate a point. There is no reason why the game cannot be expanded to take on larger actions of up to troop level.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Any scale of model can be used, although it is important that the turrets of the tank models can be rotated independently. For reasons which become apparent later, 1/200 is probably the smallest practical scale, and 1/72 or 1/90 are probably the ideal scales.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is vitally important that the terrain scale is the same as the model scale, ie. for 1/72 the ground scale would be 1&amp;quot; = 2 metres.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each 'bound' of activity takes 4-5 seconds of real time, and represents approx 10-15 seconds of game time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player represents one crew member.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
