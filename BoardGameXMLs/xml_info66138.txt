			<description>The learners will be able to match artwork created during the Renaissance period with the artist and the period in which it was created: Proto-Renaissance, Early Renaissance or High Renaissance. In this domain the students will learn to distinquish the styles of the individual artists and the characteristics of the different Renaissance periods through a more social, entertaining method than the traditional method of slide memorization and reviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, similar to &amp;quot;Gin Rummy&amp;quot;, is played in the following manner:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to form three sets from a dealt hand of nine cards. &lt;br/&gt;The players chooses either the discarded card or a card from the face down pile. The player determines which cards to keep and discards the extra card. The first player to form three valid sets from ten cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;The Use of &amp;quot;Mona Lisa&amp;quot; Cards. The deck contains three Mona Lisa cards which are wild cards. A player may substitue them for any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;57 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
