			<description>This game is designed by a Singaporean company, Camelot Hobbies. Players try to get rid of cards in their hands by playing cards that fit the mathematical conditions at the time. The game comes with a deck of 39 cards and two special six-sided dice (the dice show 1,1,2,3,+ and -).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be the Greatest, just be the first to discard all your Maths Me! cards! To do this, players place them in turn in a centre discard-pile according to the 'condition' of the play at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One pack of Maths Me! cards is just right for 2-4 players. For more than 4 players, just add another pack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Structure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maths Me! is a mathematical symbol game that revolves around placing valid cards according to one of the 2 prevailing conditions, &amp;quot;Greater Than&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Less Than&amp;quot;. The prevailing condition refers to the current flow of the game. During &amp;quot;Greater Than&amp;quot;, players must place cards which continually increase the numerical value being played (e.g. 47, 63, 89, 92 ...). On the other hand, when the prevailing condition is &amp;quot;Less Than&amp;quot;, numbers must become smaller and smaller. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game came with a sticker indicating the National Parenting Center Seal of Approval 1997 (The Camelot Hobbies website gives the year for the seal of approval as 1996).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URL for Camelot Hobbies website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.camelot.com.sg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.camelot.com.sg/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
