			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years ago, Moonbase Omega opened to great fanfare as a center of scientific research and discourse. But while one can take the person out of the nation, one can&amp;rsquo;t take the nation out of the person. Nationalistic concerns soon began taking over and shaping the Omega staff as diplomats, spies, and military personnel also came to the base. But events at an FTL research station on the far side of the Moon would soon put an end to the infighting. On September 13th, an explosion of mysterious energy ripped the Moon from its orbit and translocated it into unfamiliar space, amidst warring sophonts and mysterious mechanoids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omega 99 is a campaign setting for Cepheus Engine and other tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original Science Fiction Roleplaying Game [OSFRPG]), inspired by a well-known British science fiction TV show broadcast in the 1970s. Humans from Earth are flung into an unknown sector of space amidst warring alien combatants and fantastic adventure when the Moon is torn from its orbit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a backstory inspired by the British TV Show, the campaign features an overview of the Moon, its unwilling human passengers and their technology; overviews of the humans&amp;rsquo; new neighbors, the Edari, the Kahgg, and the Mecharchs; details of space within 6 parsecs of Luna&amp;rsquo;s new location, and a few adventure seeds to get you started!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell the stories of the adventures of Earth&amp;rsquo;s first star explorers on its runaway Moon with Omega 99.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
