			<description>Essentially the player takes on nearly exactly the same type of side scrolling action found in the NES game, with similar but simplified graphics and enemies. It is only a single player game and starts out in a level similar to the NES game as well. The task is also similar, with the player playing as Zitz having to rescue both of his partners, Rash and Pimple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there are plenty of differences in the levels and range in difficulty when encountering enemies or obstacles. The same &amp;quot;over-the-top&amp;quot; finishing combos can also be found in the Game Boy release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in the case of the original NES game, the Game Boy game is also notoriously difficult to beat, requiring fast reflexes, memorization of obstacles, and patience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Battletoads (Game Boy)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
