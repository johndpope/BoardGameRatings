			<description>Your next door neighbour, old Mrs Jones (the cat lady), just left for vacation, but she forgot to let all her cats out of her house.  You and your friends agree to help Mrs Jones, by searching her house, finding her cats the putting them outside, before they cause havoc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to successfully eject 3 cats from the house is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, you explore the modular house, trying to find those pesky cats, but catching them will require a dose strategy and plenty of luck.  Although, there are objects to help you; the cats' toys, food and paraphernalia, which will help you catch those cats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herding Cats is a hilarious game for 2-4 players that plays in around 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
