							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Invasion of Sicily</name>
									
			<description>This fine game was published in 1972 in Panzerfaust magazine, with an unmounted map in four sections, unstapled rulebook in two sheets, and unmounted two-sided counters -- one of the very first (if not the first) wargames to use two-sided counters for step reduction. Fortunately, a mounted die-cut set of counters was available for like $1 additional, so we were spared the nightmare of trying to hand-mount two-sided counters &amp;lt;shudder&amp;gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mapsheet consists of four sections (mine are hand-glued into one map) showing the island of Sicily, in light and dark blue and light and dark brown on white paper, 19&amp;quot; x 27&amp;quot; assembled. The Combat Results table (from 1-4 to 7-1), Terrain Effects chart (six types), Time Record track (12 four-day turns), Unit Designations Within Divisions chart (initial Axis), German Order Of Battle chart (reinforcements and &amp;quot;What If?&amp;quot; units), and Allied Order of Battle chart (initial and reinforcements) are all printed on the mapsheet. The starting Axis locations for the historical scenario are printed on the map, as are the historical and alternate Allied landing sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rulebook assembles into 8 pages. Front is picture, title and credits. Second page is historical info (&amp;quot;Introduction&amp;quot;). The next four pages are rules and victory conditions. Then 1/2-page of (six) alternate scenarios, 1/2 page of designer's notes, and 1/2-page of bibliography (on the last page, with instructions for assembling the mapsheet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are mostly regiments and brigades (or similarly-sized kampfgruppen), with some battalions, some Italian divisions, and an Army HQ for each army (4). There are 120 of the 1/2&amp;quot; counters -- 22 Americans (olive green, 3 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 18 British and Canadians (dark olive green, 1 is Army HQ), 39 Italians (yellow, 3 are divisions, 11 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 25 Germans (tan, 1 battalion, 1 Army HQ), and 16 blanks, some of each color. The mounted counters are unique in that the full-strength side is printed on what is normally considered the back of the counter. While it doesn't look as nice, it does actually facilitate handling the counters - they are easier to pick up. Another idea that never caught on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a complex game, more along the lines of the old Conflict games. The game sequence is 1. Allied airdrops; 2. Allies move; 3. Allied combat and post-combat moves; 4. Axis airdrops; 5. Axis moves; 6. Axis combat and post-combat moves. ZOCs are fluid for movement and rigid for combat. Combat is odds-based, with step losses, retreats and advances indicated for both attacker and defender. For example, at 1-1 odds, the results are: 1. Att 1 step retr 1, Def adv 1; 2. Att 2 steps retr 2, Def adv 1; 3. Att 1 step, Def 1 step retr 1; 4. no effect; 5. Def retr 1; 6. Def 1 step, retr 2. Stacking is 3 regt/brig. Rules for invasions, airdrops, supply, evacuations, and naval support fire are all simple and non-cluttered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One interesting aspect is Italian desertion. On turn one, the Axis player must roll for every Italian non-infantry unit, losing it to desertion on a 3-6 on 1D6. The Italian infantry are sturdier, and will not desert unless attacked at 3-1 or more with no German unit within three hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory conditions are based on three elements: Italian desertion, casualties, and cities held. Levels of victory are: Axis wins if he has more than 3/4 of Allied points, decisively if equal or more; game is drawn if Axis has less than 3/4 but at least 2/3 of Allies points; otherwise Allies win. Also, the Axis win immediately if they destroy both the US 7th Army and UK 8th Army HQs (not bloody likely).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can't believe no one ever listed this game before. It is one of my all-time favorites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
