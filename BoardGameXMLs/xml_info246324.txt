							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rook&#039;s Gambit</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-awaited return to the war-torn world of Twilight 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three years of bloody stalemate on the battlefields of Europe, the United States Army stands poised to return home. An ad hoc evacuation fleet has been assembled in Bremerhaven, Germany, and U.S. forces are converging on the port city from all over the continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ensconced in his sprawling castle headquarters in northern Poland, an ambitious Soviet Field Marshall, acting without orders from Stavka, plans to destroy the gathering military might of the United States in Europe with one fell swoop, single-handedly winning World War III for his motherland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A classic caper for a classic role- playing game, this is Rook's Gambit, the first adventure module for Twilight 2000 released since 1993. Set in Poland on the eve of Operation OMEGA, Rook's Gambit sends the player characters on a high-stakes mission to save the United States Army in central Europe from a rogue Soviet Field Marshall with delusions of grandeur and access to an errant American nuclear weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rook's Gambit is compatible with both editions of the Twilight 2000 core rules, and includes ample material designed to support an exciting, mission-based campaign set in Northern Poland. In addition to descriptions of the titular setting of Marienburg Castle, home of the Soviet Baltic Front headquarters, and the surrounding city of Malbork, Poland, Rook's Gambit features profiles of major non-player characters, regional factions, and nearby communities. In a Twilight 2000 first, three separate narrative adventure starters are provided to help referees kick start the adventure. Do you have what it takes to foil the Rook's Gambit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
