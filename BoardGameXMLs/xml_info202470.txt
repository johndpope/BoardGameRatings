			<description>You might consider this game as Big Bang Theory meeting Happy Families in the Roaring 20s - in Latin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is very much a Latin educational game, and consists of a deck of 65 cards divided into 13 &amp;quot;books&amp;quot; of five cards. As the rules put it: &amp;quot;Each book embraces declensions and conjugation forms ending in certain letters, as, es, i, um, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A book's word ending appears in capitals in the middle of each card, followed by a specific example, such as &amp;quot;-US Gen. Sing. 4th Dec.&amp;quot; (genitive singular fourth declension). Partial information to the other cards in the book appear on the four corners of a card along with one or more question marks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is similar to Happy Families, with players taking turns asking other players for the cards needed to complete a book. But in this game, a player must ask for a card by its full form, by filling in the question marks on a card he already holds. And to ask for the King card in each book, the player must recite correctly all of the other forms in the book! The player to collect the most books wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
