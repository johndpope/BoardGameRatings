							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Benefactor</name>
									
			<description>Benefactor is a mix between a puzzle game and a platform game. It has a similar concept to Psygnosis's earlier, very successful Lemmings series of games, but also adds its own ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Benefactor, the player plays a character called Ben E. Factor, who has resigned from the military to become an overall all-around good guy. Factor's mission is to save a group of &amp;quot;Merry Men&amp;quot;, who have been kidnapped from their home planet and imprisoned over 60 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefactor_(video_game),&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefactor_(video_game),&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
