Each of the deck's 51 cards presents a different theme that the GM and players, working together, can weave into the game&amp;rsquo;s narrative, as well as related rules effects. With Plot Twist Cards, everyone can help tell the story and enjoy being surprised by new and unexpected turns of fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GameMastery Plot Twist Cards add a new storytelling element to roleplaying games, allowing players to bring their own twists to an adventure&amp;rsquo;s plot.
