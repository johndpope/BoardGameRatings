			<description>Imagine an intricately mechanized clash of spy against spy, introducing corporate espionage to a Steampunk world of industrial revolution; filled with all of the plot twists and thrills of both genres. That's the world of Steam Spy, a Steampunk themed role playing card game for 2 players. Steam Spy unites the character development and narrative of a traditional role playing game with the intimacy and spontaneity of a card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create a unique secret agent character who works for one of the organizations designated to protect and serve one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest corporations. Then they face off against an operative from an opposing secret industrial organization in a one on one battle of wits, luck and exotic steampunk gadgets. One player instigates some kind of espionage mission while the other does their best to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect, play and draw cards that help create a series of exciting encounters that ultimately determine if the instigating antagonists succeeds at their mission, or the determined protagonist chases them down and defeats them; players then advance their spy character, or create a group of secret agent specialists in preparation for the next face off against operatives from opposing agencies and corporation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steam Spy: Intelligence and Propaganda includes allows you to become one of the top spies for M5, the Western European agency that works to collect and protect information for the massive Encyclopedia Englandia Corporation. Or you can join Das Wort, one of the original &amp;ldquo;reality defining&amp;rdquo; news organizations. In order to present the world as they want it to be seen (in addition to selling papers), their mysterious organization, the Diamond Club, is often accused of creating events of world significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
