							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sentinels of the Multiverse: Wager Master Villain Character</name>
									
			<description>Before time was time, before space was space, there was the wager. The wager that nothing would happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That wager was lost. And from that loss came the Wager Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As reality formed and matter came into being, all of the losing wagers - all of the impossible possibilities - also formed into being. Into a specific being: the Wager Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wager Master appears however it wants. It commonly goes for centuries without showing up anywhere in the Multiverse. But when it does show up, it&amp;rsquo;s a safe bet that things will go wrong. The Wager Master thrives on playing with the rules of reality. It appears to a race of sentient beings, plays games with whatever champions they might have, and ultimately destroys everything it encounters as they inevitably lose the Wager Master&amp;rsquo;s games. Those who lose to the Wager Master become mere playing pieces for more twisted games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, unfortunately, the capricious Wager Master has appeared on earth. Too many things have gone wrong. Too many coincidences and too many confluences point to the truth: we are all pawns in the cruel game of an entity as old as the Multiverse. What chance do the Sentinels of that Multiverse have?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse: Wager Master Villain Mini-Expansion is a new villain character, with his own unique villain deck of 25 cards, a rules card, and a character card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
