							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Santiago 1898</name>
									
			<description>Santiago 1898 is a mini game of the naval battle between the US NAvy and the Armada espa&amp;ntilde;ola off Santiago in june 1898.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played an undetermined number of turns in a boxed mapboard. Each unit is one ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn has two phases, one for player. Each player writes his movement orders for the own ships, pointing the letter and number of the square he want to move. Movement is simultaneous, and at the end ships of the active player can fire at enemy ships in artillery range. There is a hit if the dice are equal or more than the artillery factor + distance in squares to the target, and consult the damage table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some special rules cover ramming, shore batteries and heavy armour of US battleships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conditions of victory are for the spanish exit twoships off map, and for the US player avoid this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
