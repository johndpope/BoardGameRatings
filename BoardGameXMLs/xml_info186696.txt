			<description>A fun and exciting drawing game for kids! It's a chicken will provide hours of hilarious fun for kids of all ages and also encourages them to interact and to use their imaginations.

Each word card contains four options to draw, one with a picture to copy to help younger children play. The 'chicken' timer 'clucks' to let the drawer know they are running out of time and if the word is guessed within the time limit the timer announces the number of points won for both the drawer and the person who guessed correctly. The player with the most points when each player has draw 5 cards wins! This game provides a sheet of printed circle layouts, which can be photocopied to give you more sheets and a lot more hours of fun. This educational game will help children express themselves through a variety of different drawing skills and at the same time the electronic timer adds to the tension and the fun! Whatever age you are, this game is great fun for the whole family. This game is for 3 or more players and suitable for ages 5 years and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
