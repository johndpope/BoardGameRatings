			<description>Pack as many objects as possible into your suitcase - but be aware of the size of the hand luggage! Do not forget what your destination is: boots are not essential on the beach, neither is the swimming suit in the mountains. The player who puts the most cards down and collects several objects of his destination card wins the game. You have to be smart and quick because possibilities are limited!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players act simultaneously. Everyone turns over his own deck and you can start packing&lt;br/&gt;your suitcases with the following rules:&lt;br/&gt;- Each player puts the cards down in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;- Play colour on colour: in 4 categories, 12 objects in each category. The colours of the objects and the background colours also help in the differentiation.&lt;br/&gt;- You have to put down the cards in an area of 4x6 units. A card has 2x2 units, so there are 4 objects on a card.&lt;br/&gt;- You can only choose from the top of a deck!&lt;br/&gt;- The top card of any deck may be used but the taken card must be put down. If you cannot put the taken card down, you have to discard cards that had been put down earlier, until you are able to put the taken card down.&lt;br/&gt;- It is not obligatory to use the top card of your own deck, it can also be discarded. Then the card is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
