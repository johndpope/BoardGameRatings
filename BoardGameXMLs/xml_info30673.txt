			<description>A boardgame version of &amp;quot;I Spy&amp;quot;.  One player secretly selects a card which represents one of the characters pictured on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One by one the remaining players must try to guess the first player's secret character.  Players may only ask questions which may be answered &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;.  Each question or incorrect guess at the secret costs a player one of his ten chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who correctly guesses the secret identity collects the card from the first player.  The role of first player now passes to the next player to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone has had a chance to be first player the game ends.  The game can also be played two or more rounds, depending on how long a game is desired.  The winner is the person who has the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
