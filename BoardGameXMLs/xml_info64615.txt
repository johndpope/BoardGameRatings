							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FISH ON</name>
									
			<description>The game is fun for the entire family. Object of the game is to score the most &amp;quot;braggin' rights&amp;quot; which are similar to points. Each game piece is your boat, and the path of the game takes your around the lake. Starting at the cabin, you roll the dice. If you land on a &amp;quot;Fish On!&amp;quot; space, you select a lure and start fishing. Depending on the size and species of fish, you collect the &amp;quot;braggin' rights&amp;quot;. Other spaces include a &amp;quot;Fishing Duel&amp;quot;, where the player chooses another player to a duel, the biggest fish wins. Look out, not all the spaces are rewarding! The player who finishes the day with the most &amp;quot;braggin' rights&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
