			<description>This is a Dominoes variant with two ways of playing. The first one follows regular Dominoes rules: A player can play a tile on his/her turn which must match a tile to another tile at one end of the layout of tiles already on the table. If the player cannot do that with a tile s/he owns, s/he has to draw an additional tile. The first player to get rid of his/her tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces however, are irregularly shaped. For the second variant, the players put their pieces into a bag and have to feel which edge fits an edge of another piece. Other than that, the usual rules apply as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
