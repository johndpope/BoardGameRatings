							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bo Jackson Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Bo Jackson Baseball is a Nintendo Entertainment System game that was released as an arcade-style baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one (1) or two (2) players can play. In addition to that, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments. The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball. However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited. Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's &amp;quot;Kenrip&amp;quot; being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken). There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bo Jackson Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
