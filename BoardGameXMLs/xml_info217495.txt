							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silver Scream</name>
									
			<description>Bring the iconic 80&amp;rsquo;s slasher movie to life in this intense, immersive board game. The innovative story-board mechanism puts you in front of the camera as the scenes unfold, leading you and your fellow cast members through a terrifying night in a variable wilderness setting. Use cunning to survive until dawn or stand and fight to stop the Killer once and for all. Gather Plot Points to maintain your Courage in the face of horror as your Supporting Cast is slaughtered around you. Will you be able to reveal the Killer&amp;rsquo;s vulnerabilities and face him (or her) down before the mayhem of Act 3 begins? Or will you simply run for your life, never knowing where terror will strike next? Either way, the Story Board will track the choices you&amp;rsquo;ve made and tell your tale of woe (or heroism) to all who dare to watch the Silver Scream...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
