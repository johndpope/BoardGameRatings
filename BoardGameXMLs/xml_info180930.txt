			<description>Imagine that you are players in a democratic country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a voting card. The oldest player is the first President. They take the President card and chooses their Minister by placing the Minister card in front of the player of their choice. The same player may be Minister more than once during the game. The other players act as the People.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck of cards is placed in the middle of the player, 4 are revealed and the cards closest to the deck is the most valuable, descending in value to the 4th card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the top of the deck, there's a symbol at the corners of the card, corresponding with one of the phrases on the President card. The President reads the cards to all players, for example: &amp;quot;what would I like to bring to the desert with me?&amp;quot;. The other players place their Voting cards (facedown) on each one of the 4 faceup objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Voting Cards are then turned over to reveal the votes. Players score by correctly guessing which card the President chose. The Minister wins a point if they also chose the same card as the President. Each player who is not the Minister, can score an additional point if they guessed the Minister's card as well (if they both chose the same card and you voted for it, you get 2 points! If the Minister and President each chose a separate card, you only win a point if you guessed one or the other). The President scores up to 3 points, 1 point per non-Minister player that guesses his card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, the 4 faceup cards are placed at the bottom of the deck. The new President is the player sitting to the left of the current President. The game is played for as many rounds as each player is President twice (in a 3 or 4 player game) or each player acts as the President once (5 or 6 player game). The person with the most points wins! In case of a tie, both (or several) players share the victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
