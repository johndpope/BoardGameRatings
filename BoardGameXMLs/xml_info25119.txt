			<description>from publisher:&lt;br/&gt;One can travel in many different ways - afoot, by car, by plane, some - very rare though - even in a space ship. Often enough one is able to travel only in one's thoughts. The family game Slovenija is designed for such travelers. We travel &amp;quot;by dice&amp;quot;. The game is not complicated, quite similar to the popular &amp;quot;Sorry&amp;quot;, which is familiar to all of you. You only have to consider some additional rules. First of all you use traveling cards that determine your pathway. How quickly you move along this given pathway depends on your score. Rules on the cards additionally influence you mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
