			<description>America has been fascinated by the big rig truck for decades.  Kids make signals out the back window, just hoping to hear that horn blast away as the trucker goes by and we benefit everyday from these massive machines moving goods and materials from coast to coast over the maze of our highways.  Hauler is a game dedicated to the Big Rig Trucker in all of us!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hauler is a game for 2-5 players where the goal is to build a deck of resources that will give you the most victory points.  VPs are earned on cards or by running routes off of route cards purchased with Green Stamps (Money in Trucker Lingo).  Green Stamps are earned playing cards out of your hand each turn.  Green stamps can be used on your turn to purchase route cards, truck cards, fuel cards or action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of the game are complex.  Think of Hauler as part deck builder and part strategy board game.  Each turn a player can drive up to 12 hours each turn per truck or you draw 5 cards from their deck and purchase additional cards based on the green stamp value of the cards in play. Of course, there are complications and strategy to be had, as other players may be eyeing the same route you just passed on picking up, or may get to a hitchhiker before you if you take an extra deckbuilding turn. The decision is yours, and makes for great strategic conundrums in this 90-120 minute game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
