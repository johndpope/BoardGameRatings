							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wolfman</name>
									
			<description>Wolfman is a text adventure game developed by Rod Pike and  Jared Derrett using the Gilsoft Professional Adventure Writer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a standard text adventure with graphics in some locations to set the scene. It is in three parts, with the player in the role of the Wolfman in the first and third, and of his fianc&amp;eacute;e in the second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a heavy sleep the protagonist awakes to find his clothes ripped and bloody, yet no sign of injury to himself. Glancing through a window, he sees the body of a dead girl lying nearby, her throat has been torn out. He then realizes that he is in reality a werewolf, and must escape violent retribution by enraged villagers and somehow find a cure for his illness. After falling in love with a young woman named Nadia, the protagonist must rescue her when she is kidnapped while continuing to seek a cure for his lycanthropy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the earlier CRL adventures Frankenstein, and Jack the Ripper, the game was classified by the British Board of Film Censors, receiving an '18' certificate for its gory graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wolfman (game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
