							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of the Wizard of Oz</name>
									
			<description>A roll and move game in which players move counters from different initial positions: Dorothy starts in Kansas, the other players in positions ahead of her (Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, in that order.)  The point of the game is to reach the Witch's Castle and then return to the Emerald City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar in design and mechanics to the game Kentucky Derby (1938), and of typical quality of other Whitman Publishing games (paper boards, flimsy boxes, and punch-out paper pawns of other games) it looks as if Whitman didn't spend a lot on the construction of their games, apparently blowing all their budget on the purchase of the character license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linen paper game board &lt;br/&gt;1 dice&lt;br/&gt;4 wooden markers&lt;br/&gt;Two part box with color pictorial cover (measuring 7&amp;quot;x13&amp;quot;x1&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The featured art, though crude, is apparently inspired by the MGM Wizard Of Oz movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
