			<description>Critter-Tek is a tongue-in-cheek stuffed animal parody of Battletech that was fully approved and licensed by FASA.  Instead of gigantic high tech robot mechs players construct mechanical TEKs that are powered by animals on treadmills with hamster powered gyros and paper mache armor.  Weapons include spit-wad blowguns, slingshots and left over fireworks.  In fact Critter-Tek uses all the standard Battletech rules and merely renames all the terminology to a furrier anthropomorphic animal genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New elements, not include in standard Battlemech, such as subterranean movement for burrowing animals adds an new and interesting twist to a classic game.  This Beer &amp;amp; Pretzel approach to Battletech was a great way to introduce game mechanics to fairly young gamers.  My sons played allot of Critter-Tek while in grade school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
