			<description>This game is very similar to the Indian game of Pachisi, usually played by 4 players in partnerships. Six cowrie shells are used &amp;quot;as dice&amp;quot; as the rules say, but obviously the odds are quite different from the outcomes using dice. The shells are shaken and thrown from the hand. They score as follows:&lt;br/&gt;2 cowries with mouth up: 2&lt;br/&gt;3 cowries with mouth up: 3&lt;br/&gt;4 cowries with mouth up: 4&lt;br/&gt;5 cowries with mouth up: 5&lt;br/&gt;6 cowries with mouth up: 6 and another throw&lt;br/&gt;1 cowries with mouth up: 10 and another throw&lt;br/&gt;0 cowries with mouth up: 25 and another throw&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
