			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The No '&amp;amp;' RPGs: Fantasy Setting book is the first book in the No '&amp;amp;' RPGs system, but it is also a stand alone game which is designed to handle all aspects of the rules for generic high fantasy setting RPG campaigns and adventures. The No &amp;lsquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rsquo; RPGs: Fantasy Setting book has 6 races to choose from, 8 main character occupations, 7 character secondary occupations, many character skills, defects and traits, example items both mundane and magical, and over 400 spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The No &amp;lsquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rsquo; RPGs: Fantasy Setting book also contains example monsters, a system for making your own monsters, deities, and extra-dimensional locations. Character advancement is also handled by both traditional level systems and the ability to improve characters or learn through other forms of practice and schooling. The system is designed to be as quick and easy to use as possible, while still handling all of the necessary rules and maintaining versatility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
