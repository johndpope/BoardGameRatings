			<description>Eight Cards is a game where 2-4 explorers (players) go on an expedition for 7 days (turns) to try and earn the most reputation (points) and become the most legendary explorer (the winner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is simple to learn and play, but always changing and near impossible to predict. It works like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players have 8 cards. These 8 cards are the same 8 cards as everybody else has in their hands. Each turn the players select a card and once everyone has selected their card, the cards are revealed at the same time and compared. Depending on the number of people who played the card, the outcome changes. Based on the number of players with the same card, positive outcomes can become negative, the target of the card may change and even special actions must be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the head of your expedition, your role is to figure out when others will play each card, bluff about when you're going to play your cards, and deduct when it's safest to play your cards based on what's been played already.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game of reason, strategy and sometimes just plain luck to figure out how to build the best reputation and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
