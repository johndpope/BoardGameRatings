			<description>The goal is to reach scoring the most points in different disciplines of athletics to be named &amp;quot;Super Champion&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents a stadium with its running track and its vaulting. Each player receives initially a pawn and a map of &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; per event, and these cards can be favorable or unfavorable to the player to an opponent. For the first event, the 100 meters, you draw lots which starts (with the corridor No. 1) and the other players play in the direction of clockwise. In each round, the player rolls dice and moves as many spaces, some will make replay or rewind! The first who crossed the finish line wins 3 points, second 2 points, third 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;In the 110 meter hurdles, the same rules apply but the passage of the hedges is if you go out at 1 or 6. In the 400 meters, using 2 dice and make a lap. In the 800 meters, you do 2 laps and you need to cast off the rope after the first round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High jump, you throw 2 dice and make a minimum total (3 points for 1m30, 1m40 4 points etc. ...). In the long jump, the principle is the same, but the launch of a special die tells you if the jump is &amp;quot;bitten&amp;quot; or not!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember that in every event you have a card you favor or giving an opponent a handicap.&lt;br/&gt;The player who collected the most points at the end of the 6 tests was crowned &amp;quot;Super Champion&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
