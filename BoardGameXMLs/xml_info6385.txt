			<description>Passtimes: The Game of History challenges players to answer questions about events in our past.  The game is played among groups or individuals, who are given pairs of tokens to move on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player takes his or her turn, a card is drawn for them.  The player must answer a set of questions printed on that card.  If they answer a question correctly, they roll a die and move one of their tokens by the die's result.  An incorrect answer ends his or her turn and starts the next player's.  If a Time Warp card was drawn, the player switches one of his or her token with the token closes to the ending square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to move both of his or her tokens to the ending square wins and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
