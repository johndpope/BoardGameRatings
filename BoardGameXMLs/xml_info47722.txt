							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cold Snap Canadian Pro Football Simulation Board Game</name>
									
			<description>From the PLAAY.COM website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the heels of the success of SECOND SEASON Pro Football Game comes it's Canadian football counterpart: COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game! It's the most realistic and excitingly detailed  simulation of the Canadian pro game that's ever been created!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With COLD SNAP, you can bring back &amp;quot;the good old days&amp;quot; of Canadian pro football, or, re-live last year's exciting pro season! ANY time is &amp;quot;football season&amp;quot; when you've got a copy of COLD SNAP on your game shelf! YOU call the plays, YOU set the defensive alignments, YOU decide who to bring in when a star player goes down with an injury. Think you can do a better job with your favorite Canadian pro team than the real-life coach did? Well, now you can find OUT! (HINT: you might just gain a new respect for the real-life coach!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent years have seen a glut of new football games hit the market. Many of them are very good. But two key differences make COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game stand out above the crowd of pro football simulation board games...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIRST, this is a pro football game where EVERY player on the field matters. In many other games, defenders and linemen are treated almost as an afterthought--some games don't even rate them at ALL! But in COLD SNAP, the success or failure of a play most often HINGES on the performance of these players! Yes, the star Canadian passers and runners will stand out on your table-top--but so will the star interior linemen, linebackers and defensive backs! It's exciting to watch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SECOND, the COLD SNAP results book is cleverly designed to tell you not only WHAT happens on every play, but also WHY! Other games might tell you, for example, that the quarterback just threw an incomplete pass--and that's all the information you get. However, the COLD SNAP results book will tell you whether the incompletion was the result of great coverage by a defensive back, a hurried throw thanks to a missed block by an offensive lineman, a wrong pass route run by the receiver, or any of a multitude of other possible reasons! You'll know what DID happen, AND what MIGHT have happened, if not for the play made or NOT made. It's just like watching pro football on TV, with the game book serving as your color commentator!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game is incredibly detailed, yet easy to play. The offense coach chooses a ball carrier or intended receiver for one of six basic offense plays, while the defense coach secretly decides on one of four basic color-coded defense settings. (You can play solitaire, too--there are rules included for that!) Roll the dice, look up the result in the game book, record the gain or loss, and move on to the next play! It's that simple!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
