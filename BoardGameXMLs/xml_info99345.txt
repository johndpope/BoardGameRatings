			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members: Threat Report #19: Coral Snake, Threat Report #20: Steelhead, and Threat Report #21: Trawler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the authorities tend to believe Trawler &amp;mdash; with her history as a smuggler and dubious &amp;quot;salvage operator&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; is the force behind the Trident, the group actually came together due to one of its other members. Coral Snake has extensively studied her Serpent heritage and the secrets of ancient Lemuria. She believes the key to greater power and control over her ophidian nature lies there, deep beneath the Pacific. To reach it, she needs help. So she came up with the smuggling scheme and recruited Trawler and Steelhead to help back it, promising Trawler a shot at the greatest treasure trove she could imagine. Forked tongue firmly in cheek, Coral Snake dubbed their new venture &amp;quot;the Trident&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, the smuggling operation relied heavily on Trawler&amp;rsquo;s resources and the capabilities of its three founders. Success has allowed for expansion, including investment in better equipment (such as the Trident&amp;rsquo;s sea-cave hideout and &amp;quot;sea-serpent&amp;quot; submersible) and more personnel. Indeed, with the boom in illegal activities in Emerald City and the surrounding area, the Trident has more demand for contraband &amp;mdash; particularly illegal weapons and technologies &amp;mdash; than it can supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
