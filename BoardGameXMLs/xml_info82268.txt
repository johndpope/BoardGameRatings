							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cibo The Pasta Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Cibo &amp;ndash; the pasta card game is a game in which players are chefs who have to make the right pasta meal before the others. Cibo means food in Italian, and each card has unique artwork. Cards are drawn from the centre stack to gather ingredients and pieces of the place setting. Once the fork, spoon and plate cards have been played to the table in front of the player, they can start to play cards for their meal. But other players can use waiters to steal cards, and chef cards to force other players to make certain pasta dishes. Also the mouse card can be used to spoil another players dish. The first one to complete their pasta wins the round and scores points for their own cards on the table. The first to score 50 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
