			<description>In Pick Nick, each player has two or three insects that they want to move out of the garden to safety. Nick the bird, however, has other plans and will peck at exposed insects to send them scurrying back to the starting line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, players takes two insects for a short game and three for a longer game; place the leaves into their holders and set them next to the game board so that they cover certain spaces. On a turn, a player rolls the die, then adds one of his insects to the movement track. Once all of a player's insects are on the track, he moves any one of his choice on his turn based on the die roll. If he rolls Nick, he makes the bird pick up one of the insect tokens with his beak, ideally catching one of the opponents! That player must start over with that token. Whoever reaches the end of the track with all of his insects first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
