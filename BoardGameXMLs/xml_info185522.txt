							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bubble Tanks 1.5 TD</name>
									
			<description>The massive update to Bubble Tanks Tower Defense is here! This neat upgrade delivers a lot of new and fancy content:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 New Tower Types: Beam, Poison, Self-Destruct, and Confusion. Each of these towers can be included to make Mega Towers, including a new Mega Beam Tower! Yes, Mega Mega Beam Towers are possible as well.&lt;br/&gt;4 New Enemy Types: EMP, Stealth, Swarm, and Cursed!&lt;br/&gt;15 Brand New Maps!&lt;br/&gt;All the original 50 maps have been updated to include the new enemy types and re-tweaked! Try beating them all over again!&lt;br/&gt;A new Dark Mode (think FML mode) where you can only see a small area around the mouse!&lt;br/&gt;You can now turn off the auto-pause via the Settings menu.&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering how to get to the new towers, pause from in-game to see the new upgrade tree with descriptions and stats. *&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of trying to beat levels with BOTH FML and Dark modes turned on! :) Give it a try&amp;hellip; At any rate, thank you again to all our fans for your support!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
