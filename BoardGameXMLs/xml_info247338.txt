			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping encounters interesting is sometimes the most challenging part of Game Mastering. Not every encounter should devolve into open warfare. Sometimes, however, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to come up with encounters on the fly and often players grow to expect certain things as they get to know the style of the GM. This book is an attempt to keep a sci fi space opera setting interesting and unpredictable with a nod to retro sci fi from the 70s and 80s. The book uses characters, equipment and rules from the recent White Star: Galaxy Edition by James M. Spahn, but it is compatible with any White Box based game. If you want a crew of fantasy adventurers to encounter killer robots or meddling aliens, here is your opportunity to make that happen. Stats are also given for Okumarts Games Save the Day Super Powered Role-Playing Game and Darkfast Dungeons. Alien invaders and futuristic agents are just the thing for cosmic comic book adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
