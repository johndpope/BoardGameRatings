							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Journey to Silius</name>
									
			<description>In the year 0373 of the new space age calendar, overpopulation of Earth has led to increased demand for emigration to space colonies. Jay McCray, the son of a scientist responsible for development of space colony #428 in the Silius Solar System (SSS), prepares to move there in order to follow in his father's footsteps. However, the space station is obliterated in an explosion, killing the entire research team and destroying all data onboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his father's home, Jay discovers a floppy disk containing not only the complete SSS colony plans but a personal message from his father asking that he complete the projects should terrorists succeed in destroying the colony. To protect the colony plans and to avenge his father's death, Jay sets out to fight the terrorists responsible for the space colony's destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to the Mega Man and Contra series, in that while Jay's default weapon has unlimited ammunition, his other weapons do not; likewise, most of the weapons Jay can use are acquired by defeating major enemies, and items dropped by minor enemies restore life and energy (ammunition). He also cannot shoot upward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Journey to Silius, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
