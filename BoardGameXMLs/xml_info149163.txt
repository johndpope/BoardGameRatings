Build your deck from a large selection of cool characters, crazy enhancements, and awesome creatures. Then choose your hero for the battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Obliterate your opponent! Using your deck you will Deploy&amp;gt;Enhance&amp;gt;Attack&amp;gt;Discard. Use ranged and melee cards to attack. Juice them up with some spells. Place in some defensive vehicles to block incoming attacks. Use counter-attack cards to send the enemies attacks right back at them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. After capturing the opposing hero, regroup and rebuild your deck for the next battle. Don't forget to adjust your strategy, because now your opponent will gain an advantage through the use of terrain cards! So stay alert and think outside of the box or you might be caught blindsided by a brutal attack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
