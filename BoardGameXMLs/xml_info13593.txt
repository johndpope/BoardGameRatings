			<description>Drive on Damascus recreates the one major campaign between the Allies and Vichy France during WWII. It is an operational game recreating on the battalion level the Allied invasion of Syria and Lebanon in June 1941. This game has been built around two basic situations: the historical invasion and a hypothetical one, covering the chance of German intervention. In both cases it remains a two player game with each player alternately moving his pieces and resolving combat in succession. Whilst the game reproduces the situation that faced the historical commanders, the outcome will depend upon the decisions taken by players; it is perfectly possible to change the course of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drive on Damascus uses point-to-point (dots) movement system.  British forces try to preempt an attack from the Vichy French staged in Syria in 1941.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be run as part of a campaign with O'Connor's Offensive, Hellfire Pass and Bloody Keren (which is where the campaign rules are to be found).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published 1981, in The Wargamer Magazine issue #15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Syria, 1941&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1 day&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 3.2 miles / 5.15 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company to Battalion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 23 x 32&amp;quot; full color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One single-side printed countersheet (260 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 12-page Drive on Damascus rulebook (in magazine)&lt;br/&gt;Player will have to provide one 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
