			<description>Potzklotz contains of 5 wooden cubes, a 5 x 5 board with squares and 56 cards. The cubes are set in the middle of the board, shaping one form. The players draw 5 cards each from the stack of 56 cards. On these cards are pictures of other shapes, created by the 5 cubes. If the player on turn thinks, he can rebuild the existing shape into one shape of the cards on his hand by moving only a single cube, he plays a card and tries it without turning the board and in a single trial. If he is not able to rebuild the shape, he has to draw one more card from the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first gets rid of all his card, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are different rules in the box, so you can vary from lighter gaming to more heavier: Without building over the border of the board, with penalty cards for mirror-shapes etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potzklotz is for children up from 7, but also for grown-ups. It is pretty difficult to think three-dimensional and turning the shapes in your imagination. SO it is good math training and much fun, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.potzklotz.de&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.potzklotz.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
