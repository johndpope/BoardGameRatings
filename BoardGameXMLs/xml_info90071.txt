			<description>Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Splatterhouse is combat-oriented with Rick fighting various monsters in either hand-to-hand combat or with makeshift weapons, such as wooden planks and meat cleavers. Rick is able to attack his enemies with super strength and rip them apart. He can also chain attacks together into combos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rick can lose limbs, but is able to grow them back over time. Arms can be used as clubs to fight enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, Rick can collect blood from defeated enemies. Collecting a certain amount will allow the player to unlock new moves and perform special attacks. Players can find journals documenting Dr. West's history while photos of Rick's girlfriend serve as a breadcrumb trail to follow. He can perform &amp;quot;Splatter Kills&amp;quot;, extremely gory finishing moves. There is also a platforming element with jump nodes to keep instant death falls to a minimum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with the original Splatterhouse arcade game, Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3 as unlockables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer Willis is to have a interview with Dr. Henry West M.D., professor of necrobiology, at his house. Her boyfriend, Rick Taylor, comes along so nothing bad happens. Just as Rick is about to propose to Jennifer, the two are attacked by Dr. West's experiments, kidnapping Jennifer and leaving Rick mortally wounded. Rick knocks over a sarcophagus revealing a mask. Close to death, the Terror Mask calls out to Rick, saying it will save him and help save Jenny if he puts it on. Having no choice, Rick puts the mask on and is transformed into a hulking beast powered by the blood of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rick follows Dr. West and Jennifer through other dimensions and time periods and learns of Dr. West's plan to bring dark deities, known as &amp;quot;The Corrupted&amp;quot;, into this world by sacrificing Jennifer. Dr. West believes The Corrupted will resurrect his dead love Leonora, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Jennifer. The Corrupted intended to lay waste to Earth instead. It is revealed Rick was the one who supposedly killed Leonora, according to Dr. West, who witnessed it. In truth, she was burnt in a wicker man by a witch hunting mob, who were possessed by demons. In an attempt to save Leonora, thinking she was Jennifer, Rick was attacked by her reanimated corpse, forcing him to kill her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, Rick succeeds in rescuing Jennifer and thwarting West's plans. However, West still managed to summon one of the Corrupted, which constructs itself by using all of the experiments Rick killed. Rick manages to kill it, but in the process, a stray spirit possesses Jennifer. Believing his deal with the Mask to be done, he tries to pry it off. However, aware of Jennifer's possession, it refuses. It is implied from West's reaction that the stray spirit is of Leonora's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Splatterhouse (2010 video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
