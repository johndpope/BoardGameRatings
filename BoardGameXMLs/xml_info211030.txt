							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The After Party</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is set to be played as a party type game. Players can decide beforehand as many or as little details as they want about their character, but the overall point is to make it up and build stories off of one another. This game can be played by any group, but it is recommended to have at least 6 players. The more the merrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
