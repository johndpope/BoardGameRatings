			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few monsters are more terrifying than the fleshweaver. The staccato clicking, insect-like sounds that accompany every movement of this creature can be extremely disquieting to anyone unaccustomed to them. Those who have the unfortunate pleasure of meeting a fleshweaver are usually never heard from again. When they are, only their skinless bodies are found. What happens to the skin of the victims of this evil fiend, only a few souls dare to guess. A fleshweaver is a nightmarish aberration that seems to have come from the darkest corners of one&amp;rsquo;s mind. Often naked, this twisted reject of the arcane magic that created it is an unnatural combination of a dreadful-looking head attached to a humanoid torso, four large arthropod legs, and arms that end in a wide three fingered insect-like appendage. The scorched, misshapen, and malformed skin of the fleshweaver wraps tightly upon its body, as if barely fitting the creature&amp;rsquo;s form. Its skin, marked by the painful way the fleshweaver was brought to life, also tells the tale of countless battles fought against those who have fallen victim to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Fleshweaver (CR 7)&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Fleshweaver Paragon (CR 7)&lt;br/&gt;     Fleshweaver Miniature Counters&lt;br/&gt;     Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
