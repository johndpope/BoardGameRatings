							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Punch Cards: Spy Game</name>
									
			<description>This is the second set of Punch Cards released by Cheapass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Punch Cards are just what they sound like; cards with holes punched in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the front of each of this particular set of cards is art from &amp;quot;James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game&amp;quot; (illustrated by Cheyenne Wright) and on the back are lots of numbers. Riddling the cards themselves are the aforementioned holes. (Just your standard office hole-punched style holes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your opponent each pick a card (based solely on your like of the art work) and then a corner of the card. Place the two corners together so you can see the numbers through the holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now both players call either &amp;quot;High,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Low,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Both.&amp;quot; If one player says &amp;quot;High&amp;quot; and the other player says &amp;quot;Low,&amp;quot; play again. Otherwise, either the highest or the lowest number wins, depending on what was called. If either of you says &amp;quot;Both&amp;quot; the game is always on, but you must win both highest and lowest numbers to claim victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read out the highest/lowest numbers you can see through your holes and try to beat your opponent, that's it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular set was released at summer conventions because &amp;quot;James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game&amp;quot; (a re-working of the classic and trademark-infringing &amp;quot;Before I Kill You Mr Bond&amp;quot;) wasn't quite ready yet. You can buy the whole set of 9 cards for just $2.50&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
