			<description>The Atonement: Miracle of Christ&amp;rsquo;s Love from the Latter Day Saints is a captivating activity game involving many aspects of the Plan of Salvation, including choices, sins, good works, ordinances, spiritual gifts, trials, missionary work and temple work.  Players interact in both Earth Life and in the Spirit World and are eventually judged and assigned to a degree of glory. The game was created by Kathryn Matthews over a period of 12 years.  Her son, Jonathan, suffered from kidney failure at a young age which prompted her to donate her own kidney to him.  Over the following ten years, Jonathan suffered deteriorating health and required constant tending until his death in 1999.  It was during this difficult time that Kathryn found comfort in learning the doctrines of the Plan of Salvation and spending time creating a learning activity that teaches about the joy it brings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
