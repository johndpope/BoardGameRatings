			<description>Maatilakierros is a simple children's game where players move around the farm by rolling the dice. The dice is not numbered but instead has different colors on its side. On blue, green, yellow and orange you get to move to the next circle with the appropriate color, on red you move backwards and on white you do not move at all. The winner is the player who reaches the last circle first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components are nice - the dice is big, as is the board which is constructed from over 30 pieces. Soft and cute animals (a cat, a dog, a pig and a cow) are used as player tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
