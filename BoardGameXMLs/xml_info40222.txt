			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;The simple strategy game for all the family, with easy-to-learn rules for two to four players, aged five years and upwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bees are returning to their beehive, after a busy day collecting pollen in the meadow.  Players have to get their Bees into the honeycomb without upsetting the other Bees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems easy at first but the Bees have a sting in their tails and it's not as simple as it looks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player must place one of the four bees in their colour onto the 4 by 4 &amp;quot;honeycomb&amp;quot;, but each placed bee must be placed in an empty cell and may not &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; another bee of the same colour.  If you can not place a bee, then you are out of the game and the last player to place a bee wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
