Hope you are cause Tiques Attack is a game of speed that will put all your senses to work. When you see or hear that your pet may be infected with parasites, you must react faster than ticks and expose an animal other than yours to their terrible voracity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning! Ticks attack! Sharpen your reflexes and get ready for a party filled with laughter and action with Tiques Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to have as few as possible ticks counter at the end of the game. The player with the fewest win. To do so, you must be faster than your opponent to protect your animal by covering it with cards from your pile as your animal shows up in the danger zone. Players can also get ticks counter by making mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
