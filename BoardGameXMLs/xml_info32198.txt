							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chip &#039;n&#039; Dale Nuts! Game</name>
									
			<description>This is from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to collect the most nuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player at his (or her) turn spins the spinner, then moves the Chip 'N' Dale playing piece, from tree to tree, clockwise around the game board according to the number spun.&lt;br/&gt;     When a player lands on a tree which contains no nuts, he takes nuts -- according to the number spun -- from the center of the game board and places them on the tree where he landed.  For example, a player who spins 3, moves three spaces, and if the tree where he lands has no nuts, takes three nuts from the center of the game board and places them on that tree.  If, however, a player lands on a tree already containing nuts, he removes all the nuts from that tree and places them off the game board on the table in front of him.  His turn ends. &lt;br/&gt;     Play continues in this way and tell no nights are left on the center of the game board.  Game ends as soon as the last nut is taken from the center of the game board.  &lt;br/&gt;     Winner is a player with the most nuts on the table in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
