							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Discover Through Play with Chicky</name>
									
			<description>This is a roll-and-move game published as an advertising premium for the KFC Chicky Club in Singapore. Players roll two dice and move their Chicky token forward that number of spaces, trying to be the first to reach the Finish (on space 100). Along the way players may land on special spaces and have to follow the instructions on the space - one of these sends the player to their room where they have to roll six before continuing. Landing on a player sends that player back to the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
