							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pagoda: Wuxia Role Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pagoda is a game of wuxia, or melodramatic chinese martial arts. While wuxia features wild, high-strung, fast paced crazy kung fu martial arts, that is not what the genre is truly about. Wuxia is not about fighting, it is about why the characters are fighting; their motivations and drives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Pagoda are made up of three Degrees: Elements, Aspects, and Paths. When a character performs a task, the Element chosen represents why they are doing this. The Aspect chosen represents how they are doing this. The Path chosen represents what they are actually doing. There are five components of each of the first two Degrees, and an infinite number of Paths, although any given character possesses only five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF file includes a one-page character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
