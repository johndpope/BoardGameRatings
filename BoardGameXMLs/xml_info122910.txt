							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trivial Pursuit: 1998 Edition</name>
									
			<description>This is a Trivial Pursuit edition with questions exclusively from the year 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 250 trivia cards with 6 questions each from the following categories:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue: Schlagzeilen (Headlines)&lt;br/&gt;Pink: Showbusiness&lt;br/&gt;Yellow: Weltgeschehen (World Affairs)&lt;br/&gt;Brown: Klatsch &amp;amp; Tratsch (Gossip &amp;amp; Chit-Chat)&lt;br/&gt;Green: Sport (Sports)&lt;br/&gt;Orange: Rundblick (Panorama)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player gets a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes (standard Trivial Pursuit issue). There is no game board. A special six-sided die showing the six colors mentioned above is rolled by the player on turn. The color tells from which category the question comes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player on turn can answer the question, he gets another turn and, if he does not has it already, the corresponding colored pie piece which he puts in his playing piece. If he answers wrong, it's the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect all colors wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set is fully compatible with every other Trivial Pursuit game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
