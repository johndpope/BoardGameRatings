			<description>The life simulation game 6-Minute Princess uses incremental deck manipulation to represent the progression of each player&amp;rsquo;s adopted daughter from age 10 to age 18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 6-Minute Princess, each player works to raise his or her child to succeed in a trade or profession of her choosing. By learning a trade, each player&amp;rsquo;s daughter can focus and increase her physical attributes to build a foundation for her later career; money she earns by practicing her trade can help pay tuition for schooling to align her skills with her ultimate goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By overseeing his or her daughter&amp;rsquo;s training, leisure activities, and diet, each player may choose to steer his or her daughter&amp;rsquo;s progress toward any among the number of endings available exclusively to her in a particular game; but each player&amp;rsquo;s ultimate success depends not on the relative prestige of the career he or she chooses for his or her daughter, but rather on his or her daughter&amp;rsquo;s success in that career: A hunter who knows her trade may do better in life than a princess who cannot inspire the love of her subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players construct their daughters&amp;rsquo; character decks gradually all year long, building toward the yearly harvest festival, in which each player&amp;rsquo;s daughter can compete against other contestants in a variety of contests to win prestige, prizes, and royal favor. During the festival, players enter any contests of their choosing by selecting hands of cards from their daughters&amp;rsquo; character decks, then playing out those hands of cards against the other players in each contest. Cards won increase each daughter&amp;rsquo;s reputation in her associated skill and raise her likelihood of encountering rivals striving in those same skills during the rest of the year. Cards saved back from the contest form each player&amp;rsquo;s daughter&amp;rsquo;s character deck for the next year, helping her focus her work and training as she prepares for the next festival and, ultimately, aims at her chosen destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players who feel confident in their daughters&amp;rsquo; training can go adventuring outside the confines of the capital city in hopes of finding help unavailable through normal means, whether from new acquaintances, after defeating enemies, through fairy meetings, or in undiscovered troves. Those who focus chiefly on schooling can benefit from the benevolence of the various deities who oversee the various mental and physical arts in the kingdom. And those whose skills lend themselves less toward adventuring and training and more toward society can try to find their place in the capital&amp;rsquo;s social life by cultivating helpful relationships among those who live in the palace&amp;mdash;and can eventually aspire to a position among the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s nobility, perhaps even its royalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But raising a daughter isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Keeping her healthy means feeding her well, and both feeding her and training her cost money. Yet the work she does to help earn that money can increase her resentment if she feels too much is being required of her&amp;mdash;if she works or studies too long without time to herself, if she wears herself out adventuring without time vacationing to renew her energy. And if her resentment grows, she may fall into delinquency, may even run away from home without considering the consequences of abandoning her schooling or missing a festival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to do what you can to shepherd her through the difficulties of growing up, teaching her how to work and how to learn and giving her skills for the life she eventually chooses to live. She may not be grateful at the time, but as you teach her to be moral and industrious, to work hard at getting ahead, she will come, in the end, to be thankful for the discipline you&amp;rsquo;ve helped her maintain during her formative years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when she turns 18, your job is over: She is of age, free to follow her own path in life. And you can only hope she feels kindly toward you for the role you played in her upbringing, for the tools you have helped her equip herself with. Because whatever part she chooses to play among those who live in the capital city&amp;mdash;even in the kingdom overall&amp;mdash;it is you who helped give her the chance to choose that path, and you who prepared her to succeed in it. Your parenting skills will be reflected in her success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full game of 6-Minute Princess is played in 8 sessions of approximately 1 to 3 hours apiece, depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
