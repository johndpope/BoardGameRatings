							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boxing Arena</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This building with its thick concrete walls originally was used as a fabrication hall. When the factory was closed down though this structure fell into disuse and neglect. Only recently the community decided to renovate and re purpose it. Now, with new windows, a fresh and shiny parquet floor and tiling on the lower part of the walls it is used to host both social and local sports events. Currently a boxing ring has been set up at the center of the decorated room, surrounded by enough rows of benches to seat a few hundred, to host an important heavy weight fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
