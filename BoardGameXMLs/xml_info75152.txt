			<description>Publisher Site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prince of Darkness has vanished and the Infernal Throne sits empty.  A conclave of the Powers and Potentates of Hell will be summoned to Pandemonium to select the next ruler of The Infernal Pit.  Do you have what it takes to claim the throne and rule Hell?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solium Infernum is a turn based strategy game set in the profoundest depths of Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game combines mechanics from a traditional hex-based wargame with political machinations.  Players fight to score prestige points to win the approval of the Demonic Conclave who will appoint the next ruler of Hell - or to destroy the conclave and conquer Hell by force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capturing key locations in Hell, manipulating events and becoming involved in global actions can provide prestige points, but they can mostly be gained from interaction with other players.  The Conclave do not allow directly attacking another player; you may instead insult them publically or make demands of them to force them to declare war on you or give cause for declaring war on them.  Even such a war is only allocated a limited number of turns and a specific goal, and the aggressor must wager Prestige on their victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player may create their own demon with several statistics which influence their ability to lead armies, to gather resources (and steal them from other players), and which may raise the cost or risk of political actions against them.  The game is over when a player seizes the rule of Hell by force by conquering Pandemonium, or when the Conclave casts their 15th vote, at which point the player with the most Prestige wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
