			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pure Shoujo is set in a high school and concerns itself with the romantic alliances and friendships that form and break in that setting.  The setting is infused with Manga elements.  Players may choose to play multiple characters.  The game uses D6 and D12 and a stripped pack of playing cards.  One player is called the Dealer (Game Master), who deals cards, rolls (randomizes) scenes, and breaks ties.  Otherwise, the game is a shared narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have a gender and a concept, as well as Virtues (Attributes) including:  Honor, Cunning, Discernment, Passion, Style, Beauty, and Prowess.  Virtues can be randomized or purchase from a point pool, as desired.  Characters also have three Specialties (Skills) which are player-defined, and three Secrets.  During play whenever two dice are rolled and match (e.g., a 1 and a 1, or a 6 and a 6) one or two cards are laid and the cards determine the generic sort of action which next occurs (e.g., &amp;quot;Going Steady:  Elevate a friend to an SO, or an SO to a True Love&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For any non-trivial action, dice are rolled and compared to an appropriate Virtue.  &amp;quot;Rolling under&amp;quot; the Virtue indicates success.  Modifiers apply upon the Dealer's determination.  If an action is opposed by another player and a compromise cannot be quickly evolved, then a vote is solicited from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules present a sample high school with a supporting cast.  This setting is quite basic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
