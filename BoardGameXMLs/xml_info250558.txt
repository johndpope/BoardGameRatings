			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Year of Celebrations is a continuing monthly log written by the traveling bard Digby O'Flannagan. In this log Digby describes the various holidays, celebrations and fairs that he has seen in his travels. This month Digby settles in to the first month of autumn with September - a month when the fields are a bustle of activities and preparing for the coming winter is on everyone's mind. This unique race to clear the fields and provision before the cold settles in infuses the month of September with a frantic energy. This frantic rush even finds its way into the unique celebrations of September. So, as Digby would say, &amp;quot;Keep a merry soul&amp;quot; and let's see what September has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small product contains a month summary, alternate historical and fantasy names for the month and four fully fleshed-out holidays. This product also includes a game master section with an in-depth month theme discussion and advice on using each of the holidays presented in your game including unique plot hooks for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
