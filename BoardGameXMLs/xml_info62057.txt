							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power Alteration Feats</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feats such as Power Attack let you alter your powers on the fly. A character with Power Attack can choose whether to apply the effect of power attack for each attack they make, giving the player more choice in combat and making the character more versatile. Power alteration feats make use of this mechanic, allowing characters who use different kinds of powers to alter their attacks when they think it is best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the power alteration feats here are heroic feats so they can be used by any character. They are designed to be useful at all levels, so certain benefits are improved in paragon and epic tiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spice up combats and encourage tactical thinking with power alteration feats by Svalin Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
