			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be learning to care for the mysterious Mio, and also deeper mysteries of this animal. Talking to a number of people to find the clues you are looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hoshi wo Sagashite... (星をさがして&amp;hellip;?) is a late 1980s adventure video game for the Sega Master System. The game revolves around a dog and his family. Being one of the earliest adventure games for an 8-bit console system, the game tends to be simplistic compared to today's adventure games. As a Japan exclusive video game, literacy is required in the Japanese language in order to play the game. The character seems to have an anime-like influence as the people are watching out for the dog that is sitting on a log. Among the human beings, however, is an alien-like creature. While the literal translation would be Searching the Stars..., the actual alternative title is The Story of Mio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different endings to this game in addition to an altered sequence and a definite game over situation. Places to visit include the airport, the park, and various homes. The game is controlled with an interface that nearly resemble ICOM's (since this was the interface that was popular in Japanese adventure games back in the 1980s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshi_wo_Sagashite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshi_wo_Sagashite&lt;/a&gt;...
