			<description>User summary: &lt;br/&gt;Cultures is the first game in Cultures series. It's a strategy game, where you really need to take good care of your tribe. You need to navigate a production line for food, tools, ..., make sure you have enough houses and enough kids (you make them yourself, so one of the first things you have to do is find a spouse for most of your people) to educate them for all the job openings (for example: first you can build a farm and there a farmer is educated who then unlocks a mill, you get a mill and unlock a barkery, get a baker ... but at the same time you need new people to take care of the farm, when a farmer becomes a baker. And it's like this with everything, but in a while school gets unlocked, so you can educate kids there (but you do have to wait for them to grow up, of course). In the meanwhile you have to take care of your army too, 'cause there are some other not so friendly tribes on your land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
