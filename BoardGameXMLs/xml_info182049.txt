			<description>&amp;ldquo;Taste of Poland&amp;rdquo; is a culinary trip around Poland. We evoke tastes characteristic and  unique to each region of the country. In this game, each of you will try to make the most meals by collecting the ingredients needed for their preparation. The player with the highest number of taste points becomes the winner and earns the title of the biggest foodie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consist of a series of rounds in which players take turns carrying out two phases in a certain order. Beginning with the active player, each player plays his or her round. After the round of the active player, the person to the left (clockwise)&lt;br/&gt;of the active player becomes the new active player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round consists of 2 phases:&lt;br/&gt;The phase of the active player: the active player plays a dish card and draws new cards from appropriate decks.&lt;br/&gt;The phase of the remaining players: (it begins at the same time as the phase of the active player) each of the remaining players has the opportunity to prepare the dish played by the active player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of the turn of the active player in which the last card is drawn from the face-down deck. The remaining inactive players may prepare the dish depicted on the card played in this round by the active player, provided that they have the necessary ingredients at their disposal. The game ends after the turn of the active player is over. To calculate the final score, each player sums up the Taste Points from the dish cards (prepared dishes) collected in his or her score pile. Additionally, players receive 1 Taste Point for each full meal consisting of 3 different types of dishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
