			<description>&amp;ldquo;The Korean War included several major surprises: the North's invasion of the South, the Inchon landings, and the intervention of China. Another surprise came when the Russian built Mig-15 jet started flying in the skies over North Korea. It dominated the skies and took a heavy toll on UN bombers, especially the B-29s.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The US sent in the F-86 Sabre to fight for air supremacy. Jet vs. jet dogfights took place in &amp;lsquo;Mig Alley,&amp;rsquo; an area just south of the Yalu River which marked the border with China. UN pilots were not allowed to cross the Yalu, a rule they sometimes ignored. Badly outnumbered and hampered by early technical problems, the Sabre pilots struggled at the start. In time they would turn the tide, and by the end of the war they would have the upper hand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple historical miniatures air combat game designed for classroom use in grades 6-8. The game may be played by eight players using 1/144 scale models on a Battle Masters mat (4x4 feet with five inch hexes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses an aircraft model (F-86 or MiG-15), a deck of maneuver cards, a laminated record card (for tracking damage and victories with a dry erase marker), and 5 six-sided dice. Each record card includes the name of a Korean War ace, his victory total, and brief biographical information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
