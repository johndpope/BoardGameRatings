							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unbound Saga</name>
									
			<description>Unbound Saga is the story of Rick Ajax, a comic book character who is aware he is in a comic. Ajax and fellow comic character Lori Machete seek to confront the artist who created them and be freed from constantly fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the game's two playable characters has a unique animation set and fighting style. Rick uses a fighting style similar to wrestling and can also pick up and throw enemies. Lori's moveset is more reminiscent of kung fu, and she has the ability to use smoke pellets to sneak up on enemies. Characters moves and abilities can be upgraded to more powerful attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Unbound Saga&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
