			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;Role-Playing in the Orient&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside are two books for you and a friend to use in playing an all-new kind of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of you will take the part of Prince Matabei, dispossessed of his kingdom by his uncle, Lord Kenshin, who will be played by the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dead of night, on a fog-shrouded coast, the prince returns to Tsuke, his former kingdom. During the coming days he must investigate the entire province, locate Lord Kenshin's troops, and determine who is for him and who against. At the same time, Lord Kenshin will be fighting to keep control in a land that has come to hate him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either of you can win... and either of you can die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This an exciting game of hand-to-hand combat, troop movements, and subtle negotiation, all in the oriental style. No dice are required. Instead a traditional paper-scissors-rock game determines the outcome of combat and other encounters. All you need to start is one friend and two pencils!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY ANYTIME! ANYWHERE!&lt;br/&gt;PLAY MANY TIMES!&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
