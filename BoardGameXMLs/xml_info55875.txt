			<description>From the back of the module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy Warriors: A Module of Faith, Intrigue and Death During the Crusades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the bloody days of Richard Lionheart...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JOIN UP! And journey to the castle of Assassins in the time of the Crusades. Take ship with a mad Frenchman on a doomed mission to sack the holy city of Mecca. The Voltigeurs of the BTA who take these missions on, must be the best if they are to survive the struggle of Holy Warriors, Timeline's first module for Time &amp;amp; Time Again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game package contains all of the information, maps and details the Gamemaster needs to run these two scenarios. In addition, detailed historical information of the Crusades and the Medieval Middle East is given so that the GM can develop his or her own Crusader scenarios. Included are sections on warfare, economics, the history of the Crusades, religion, politics and more. Complete maps of the area (including four city maps), tables detailing costs, time of travel, arms and armour and population are all here for the GM's use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the glory, pageantry, hope, despair and savagery of the Crusades are here for Voltigeurs who dare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Notes:&lt;br/&gt;This item appears to have been the only module produced for Time &amp;amp; Time Again. It contains a great deal of background on the Crusades and the Levant, so much so that it would probably be useful for any RPG set in this era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
