			<description>Koppzerbreche is a trivia game featuring questions related to the city of Darmstadt, located in the South of Hesse, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics are very simple: each turn, a multiple choice question with four answers is read aloud by a player. All other players then simultaneously try to answer the question by secretly placing one of their four answers cards (A,B,C or D) face down on the table. Each player with the correct answer then progresses his meeple on a linear track, according to the predetermined difficulty rating of the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions are divided into the categories Science, History, Sport, Culture, People and Local. Some are simple and some are very tricky. For example, one can score if one knows that the local museum houses the original death mask of William Shakespeare, that the 1990 world-championship in solar racing was won by students of the city's university, that &amp;quot;Kn&amp;auml;&amp;auml;rze&amp;quot; is local slang for the end piece of a bread, or the country were the 2009 world championship in amateur boxing had been won by a local boxer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is of standard quality for a German boardgame with 6 classical wooden meeples and a full-color thick cardboard board. Each of the 165 full-sized double-sided question cards features a color photo or picture in relation to its question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
