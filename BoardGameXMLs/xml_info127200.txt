			<description>Very often spectacular scientific inventions are based upon nature - the aeroplane, roof tiles, or the newest thing, the &amp;quot;lotus effect&amp;quot; - a dirt-rejecting ability that now is used for sinks. With the simple means of a dice/movement game those connection between nature and science are explored and explained. Players try to find as many logical connections between nature and science as possible, the board parcours has 5 kinds of spaces, which require different forms of problem solving to find a solution. Players roll the die, advance their pawn and solve the problem of the space they land on. For a correct solution players receive a bionic-chip, who has collected five of them, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would you know what a fly and a bicycle have in common? The gear shift in a bicycle was devised from the fly's shoulder joint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
