			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the morning of 27th May dawned the 8th Panzer Regiment under Lieutenant Teege led Rommel&amp;rsquo;s wide sweep around the British southern flank at Bir Hacheim. With one hundred and eighty tanks, the regiment was arrayed in spearhead formation with the first section moving forward on a wide front of one and one half miles by about a mile deep. At about 0715 hours, the call rang out in the headsets, &amp;ldquo;Enemy armor, twelve o&amp;rsquo;clock!&amp;rdquo; A British lieutenant of the 8th Hussars also dryly noted enemy armor to his regimental HQ by radio. &amp;ldquo;It looks as if Jerry&amp;rsquo;s come with a Panzer brigade,&amp;rdquo; only to correct himself moments later. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s more than a brigade, its the whole bloody Afrika Korps. Alert! Alert!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And thus began the historic Battle of Gazala. It was May of 1942, Hitler&amp;rsquo;s armies were still the masters of Europe, with more conquests to come. And yet YOU, tactical-level gamer and ATS devotee ... has only experienced this battle in &amp;lsquo;penny packets&amp;rsquo;, a tank here, two tanks there. Until NOW. Because the ATS GAZALA MONSTER is here to rescue you from never being able to cross off, &amp;lsquo;big, real Western Desert warfare experience&amp;rsquo; ... from your bucket list. Imagine the old Tobruk orders-of-battle ... with all of their one-to-one representations ... then knife forward with your formations of 10, no 15, wait add in Troop Leaders and panzer leaders ... and make that 17 AFVs ... in a full-blown presentation that gives you ALL of the tanks, guns and men (i.e., all combat counters; just bring your ATS rulebook and markers) ... and the playing area to duke it out in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set also debuts the first collection of 11&amp;rdquo; &amp;times; 16&amp;rdquo; folding DESERT GEO boards and a selection of overlays to go with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
