							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faerie Passions (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fantastical resource for integrating the fey into campaigns, for players and GMs alike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens when immortal infatuation breaks forth into the world of mortals? Faerie Passions holds the answers, with advice and optional rules for GMs as well as new character options for characters. Faerie Passions explores the mindset of the fey and their motivations when interacting with mortals and a world that is not their own, richly illustrated with detailed examples. It also engages children of mortals and the fey, the legacies of love (or lust) left behind in the wake of the often fleeting or turbulent romance between lovers that are worlds apart. Finally, you will find within these pages five new fey-themed sorcerer bloodlines as well as a pair of archetypes devoted to a closer relationship to all things faerie: the feyfriend druid who desperately wishes to be like them in every way, and the fey hunter ranger who wishes only to get close enough to kill every last one for spite and vengeance on the Fair Folk who wronged them dearly once upon a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideally suited for use with the Kingdom-Building Adventure Path or for any campaign where they fey play a significant role, Faerie Passions is brought to you by the authorial team of Russ Taylor and Todd Stewart making their Legendary debut, with marvelous artwork by the esteemed Mike Lowe. Add this 18-page to your collection today, and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
