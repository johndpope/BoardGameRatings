							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Famous Fastballs: The World&#039;s Smallest Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;        The sweat on the pitcher&amp;rsquo;s brow as you stare him down, the hum of the ball as it hurtles toward you, the crack of the bat as you swing for the fences like you&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted... Do you have what it takes to be a famous baseball player? Find out today with Famous Fastballs - the World's Smallest Baseball Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Famous Fastballs is a fun, fast-playing simulation of the sport of baseball. The game focuses on the contest between the pitcher and batter which results in walks, hits, and outs. Hits lead to an additional contest between the fielders and the baserunners, resulting in everything from home runs to triple plays. Throughout the game, pennies move about on the playing cards, tracking statistics and men on base. Famous Fastballs was the very first game in Famous Games Company's line of Worldâ€™s Smallest Sports Games to be invented, and serves as an excellent introduction to the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
