							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soldiers of Pen and Ink</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldiers of Pen and Ink is a Trail of Cthulhu campaign set in the dark heart of the Spanish Civil War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comrade is lost. Enemies surround you, and your fellow soliders cannot be trusted. Can you rescue your friend while retaining your sanity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madrid, 1936. The Investigators have come to Spain to shoot a documentary on the war sympathetic to the Republican cause, but find themselves trapped in the Siege of Madrid. One of their team goes missing, and their literary colleagues say it&amp;rsquo;s pointless &amp;ndash; even dangerous &amp;ndash; to ask what happened to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a war of competing ideologies, unorthodoxy can merit the death penalty, even amongst those opposing Fascism, but is this Communist oppression or something more sinister?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players need have no knowledge of the Spanish Civil War to experience this adventure &amp;ndash; their Investigators can be naive idealists, and Keepers can be confident that the text explains historical background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dare you negotiate steely-eyed Communist ideologues, blood-thirst fascists and the horrors of an inhuman cult to rescue a friend?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
