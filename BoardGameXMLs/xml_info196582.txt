							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hierophant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fanatic determined to reshape the world&amp;hellip; The Hierophant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 16 Rogue, The Hierophant is an emissary from a mysterious force dedicated to transforming the universe. The Hierophant is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hierophant&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;quot;Black&amp;quot; to reflect his strange, occult origins. Once upon a time, he was a mortal man who lost his way and searched for answers to the deepest questions. Now he believes he knows the truth, and seeks to spread the word of Ex Machina wherever he goes. Whether he is mad, or truly empowered by some supernatural entity has yet to be determined, but there is no mistaking his power. Included in his writeup is his mechanical minion, Cog, a steam-powered menace in its own right. A truly potent presence, The Hierophant has already left his mark upon Beacon City. It&amp;rsquo;s up to your heroes to keep him from transforming the rest of the world into a reflection of his uncompromising vision!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
