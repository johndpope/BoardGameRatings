			<description>ExSpelled : A magical paper craft game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Kickstarter page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're all incoming freshmen at Whimberly's College of the Magical Arts &amp;ndash; a magic school located in the center of a mana desert. It's pretty terrible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...but you don't have much of a choice. You didn't get accepted to any of the more prestigious magic schools &amp;ndash; the quill didn't write down your name, you weren't endowed with amazing mutations, you're not exactly what the magic elite want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that doesn't mean you can't attend magic school. Magic is for everyone...right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a book that transforms into a creative tabletop game for 2-6 players. As you progress through the book, you will create your characters, color them, and customize them. Your characters will face many dangers, brave challenges, and make many decisions that permanently affect the story. You'll use a decision card to track the choices you make as the story moves forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
