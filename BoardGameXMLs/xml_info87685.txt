							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flesh Feast</name>
									
			<description>Flesh Feast is a third-person action game with the in-game camera showing a top-down perspective in most instances. The game's plot concerns a secret ingredient invented by the food company Nutrition Applied Science and Technology Inc. (NASAT), which has been released and has infected the entire island's water supply. The citizens are dying and rising as flesh-hungry zombies, buried dead break through the ground to attack the living. The player proceeds through fourteen levels controlling three teams of characters, each team consists of one main character and two sub-characters. Throughout play hordes of zombies attack the player and must be repelled with weapons which are found throughout levels, a radar display shows the location of items relative to the characters. The objective is to unlock the final showdown at NASAT headquarters by completing each of the game's levels, containing the disaster.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh_Feast_%28video_game%29,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh_Feast_%28video_game%29,&amp;q...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
