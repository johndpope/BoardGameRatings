							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saboten Bombers</name>
									
			<description>Saboten Bomber is an arcade game that was only released in Japan on horizontal (two player systems) arcade systems in 1992 by Tecmo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control a cactus and throw bombs at the enemies. They can speed up their character by jumping into the bombs. The enemies are stars at the start but later in the game there are something that look like flower pots and many other comedic enemies. There are over fifty levels and there is also a &amp;quot;versus&amp;quot; mode. After completing five levels with another player you are put against each other and the only way to win is to blow up the other player. When an enemy is defeated it leaves behind collectibles. One collectible that is most important is cake because it awards an extra life if the player collects enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Saboten Bombers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
