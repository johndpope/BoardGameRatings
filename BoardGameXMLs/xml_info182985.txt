			<description>Dice-based combat with tile-based resource gathering. Spend resources to expand your armies, upgrade soldiers, or climb the tech tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to capture 20 enemy soldiers. The first player to do this wins. However, if all of one player's soldiers have been captured (they have no more on the board or in their reserve pile), then the player who has the highest number of enemy soldiers captured wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of hexagon-shaped tiles set up in a large hexagon shape. These tiles consist of six different kinds of resource tiles as well as a base tile in the middle of the board and at each of the six corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players move soldiers from tile to tile, they leave behind Possession Markers to claim those tiles as part of their territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you expand too far away from a base tile, another player could move in behind you, separating your territory from a base tile and capturing your soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you may collect one resource card for each soldier you have on the board - corresponding with the resource tiles they occupy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can trade resource cards with other players regardless of whether or not they are your ally. Your resource cards can be spent on a wide variety of items to help you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
