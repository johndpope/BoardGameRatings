							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Catowl</name>
									
			<description>Cats and owls are witches&amp;rsquo; favorite animals. The poor things are subjected to magic experiments so often that sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to say whether it&amp;rsquo;s a cat or an owl. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s figure out who is who!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing this incredibly designed game, kids learn to determine quantities in a split second, without the need for recount. The game process exercises attentiveness, concentration and speedy response, and&lt;br/&gt;also trains memory. The box effectively contains three games, allowing players to practice different skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has several levels of difficulty for the kids of different ages. Cards, dice and totems are bright&lt;br/&gt;and unusual, and the kids love them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
