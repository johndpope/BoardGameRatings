							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">EverQuest: The Legacy of Ykesha</name>
									
			<description>EverQuest: The Legacy of Ykesha (also known as LoY or Ykesha) was the fifth expansion pack and only extension pack for the EverQuest MMORPG. Promoted by Sony Online as EverQuest's &amp;quot;first download-only extension&amp;quot;, it was the first EverQuest content expansion available almost exclusively from Sony Online's direct purchase and download service. Due to overwhelming demand, a limited number of CDs were made available to retailers after the product release date. Ykesha was released in February 2003 and was considered a minor content addition at the time. Over time, Ykesha's &amp;quot;extension&amp;quot; designation was lost and the product is now referred to as a full fledged EverQuest expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legacy of Ykesha introduced the froglok (the frog-like humanoid race present since the original EverQuest was released) as a playable race. To do this, Sony Online Entertainment introduced a storyline whereby the frogloks invaded the Troll city of Grobb and reclaimed and renamed it Gukta. The trolls were sent fleeing to the city of Neriak. Another part of the storyline introduced the Broken Skull Clan of the trolls, which had a rivalry with the Grobb trolls, and live on the island of Broken Skull Rock just off the south coast of Antonica. This is where the new zones of the expansion are located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other enhancements of the expansion included dyeable armor, an increase in the number of bank slots available for characters, a new guild management system, a new armor slot called 'Charms', and a new overhead mapping system which allowed players to customize maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zones were intended for mid-level adventurers between levels 36-60 and were generally received as very uninspired and added little to the lore of Norrath, however the guild management, extra bank slots, trading between characters utility and mapping tools are considered vital, and dyeing of armor is very popular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;EverQuest: The Legacy of Ykesha&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
