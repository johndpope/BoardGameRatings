							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reiner Knizia&#039;s High Society</name>
									
			<description>From RPGnet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Society is a card-based auction game of great deals and careful brinkmanship based on the tabletop eurogame by Reiner Knizia. Every player starts the game with the same amount of money to spend on luxuries and recognitions, but whoever spends the most money loses, no matter what they collected!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Society is based on the same MobileEuroCard gaming engine that was used in Reiner Knizia's Money, also produced by RPGnet. Simple gestures allow you to examine your own hand and the bids of your opponents. Additionally, four different AIs, each with their own personality, help make every game unique. High Society is the second release in RPGnet's MobileEuroCard series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
