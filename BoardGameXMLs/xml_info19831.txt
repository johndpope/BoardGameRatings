							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fraggle Rock Doozer Construction Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of this English Fraggle Rock game is to be the first player or team to complete their construction by reaching the solid yellow square between the red arrows.  The game consists of a 15 by 15 inch game board, 170 Doozer Building Cards, 1 dice and dice cup and 21 directions cards. The illustrations on the box, board and directions cards are very nice and are done by an artist that did other Fraggle items such as the UK Fraggle Rock annuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
