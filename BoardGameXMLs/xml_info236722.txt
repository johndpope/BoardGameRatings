							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thieves&#039; Gambit (Round 2)</name>
									
			<description>A Three-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latest round of alliance negotiations were to have been held in Selgaunt. Arrangements were made to have the player characters escort the Ordulin guildmaster to Selgaunt for these talks. The escorting party was overly powerful for such a mission, but both guildmasters feared treachery within the guilds and chose the members of the party for their ability, prowess and loyalty. The mission went smoothly and the characters passed every test presented to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This round was distributed as two separate files in the obsolescent WP5 format:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        10-page scenario&lt;br/&gt;        19-page pre-generated characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
