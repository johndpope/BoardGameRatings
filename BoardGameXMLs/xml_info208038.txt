							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mibibli&#039;s Quest</name>
									
			<description>Mibibli's Quest is a retro-style surrealistic platformer game. Join everybody's favorite poorly-drawn 8-bit character, Mibibli, as it blasts his way through over 20 crazy and eclectic levels designed to challenge even the fiercest wayward retro warrior. Conquer caves, dance through raves, wander the suburbs, and blow up eggs... travel through time and explore your nightmares along the way! Collect power ups and find the secrets that are scattered throughout this world. Each level has it's own collection of enemies, unique gimmicks, and bizarre characters to meet. Pay heed to their quizzical insights and use it to demolish bosses and ultimately defeat Mibibli's arch-nemesis, Crocodibli!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique, colourful, and eccentric game has been described as &amp;quot;Mega Man&amp;quot; meets &amp;quot;Space Funeral.&amp;quot; The soundtrack was inspired by catchy retro NES tunes, but is interspersed by instrumental oddities. Submersive and subversive, it is truly a gaming experience that will leave a lasting impression on your mind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- over 7 bits &lt;br/&gt;- realistic graphics &lt;br/&gt;- sounds AND music     &lt;br/&gt;- grammar errors &lt;br/&gt;- a story that will make you cry &lt;br/&gt;- gameplay that will make you cry&lt;br/&gt;- Mibibli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
