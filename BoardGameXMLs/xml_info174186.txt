							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Distant Vistas</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an impressionable teenager I always loved the glossy hardback sci-fi books that seemed to abound in those days, telling of 'future histories' and featuring page after page of gorgeous airbrushed art work. Distant Vistas is a game resource in that style: science fiction told as fact, with plenty of illustrations thrown in the mix. The Sector described is far too large to describe in full - rather, Distant Vistas gives a flavour of it, with selected planets, cities, alien species, weapons and spacecraft described in detail... not to mention sports, culture, politics, religion and useful gadgets! I very much hope that Distant Vistas will be of use to sci-fi RPG GMs - that maybe the Player Characters in your next game will get to fire the I-47's plasma cannons in anger, or will sit down with a Kree for a game of Karanj (they should do well: very wise, the Kree, but terrible bluffers...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
