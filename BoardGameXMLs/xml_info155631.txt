			<description>Each player gets 3 meeples, which he has to get across the board to his finish spaces, which are also the starting spaces of another player. In his turn each player can move 1 meeple 1 space in any direction. No meeple can jump over another, so they get blocked a lot. The colored spaces on the game board may only be occupied by meeples of the same color. The first player to get all 3 meeples to the finish spaces, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was likely published in the 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
