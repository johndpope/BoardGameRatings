							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fall of the Goblin Empire</name>
									
			<description>User Discription&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fall of the Goblin Empire is a set of miniatures fantasy air wargames rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules background are about after the Goblin Empire which has fallen and now the Goblins have retreated to their floating isles. They defend their islands against their enemies (other goblin tribes and races) with their flying craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player have at least one flying vehicle crewed by a number of characters (mainly goblins), through there are rules for actions on the ground.  Each turn Characters must crew their craft, but those who not crewing can perform other actions like entering combat or shooting at their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are background based so a scenario will need to be devised before play with victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules suggest miniature scale is 25/28mm (Through I can see that 15mm could be used) and a number of six sided and one eight sided dice are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fall of the Goblin Empire was published in the Ragnarok magazine, issue 59, which won the 2011 SFSFW rules writing competition on fantasy air wargamming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
