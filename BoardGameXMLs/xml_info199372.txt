							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Retro Rocket Rally</name>
									
			<description>Players race their vintage rocket ships through a random and mostly unexplored galaxy, encountering asteroids, UFOs, wormholes and more as they collect Star bucks to buy fuel and rocket parts. The first one to collect 3 Flags is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deck of space cards is drawn dealt out in a conveyor belt system that creates the board as you play. Players must ration their money and fuel cards to avoid calamity. Ship upgrades can be purchased to give them an edge over their opponents. The game is random enough to be challenging without being dependent on the whim of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A light racing and hand management game intended to fill a sweet spot between Sorry! and Merchants of Venus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
