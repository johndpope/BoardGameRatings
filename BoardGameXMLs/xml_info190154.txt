			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penchant for Adventure &amp;ndash; 4 is the solo adventure for a 4th level character. This scenario can be used for the PC to obtain a &amp;lsquo;special&amp;rsquo; item that they want. Originally used for a paladin to get his warhorse, the adventure can be tailored to suit the needs/wants of a specific PC. Like all the Penchant for Adventure settings the adventure takes place around the small community of Penchant. Not all of the businesses are in focus for the adventure although details can be feathered in as you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure centers on a mysterious dream that the PC has about getting their special item. As the PC arrives in Penchant they realize they have seen the setting before&amp;hellip;in their mysterious dream! Several challenges await at the adventurer attempts to locate their goal. As with all adventures in the Penchant series it can be difficult and not for the faint of heart!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a mid-level solo adventurer and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
