			<description>Key Points:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noir Atmosphere - Let yourself be swallowed up by the atmosphere of a murky night in the New York of the 30s, among rain, skyscrapers and Jazz music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-linear gameplay -Live the present, but don`t forget about the past. Experience it again through flashbacks and piece the course of events together or, if you are able...change it.&lt;br/&gt;Innovative thinking mode - Gather info, verify and link it in order to find out the truth... or at least use it to your own advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3D inventory -Use the 3D Inventory, examine objects and find out by yourself which are the details worth lingering over.&lt;br/&gt;Fully interactive puzzles - Use your mouse as if it were your hand: rotate, move and interact directly with objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore New York -Get drunk in Lower East Side`s pubs, stride along the back lanes of Harlem`s streets, get lost in the abandoned docks of Brooklyn, visit the Upper East Side, Central Park, Hoboken e several other places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters -Talk to the more than 20 characters you are going to meet. But don`t trust anybody. Honesty is a luxury that few can afford in this city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
