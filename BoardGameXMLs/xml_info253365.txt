							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Boat</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The river running through the city of Ryville is navigable all the way to the sea, and originates in a large lake to the west called Lake Greenbow. The lake was once a significant tourist draw, being picaresque and close to Ryville. Since the Event, travel along the land is difficult, but the water remains mainly free of growth, only the areas close to the shore showing the explosion of greenery in the form of kelp forests that characterize the post-Event world. The community of the Boat as they call it dwell on the lake, their vessel anchored off-shore near the center of the water. A refuge from the dangers and difficulties of the Sea of Leaves, the Boat is unfortunately manned by a hostile crew who see Drifters as competition, not potential allies, and who don&amp;rsquo;t welcome guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boat is a mini-supplement for Summerland 2nd edition, the roleplaying game of Desolation and redemption within the Sea of Leaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
