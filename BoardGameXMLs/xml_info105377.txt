			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the adventure by choosing your character&amp;rsquo;s gender, his characteristics, and how much money to start out with - even the type of pet! This is a &amp;quot;point-and-click&amp;quot; adventure game. All the selections you make in the beginning of the game have an impact on how the game is played out from start to finish.&lt;br/&gt;You are young, you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a job, and you have always dreamed of becoming a Private Investigator. You were born in a small town in California called Gillibel, and as a Private Investigator wanna-be, your hope is to get hired by one of the many investigative agencies in California, possibly in San Francisco. In the beginning, things don&amp;rsquo;t go exactly as planned. Your local employment office in Gillibel doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem very interested in helping you - But, just when you&amp;rsquo;ve almost lost your hope, you unexpectedly get lucky! The very famous investigative agency &amp;quot;Copper &amp;amp; McIntosh&amp;quot; in San Francisco is looking for a new PI to hire. A once in a lifetime opportunity - not to be missed!&lt;br/&gt;The game contains mystery, magic and humor along with puzzle-solving. The static, hand-drawn graphics appear in a slide-show fashion, but react to what you do in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
