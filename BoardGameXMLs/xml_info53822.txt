			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mountains move hundreds of miles overnight!&lt;br/&gt;Fez placed in mortal danger!&lt;br/&gt;Sentient bed chased by metal-eating monster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amidst an already-strange world which has been turned inside-out, Fez, the Wizard of Time Travel, faces the ultimate choice: cease to exist and set the universe right, or seek his long-lost daughter and allow the universe to destroy itself.  You are Fez's only hope for survival!  Only by fulfilling a set of ancient prophecies can you enable the wizard to remain alive and be united with his child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fez VI: Wizard's Dilemma is the sixth and final chapter in the unique and popular Fez series, which places you in situations never before experienced by fantasy role-players.  In a universe where anything is possible, you can meet talking mice, appear on a game show, be harassed by a smart aleck minah bird, and even serve on a jury while one of the Fez authors appears as a gorilla and is brought to trial!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
