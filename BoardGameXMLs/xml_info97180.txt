							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Tower of the Witchlight Fens</name>
									
			<description>User description:&lt;br/&gt;This is a solo adventure which can be downloaded from the web using the code contained in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Starter Set. Although the adventure says &amp;quot;Dungeon 182&amp;quot; on the bottom, it was not part of that Magazine. Dungeon 182 does contains a sequel adventure titled &amp;quot;The Dungeon of the Ghost Tower&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the first page:&lt;br/&gt;You set out to recover the stolen case. You tracked the goblins to their lair and found the courage to face them in battle. Whether you were victorious or found defeat, you knew that if you pressed on alone, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t return with the prize you were sent to recover. So you withdrew and walked the long road back to civilization. During that trek, you determined to find stalwart adventurers who would lend cold steel and deadly spells to your cause. Surely in Fallcrest you&amp;rsquo;d find the allies you need. But then, you never know what you&amp;rsquo;ll come across on the road home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
