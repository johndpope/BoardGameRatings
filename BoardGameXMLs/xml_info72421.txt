			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In issue #5 of the Traveller's Aide series, we bring you a full-length Traveller adventure as well as a beta-preview of the upcoming Psionicist prestige class for T20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been considerable public (and not so public) speculation over the motive behind the recent theft of artifacts from the private collection of a wealthy local business family. Some say that it is probably an insurance swindle, others say it is likely the work of another collector trying to enlarge his own collection. The abrupt takeover of the investigation by the Imperial Navy has a few wondering if there might be more behind the theft. Winston Bryon, the current family patriarch doesn't care about the motive; he just wants his family's property returned. Can the Travellers unravel the mystery of the theft and recover the artifacts without running afoul of the Imperial Naval investigation and without running into a terminal dead-end?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
