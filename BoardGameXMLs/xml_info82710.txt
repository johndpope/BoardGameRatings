			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Startopia is a wonderful mix of humour and space business simulation. Although it is full of jokes, various popular culture references, colourful characters (voiced with great talent) and emits a general feeling of well-being, its strategic aspect isn't lacking at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the part of a space station manager, who, with the help of the station's computer, learns to furnish an empty space station into a place brimming with unique alien creatures. Each alien race is best in one kind of task, and also has specific needs. You start from a single deck, with simple rooms, and scale up to four decks, including a 'Biodeck', where you can create a &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; environment for your residents, with parts specific to each species. The game features trade, medicine, crime &amp;amp; punishment, expansion, and eventually even battles and a bit of espionage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is perfect for anyone who enjoys management as well as a little bit of space humour in the vein of Douglas Adams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
