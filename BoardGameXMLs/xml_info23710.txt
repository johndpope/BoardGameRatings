			<description>This is one in a series of magnetic games designed to be played on your refrigerator (or file cabinet at work, or any other metallic surface).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a steeple jump horse racing game, with magnetic racetrack and 2D horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The odds vary with each horse, and a spinner is used to determine speed as well as to discover how successfully a horse executed a jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be played face to face, or over the course of time, utilizing a Your turn square.  Take your turn, flip the square so that your opponent's color is on top, signifying that it's his turn, then walk away.  When your opponent sees that he's up, he can stop, play out his turn, flip the square, and go on about his business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This feature justifies the magnetic aspect of the game.  It can be set up indefinitely and be played out as quickly or as slowly as you desire.  This makes it suitable for home or office play when you don't have time to sit down and play an entire game start to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
