			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed for 7th level characters and is for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Text from the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;After traveling through a land of rugged hills, dark forests and deep fjords, you arrive midday in the village of Honningstad. Today the locals are celebrating the Feast of the Dragon and you are welcome to join them. On this day each year the village awaits the return of an envoy sent to deliver a tribute of strong ale and hard-earned gold to the dragon in Fangcrag Keep. It is this tribute that keeps the dragon appeased, and for over 30 years the village has known peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you enjoy the music, dancing, fine food and wonderful spirits, a member of the envoy staggers into the village, battered and bloodied. He says the envoy was attacked by giants and the tribute never reached the keep. Some men fought and were slain, while others were less fortunate. Rayn Brekston, nephew of Dame Margarete Brekston, ruler of these lands, was among those captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men and women take up rusty spears and weathered shields intent to rescue their comrades, but you know these villagers, mostly farmers, brewers and fishermen, are not seasoned warriors and have little hope of success. Will you aid the folk of Honningstad by slaying the giants? If so, the dragon may awake and find his tribute not delivered. He would surely descend upon the village. But if you plan to barter with or slay the dragon, the giants' captives may suffer a horrible end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan well brave adventurers, for the lives of many rest in your capable hands.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scroll of Omens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of this adventure is the Scroll of Omens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning of the adventure, the characters are given two difficult choices and little time to solve either dilemma. As they progress through the adventure, the conditions elsewhere in the world deteriorate. They are continually reminded through the use of omens, making them doubt their choices. This creates wonderful tension and gives a sense of urgency to everything the characters do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure plays perfectly well without the Scroll of Omens and is not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full-Scale Maps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included with the .pdf of the adventure are .jpg maps scaled for use with various virtual tabletop programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
