			<description>BattleBlock Theater is an upcoming co-operative / competitive platformer video game and the third production from developer The Behemoth following Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious character who experiences two emotions at the same time, Hatty (some have nicknamed him &amp;quot;Two-Emotion Man&amp;quot;), has kidnapped the player's friends, and it is up to the player to rescue them through a series of trials. Behemoth wrote this in the official BattleBlock Theater Trailer: &amp;quot;Having shipwrecked on a mysterious island you find yourself both betrayed by your best friend Hatty and captured by the locals. All of this is happening while being forced into deadly performances. This however, is just the start of your problems.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create a character using shapes and different face styles and give them a weapon to use, and control them using a simple control system of running, jumping, punching and firing a weapon. Punching dazes an opponent, while jumping on their head kills them. Players on the same team can stand on each others heads and help their teammates up ledges. Different weapons have different effects, ranging from explosive devices to effect inducing objects. Levels shown featured different types of blocks, including ones that self-destruct and ones with spikes, as well as hazards such as water and laser cannons. Power-ups include wings that allow players to fly around the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;BattleBlock Theater&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
