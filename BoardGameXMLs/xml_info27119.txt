			<description>It's the first day of school, and children are trying to get into the classroom as late as possible so that they will get the seats in the back (farther away from the teacher).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roll-and-move dice game. Each player gets a secret objective card stating the desired seat for each child; at the end of the game, each player scores points only for the kids that are seated according to his/her objective card (the seats in the back being more valuable than the seats in the front).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
