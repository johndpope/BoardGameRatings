			<description>This is a Depression-era game of riddles with 100 numbered cards. Each player takes an equal number of cards face down. On his turn, a player turns over the top card; if he answers correctly, he keeps it; if he can't, other players in order get a crack, and whoever answers the riddle correctly keeps the card. The player with the most cards at game's end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riddles include questions such as: &amp;quot;What would you do if there was a horse in your bathtub? (#85); &amp;quot;If a bowlegged man and a knock-kneed man came along together, what word would they spell? (#77); and &amp;quot;If a goat swallowed a rabbit, what would be the result? (#1).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
