			<description>Build your party of Pok&amp;eacute;mon figures and play against your friends in Pok&amp;eacute;mon Duel, free to download for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices! In Pok&amp;eacute;mon Duel, your objective is to deploy your Pok&amp;eacute;mon figures on the game board and move them to the goal in your opponent's territory. To win the game, you have to reach your goal before your opponent reaches theirs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selecting the six Pok&amp;eacute;mon for your team is an important part of Pok&amp;eacute;mon Duel. Each Pok&amp;eacute;mon figure has different strengths and a set number of steps it can take, so you'll have to plan your moves strategically. Send your Pok&amp;eacute;mon along different routes in a rush to the goal, or block your opponent's Pok&amp;eacute;mon from advancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you get next to one of your foe's Pok&amp;eacute;mon along your route, you'll need to engage in battle to advance. Battles are determined by Attacks on each Pok&amp;eacute;mon's Data Disk&amp;mdash;spin the disk to see which Attack each Pok&amp;eacute;mon will use. Try to Knock Out the opposing Pok&amp;eacute;mon or cause it to move out of your way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to moving your Pok&amp;eacute;mon and battling, you'll also be able to use a plate at the start of your turn. These plates have various effects, including swapping positions of Pok&amp;eacute;mon in play and giving your Pok&amp;eacute;mon various enhancements for that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
