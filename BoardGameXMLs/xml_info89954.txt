							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ten in the Bed</name>
									
			<description>An entertaining number game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a bed card and the remaining cards are shuffled and dealt out 4 to each player.  Players look to see if any of their cards add up to exactly 10 (e.g. 5+5, 2+3+4+1, etc).  If the player has a 10 then they put their cards to bed.  Teddy cards are wild and can count as anything; roll over cards allow you to exchange cards from hand.  Play continues until all the cards have been picked up, and each player counts the number of 10s they have 'put to bed'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
