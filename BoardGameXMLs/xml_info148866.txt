			<description>From the introduction to the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Straight Jacket is a fast, fun card game for 3 or more players &amp;mdash; 4 or 5 is best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Straight Jacket, the players take on the roles of inmates wearing straight jackets and trapped in a padded cell. All of you want to escape, but you&amp;rsquo;re not exactly pragmatic about it. The person with the most points at the end of the games, wriggles from their jacket and escapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck consists of 75 poker-sized cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw up to three cards to form a hand of three, play the lowest value card from their hand of three to their play area, then pass one card each to the left and right of them.  Cards may have instructions which are to be followed when they are played.  Play continues until the draw pile is exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
