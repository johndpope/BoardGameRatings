			<description>&amp;quot;Look, you fools, you're in danger! Can't you see? They're after you! They're after all of us! Our wives, our children, everyone! THEY'RE HERE, ALREADY! YOU'RE NEXT!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quiet and desolate town of Santa Mira is being invaded by alien spores that have drifted through space propelled by the force of light.&lt;br/&gt;People have started to accuse their loved ones of being impostors but are however dismissed for being part of some mass hysteria. But you know better, you've seen the signs.  You know that these people are being replaced with duplicates of themselves, grown from plantlike pods while sleeping. Now it's up to you if these Pod People are not to replace the entire human race before they move on to the next world. If only you knew who to trust and whom not to...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based upon the science fiction novel by Jack Finney. In The Body Snatchers the players are secretly taking on the roles as Pod People and Humans to either fight to absorb the world or to save it from being utterly vanquished. In turns the players will choose one of the characters on the board to move around the city of Santa Mira and perform a number of available actions that are accessible at the different locations. The Pod People seek to infiltrate the city and must do so by secretly assigning Influence cards from their hand to the different locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Humans play in the same fashion but as they will be outnumbered and seek to sabotage the invasion, they must try to assigning as low Influence as they possibly can without raising too much suspicion on their part. If they're not detected and manage to hinder the aliens from influencing more than half of the city within one week they have succeeded. But if the city has been overrun by then the world shall never wake up again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The seed is planted... now terror grows.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
