			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prescience is a two-player, action-based time travel board game. The goal of Prescience (as determined by which scenario you play) may be simple, but things become more complicated each time the players travel back in time to relive the opening of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players always control the most current version of themselves, but they have the opportunity to use their knowledge of the past to interact with their former selves &amp;mdash; or the former versions of their opponent. Through special abilities such as pushes, pulls, and stuns, they can change the course of the previous generations. However, each time they change the past, the effects of that change continue to ripple forward as the game progresses. Players who are able to use their knowledge of the past to their advantage will be victorious in Prescience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
