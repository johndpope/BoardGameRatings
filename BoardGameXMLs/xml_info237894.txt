							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assassin&#039;s Creed: Identity</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The game takes place during the Italian Renaissance and features locations such as the Colosseum in Rome, Firenze, and Monteriggioni, with a Forl&amp;igrave; chapter released separately as a DLC on 18 May 2016.[2]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to the original Assassin's Creed. The player's Assassin can perform parkour by running towards climbable walls, hills, or objects, and will automatically perform parkour upon contact. The Assassin can also blend into various people/structures by either pressing the Action button or running into blendable structures/objects, although the Assassin must be in Alerted status or below to blend. Assassinations are performed by tapping the Action button when a nearby guard has the Hidden Blade icon over his head. During combat, players can attack, block attacks, use skills, or exit the fight. However, some skills cannot be used in combat, and exiting fights has a cooldown. The Assassin starts off at the Anonymous status, in which normal guards ignore him. If the Assassin manages to break hostile guards' lines of sight or is doing suspicious acts, the Assassin enters Alerted status, in which normal guards watch the Assassin closely, but do not do anything. During fights or when running from hostile guards, the Assassin is in Wanted status, in which all guards attack the Assassin on sight. Assassins can lower statuses by either breaking hostile guards' lines of sight for an extended period of time or by blending. However, the Assassin will always be attacked on sight in Restricted Areas, and by some Templar enemies. During combat, the player can also summon hirelings, which depending on class, have a skill and passive upgrade. However, if the player uses the hireling's skill, the hireling can no longer be used for the mission, and passive upgrade is nullified. Players can also use the iconic Eagle Vision and Leap of Faith during missions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_Identity Assassin's Creed Identity]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
