Scores of new double play animations let you turn two faster than you can say 6-4-3. Flash enough leather and you could even win the coveted Rawlings Gold Glove Award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACK IN THE DAY&lt;br/&gt;Take the field classic yards like The Polo Grounds, Forbes Field, and Shibe Park. Play as or against Hall of Fame players featuring signature batting stances and pitching styles for Stan Musail, Willie Stargell, Rollie Fingers, and more. Round out the retro theme with three throwback unis for every MLB team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN&lt;br/&gt;Gold standard gameplay goes deeper to give users what they asked for including: user-controlled leadoffs, power swings, drag bunts, Pitcher Cam, and improved cut-offs and relays.
