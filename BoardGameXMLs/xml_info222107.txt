			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beat Down Wrestling is a family friendly 2 - 4 player game. It features 10 original wrestler cards.Choose your wrestler and battle your opponent. Take turns rolling the &amp;quot;1,2,3&amp;quot; dice and move through the Beat Down Universe. Land on a &amp;quot;Story&amp;quot; space and pick up one of 40 &amp;quot;Story Cards&amp;quot;. A story card may be beneficial or it may be detrimental. You can save some cards, and some cards must be played immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get Into The Ring&lt;br/&gt;If you land on a &amp;quot;Fight&amp;quot; space, you have the option of challenging your opponent to a match. Take turns drawing fight cards until you have an even amount of cards and some one has reached 10 damage points. The winner will pick up a &amp;quot; Winner Card &amp;quot;and the loser will go back to the Start or the Mid-Card Checkpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Win&lt;br/&gt;To win you must enter the ring and consecutively roll a 1,2,3. If you roll a 1 but not a 2 your opponent gets a turn and can still challenge you to a fight. On your next turn you must roll a 2 and then a 3. When you do not roll the consecutive numbers you are vulnerable to be challenged to a fight and lose the progress you have made on the board and in the rolling process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
