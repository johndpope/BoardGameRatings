							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stacked Deck War</name>
									
			<description>For years Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs had the exclusive claim to the game commonly known as `War'. In the world of playing cards, all was well. One day Suns, along with Moons, Crowns and Arms decided they wanted to take the game of `War' for their own. The playing card clan grew angry at the piecepackian army. With all rational reasoning and compromises ignored, the two rivals soon decided to stack their decks and play the ultimate game of war, for rights of the game of `War'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was an entry to the Mesomorph 1 Piecepack Contest, and is designed for a standard piecepack and the playing cards expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
