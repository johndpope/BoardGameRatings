			<description>Rules of the game Fudbalinho&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETTING THE FORMATION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with the first agreement between the co attacks. Then the coach sets the defense of their players in the &amp;quot;game zone&amp;quot; but so that teammates must not touch.&lt;br/&gt; - When you see a defensive formation, the attack coach asks his players to &amp;quot;play zone&amp;quot; but they are not allowed to touch each other.&lt;br/&gt; - Grid - teammates are, setting the formation or reorganization thereof, must not touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;START OF THE MATCH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ball is at the very beginning of the match, is the &amp;quot;goal area&amp;quot;, where the attack begins.&lt;br/&gt; - Simultaneity - in one move, and attack and defense can move the two players. The moves are played by, the defense coach writes his move on the paper (the number of players who move and index fields in which the player moves) and, only after the attacker on board their moves, defensive coach illustrates what is written.&lt;br/&gt; - If defensive coach read intention of the attacker and put his players in the path of movement of the ball, it belongs to a player who had intercepted and the defense moved to stage attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATTACK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Dribbling - moving the player with the ball for a field. It is usually used in combination with the movement of another one of his teammates.&lt;br/&gt;- Short pass - The longest short pass is two fields and it can be added along the line that goes from the vertex of a field from which threads are added to the next adjacent field. &lt;br/&gt;- Long pass - it only adds to the field where the player is (the place), on any field in the &amp;quot;game zone&amp;quot; which is not in contact with the &amp;quot;line out&amp;quot;. If, over the fields to which is added to the ball, no defensive player, the pass is successful. If the defensive player finds himself in a field environment to which is added, the ball belongs to the defender, long pass is imprecise. Long ball passing levels can not turn back.&lt;br/&gt;- Receiving the ball (Zidane) - Any player who receives the short pass,can move one field with the ball.&lt;br/&gt;- Empty space - The ball can be added (short or long passing) the exact area where the other player or standing next to a field, and with run player receives the ball (after which it is entitled to move to another area, with the ball, if it is short pass, Zidane).&lt;br/&gt;- Return the pass - The level of the ball, only once during the attack, may move the gear (ball usually has to go forward).&lt;br/&gt;- Construction of positions - To be a player kicked, or center the added debt on the pass must first be moved from his position dribbling.&lt;br/&gt;- Play - The ball in the turn, must not stay on same place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
