			<description>&amp;quot;Play with us the game of European Traffic Regulations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange educational board game where the player attempts to answer questions on European Traffic Regulations (!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game components are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a small battery powered electrical component with a light at one end and a wire with a small metal plug at the end&lt;br/&gt;- 17 double sided cards with questions about European Traffic Regulations. The multiple choice answers are printed on the cards next to strategically punched holes in the card&lt;br/&gt;- a metal covered connecting circuit piece&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, a battery in inserted into the electrical component, and a question sheet is placed in the box on top of the metal covered circuit piece.&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to ask a question, and the player attempting to answer the question connects the plug at the end of the electrical component into the relevant punched hole on the answer sheet.&lt;br/&gt;If they select the right punched hole (and therefore the right answer), the plug will touch the metal covered circuit piece, forming a complete circuit, and the light at the end of the electrical component will come on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limited gameplay - more of a curiosity item than anything else - and best described as the unwanted love child of Trivial Pursuits and Operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced by Trotty-Lux, and is printed in German and English, indicating that the manufacturer was German.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advertised as suitable for players 8-80 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
