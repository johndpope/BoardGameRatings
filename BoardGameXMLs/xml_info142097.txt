			<description>In IT's All In The Game you try to place your consultants at the best positions with ongoing projects. The better you do this, the more points you score each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile you have to keep an eye on the deadlines. And try to stop other players from making you lose your consultants for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every playing round exists of more action rounds. At the start of each playing round you receive 2 senior consultants (playing cards). In your turn you can perform 1 action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions:&lt;br/&gt;- Place 1 consultant with a project&lt;br/&gt;- Move 1 consultant from a project to another project.&lt;br/&gt;- Pay 2 points and a consultant. Choose another consultant (without the other players seeing which one).&lt;br/&gt;- Pay 2 points and a consultant. 'Upgrade' this consultant to a principal of the same color. Show other players this principal.&lt;br/&gt;- Pay 6. Same action as above, but withouth showing any card to the other players.&lt;br/&gt;- Pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A project has 5 phases. Consultants have to be placed first at the 1st phase. Only then can a consultant be placed with the second phase. And so on.&lt;br/&gt;The last or the last two consultants always have to be principals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a project is finished (that is consultant for phase 5 has been played) it is scored, the project and the consultants are put at the discard pile. A new project is then placed on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all players have passed, the playing round is over and points are scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every project is scored. Points being awarded 6/4/2/1 (later 10/6/4/2). The further towards the end of the project a consultant lies, the more points it generates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After scoring all cards remain with the projects. Players can therefore score multiple times for the same consultant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IT's All In The Game in a few words: &lt;br/&gt;- Lots of interaction. &lt;br/&gt;- Tactical choices. &lt;br/&gt;- Basic game with two expansions. &lt;br/&gt;- Unexpected depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For now it is only available with Dutch game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
