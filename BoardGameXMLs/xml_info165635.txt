			<description>More or Less 2 is the sequel to More or Less. While the latter game is most suited for a large number of players, More or Less 2 is designed as a game for up to four players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More or Less 2 is a quiz game in which players have to answer (numerical) questions. The player whose guess come closest to the actual answers gains a point. But there is a catch! For each question, it is determined whether only guesses that are higher than the actual answer will count (more), or only guesses that are lower (less).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to gain five points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
