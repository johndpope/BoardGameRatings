			<description>BACKGROUND: The Falklands Ablaze is a solitaire semi-historical simulation of the Falklands War (May &amp;ndash; June 1982). The Game begins shortly after the Argentinians capture the Port City of Stanley after a surprise attack. The British have mustered their Task Forces and have arrived just of the northern coast of the Falkland Islands. The British must now establish a Beach Head and advance their forces towards Port Stanley to defeat the Argentinian Forces and liberate the British Settlers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of the British Naval and Land Forces, you must gather your forces and naval squadrons to capture Port Stanley, Port Stanley Airfield and 10 other Argentine controlled Settlements before the Campaign Deck is depleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: The Falklands Ablaze contains many colorful counters including ground forces, ships and aircraft. The Game includes rules for Ground, Sea and Air Combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Falklands Ablaze can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
