							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Pack 12: Cactus Canyon and Central Park</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack adds recreations of two pinball tables to Pinball Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cactus Canyon was released in 1998 by Bally and has a Western theme. The playfield includes two model pistols, a goldmine and a desperado with a hat which can be shot off! This was the last conventional Bally pinball machine and less than 1000 were produced. The main aim is to activate High Noon mode by completing five tasks as the town Marshall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central Park was released in 1966 by Gottlieb and is set in the famous New York park. It features an animated monkey on the backglass which rings a bell for every 100 points scored. As an early table it has just two small flippers with a large gap between them. As such, nudging the table was an essential tactic. The main objective of this game is to increase the yellow and green target score values. This increases the value scored by hitting other targets on the playfield. Increasing the yellow or green targets to the maximum awards a Special (extra ball).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
