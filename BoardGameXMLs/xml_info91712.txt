			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backyard Baseball 2007 is another in the Backyard Baseball series in which children can create and manage their own baseball team while challenging computer-made teams of various skill levels. &lt;br/&gt;Backyard Baseball 2007 follows the other Backyard Baseball games in style and gameplay, including MLB players in their cartoony child form and allowing a host of powerups and trick plays that compliment the game type.  The game includes sixteen Major League Baseball players and all 30 MLB teams are represented, as well as ten fantasy teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
