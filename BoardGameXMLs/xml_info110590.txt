			<description>Thankfully Flying Cheese does not challenge players to shoot cheese into one another's mouths &amp;ndash; but you will be launching &amp;quot;cheese&amp;quot; skyward to try to land it in your mouse home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round starts with players laying their home tiles (4, 6 or 8 depending on the number of players) and 1-2 cat tiles one by one in the 25 slots in the game tray. The center is reserved for a 2-4 point tile, depending on the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once everyone has placed their home and cat tiles, players take turns launching the cheese dice into the tray using their spoon-shaped catapults. Players have two chances to try to land a cheese die in the tray. If they land on a home tile, the owner of that tile earns one point immediately. Landing on a cat costs the player one point, while hitting the center tile earns 2-4 points. Land off the board or in an empty slot, and you get nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all twelve cheese dice have been launched, tally the face-up dots on each player's home tiles; each die has three blank faces and 1-2 dots on the other faces. The player with the largest total earns two additional points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying Cheese lasts three rounds, and the player with the most points after three rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
