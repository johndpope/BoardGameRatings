							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space-mission: Zanathar</name>
									
			<description>A roll-and-move race to the finish for two players, Space-mission: Zanathar incorporates two types of pieces for each player and luck-based battles on the way to the central goal of &amp;quot;Zanathar,&amp;quot; where the first player to land his Command ship and two Star ships will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has one Command ship and eight Star Ships. The board has each player entering from a different side and spiraling from one numbered base to another toward the central goal. What moves each player makes depends on the roll of a die. Moves include continuing forward towards the goal, combat with one of the opponent's pieces, starting over at the beginning, or overshooting the goal and re-orbiting nearby for another attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
