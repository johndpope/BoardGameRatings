							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Basket of Deplorables: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a light-hearted, humor-filled, liberal-leaning game about the state of politics from 2016 to 2020. The good guys (player pieces) are Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. They're vying to take on Trump in 2020 and filling their Basket of Deplorables along the way. The Deplorables in this game are not meant to be an insult to Trump supporters, rather they are ghoulish caricatures of people in the Trump inner circle, i.e. Steve Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Vladimir Putin, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players navigate the campaign trail and participate in debates, compete in primaries/caucuses, navigate scandals, seek endorsements, confer with pollsters, decide whether to run as an independent, etc. Deplorables can be drained from The Swamp and placed in each player's Basket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
