							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shell Roleplaying System</name>
									
			<description>Form the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the skeleton of a FRPG system.  It is just the rules;  not the world, or the campaign, or even the equipment charts or anything.  To flesh this system out into a playable game, one must first provide the genre, which is a list of equipment and their stats, monetary systems, spells and how they are learned, character advantages and disadvantages, and available skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Primary Attributes (Strength, Agility, and Intelligence) as well as some derived Primary Attributes (Encumbrance, Damage, and Attack/Defense).  Characters also have Secondary Attributes (Health, Hit Points, Endurance, Willpower, Charisma, and Perception).  Characters may have additional Secondary Attributes depending on their race.  Characters also may have Skills which are placed in Skill Groups.  Resolution of all actions consists of a die roll plus modifier compared to a target number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
