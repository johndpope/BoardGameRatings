			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon stopped along the bamboo trail as the four well armed men stepped out of the brush to either side of the trail.  &amp;ldquo;We will require a toll for you to walk on our trail,&amp;rdquo; Offered the lead bandit, a nasty smile on his face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Course a woman as pertly as you might have to pay with more then coins,&amp;rdquo; He smirked to his friends.  As the bandit turned his head back towards the Dragon, She lashed out with a mighty kick, knocking his head clean off his shoulders.  The other three bandits screamed in fright as the warrior called the Dragon smiled her own grin and moved on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Warriors of the Four Circles, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions.  Taking the S&amp;amp;G skirmish game system and add to it super Kung-Fu masters and martial arts experts and you have a great action game of flying kicks and mighty blows. Warriors of the Four Circles is a great mix of martial art action and elemental magic, all creating the wild world of a mighty battles and high suspense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
