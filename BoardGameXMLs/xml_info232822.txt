			<description>From the box - &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The CLASSIC GAME of BATTLEFIELD STRATEGY&lt;br/&gt;ON A DISTANT PLANET, TWO ARMIES CLASH. WHO WILL BE VICTORIOUS?&lt;br/&gt;You command an army of soldiers, machines, scouts and miners. &lt;br/&gt;Devise a plan and deploy your troops. Use strategic attack and clever deception to break through your opponent's line, but beware of bombs and enemy spies. Capture the flag, and victory is yours!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players position their game pieces on a chess-like board but in a configuration unknown to each other: token values can only be seen from one side. &lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player moves a token horizontally or vertically. If the token lands on a square occupied by the enemy, the two tokens are revealed and their values compared. If a special power doesn't come into play, the lowest value is taken off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, a player must discover the opponent's flag piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stratego Spin Master 50th Anniversary Edition plays similar to classic Stratego with some slight rule variations and a sci-fi/futuristic theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version is played on a 10x8 with 30 pieces on each team versus the traditional 10x10 grid with 40 pieces to each side. The Stratego Spin Master 50th Anniversary Edition uses the alternate highest to lowest numbering system for it's pieces, 10 as the Marshal, 2 as the Scout and 1 as the Spotter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition introduces 2 &amp;quot;Spotter&amp;quot; pieces to each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Spotters target and identify the enemy calling in laser barrages from orbiting battleships to destroy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spotter Special Attack: Spotters may move, then use their special attack. A Spotter may attempt to attack and capture any piece on the square in front of it by guessing the piece's rank. Tell you opponent that you are 'Spotting' the piece, then guess. Your opponent must reveal the piece's rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your guess is correct, that piece is captured. The Spotter does not move to the captured piece's square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your guess is not correct, nothing happens. But your Spotter is revealed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Spotters can 'spot' and capture Bombs and the Flag.&lt;br/&gt;Spotters may attack normally instead of Spotting.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple strategy for the Spotter is placing him behind a crater. When an enemy attacks down one of the Corridor lanes their piece is revealed. If they capture your piece and move forward, the Spotter can then flank them from the side 'guessing' their rank with complete certainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
