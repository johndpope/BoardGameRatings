			<description>Basically the game is very similar to the much better known game Pachisi. Each player is trying to move his pigs from his starting position around a race track and get them to the brick yard, which is &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some differences to the regular Pachisi game. There are only four safe spaces marked on the board. Also there are special spaces which tell a player to advance or to go back a certain number of spaces. Also there are only three pigs, not four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
