							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mystic Godling</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mortal with the blood of a god flowing through her veins&amp;mdash;a hero with one foot in the world of man and the other in the realm of the divine. This concept was explored in the best-selling Genius Guide to the Godling, but that material hardly exhausted the subject. The godlings in that first volume focused on flesh and blood, brawn and brains, striding the world as paragons of human endeavors. They did not, however, touch on the idea of godlings whose affinities lie closer to the mystical world&amp;mdash;channeling their connections to divinity into magical effects that no mortal spellcaster could ever equal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Genius Guide to Mystic Godlings expands the concept of semi-divine characters to include those whose godly heritage manifests itself through magics and spellcasting. These godlings do not fit as readily into the ordinary world. Mortals can sense the power they wield and sometimes find it unsettling. Even the godlings themselves have an uneasy relationship with their own powers&amp;mdash;some finding their earthly bodies barely up to the task of containing so much raw energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents two new godling base classes, mystical counterparts to the ones from the previous book. It also contains a collection of godling spells&amp;mdash;magic so tightly bound to the gods that only those with divine blood can wield it. In addition, there are also new godling feats, divine traits, and scion talents that can be used with these classes or the previously published mighty and clever godlings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Genius Guide to Mystic Godlings stands on its own, containing everything you need to create semi-divine spellcasting heroes for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. When used in conjunction with the original Genius Guide to Godlings, though, your players can create an entire pantheon of godlings, ready to prove their worth in the mortal world and then take their place among the gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
