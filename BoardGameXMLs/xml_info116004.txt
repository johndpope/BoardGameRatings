			<description>Bleach: Blade Battlers (ＢＬＥＡＣＨ　～ブレイド・バトラーズ～) is a fighting game released only in Japan on the manga and anime Bleach by Tite Kubo. The games became best-seller in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of one of many characters from the source material. As with most other fighting games, the idea is to fight the opposing character, or characters in the free-for-all mode, until their health is fully depleted. Players can use their characters' special abilities taken from the series, such as Ichigo Kurosaki's ability to unlock his bankai state or Rukia Kuchiki's control over ice with her zanpakutō. Some of these abilities may alter the arena, such as Rukia's zanpakutō causing the battlefield to become covered in ice and making other players slide around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features extensive battle modes, where you unlock characters after beating all of the challenges. Some missions have you perform under certain circumstances, like a time limit. In both games there is a bonus section where you can view character models and extras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 23 playable characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bleach: Blade Battlers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
