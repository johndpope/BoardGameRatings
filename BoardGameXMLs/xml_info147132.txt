			<description>From the cover page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...StarDate 211327.02...Transmission start 0935 z-hours...&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 2113, and the planet Earth has been changed forever. It was only recently that the inhabitants of Earth learned two stunning discoveries: that we were not alone in the galaxy, and that the galaxy was a merciless frontier. Lives were lost, wars were fought, and billions in credits were spent just so we could prove that we deserved a chance in this &amp;quot;new galactic order&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...From the creation of hyper-fast computers, to developing the research in quantum vortex-space starship design (ooh, sounds fancy!). Some of the races encountered along the way were willing to help us gain a foot-hold as the youngest star-faring race. Others were more-than-happy to help us lower our overall population. At any rate, we have undone our shackles that have kept us locked down on Earth. We have begun to explore not only our own solar system, but beyond it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...Welcome to Terra-Xeno: This Alien Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
