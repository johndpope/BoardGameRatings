			<description>Politics is a terrible and scary race to be in. Everyone has scandals, big and small, that they wish wouldn't see the light of day. However, the press always seems to find them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Indictment, players are politicians who are working hard to bury their scandals before the press can find them. Each turn, players play either scandal cards or cover-up cards. A player then chooses which scandal to reveal, hoping the next, bigger scandal is just around the corner to occupy the press. If they can't play a same level (number) of scandal or higher, they have to pick up all the revealed scandals.  If you play the same level (i.e. same number) of scandal as your opponent, they can stack and give you special bonus actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, once you've eliminated of all your hidden scandals, you can finally get to putting those nagging open scandals behind you, knowing you will not be the last one left in the press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no winners in this game of politics, with only the last one left holding onto scandals being indicted and losing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
