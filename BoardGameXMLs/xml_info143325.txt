			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Six Guns is a science-fiction roleplaying supplement using the Traveller rules. Each issue presents six items (not always weapons) in detail, with accompanying notes and stat blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generic versions of most of these items are presented in various game supplements, but there is a significant difference between aiming a generic, vanilla-flavor &amp;lsquo;revolver&amp;rsquo; at the opposition and pulling out a specific model chosen as much for what it says about you as for its capabilities. Not all of the equipment herein is &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; than the generic versions. Indeed, some items have significant drawbacks or are tailored to a specific purpose and poor for other applications. However, what they all have in common is being more interesting than the basic rulebook version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
