			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FaLoR is a generic, universal system with an extremely simple set of rules.  Characters are said to have &amp;quot;Characteristics&amp;quot; that include whatever categories are needed for play, and examples include &amp;quot;Strong&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Super Strong&amp;quot;.  Characteristics do not have numeric ratings--they are either present or absent.  Characters also start with ten Skills--areas in which they stand out from the normal mass of people.  Sample Skills are &amp;quot;Fireball&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;5 lb. Telekinesis&amp;quot;.  Generally speaking, Characters are assumed to be successful in Skill use.  Characters also have Plot Points which may be spent to influence events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During combat or other intense situations Characters must perform actions during Action Rounds.  During Action Rounds, Skills may only be successfully used if the player rolls a good result on 1d12, adjusted by one or two Plausibility Modifier scores.  Results of 7+ are deemed successful, while results of 6 or less are narrated by the opponent.  About half of the brief rules are devoted to rating Plausibility Modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
