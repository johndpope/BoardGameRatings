							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warlock</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warlock is a warrior esper. They apply the strength of their psionic powers to the various battlefields of the Universe, from the largest fleet battles to the smallest of duels. Some do do work as mercenaries, but rarely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They do not like to sell their allegiance so cheaply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warlocks believe only in power. The nature of their belief in power does differ from one Warlock to the next, but their existence is always defined by power and its uses. If a Warlock chooses to serve anyone besides themselves, and that is rare, they do so for loyalty, not for money. But those who can command a Warlock's loyalty must be mighty indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike their Adept cousins, the Warlock does not believe in sealing themselves away in some monastery while contemplating the meaning of the Universe. Nor do they believe in sealing away their emotions. Just the opposite on both accounts. The Warlock believes in engaging with the Universe, usually aggressively, forcing their will upon it. And that will is defined by the strength of their emotions, not the power of their minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full player class usable with Infinite Futures 2.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
