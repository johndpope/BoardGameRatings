			<description>The world needs power and we have learned to travel to and harness the power of the stars. Star Farmers send ships to get as close to stars as possible to gather the most valuable power. The Star Farmers are also racing to gather this power as quickly as possible. Some pilots get too close to the stars and burn up in the process. Who will be the most successful Star Farmer and win the government contract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Star Farmers players are flicking their ships across a flat surface in an attempt to get as close as possible to a set of stars numbered 1 to 5. Players get points for being the closest or second closest at each star. Once any players have scored on each of the 5 stars points are tallied and a winner is declared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition of Star Farmers is included on the back side of the cards in the first edition of Bocce Piatta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
