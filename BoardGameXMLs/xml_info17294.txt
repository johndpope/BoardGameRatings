			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Set about 50,000 years B.C. in an age of hunter gathers, and the last of the strange large mammals, such as Woolly Mammoths, Sabre-tooth Tigers and Giant Birds, the game is a mixture of board games and wargames and was a daunting task to create. It was easy all we had to do was make it simple and quick to play, whilst still blending in a level of complexity that would keep the players interest alive. Well, I am sure that we have succeeded in doing just that. Using a mixture of Metal Miniatures, Resin Buildings and Cards and Counters, there is very little note taking and working out involved as the counters and cards remove this aspect, and the player is free to work on the most important aspect of the game strategy, and this is what the game is really about!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game all the players start with the same amount of pieces and the basic idea of the game is to grow your settlement faster than the other players, buying Figures and Buildings with game tokens as you go along, hopefully avoiding Natural Disasters and other unforeseen incidents.The game can be played by 2 or 4 players and is for Ages 14 and up and is fun for families as well as boardgamers &amp;amp; wargamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great deal of time and effort was put into the design of the game pieces, which are very detailed. The same figures are used for each different tribe, which are just painted differently. Spears &amp;amp; Shields are cast separately, but come with the figures that they are intended for. The rules are well printed complete with a color cover, and are packed with black &amp;amp; white illustrations. The game tokens are printed in color, on white card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To sum up, this was daunting but great fum to create, and to play-test, of which there were many games. There isn't a game like it on the market that I know of, and I know that those who buy a set are going to find it an appealing and tactical game. The more you play the game the faster it becomes and the more you will find that you have learned since the last time you played it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently there are 2 expansions that add Shamans and water taskings:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;The Savage Seas&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;- &amp;quot;Out of the Wilderness&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check more info at the homepage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.sbarber-models.clara.net/html/settlement.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.sbarber-models.clara.net/html/settlement.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or the yahoo group: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/steve_barber_models/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/steve_barber_models/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
