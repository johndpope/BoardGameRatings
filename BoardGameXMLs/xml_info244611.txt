							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Things to Find in a Supermarket</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of 100 base items, with many possible alternatives, that could be found by players looting or investigating a supermarket, convenience store, or other, similar location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the items could be useful in an appropriate situation, such as following a zombie apocalypse. Food, other supplies and some improvised weapons could be found; other items are just clutter. The list can be used to randomly generate supplies, or simply flesh out a location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example results are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;48. Fruit Juice (In cardboard cartons and plastic bottles of different sizes, some refrigerated, of different flavours, including single fruit such as apple, cranberry and orange, or combination, such as orange and passion fruit)&lt;br/&gt;49. Garbage Bags (On a roll, from small bin bags to large garbage bags)&lt;br/&gt;50. Gravy (In granules, stock cubes and liquid, of different flavours such as beef, chicken and onion)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
