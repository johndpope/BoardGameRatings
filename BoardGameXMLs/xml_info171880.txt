			<description>Lost Marbles infuses the gameplay of Marble Madness with the three character puzzle based action of The Lost Vikings to ceate a new 3D experience! You'll start with one marble but before you know it you'll be controlling three marbles at once as the game goes from fairly simply platformer to frantic puzzle game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each marble has a different material and special power; Rubber can Jump, Paper can Shrink, and Metal can Boost. You'll have to combine the strengths of each marble to overcome a multitude of hazards as you race to the end of each level in search of the fastest time. The game is very challenging so don't be fooled by the cute graphics and atmosphere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
