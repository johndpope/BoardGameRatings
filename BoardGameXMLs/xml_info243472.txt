			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still in active development and available to the public for purchase in it's unfinished state, either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a mixture of many things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the game is to create a village simulator that will continue to challenge you. You are the benevolent overseer of the world your people inhabit. Through the management of these you strive to build better tools, defences and a better life for them - or just survive a little longer than last time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It draws on classic 90s era games like Settlers, adds a dose of tower defence and some survival elements. The ambitious goal is to bridge the gap between village management, godgames and RTS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will come with various modes, such as survival, sandbox and peaceful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently the game is in Early Access and has been since 2014. That said, the are updates and the game is still in development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
