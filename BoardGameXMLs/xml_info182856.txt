			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you've managed to survive the threats of the mazes below a few times and your exiles no longer fear what might lie within the next corridor beyond... if that's the case then you need some new hazards! This Exiles Of The Wicked Maze expansion pack provides 20 new hazards that you may use alone or in combination with the hazards provided with the main game rules. From forbidden altars to mechanical menaces to the &amp;ldquo;left behinds&amp;rdquo; of the deceased, this expansion pack has all sorts of nastiness to mess with your characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion for Exiles Of The Wicked Maze includes a new game mechanic called Sacrifice. In this particular product the new rule refers particularly towards dealing with hazards. When a certain hazard has sacrifice as a special disarm/negate option, the character must sacrifice, or rather give up or destroy the item in question in  order to bypass trying the beat the hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
