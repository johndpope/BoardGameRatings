							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wrath of the Demon</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthrax, a court wizard, has summoned the Demon in an attempt to kill the king and seize power over all the lands. But one does not simply command the Demon. Instead of obeying, the Demon killed Anthrax and destroyed the once prosperous kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Months turn into years, and eventually men wandered into the wasteland and a new kingdom arose ruled by another King. All while the Demon continued his sleep, waiting for his powers to restore. Once the Kingdom had risen to as mighty as the previous one, the Demon decided it is time to wreak destruction once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A faery foresaw this and warned the King, and he sent his most loyal messenger to find the noblest knight to destroy the Demon. But the Demon was watching, and sent one of his minions to kill the messenger before he was able to deliver the message. A stranger saw this all happening. He found the royal scroll in messenger's hands and took the message back to the King. This is where your quest begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King instructs you to defend the kingdom, and in return he will give you the hand of the princess in marriage. And so you advance, killing Demon's minions as they cross your way, towards the horizon from where dark clouds are spreading through the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
