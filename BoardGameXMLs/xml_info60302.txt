			<description>This is the Hungarian Go. The aim of the game is to create words in given categories such as geography, history, literature or music. The letters do not have accents so one letter can stand for several Hungarian accented or not accented letters. Before the game begins the players have to agree as to how many points a player has to collect to win the game and how much time is allowed to create a word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
