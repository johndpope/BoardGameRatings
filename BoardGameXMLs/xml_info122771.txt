			<description>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 (also shortened to WWE SvR 2011) is is the seventh game in the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series and the final game under the SmackDown vs. Raw name, with future installments simply being named WWE. It is the sequel to WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 and succeeded by WWE '12. It is also the last installment for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable platforms.  The game is based on the two brands of WWE, Raw and SmackDown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at the player's opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hell in a Cell match was revamped with expanded cell walls, weapons underneath the ring, steel steps near the poles, and the removal of the cell door. In addition, new ways to exit the cell were introduced, such as barreling through the cage wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's new &amp;quot;WWE Universe&amp;quot; mode replaces the career mode from previous games. The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road to WrestleMania mode has been modified to include new features such as backstage roaming, mini-quests, and further interaction with other Superstars. Playable storylines involve Rey Mysterio, John Cena, Christian, and Chris Jericho. Along with that is the new storyline in which players choose Kofi Kingston, John Morrison, Dolph Ziggler, R-Truth, or a created superstar in a quest to end The Undertaker's undefeated WrestleMania streak. Create A Superstar mode now includes pre-loaded attribute points for created superstars, while in Create A Finisher mode, a new finisher position is the &amp;quot;Corner&amp;quot; , in which finishers can be created in corner position (Cannot be used during the Royal Rumble match) . Also attributes such as speed and trajectory can now be modified by single increments rather than 25% increments. The number of available created finishers has been expanded to 130 as well.  Online mode also returns - each new copy of the game contains an Online Pass allowing one user to play the game online for free. Players who rent or purchase the game used will obtain a trial of Online Pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new feature called &amp;quot;Match Creator&amp;quot; allows players to create new match types. In addition, Story Designer mode now has new cutscenes, usable sound clips from announcers and wrestler entrance music, support for up to fifteen created superstars, 'branching' story paths depending on which character won the match and the ability to include championship belts in cutscenes and event triggers based on a wrestler reaching a certain state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
