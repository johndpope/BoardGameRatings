			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sci-Fi Beta Kappa, the first game to be published under the indyhippo imprint, is a light-hearted role-playing game about delinquent aliens sent to 22C Terra under the terms of a treaty that enables us to receive the benefits of powerful Galactic Federation technology in exchange for taking in its low-level miscreants. The characters in the game are denizens of a frat house in Weber College, in New New England, where they get up to all kinds of mischief and are constantly under the watchful eye of the Dean, who hates aliens and is always looking for an excuse to close down Alien House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get into a spot of bother on your homeworld? Don&amp;rsquo;t fancy a spell on the prison planet? No problem, go and do a degree at Weber College, the fustiest, dustiest learning establishment on the East Coast. Eh? Don&amp;rsquo;t like the sound of that? Prison planet it is then. Yeah, thought that&amp;rsquo;d make you change your mind. Next shuttle leaves in ten hours. You&amp;rsquo;d better be on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know much about History? Biology? A science book? Then you&amp;rsquo;ll fit right in to Alien House. It&amp;rsquo;s the coolest, hippest, happening-est frat house on campus, but watch out! Dean &amp;lsquo;Wormhole&amp;rsquo; is on the warpath. He&amp;rsquo;s been trying to have Alien House closed down for years, and now he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s got them just where he wants them. Complete your studies, have a cracking time and save Alien House from closure. Do you think you can manage that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age rating: 16+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
