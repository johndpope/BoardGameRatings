							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bridge Building &amp; Cross Over</name>
									
			<description>A pair of abstract games, made cheaply and aimed at children. Cross Over is a proper game, even adults will like it, but the rules for the Bridge Building game are completely indecipherable. So, I will only describe the Cross Over game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts at opposite corners on the board. The object is to get one piece on to the opponents back corner (marked with an X on the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A die dictates distance of movement and you can only move a piece either horizentally or diagonally. It would appear that you cannot change direction within the move. If you land on an opponent's piece, that piece is removed from the board. If a person has lost pieces and rolls a 6, he can bring on one of the lost pieces but only within his start field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is magnetic with the two boards forming the top and bottom of a case and the pieces can be stored within that case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
