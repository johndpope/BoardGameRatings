			<description>Sholf is a hybrid creation of two classic games. Sholf fuses the accessories of golf with the strategy, competitive play and scoring of table shuffleboard. Played head-to-head, Sholf is wildly addicting and fun for all skill levels. Anyone can play, day or night, indoors or out. Sholf's portability makes it possible to play anywhere, all the time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you know how to play table shuffleboard, then you pretty much know how to play Sholf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Sholf is to putt your golf balls further into the scoring end than your opponent. Point values increase as you get closer to the edge of the playing green. The first player or team of players to 15 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visit the Sholf website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://sholf.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://sholf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
