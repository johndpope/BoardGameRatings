			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sarcosans united the humans of Eredane into a single great nation that befriended all the fey, but their way was ripe with intrigue. Their culture became fertile ground in which the Shadow planted seeds of corruption and dissent. While the other races fought against the coming of the Last Age, most Sarcosan towns simply surrendered to the dark god's armies. The cities of the south are entirely subjugated, the Sarcosans his puppets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or are they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Izrador may have captured the cities and outlawed literacy, but the Sarcosan freeriders still control the vast plains of the south. Their respected sages still pore over the lore of old to find signs of their enemy's weaknesses. In a war where hope is all but vanquished and the future is uncertain, a Sarcosan has only two options: to fight for the hope foretold by the stars, or to give in to the Shadow that lies between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star and Shadow includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A history of the migration and expansion of the Sarcosans.&lt;br/&gt;     A gazetteer that includes details on each Shadow district in the south.&lt;br/&gt;     New allies and enemies, feats, prestige classes, and new rules options, including background classes, Sarcosan-bred horse tricks and quirks, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
