			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After surviving the Living Dead against all odds, the characters have finally found a place of good people, food, and supplies, at the community of Hirshbeck Estates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given temporary housing at the nearby abandoned Snyder Farm, the characters have slowly started to gain the trust of the community's residents. They accompanied Michael Rhodes in a hunting expedition, and defended the town against both the Living Dead and a group of raiders. After bearing witness to the tragic death of two-year-old Brian Cardile at the hands of his Living Dead father, the characters met with community leaders concerning the advancement of a massive horde of Living Dead- hundreds of the creatures that would arrive at the community within two days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even as the characters struggle to evacuate before the Living Dead arrive, their own problems rise to the surface when Jeff and the children disappear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
