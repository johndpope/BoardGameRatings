			<description>Vanor: Champions of Fate is a co-operative card game in which 1-3 players explore locations in the magitech infused Vanor campaign setting to complete encounters and stop the plots of evil villain masterminds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player pick a deck from one of three classes: the Fighter, Thief and Wizard. Each class has unique moves and abilities to overcome encounters and help the party progress in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When discovering new locations, player face encounters, which can be both friendly- and offer special advantages- or hostile, and need to be overcome. Completing encounters uses a similar mechanics to crisis resolution: each encounter require a number of different stat tokens, and the party work together to combo cards which will allow them to build enough tokens to defeat the encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is determined by a set of scenario cards the players pick at the beginning, and would usually require defeating a villain encounter. The players may lose the game if one of their characters dies, or if they&amp;rsquo;re forced to remove every card from their deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
