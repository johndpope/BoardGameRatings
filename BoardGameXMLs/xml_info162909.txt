			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos stalks the tourney field! When the Royal Tourney at Carind is beset by a series of inexplicable disasters and bloody conflicts, it's up to the player characters to investigate the mystery and save the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A supernatural mystery scenario to challenge a group of Dragon Warriors characters of 2nd to 5th rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Warriors: Enter a world of magic, folklore and danger. Here, superstition covers peoples' lives like autumn mists cover the moors, and terrifying monsters with bizarre powers lurk in the shadows. The king is a weakling, barons scheme against each other, and lordless knights, back from the Crusades without the honour or riches they were promised, roam the countryside in search of adventure - or prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruined castles and barrows are the lairs of the supernatural, or newer, more sinister masters. Labyrinthine underworlds lie forgotten below ancient temples and city cellars. The dark places of the world hold riches for those who would search for them, and the keys to great power, and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the Lands of Legend, and they need heroes. Brave knights, courageous barbarians, cunning sorcerers, mystics trained in the powers of mind and body, sword-wielding warlocks, elementalists who command the fabric of reality itself, and assassins trained to bring death to the deserving. All these will be your comrades on the path to glory - and perhaps your enemies too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you accept the challenge of Dragon Warriors?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
