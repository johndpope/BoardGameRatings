			<description>Whizizzle Phonics is a fast-paced phonics game series that teaches the sounds of the English language. Designed by a dad and perfected by teachers, this series of phonics games keeps kids engaged in learning. Guided by the whimsical, yet brilliant Professor Whizinpiggle, a wise old pig who loves to read, kids learn phonics basics quickly and completely while they have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easier than memorization and more fun than flashcards, Whizizzle Phonics games help kids learn by using sight, sound and color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They learn short vowel sounds in consonant-vowel-consonant words and long vowel sounds and silent &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo; words.&lt;br/&gt;They combine consonant sounds to learn beginning or ending blends. Players begin with seven cards. To win, players must be first to discard their cards by matching like sounds. &lt;br/&gt;Action cards &amp;lsquo;Change the Vowel&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Leap Frog&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Turn Around&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Draw One&amp;rsquo; are also included in each deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
