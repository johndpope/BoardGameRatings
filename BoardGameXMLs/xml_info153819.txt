							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earth&#039;s Legacy</name>
									
			<description>When the wormhole opened up for the first time on the edge of the solar system, mankind was not ready. Governments scrambled to cobble together spaceships to investigate the anomaly, but it vanished as unexpectedly as it had first appeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years later, the wormhole has returned and this time, we were prepared. Probe data shocked humanity when it revealed that a perfectly habitable planet lay on the other side, awaiting human colonization. A global effort was mounted and finally, the colony ship was ready for its maiden voyage. Built from whatever modular components were available, the ship left on its journey, carrying with it a crew of intrepid explorers, meager supplies and the hopes of planet Earth. Would they survive the expedition and start a new chapter in humanity's history on the mysterious planet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth's Legacy is a co-operative, legacy, micro card game. Though the base game consists of very few components, the combination of player choice, random elements, and unique, persistent game modifications through an upgrade system, lead to a high level of replayability and expandability. The low complexity nature and minimal components of Earth's Legacy make it the perfect introduction to the legacy game genre that will appeal to gamers and non-gamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
