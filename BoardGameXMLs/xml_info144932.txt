							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Apostle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the common people it is often a mystery as to how the gods works through mortal agents. The apostle is a member of the clergy who has been gifted miraculous powers by their deity. Unlike most holy men that struggle through a lifetime of trials to understand the meaning of their faith, the apostle did not choose to follow their god; instead, their god has chosen them to be a messenger in these dark times. These divine agents are granted their abilities without choice, selected by their deity to wield an inner fire that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws divine magic through a lifetime of devotion, apostles garner strength and power directly from a deity which has selected them to serve as a worthy vessel for their power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
