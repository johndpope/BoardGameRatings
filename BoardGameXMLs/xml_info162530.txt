			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shield Yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shields are an invaluable tool for fantasy warriors. Not only are they good for deflecting incoming blows, they also double as handy weapons in a pinch, and, if decked out in your personal heraldry, can serve as a sort of badge and nameplate all rolled up into one. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook does little to differentiate shields from armor, however, with the few shield-only magic abilities mostly being those that are related to shield bashing. This book provides over 50 new magic shield (and, in some cases, armor) special abilities that capture the flavor and identity of shields. The abilities range from some that cost less than a +1 enhancement bonus to six +5-equivalent abilities, with an even distribution in between, ensuring something for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absorb spells cast upon you and use them to enhance your AC with the arcane consumption special ability, or turn your shield into a true engine of bashing destruction with battering, which not only makes it deal damage as though it were two sizes larger, but also improves your ability to wield your shield and another weapon at the same time. If you prefer to use your shield to attack from a range, the hateful blast ability allows it to gain charges as you take damage, and then unleash a mighty discharge of hateful, damaging energy on your command, or you could simply watch as the dragon from your dragon emblem shield comes to life and devours your foes for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also contains several mundane enhancements for shields, allowing characters of even 1st or 2nd level to be able to purchase customized, enhanced shields. Finally, there are 10 new specific shields, each of which has a rich history and physical description, making them evocative as soon as they&amp;rsquo;re dropped in your game, and each of which also contains a special ability unique to them, such as the discus of destruction, which, when thrown, ricochets from one target to another, for a devastating mass attack, or the shield of the undying warrior, whose wielder can never be slain as long as he holds it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
