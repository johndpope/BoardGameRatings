			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circle or rebirth is made by druids who celebrate the natural circle of life and death. Many see them only as healers, but the few who truly care about their ways understand that death is as much part of life as life itself.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Druids from the Circle of Seasons celebrate the eternal dance of elements, and bring their chosen season's might to bear upon the enemies of nature with elemental fury.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;People who dance under the moon. That curse the unwary. These are a few of the things that followers of the Circle of Witchcraft are known for. These wielders of the &amp;quot;dark arts&amp;quot; spawn these legends, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
