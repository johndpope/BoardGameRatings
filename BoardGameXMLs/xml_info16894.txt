In a manner similar to &amp;quot;Clue&amp;quot;, players need to identify which city, hotel, and suite Mr. Who is in, along with which of his 5 disguises he is using.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Somewhere in the Western hemisphere, the eccentric billionaire, Mr.Who, is hiding. Suspicious and withdrawn, Mr. Who is elusive to the point of being almost invisible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Federal grand jury has just ordered Mr. Who to testify in court. Acting for the district attorney, three to six players are about to join in the exciting global search for the world's most fabulous recluse.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
