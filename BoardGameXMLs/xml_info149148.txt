			<description>There is an unusual cabin deep in the woods. It had served as a laboratory and a dwelling for three generations of Lodgers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But as of late the latest Lodger has been noticing weird changes in familiar surroundings; things are missing, noises and rattle heard. Something odd is coming out of the woods. Come night, it seems like someone's made himself at home in the twilight of rooms, attics, and cellars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need to stay awake and sane till dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
