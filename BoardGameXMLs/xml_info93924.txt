			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aligned Destinies is a Role-playing Game about characters from different worlds in a common setting, linked by their destinies. In each of those worlds one player plays the lead character while the others join in as supporting crew. And as they proceed through the adventure the world switches by the whim of the GM to throw them into even greater peril or, if they are determined enough, they might switch on their own to lighten their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very improvisational and works best if both GM and players actively take part in the creation of the story. It is possible to start playing with only the lead alter-egos created and do the rest of character development on the fly while switching through the worlds of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally the game is more a one-shot thing, with no greater linking story between adventures. Because of that and with the very light rules included, it is best suited for convention style adventure sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
