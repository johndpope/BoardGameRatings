			<description>Description from MNG-AJM Games and Collectibles&lt;br/&gt;Oct 2005 Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TV and film related, licensed by King Features, who made the Popeye cartoons and the old serials that always ended at a crisis point. A game set on the Moons of Mongo. Each player takes the part of Flash, Dale, Zarkov or Emperor Ming. The board shows orbits around each of 6 moons and the players try to be the first to land spaceships on any four of these.  Movement is by dice roll, but you can choose which of your 4 ships to move.  Landing on an opponent's ship causes it to have to restart.  Orbits intersect giving quite a bit of choice of where to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move your three pieces into position on the moons of Mongo. The first player to occupy three moons wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Waddington ad dated 1976: &amp;quot;Flash Gordon Space Adventure Game - Your mission in this thrills-a-second game is to gain control of the moons of Mongo! Who will win? Flash Gordon? Dr Zarkov? Dale Arden? Or Ming the Merciless? Hours of excitement has been packed into this space thriller!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
