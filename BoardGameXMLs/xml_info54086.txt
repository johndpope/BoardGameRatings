			<description>This is a solitaire simulation of the Second Lebanon War 2006. The player represents the Israeli supreme political leadership (i.e. the Prime Minister and the War Cabinet) contested by the designed system, representing Hezbullah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The player&amp;rsquo;s aim is to defend his home-front from rockets fired at it by Hezbullah, and to maintain and improve his political conditions, domestically and internationally, towards the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;     The player must consider various factors that affects the campaign&amp;rsquo;s outcome: domestic and international political factors, military mobilisation and operational successes and losses.&lt;br/&gt;     The player will keep good record of points on two designated tables: domestic political points and international political points. A third table will be used to keep track of turns. Each turn ends only after playing all phases.&lt;br/&gt;     The initial setting of the simulation represents the first stage of the conflict. Therefore, the player has thirty-three days of war to simulate in eleven turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
