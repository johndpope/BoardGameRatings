							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space: A Race to the Moon</name>
									
			<description>A roll and move electronic space race board game starting at the Woomera rocket range in Australia. The first to reach the moon is the winner. Two players each have a wired playing piece (electrode) that they move by the roll of the die. The electrode piece advances along small holes in the board towards the moon passing planets along the way. Each player has to follow a separate route to the moon made of these small holes. At certain contact points along the way the playing piece sets off one of a series a colored warning lights on the board that indicates a penalty sending them back to a planet. On reaching the moon a yellow light in the moons center indicates the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown publisher but most likely Australian or English considering the unique launch zone where rocket testing was conducted during the 1950s&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
