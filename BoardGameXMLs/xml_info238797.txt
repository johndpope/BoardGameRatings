			<description>In a crazy experiment that went haywire, scientists accidently opened the portal to four parallel universe! Meanwhile, four different UFOs from the four different multiverse was split due to fraction of space! Scientists now fight anxiously to piece the UFOs back together in order to avoid cosmic chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UFOS宇宙迷航 (USO Tumble) is an abstract, tile-placing board game. Unlike typical games, it features an unique mechanism: a board that can be turned and rotated, where tiles will fall or not fall depending on their corresponding colors, and re-arranging the module as it goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a 5x5 grid, with four different colors on each side representing the four universes. Tiles with colors matching the bottom side will gain anti-gravity, which means they will not fall downwards and can be placed anywhere. The tiles are magnetic, allowing players to shift the tiles freely on the board throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come challenge your ability of spatial cognition and prediction, outsmart your opponents and win by piecing together as much UFOs as you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
