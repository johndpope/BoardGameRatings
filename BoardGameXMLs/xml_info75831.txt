			<description>Publihser Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Krieg served the Sorcerer King in life so well that the undying ruler offered him any boon. Krieg asked only for the power to serve his master for all eternity...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cost: 14.&lt;br/&gt;Avatar: Sorcerer King only.&lt;br/&gt;Power: Hordes of the Things.&lt;br/&gt;Minions: 6 Skeletons, 2 Master Skeletons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is only placed in the graveyard if killed with an attack that ignores the Undying ability. Otherwise, he returns to the Overlord's Keep at the start of the next week.  He has Regeneration 3 and Poison.  Whenever at least 1 damage to a hero (after armor is applied) is dealt, the hero is reduced to zero fatigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
