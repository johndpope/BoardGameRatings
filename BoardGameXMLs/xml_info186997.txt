			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Octane is a slightly more serious, possibly more complicated, and hopefully still fun expansion for Risus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion lists numerous Clich&amp;eacute;s to use during character generation.  In this expansion, Clich&amp;eacute;s have three components--a name, a number of dice, and a scope.  For example:  Psycho Killer, 4, Butchering people with household objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document includes Swords &amp;amp; Sorcery genre notes as well as &amp;quot;bonus rules&amp;quot; for traps and spells.  Also included are Science Fiction notes.  Also included are a weapons list and optional rules for modern genre gaming.  For the Game Master, some notes on NPCs and locations also are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
