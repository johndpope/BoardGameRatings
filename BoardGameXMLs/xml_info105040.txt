							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bronze</name>
									
			<description>The board game Bronze is based on the Windows computer game of the same name from developer Dreamspike Studios and publisher Shrapnel Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the computer game is mostly for solitaire play, Bronze the board game will be for two players. The game will include six civilizations, which will slightly tweaked from their digital versions. Game play requires the capture of fertile land or minerals to fund your expansion and building program. There are 7 different building types in the game each helps you to expand in different ways, however there are a limited number of each building in the game so choosing when and where to build is critical. Each player is randomly allocated one of the 6 civilizations to play and each civilizations has a different selection of buildings available to them and at differing costs. Each civilization will require a different strategy to be successful. The game also includes tiles for different terrain types so each game can be played on new map, sometimes minerals are plentiful, at other times all you see is endless desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer game is a tile strategy game of area control set in ancient Mesopotamia. Controlling one of twelve historically accurate civilizations of the era &amp;ndash; Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Elamites, Ebla, Egyptians, Gutians, Hittites, Kassites, Mitanni, Nomads or Sumerians &amp;ndash; players attempt to dominate the game board by creating farms, towns, embassies, ziggurats, and even armies. Each civilization has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the game has no luck elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
