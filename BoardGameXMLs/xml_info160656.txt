							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salt Merchant</name>
									
			<description>Your grandfather started a salt manufacturing business fifty years ago. After thriving for many years, the salt business is now in trouble. Faced by tough competition and a lack of good management, there's a risk of business going bankrupt. It's up to you to take up this challenge and save this family business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salt Merchant is a card game of business, luck, math and strategy. Each player becomes a salt merchant and tries to outplay other players and become the first to set up the maximum number of salt manufacturing factories and hence earn maximum money. Your challenges are to acquire good labor and factories, dig more salt water wells, and automate your factories. There's tough competition, too, so you have to be smart, make the right moves, and set-up factories of all different types if you want to regain lost glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
