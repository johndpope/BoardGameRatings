			<description>An Inheritance game for two to five players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Great Aunt Hattie has passed away and named you in her will. All she left behind was a bank account and her collection of ART DECO prints from the 1920&amp;rsquo;s. Aunt Hattie was a bit eccentric - and created a game for her inheritors. If you want your share, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to play! Inheritors start with a stake from the bank, and continually draw money from the pool to bid on Art Prints until all have been won. Each print is assigned points. The Inheritor who gains the most points takes home the entire collection - and the balance of the bank!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players roll dice [the bid]. Highest roll pays the difference between his die roll and the low die roll and gets the print [card]. If high roll is tied, everybody gets double the roll in chips and the card goes in the discard pile. Winning a Wild Card allows you to choose any card from the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards range in points from 2 - 8. 6, 7, &amp;amp; 8 point cards may not be 'DOUBLED DOWN', but 2 - 5 point cards may. During scoring, each DOUBLED DOWN card doubles the entire score of a color group. All chips accumulated score as well. Highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A fifty card deck of ART DECO prints. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the two player game, only use the Color Cards that have between 2 and 5 points. Color cards are arranged into five color groups, or sets. There are an extra ten Wild Cards in the deck have no points on them - for the two player game, only use five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Two D6 [two player]&lt;br/&gt;     Four D8 [3 or 4 players]&lt;br/&gt;     Five D10 [5 players]&lt;br/&gt;     Poker chips [50 each- White, Red, Blue, Green]&lt;br/&gt;     12 page Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;     Aluminum case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
