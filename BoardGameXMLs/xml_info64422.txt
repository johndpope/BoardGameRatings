			<description>Lay your cards (2-6 &amp;amp; 8-12) face up. All players put a chip in the pot. Starting player rolls two dice, and turns the card that match the roll total face down. If he cannot use the roll, play moves to the first player on the left who has that number card showing. If he rolls a 7 (no card), he puts a chip in the pot and play moves to left. The first player who turns over all his cards is the winner of that round, and takes the pot. The player with the most chips after 10 rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
