			<description>Easy memory-style board game that is well suited for both adults and/or children or the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Rainbow, 9 cloud tiles will be arranged in a square. On their turn, players will flip over the clouds to their rainbow side to find colours matching on of the three rainbow cards that are the current goal cards. As long as the revealed rainbow colours match one of the goal cards, the active player can continue to reveal further colors until either one of the rainbow goal cards is fulfilled (take that card and score at the end of the game) or the sun is revealed (player is allowed to unflip colours again for a new try) or the raincloud is revealed (shuffle all revealed tiles!).&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who scored the most points on the rainbow cards he completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For buyers at the Tokyo Game Market Dec 2016, an additional tile &amp;quot;Thunder&amp;quot; was added as a give away to create even more variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
