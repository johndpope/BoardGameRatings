							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dargrim Four-Fingers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fully developed D&amp;amp;D 4E gaming aid designed as a sample of our writing and design style. We plan to bring products that center around role play elements to you for your 4E gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dargrim is designed as a mentor NPC for players up to about 18th level. However he can be used as an information source or just a powerful NPC the players meet. His background is written so that he can be a gritty street fighter or a noble dwarf trying to regain his clan honor who has fallen into contact with the thieves guild through no plans of his own. Whatever is best for your campaign theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enccounters are designed for levels 6 to 9. This product includes a full color, full page portrait of Dargrim, 7 grandmaster training skills players can learn, 2 introduction encounters, 5 new creatures, 4 scaled encounter maps, and a city map of Worlun if you don't have your own city to place Dargrim within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
