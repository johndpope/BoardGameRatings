							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Hexes</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The map presented in this PDF is intended as an illustration of how a campaign setting can be started from a single hex and expanded as required. I've not set a scale for my maps as I think they can easily work at different scales. The large hexes are each 9 small hexes high. Depending on how spread out you'd like the setting to be, the scale could range from half a mile per small hex to three miles per small hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 14 hexes in this map has a short description that accompanies it. These descriptions are devoid of place names, as this helps when placing the map into a larger pre-existing setting. In addition to providing details of the locations in each hex, the notes also suggest possible connections between places in adjacent hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
