			<description>We are the citizens of the Weate State. We deserve to be happy, we deserve to move up in this world, and this company. If someone else is being successful, that only makes your success less. You must defeat the other citizens of the Weate State that are trying to be better than you. You will have to liquidate their assets, buy them out, and engage in a little bit of friendly &amp;ldquo;combat-atition&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weate State is a living card game currently in development by Right After Then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take the role of a character in the Weate State.  Everyone starts with a random deck of cards and a character card.  Throughout the game players have to make choices as to what items they want to use, and what they want to deposit into the bank to use as money.  Many ways exist to take down opponents, but in the end only one will stand with their deck, bank, and and health in intact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
