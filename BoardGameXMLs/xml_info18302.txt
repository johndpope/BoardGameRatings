							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tactician Simulated Sailing</name>
									
			<description>Tactician Simulated Sailing is a fairly simple game that tries to simulate a yacht race.  There are a couple of scenarios for solitaire play also.  Six plastic yachts sail around the course area marked on the board.  In the center of the board is placed a spinner that shows how far the yachts may move in a given direction.  The trick is that the spinner is magnetized so the wind will only vary 45&amp;ordm; from the mean wind direction for the game.  A good way to simulate wind direction over the period of a yacht race.  The board is dark blue and the course is marked on in darker lines with dots to show where the yachts may move. There are also currents and shallows to be navigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
