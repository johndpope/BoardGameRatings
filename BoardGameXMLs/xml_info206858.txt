			<description>With three shapes (cube, cylinder, sphere) being in three colors (blue, yellow, red) you must realize, on a board of 16 vertical rods arranged in a square of 4 out of 4, the maximum combinations, and also interesting combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieving a combination is successful in placing four pieces of the same shape - or the same color - or better still in the same shape and the same color,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     On an alignment of 4 rods, in long or wide;&lt;br/&gt;     On the four corners of the same square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also possible to do combinations by placing, on the same vertical rod, three pieces of the same shape or the same color, or better still in the same shape and the same color.&lt;br/&gt;The possible combinations of this new three-dimensional game, highly original and modern, are countless.&lt;br/&gt;You learn very quickly to identify the shot that will score the most points by not letting your opponent a minimum of possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
