							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Unstuck&quot; Encounters</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short scenarios for when your PCs just can't figure it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Dungeon Master has been in this situation: your PCs can't figure out what to do next, where to go next or who to look for next.  It's your job as the DM to help them get unstuck, and this collection of encounters can help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than simply telling your PCs what they need to know, make them earn it.  If they are about to give up, use these short encounters as a way to reveal the needed information in a different or weird or (sometimes) low-cost way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, did your PCs miss your multiple clues about the secret section of the dungeon? Then have them meet Dirk, the transmuted rat thief, who would gladly show them the way in exchange for some well-made, rat-size furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
