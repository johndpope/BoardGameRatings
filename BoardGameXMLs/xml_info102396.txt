			<description>NASCAR Rumble is a racing game by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation. The player or players can race through 18 different courses set in six different areas collecting powerups to aid them. The game was met with fairly positive reviews, and earned an 80% on GameRankings[1]. This game is a great departure to many NASCAR games, as this game is an arcade racing featuring various tracks and Mario Kart esque powerups. A non-NASCAR licensed sequel was made for the PlayStation 2, called Rumble Racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In NASCAR Rumble, the main object of the game is to win a race or series of races against one to five opponents. They race in normal or souped-up stock cars from the at-the-time NASCAR Winston Cup Series, in addition to several Craftsman Truck Series drivers, unlockable past NASCAR legends, and everyday vehicles. Another feature in the game includes the voice of actor Jess Harnell, who talks to the player during a race. The game also features three original songs by guitarist Derek Trucks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NASCAR Rumble&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
