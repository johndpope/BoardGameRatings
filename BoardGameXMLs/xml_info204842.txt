							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chronomancer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time. For the common-folk time moves in only one direction: forward but for a chronomancer, time has a more fluid interpretation. A chronomancer is aware of the many possible timelines that there could exists, each depending on the tiniest of actions. Perhaps this is the timeline where the thief tries to steal some coins from a noble, gets caught and is sent to jail or maybe this is the one where the thief steals the coins, gets away, but gets crushed by a dragon. A chronomancer manipulates to nodge his timeline into a desired direction. The trouble is figuring out which timeline they are currently on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 13 page playbook containing over 20 moves.&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
