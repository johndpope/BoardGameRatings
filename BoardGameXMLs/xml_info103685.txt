							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SuperUber-Six</name>
									
			<description>An expanded version of Uber-Six, this version changes a few core rules, and adds a large number of abilities to enemies to make the game a bit more of an interesting challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pencil-and-paper dice-based solo roleplaying adventure.  Players build a character and face hordes of enemies in an attempt to level up or die.  The ultimate grindfest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create a character of one of four classes (Warrior, Mage, Ninja, or Druid) each with a special ability, and adventure off into the wilderness to slay countless foes.  In between each fight, the character rolls on the monster tables to determine which foe they will face in the upcoming round.  If they so choose, they may spy by paying one gold before the roll--spying allows the player to decide whether or not to face the enemy.  After the enemy is determined, the game continues to battle.  During battle, initiative is determined each round by a roll of the dice modified by attributes, and whichever side has the initiative is allowed to make an action--either attacking, running, or using magic if possible.  Combat is worked out in this way until one side or the other is reduced to 0 health, at which point if the character survives they gather gold and experience, and lives to fight another monster.  If the character is dead, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this game is simply to kill time in a fun way.  Surviving characters can last for several sessions, and allow for a feeling of progression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SuperUber-Six builds upon the gameplay of Uber-Six by adding several additional status effects and generally streamlining the turn process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
