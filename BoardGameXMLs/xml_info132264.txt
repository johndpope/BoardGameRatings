			<description>The goal is to get &amp;quot;a golden axe &amp;amp; knife&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has five cards may have a knife or an axe, besides each of these will have a number between 3 and 10.&lt;br/&gt;Players throw a card knowing that must be of equal or greater number of which is in the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;If a player can not play this move, will take all the cards from the pile and the player who threw before he will take as many bronze axes and knives as cards of them have had that pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bronze axes and knives can be exchanged for the same silver (8 bronze axes = 1 silver axe / 10 bronze knives = 1 silver knife), and silver is exchanged for the same golden (2 silver axes = a golden axe / 3 silver knives = a golden knife).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
