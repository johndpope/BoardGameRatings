			<description>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard all the rumours lad. Corsair&amp;rsquo;s a drunk &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s not match fit! Appearances can be deceiving young blood &amp;ndash; under his leadership we&amp;rsquo;re rebuilding, being shaped into his team again - ready for anything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Greyscales, Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Guild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the ambitious and charismatic skipper of his crew, Corsair was brought low by a brutal attack orchestrated by the Butcher&amp;rsquo;s Guild that sent him crashing out of the team. However cutthroat pirates like Corsair don&amp;rsquo;t fold sails easily &amp;ndash; the exile has returned, desperate to reclaim his mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Guild side are slyer than other Fisherman teams in how they play their game; able to move enemy players around and cut away crucial opposition players. Their flexibility leaves them a dangerous footballing side, and coaches will love the tricks they can use to control the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The return of the cutthroat exile, this set includes: a ball, 6 player cards, bases, and 6 players: Corsair, Tentacles, Sakana, Veteran Siren, Hag, Jac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
