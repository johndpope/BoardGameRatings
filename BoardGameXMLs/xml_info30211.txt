			<description>Phractured Phrases is a party game where players try to recognize and correct alterations in famous phrases from famous speakers, literature, film, culture, and history&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players divide into two teams.  While a timer runs, one player on a team reads cards with famous phrases that have had words replaced in them.  The rest of the team tries to identify the wrong words and correct them.  For example, the phrase &amp;quot;Don't fire until you see the SIZE of their THIGHS&amp;quot; would need the corrections of &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;eyes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;When time is up, the other team can then score points by correcting any phrases missed during the round.  Score is kept on a board with various bonus spaces and other incentives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
