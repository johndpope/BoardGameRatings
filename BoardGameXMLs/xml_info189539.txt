							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zelph On The Shelf Edition (fan expansion for Cards Against Humanity)</name>
									
			<description>Cards Against Humanity Zelph On The Shelf Edition is a fan-made version of Cards Against Humanity that is designed for ex-Mormon players. Like the regular game, a player selects a black card with fill in the blank text and each player selects one of their white cards to try and find the funniest result. The person playing the black card chooses the funniest response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game pokes fun at Mormonism and Mormon Apologetics. The name Zelph refers to a skeleton found by Joseph Smith in Illinois that was uncovered in a Native American mound. He claimed the bones belonged to a warrior named Zelph who had fought in the battles described in the Book of Mormon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played independently or integrated with Cards Against Humanity. Like the original game, the humor is very adult in nature and is recommended for mature players. For faithful Mormons, the game is probably especially offensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
