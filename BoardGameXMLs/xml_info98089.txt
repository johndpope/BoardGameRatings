			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woodland Warriors is a fantastic little role playing game suitable for kids and adults alike. It uses the popular Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry Core (with modifications to more closely suit the genre) which itself is based on the original role playing game of medieval fantasy adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fans of any animal-based fiction, comics, fairy tales or cartoon movies will love this game. Set in the Alder Vale, Stonewell Abbey is a place of learning for the Kind and Murkenhill Fort is a bastion against evil. Players take the role of Mice, Moles, Hedgehogs, Squirrels and Badgers, who must protect their homes against the Verminous Rats and Weasels that pour down from the Murkenhills, intent on pillage and plunder. Danger and adventure awaits - are you brave enough to put your sword to the defence of The Alder Vale?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
