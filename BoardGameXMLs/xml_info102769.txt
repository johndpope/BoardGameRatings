							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tecmo Super NBA Basketball</name>
									
			<description>Tecmo Super NBA Basketball is a basketball video game published by Tecmo for the Super NES. It also came out a year later (with updated rosters) for the Sega Genesis. It was released in the United States in March 1993. The teams consist of NBA teams from 1992. Players can choose from exhibition games, the 1992 All-Star Game, or the 1993 season. In playing the season, players can choose which teams they want to control, for example, a player can choose to play as two teams, and will play every game those two teams play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Super NES version Michael Jordan and Reggie Lewis are selectable players in the Bulls and Celtics rosters, respectively, but in the Sega Genesis version they are replaced for &amp;quot;Roster Bulls&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Roster Celtics&amp;quot; players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is also one of the few ones for 16-bit generation where it is possible to watch every single game instead of playing only with the team you select.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tecmo Super NBA Basketball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
