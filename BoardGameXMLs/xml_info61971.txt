							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ephemeris Book of 1st Level Characters</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Ephemeris Book of 1st Level Characters. This book contains 54 1st level characters. One from each species for every class in the Ephemeris game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can print these up to immediately start a new game or you can use them as potential adversaries or allies for the characters that your players have already created. All you need to do to make them playable is give them names.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character already has skills and equipment. The Cyber Wizards have their spells, the Nanists have their Transferences, and the Traders have their ships (although these need to be named as well.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these characters need is an adventure to undertake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
