							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sorceress of Zhaan</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue is Chock full of articles: The Limrust Family, Sheriffs, Law and Crime of the Winterlands, Politics and the Targ, and Roguish activiites like assasination and robbery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is the Sorceress of Zhaan adventure! What's that all about? Read on...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is word on the wind.&lt;br/&gt;There is a sorceress in Kartharka. She can work miracles, heal the sick, foresee the future, or strike down your enemies. She can do anything, for a price.&lt;br/&gt;Coming from far Zhaan in the Autumnlands, her history is unknown before coming to the Winterlands.&lt;br/&gt;Surrounded by her band of fiercely loyal followers she is travelling the Winterlands, working her magic, moving ever closer to the heart of the Winterlands, Stroh Branoch.&lt;br/&gt;In public, the story is always the same, the Sorceress is a hero of the people. She works her magic for all, the poor, the sick, or those who cannot convince the Targ or the Sheriffs to help them with their problems.&lt;br/&gt;She is especially loved by those who feel the Targ is a corrupt organization, paid by the Empire to keep the Winterlands under their heel.&lt;br/&gt;But there are other stories as well. Whispered in secret.&lt;br/&gt;Whole families, killed in the night, hot springs drying up, Takket herds sickening and dying. Targs struck down in their beds by mysterious forces.&lt;br/&gt;Stories that mean even the Targ dare not stand against her.&lt;br/&gt;All the stories end the same. The Sorceress is allowed to leave, to move on to the next town to work her magics.&lt;br/&gt;Will our heroes find out the truth? Will they join the Sorceress and help her to fight the Empire, or will they fight an evil sorceress bent on control of the Winterlands?&lt;br/&gt;Let the adventure begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
