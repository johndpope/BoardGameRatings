			<description>Metanon: The Biocode Adventure:  A Fun Way to Teach Kids about DNA!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine that you're a space traveler whose ship has been forced to land on the planet Metanon. Your computer is damaged, and your ship is leaking fuel and oxygen. To complete your mission and return home, you will need to find three missing items and put them in your spaceship. Sound simple? Not so fast. You can get them only by entering three walled cities. To do that, you must collect Biocodes, and put them together in the right sequence and pattern combinations that unlock the cities' gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biocodes and Brain Development:&lt;br/&gt;(serious stuff for parents and teachers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DNA keeps making headlines. Kids may not be ready to learn the difficult terminology, but Metanon:The Biocode Adventure prepares them to grasp the basic concepts of DNA. All players use the game's biocode pieces in different combinations. Why is this shape and color matching important? Just by playing the game, kids begin to understand how DNA works. This form of learning is one of the most effective ways of preparing young brains. The critical skills learned in Metanon:The Biocode Adventure help kids excel in school and ultimately in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At kSERO Corporation, Inc. we create games that help young children develop their cognitive and analytic skills. Our games are designed and tested by noted scientists and educators, using the latest discoveries in FUN and brain research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
