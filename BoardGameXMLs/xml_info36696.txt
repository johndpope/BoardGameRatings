							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Fat Lies</name>
									
			<description>Cards consist of one truth and one lie on each side, cards are drawn and read aloud to the other player/team.  If the two lies are identified correctly the guessing player/team keeps the card and continues to guess. If both lies are not identified, the card goes in a discard stack and the reading player/team becomes the guessing player/team.  There are six categories of cards, play continues until one player/team has collected at least one card from each category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
