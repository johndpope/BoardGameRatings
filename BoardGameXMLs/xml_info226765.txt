			<description>Everyone is moving on the Moscow subway map. In the beginning every player receives 3 cards with photos of Moscow tourist sights. The goal of the game is to visit your 3 sights  and return to the starting point. To win the game you need to do it first. Main difficulty is to recall what subway station is the closest to sight. On the back of the sight card there are 3 hints which can be earned during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to move players need to answer quiz question about Moscow and make stakes on the right answer. Every turn player can make secretly a stake or not to bid. After all bids were made variants of answers are revealed - participating players choose their answers. Those who answered correctly can make a move (no bid - 1 station, otherwise - according to the number on their bid). Those whose answer were wrong lose their appropriate bid tokens. Those tokens can be replenished on the specified areas of the map. For 2 moving points player can instead receive a hint about one of their sights. For each sight there are 2 hints, for the 3rd hint player receives exact location of the sight. Also there are cards with random events which are revealed at different locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
