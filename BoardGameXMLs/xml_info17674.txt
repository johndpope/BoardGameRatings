			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 1600, deep in the valley of Charma, King Gambrel discovered a globe possessing mystical powers. He took the globe, which he named the Moonstone, back to his tower. Using the powers of the Moonstone, King Gambrel ruled long and wisely; however, four of his bravest knights became obsessed with the Moonstone and conspired to steal it.&lt;br/&gt;King Gambrel discovered the plot, and using the Moonstone's supernatural powers he transformed the four knights into Dark Riders whose eternal task is to protect the Moonstone.&lt;br/&gt;Recently, the Moonstone was rediscovered, still sealed away where King Gambrel had left it under the watchful eyes and powerful swords of the four Dark Riders. Only the most brave knights may challenge the Dark Riders for the possession of the Moonstone.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Riders is similar to Pachisi or Sorry!, with mechanics in the rules to create blockades, or to send opponents back to &amp;quot;start&amp;quot;. Your goal is to get to the tower in the center of the board, retrieve the Moonstone, and return it to your starting corner of the board while avoiding the Dark Riders and the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
