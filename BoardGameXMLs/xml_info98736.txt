							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1839 The Netherlands</name>
									
			<description>This is a 18xx game by Paul Stouthard and Rob van Wijngarden. It is based on 1829, which means that the emphasis is more on building than on business. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp;amp; generate revenue for shareholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The author produced only 32 copies of the game. 15 were sold to 'supporters', 15 free copies were given to game publishers and 2 copies for Paul and Rob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From 18xx net:&lt;br/&gt;Location: The Netherlands &lt;br/&gt;Corporations: 9 &lt;br/&gt;Privates: None or 8 &lt;br/&gt;Map Size: 104 hexes (118 total) &lt;br/&gt;Off-Board: Three steps (2 / 3-4 / 5) &lt;br/&gt;Bank: 11,520 (plus 4,500 Company Credits) &lt;br/&gt;Tile Colours: Yellow / Green / Brown &lt;br/&gt;Stock Market: 1D (Linear)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
