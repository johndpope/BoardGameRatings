							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jungle Encounters</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to jungle Encounters! This is designed and dedicated to give more life into your jungle themed adventures with fun ideas and themes. In this material you'll find over twenty-five new, custom jungle themed creatures and creations with full stat blocks, pictures, and descriptions. These creatures range from beast, three new dragons, three new non-playable characters, weather patterns, and traps! You'll also find, for your convenience, some official Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition monsters that now have descriptions and pictures to better serve your creative juices when creating an adventure. Creatures taken from the official Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition Monster Manual have the exact stat block as they do in the manual, and have been marked with the red Dungeons and Dragons Logo on the upper right-hand comer of their stat block. These creatures were added to this project because they are common creatures found within jungle environments. Like all creatures in the world of Dungeons and Dragons these creatures can be modified anyway you like and were created for inspiration and ideas for your enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
