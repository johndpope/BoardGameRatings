			<description>&amp;quot;The family game of TV fame.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep It In The Family is a game from the 1950s for two teams based on a TV show.  In each round a category of questions is read out and each team bids on the number of correct answers they think they can give, until one team outbids the other.  The winning bid is then multiplied by 10 and this is the number of points now at stake in the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team that made the higher bid must now attempt to give their answers, against the clock.  If they manage to give enough right answers, they win the points.  If they give a wrong answer, the opposing team scores the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one team reaches a total of 250 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
