							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Underneath The Haunted Hill</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Faerie-Kin that has turned to the chaos and become a witch; a wild black cat that died a horrible death and has come back, but now has friends to help it seek its revenge; a druid who failed his Mortal God and now serves out his penance as a carved gourd, warning his Grove of the incursions of undead. These are only a few things you&amp;rsquo;ll find within these haunted pages this year...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... Halloween 2017 for Questing Heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
