			<description>You and your fellow players are officers trying to save yourselves and some passengers but there is only one last lifeboat remaining, eventually fighting for life. That last lifeboat has a limited number of places...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use their action cubes to determine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     the turn order (it also allows to get courage or money)&lt;br/&gt;     the distance their officer walk. Each one has a list of rooms he must go through before he can leave the sinking boat.&lt;br/&gt;     the money they want to get (it helps to get objects and passengers)&lt;br/&gt;     the courage they want to get (useful in order to move further and guide passengers)&lt;br/&gt;     if they want to get an object (useful when fighting)&lt;br/&gt;     if they want the buoy (to go through a room that has got the water leak)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-*if they want passengers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the water leak moves from one room to another. The buoy comes handy there. If an officer is in that same room, he must go back on his rooms list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then actions are taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fights are resolved when several officers are in the same room. Passengers and collected objects are used to calculate the force of each opponent's group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When each officer arrives at the end of his list, he finally moves into the lifeboat. He takes as many places for his passengers as he can, if remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the lifeboat is full.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who could save the most passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
