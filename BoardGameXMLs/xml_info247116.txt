			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a 40 x 40 inch full-color, map of a Secret Bio Lab , with Hex, Square and No Overlays. The Zip file contains the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;My god. If this isn&amp;rsquo;t contained it might just be the end of humanity as we know it. Look into this microscope. Every cell has been covered by hyphae with the highest concentration overlapping the synapses in the brain. The lungs have been converted to spew airborne spores as well as the kidneys with flagellated spores in the urine. This fungus spreads throughout the body, consuming a man alive and using its body to spread this plague. Wait&amp;hellip; What are you doing? Stop aiming that gun at me. They got to you too. Fight it man!&amp;hellip;I can&amp;rsquo;t die here; I must escape!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Dr. Jordan, Medical Examiner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Flips over a medical bed. Shots fired.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secret Bio Lab is a single level exterior and interior map of a clandestine research facility&amp;rsquo;s ground level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secret Bio Lab is intended for use in horror and near or far-future science fiction games. This can also be used as a high-tech facility in modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thing under the Lab: In the small town of Raquel, Nevada there has been a rash of missing persons reported. Locals seem to think it is alien abductions or blame a covert government lab down the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group&amp;mdash;as vacationers or tourists&amp;mdash; has been forced to stop in Raquel for gasoline or to fix a flat tire on the way to Reno or Las Vegas to gamble. The local gas station is closed for happy hour, forcing them to head to the local bar, the Ale-y-inn, to talk to the owner and get him to reopen the gas station. The barkeep warns them to stay away from a secret government lab down the road as they shoot on sight. While they are there, a man stumbles into the bar in a bloodied lab coat. Dr. Jordan, the town&amp;rsquo;s medical examiner, has been shot several times and he barely made it to the nearby bar from the morgue. He tells his crazy story to the bar about fungus that can take over human beings. He tells the group of foreigners to the town to trust no one in the town of Raquel. Dr. Jordan has lost a lot of blood and needs medical help to survive. From here it is up to the group to decide what to do. Save Dr. Jordan? Go to the morgue and investigate Dr. Jordan&amp;rsquo;s story? Investigate the secret government facility? Get the hell out of here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
