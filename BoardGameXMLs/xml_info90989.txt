			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GP-1 Part II is the sequel to GP-1 for the Super Nintendo. It carries many of the main features that were present in its predecessor. The game includes 17 different tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four game modes to choose from: Grand Prix, Race, Practice, and Battle. Grand Prix is a career mode where players progress by winning races and earning points. After earning sufficient points, new parts and upgrades can be purchased to improve a bike&amp;rsquo;s performance. There are six bikes to choose from, each with its own unique performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Practice mode allows players to race a track without any opponents, while Race is a single match against the AI. Battle mode is a head-to-head match between two players on any of the tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
