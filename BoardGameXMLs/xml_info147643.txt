			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some wicked-twisted spells that a cyborg sorcerer from a shoggoth-haunted nuclear waste-land might have on-hand or you want to give the next bunch of foul cultists something with a little more oomph than a few magic missile spells, we&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a collection of over 100 strange new spells that combine magic and technology in bizarre, unsettling and often horrific ways best suited to Lovecraftian Space Opera, Eldritch Cyberpunk, Post-Apocalyptic Sword &amp;amp; Planet campaigns, settings or games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to build a memorable villain or NPC spell-caster? Just switch the spells of a typical Magic User, Cleric or Lich with some of the more blasphemous or insidious spells contained in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware; these aren&amp;rsquo;t the usual run of the mill spells you might be used to. Many of these spells carry a terrible cost. Others are gonzo-batshit terrifying, and a few are so gross that we all know that someone is going to insist on having their character attempt to cast one of them just to see what happens. Not all of these spells are appropriate for every world, setting or campaign. Some of these spells have really drastic consequences, others run the risk of exposing the caster to Dread Powers only fools or those suffering from insanity would ever consider casting (making them ideal for rivals, opponents and hirelings). It&amp;rsquo;s up to you whether any of these spells are available to player characters or only to NPCs, or not at all. It&amp;rsquo;s your world, your game and your decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
