			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The perils are great, the potential dangers unmistakable, and yet the allure is all too real. Devil worship, in fact and fiction, has been a part of our world since before any of the current practiced religions were even formed. From appeasing a vengeful nature demon with sacrifices to cloistered cultists summoning devils amid a pentagram, there have always been those who were willing to gamble with their souls by making pacts with the denizens of the infernal realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet, all too often in RPGs, this aspect-worshipping demons and devils as legitimate, if decidedly evil deities-is overlooked. While one would hope they never surpass the good-gods, they do in fact represent an alternative pantheon if you will.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Masters, Penned by the ENnie-nominated author Andrew Hind (who wrote Dark Ladies for &amp;Oslash;one) presents a collection of lords of darkness: entities who are worshipped by someone and fought by others. The book is filled by gorgeous artwork by Daniele Bigliardo and wonderful cartography by &amp;Oslash;one. If you want add devil worship to your campaign, this is the book for you. Dark Masters contains five ready-to play adventures in devilish temples to plug into your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
