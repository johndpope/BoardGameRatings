			<description>Published in the Old Game Journal #59.  Map is about 13 x 20 inches and comes with 180 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just starting learning this one but initial impressions are quite favorable. Covers the entire war in about a 4 hour sitting.  A melding of Victory Games Civil War and GMT's For the People but far faster and, remarkably, at least at first glance, not missing anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has production, leaders (dismissal and promotion), naval rules (river fleets, invasions and blockades), Neutral States and cards for player chosen events (Emancipation and Trent to name just 2 of the 32 choices in the game). Chit pull system that is pretty novel and a first rate combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More later as I get this completely translated, play tested and analyzed but looks to be first rate game in a playable format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sort of a House Divided type game with all the goodies added but not at the expense of more playing time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
