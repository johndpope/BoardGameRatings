			<description>Super Fantasy Zone was the last addition to the Fantasy Zone series of video games. It was originally released in Europe and Japan but, for unknown reasons, not in the United States. However, North America would eventually receive the game in the form of a Virtual Console release on July 21, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a free moving shoot 'em up, like its side-scrolling predecessors, and essentially has the same core gameplay as the arcade original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soundtrack to the game was composed by Naoki Kodaka, but also features themes from earlier Fantasy Zone games composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Fantasy Zone&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
