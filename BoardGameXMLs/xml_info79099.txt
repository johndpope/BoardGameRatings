			<description>Boojum is a set collection card game, using auction and deck building mechanics. It uses two decks of Decktet cards, plus some tokens to keep score. Groups of cards are auctioned, with players bidding using other cards from their hand. The winning bid for each group gets incremented by a card, and then auctioned in the next round. Sets to be collected are typical rummy/poker-like sets: straights, sets, flushes, etc., plus a few sets peculiar (in at least two senses of the word) to the Decktet. A sister game to Snark which uses the same mechanics, but with a Rainbow Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
