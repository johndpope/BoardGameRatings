							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Necrostruct</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A necrostruct is a once-living and artificially created creature animated by spiritual or supernatural forces. Necrostructs are created by encasing a recently dead body within a suit of specially prepared armor. The corpse is then infused with negative energy, creating a unique form of undead creature which is permanently trapped inside the ornate armored shell which it must use to fight and move. The elaborate process of creating a necrostruct binds this undead force to the specially prepared armor, resulting in a single, unified being that is both undead and construct.  The first necrostructs are said to have been created many centuries ago by a powerful but crazed mystic theurge with an odd, twisted sense of self loathing. Many sages believe that it is because of this twisted self loathing that all necrostructs possess a powerful urge to seek out and destroy magic when they are created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Lesser Necrostruct (CR 7)&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Necrostruct (CR 10)&lt;br/&gt;     Statistics, abilities and rules for a Greater Necrostruct (CR 13)&lt;br/&gt;     Harvester of Sorrow Miniature Counters&lt;br/&gt;     Initiative and Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;     Combat &amp;amp; Initiative Tracker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
