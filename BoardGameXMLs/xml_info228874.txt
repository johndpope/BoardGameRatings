			<description>A One-Round Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jack Mooney and Sons Circus has just pulled in for the winter just outside of Procampur, as Ravens Bluff is not safe this year. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Zhentarim have decided that taking over the circus and using them to take Procampur is a good idea. In order accomplish this, a group lead by a spell casting vampire, have been elected to execute the plan. The vampire actually wants all out destruction of the entire area and is merely using this tactic as a means to an end, his end. The fact that there is a war on in Ravens Bluff is a bonus and should make his overall plan much easier. It is up to the PCs to thwart these plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
