							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadly Encounters: Astray in the Woodlands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astray in the Woodlands is the first adventure module in the Larrgn Steelehart's Deadly Encounters series for Creatures &amp;amp; Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traveling along the weed encroached road we saw a hunched shadow up ahead. The shadow didn't move - thinking an ambush imminent we drew our blades and notched arrows. As the horses trotted nearer, the sounds of sobbing and crying were heard. Hiding in the shadows nearby was a dark silhouette. Renwald silently stepped-down from his horse and cautiously sidestepped the twigs and branches as not to make a sound, while we trained our arrows in his direction. Sword drawn, Renwald arched around the tree. Behind the tree was a small human child crying, his knees tucked under his chin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the child a sign of impending doom? Lost due to war or monster? Only one way to find out.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astray in the Woodlands is a supplemental adventure for a band of four adventurers of 6th to 8th-level. It can take place between campaign adventures, or as a small insert into a longer campaign adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
