							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Act of War: High Treason</name>
									
			<description>[From the publisher's website]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the eve of the U.S. Presidential election, terror strikes again in the worst possible way&amp;mdash;as both candidates are attacked, the sitting President is assassinated.  As America tumbles into turmoil, confusion and chaos, only one man can save the nation from a threat that's growing more frightening by the day.  In this expansion pack we follow Major Jason Richter and his Task Force Talon on a desperate race against time to unravel a gigantic plot to cripple the world's only super-power, with connections back to the Consortium, the shadowy organization we got to know in Direct Action.  Aside from theaters of war ranging from New York and Manhattan to Cuba, Mexico and Florida, in this installment we also take the fight to the murky waters in between&amp;mdash;as we're introduced to modern naval combat in the same ultra-realistic style as we did on land in Direct Action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
