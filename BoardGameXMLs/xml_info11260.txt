							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naval Wargame Rules for the Ironclad Era</name>
									
			<description>The object of these rules is to reproduce the tactics of naval warfare in the period 1860 to 1880. This was the time when naval architecture and warfare underwent fundamental changes. No longer the majestic lines of the &amp;ldquo;wooden walls&amp;rdquo;, now the three-decker with smoke belching from funnels looking out of place between the masks, the awkward shapes of the American Civil War vessels and finally the multitude of one off designs which prevailed until the start of the Pre-Dreadnought era. Tactics were dictated by the great variety of vessels and weapons available, (an homogeneous fleet being unknown) and sometimes by the restricted sea-space available. I have tried to reflect these problems and changes in this set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play the game, players will require the following equipment:&lt;br/&gt;Metric rule    &lt;br/&gt;Angle indicator    &lt;br/&gt;Cotton wool.&lt;br/&gt;Turning circle (see Appendix)    &lt;br/&gt;Protractor    &lt;br/&gt;Damage Control Chart for each vessel&lt;br/&gt;A pair of decimal dice When used as a pair 00 shall represent 100. when used individually zero shall represent 10. Models with removable masts for sailing vessels. Details of armor, armament, speed, dimensions (free board, length, breadth and draught), whether single or twin screwed for each vessel being used. Position of the vessels&amp;rsquo; engines should be known as they are not always below water - if unknown assume them to be below water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
