			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heritage is a free and generic, universal roleplaying system that is diceless and character-focused.  It's primary strength is shared storytelling.  Characters are built form a list of Traits--narrative tags and elements.  They may include attributes, skills, advantages, disadvantages, and so forth--but these will all be represented as narrative elements.  Each Trait has an associated level of influence on the character (Mild, Strong, or Extreme).  Most character Traits can be activated only by the expenditure of Plot Points, which a character accumulates (from experience) and spends.  Activating a Trait may cost more than one Plot Point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published as a series of 10 HTML pages on various game topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
