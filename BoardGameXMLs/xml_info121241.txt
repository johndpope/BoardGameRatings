			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerer Lord is a turn-based fantasy wargame, published in PSS's Wargamers Series. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sorcerer Lord is a solo fantasy wargame simulating the invasion of the ancient lands of Galanor by the eveil sorcerer ruler of the Northern Shadowlands - the Shadowlord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You as the player must gather the free forces of Galanor and stem the advancing might of the Shadowlord before you can earn the title SORCERER LORD. You can call upon the ancient battle magic of Galanors warlike ancestry, and the rune rings will hum to the force of your powerful spell casting - but the Shadowlord has also learnt their secrets so control of the rings is essential of the malignant invader and his Demons of Chaos are to be defeated.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has many traditional wargame features (hexagonal grid, IGO-UGO turn structure). Magic is abstracted (spellcasters give combat bonuses), leadership is important (leaders can mobilize troops and other leaders in friendly cities), as well as terrain (troops gain substantial combat bonuses if they fight on their prefered terrain).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
