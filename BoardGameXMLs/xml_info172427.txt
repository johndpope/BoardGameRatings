							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterball: Team Legion Arena â€“ The Colosseum</name>
									
			<description>Metroplex Roma boasts an exact replica of the ancient Roman Colosseum, but at twice the size! Plus, it sits atop the Caesarium Arcology, making it one of the most recognizable points of the Roman skyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, gladiators fought each other and wild animals in the Colosseum. SPQR has opted to emulate this in the Legion&amp;rsquo;s home arena by unleashing random mavericks into the games. These athletes owe allegiance to no team, and earn money for each athlete that they slaughter! This results in a very chaotic game as the wild mavericks engage in all sorts of mayhem. Indeed, sometimes they even help a team that they might like. Often, Legion benefits from this maverick benevolence, making opposing teams wonder if there is some corruption going on. No proof of such has ever been presented, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, some mavericks are more popular than others. Simba Khan elicits the most fan excitement, of course. Other butchers are also favorites, such as The Barbarian, Warren Johnston, Sandy Petersen, the Unspeakable One, and Four-Fisted Farouk. Razors are the least favorite, of course, because the fans want wild mavericks who can inflict maximum damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colosseum is an arena board for Slaughterball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rules:&lt;br/&gt;The Legion pits include spaces called Maverick Pillars, indicated by the M. These spaces block movement and no athlete can enter them. However, random mavericks appear on them to wreak havoc with all teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the goals are opened, the first maverick is revealed. Draw a random maverick card and place the matching maverick figure on a random Maverick Pillar. This is a Wild Maverick, who owes allegiance to no single team. It is his job to cause as much mayhem as possible, attacking and thwarting all teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To simulate this, each coach can control any wild maverick during their Onslaught phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
