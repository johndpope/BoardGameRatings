			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A marvelous manual of mythic magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This incredible supplement is a massive expansion to the mythic spellcasting options presented in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures hardcover, including mythic versions of every single spell in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook that is not already detailed in the mythic rules. This product contains over 400 mythic spells from cantrips and orisons to 9th-level spells, as well as complete spell lists for every spellcasting core class, providing a detailed reference of mythic and augmented mythic spells from class spell lists for bards, clerics, druids, paladins, rangers, sorcerers, and wizards, as well as cleric domain spells and sorcerer bloodline spells. In addition, this product contains several new mythic feats and path abilities to enable characters to make better use of these expanded spell offerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 100-page full-color reference has not only elegant and innovative design by the same authors that brought you a large number of the mythic spells in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures, but also the beautiful production values and top-notch functionality you expect from Legendary Games, with internal and external hyperlinking and indexing, allowing you to jump from lists to individual spells. If you're implementing the mythic rules in your campaign, or even if you're just curious about exploring the possibilities that mythic spells allow, you cannot miss Mythic Magic: Core Spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
