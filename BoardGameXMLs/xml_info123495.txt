			<description>The sleeping dragon is protecting her stash of golden eggs, and she won&amp;rsquo;t be pleased to wake and find there are lizards sharing space in her warm nest. Help the lizards escape without breaking any of her precious eggs. It takes a careful hand to remove the lizards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sleeping Dragon molded piece is placed in the center of the table, with 29 Lizards and 15 Golden Eggs placed on top of it.  On your turn, use your Pinchers to try to remove once of the Lizards from the dragon:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- If you are successful without anything falling off the dragon, place the Lizard in front of you.  Well done!  You also get to keep any other Lizards that are attached!&lt;br/&gt; - If anything falls off the dragon, your turn ends immediately, but you can keep any Lizard already in your Pinchers (and any other Lizards attached to it).  Any Lizards that fall off are placed in the box, and any Golden Eggs that fall are placed in front of you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all Lizards are removed from the dragon, the game ends.  For each Golden Egg in front of you, you must return a Lizard!  After accounting for all Golden Eggs, the player with the most Lizards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Visual Mapping &amp;amp; Analysis, Eye-Hand Coordination, Concentration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
