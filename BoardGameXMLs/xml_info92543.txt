			<description>Now all of Count Hogarth's children have come of age it is time for them to prove themselves independently.   The Count has given each of them a small sum of his fortune to invest in building their own settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The settlements must be filled with pleasure, be plentiful and ruled with an iron fist of power.  Without all of these elements it will not be exquisite and if it is anything less than exquisite you will be  banished, deep within the cellars of the Count's castle never to return again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one child shall be the Count's future successor and you better make sure that it is you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exquisite rivalry is an auction game of 3 to 4 players based in a medieval setting.  Players compete to bid on different elements to improve their town.  The winner of each round getting first pick of the cards and the loser collecting the most gold in return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has managed to gain the highest majority in two out of the three elements required to impress Count Hogarth: Pleasure, Plenty and Power&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
