							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psychedelic Cipher Caper</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the late 60's.  A spy is selling government secrets by encoding them into the artwork of psychedelic posters.  The transfer point is Sy's Psychedelic Disco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suspects include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sy Silver - owner of Sy's Psychedelic Disco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thunder Showers - TV weatherman who is remarkably vain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;April Showers &amp;ndash; Ex-wife of Thunder Showers, April is a Go-Go dancer at Sy's Psychedelic Disco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May Flowers - A genuine child of the 60's, May is a hippy flower child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lenny &amp;quot;Thinker&amp;quot; Spencer - a philosophical draft-dodger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jean Boaz - a dreamy poet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ralph Rubble - a light-hearted jokester, who seldom takes anything seriously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teresa Wainwright - a stuck-up rich kid who acts as though she shuns the money upon which she so richly lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike a lot of other murder mystery games where you ad-lib, this one provides a script for each player.  This is a great way to introduce people into these types of parties.  Next time they will feel more comfortable if you choose one where they have to hold a conversation on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attire and prop suggestions are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
