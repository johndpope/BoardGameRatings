			<description>With M. ARKWRIGHT&amp;rsquo;S invention of the liquid automaton FLURO, civilization as we know it has been TRANSFORMED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not an industry is left that does not employ FLURO WORKERS in its operations. Their work is FLAWLESS, their efforts TIRELESS, and in the event of industrial accident, their forms REPLACEABLE.&lt;br/&gt; Through use of the M Arkwright&amp;rsquo;s patented TURBINE invention, Fluro creation is UNRESTRAINED, flexible enough to bring ANIMATION to absolutely ANY LIQUID. The INFINITE ADAPTABILITY of these life-like machines makes them a force greater even than NATURE HERSELF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the phenomenal success of this invention, ALL EYES are upon M. Arkwright as he prepares his next great invention, a BUILDING-SIZED creation of UNKNOWN PURPOSE, known only as THE ACCELERATOR.&lt;br/&gt; JOIN US as we venture into this new age of LIMITLESS WONDER and POSSIBILITY, and enter the world of VESSEL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
