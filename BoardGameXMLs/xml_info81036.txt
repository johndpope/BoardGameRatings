			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embark on a quest to build your all-time fantasy baseball team by competing against opponents while managing a salary cap to become the best General Manager in baseball history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your fantasy team with the roster of trading cards provided or use your own trading cards from any era to enhance your roster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;Players pick up challenge cards in the categories they are trying to advance in, example &amp;quot;Hits&amp;quot;, a sample of one question would be &amp;quot;how many career Hits does your opponent's 3rd Baseman have? Your opponent will then tell you who their 3rd Baseman (trading card) is and the last year of statistics on his/her card. For Example, &amp;quot;My 3rd Baseman is Wade Boggs and the last year of stats is 1991. You must then make your best guess as to how many Hits you think Wade Boggs had by the end of the 1991 season. The closer you are to the correct answer, the further up the fantasy charts you go in the Hits category. So....the more you know about Wade Boggs and how many Hits he averaged, the better guess you can make as your answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't ever have to be exact, but the closer you are to the correct answer the faster you move up the fantasy category charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
