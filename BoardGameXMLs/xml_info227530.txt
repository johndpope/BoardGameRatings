							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Good Old Game of Proverbs</name>
									
			<description>The game consists of 96 small cards, each with a Proverb written upon it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is selected to leave the room and be the Guesser.&lt;br/&gt;All other players choose one of the Proverbs from the box.&lt;br/&gt;Each of these players, in order, are given ONE word from the chosen Proverb, and then the Guesser is invited back in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guesser is then to ask one player at a time a Question.  The player must answer him, but he must include the word from the Proverb he was given, in his answer. &lt;br/&gt;The Guesser continues asking Questions to players, to which they answer with inclusion of the given Proverb word, until the Guesser can figure out and cite The Proverb.&lt;br/&gt;The player who gave the final answer, which allowed the Guesser to cite the correct Proverb, is then the Guesser, and play repeats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
