							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mystaran Armoury</name>
									
			<description>A Guide to Armour, Shields, Weapons, Firearms, &amp;amp; Siege Engines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This manual was began to gather together, in a single supplement, all the rules concerning armour, shields, and barding from the various Mystaran manuals and in those of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2nd Edition), along with all the descriptions of the various types of weapons from the fantasy worlds of TSR (now Wizards of the Coast), and the rules concerning mastery with weapons (weapon mastery &amp;ndash; a system introduced in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Set 4: Master Rules). This book therefore replaces the old Manual of Weapon &amp;amp; Mastery written by Marco Dalmonte in 1998, adding new information and new rules taken partially from MonkeyGod Enterprises supplement From Stone to Steel, which is what I consider the definitive guide of the history of weapons &amp;ndash; from the dawn of man until the Renaissance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
