			<description>This game is not to be confused with SPI&amp;rsquo;s Spies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two pawns, a tall one and a short pawn. Each player designates  one pawn an active agent and the other pawn a decoy agent. To win the game the player must get the active agent to the train station with three or more pieces of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard represents a seedy part of an anonymous city. Designated buildings in this neighborhood contain the information. Players spend their turns skulking around the neighborhood collecting the information. Players may leave bombs in buildings as booby traps for unsuspecting opponents or attack them using guns and knives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
