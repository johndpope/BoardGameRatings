			<description>Captain Cook : Voyage of Discovery is a simple roll &amp;amp; move educational game produced by Studio Press and the NSW Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service in 1969. The box proclaims:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Relive the perils of Cook's historic first voyage...watch out for unfriendly natives...unfavourable winds...dangerous reefs and look forwards to exciting discovery unlimited..'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players win the game by being the first to get their 'Endeavour' from the Portsmouth, England, to Botany Bay in Australia.  The players move forward or backwards around the board track according to the cards that are drawn in sequence. No dice are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in the game are drafted randomly into several different roles of the Endeavour: Bosun, 1st Mate, Joseph Banks, and of course Captain Cook.  Cook has a few privileges and winners of the race get to play him in other rounds of the game. Cook moves first and is essentially the dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with an educational supplement published by the NSW Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service. The playing cards also contain illustrations and facts about some of the Flora &amp;amp; Fauna of New South Wales, Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also came with 'historic cut out medals' that players were encouraged to pin on themselves in order to add the element of role-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
