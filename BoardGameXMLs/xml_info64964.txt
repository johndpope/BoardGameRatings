			<description>This game is played with two standard decks of cards. One of them is dealt to the players evenly (the remaining cards remain face down). Then everyone has half minute to memorize his cards. Then the cards from the other pack are revealed one at a time, and players can claim they have the matching pair among their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After going through the deck every player scores 1 point for his card if he card alone claimed it, and p points if it was claimed by someone else as well, where p is the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
