							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume XIII</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XIII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 22 mythic spells, from longstrider to message. A mythic mage&amp;rsquo;s lucubration gets you two spells for the price of one, and even allows you to regain any spell you know, instead of one that was prepared and expended. Live in luxury in a mythic mage&amp;rsquo;s magnificent mansion, which is not only larger and longer lasting, but comes with more competent servants, and can be made visible, allowing you to set up shop in style. Among other improvements, a mythic magic circle against chaos allows you to trap any chaotic outsider in the circle, instead of just summoned ones, and a mythic magic jar takes all the guesswork out of picking a target, while also safeguarding you against the dangers of your host dying. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
