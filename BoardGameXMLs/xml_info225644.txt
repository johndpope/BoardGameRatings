			<description>You are an alchemist for &amp;quot;The Kingdom&amp;quot;. In order to keep your job and become the Royal Alchemist you must make the most &amp;quot;Coin&amp;quot; for the Treasury. Starting with only Air, Earth, Fire, and Water as ingredients, play Formula cards from your hand to make valuable Materials. These Materials are worth Coin towards winning, but can also be used as ingredients for Formulas that steal, transform, destroy or regenerate cards.&lt;br/&gt;      Alchenemy combines elements of resource management (cards that count towards winning can be discarded to perform actions), &amp;ldquo;take that!&amp;rdquo; (inevitably, someone breaks out the Aqua Regia and dissolves something you were really attached to), and a novel mechanic that gives players some control over when the game ends: you choose whether to draw from a common, limitless deck of basic resources or a limited, personal deck of more powerful cards &amp;ndash; with the catch that the game ends when any personal stack is exhausted. Two, three, or four people may play and it should take first time players about an hour to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
