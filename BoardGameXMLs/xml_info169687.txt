			<description>A Finnish board game classic from the 1980s in which the players take the role of taxi drivers in an imaginary town. The aim is to collect as much money as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start from the taxi station of their choice. Everyone picks up a customer and an address from the yellow customer deck. The taxi fee is determined by counting the spaces between the destination and the current location of the taxi car. Now, all the players must reach their destinations on the map by throwing two 6-sided dice and moving according to them on the board. When a customer reaches his destination, the player must pick up a red destination card: Will the customer be able to pay after all? Or will he even tip you some extra? Or maybe rob you of half of your money?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After successfully completing a trip, the players return to a taxi station to pick up a new customer. Whoever has the most money after a predetermined time or other limit (e.g. end of deck) is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
