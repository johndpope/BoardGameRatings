			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Master System game Taz-Mania (in-game subtitle In Search of the Lost Seabirds) is a platform game.  You control Taz and you are trying to get to the end of the game and find the lost nest of the giant Tazmanian seabirds to steal their eggs for an omelette.  You can jump and spin to attack enemies or destroy objects blocking the path.  Spinning uses up your power quickly (which then automatically refills) and walking into enemies or bombs uses up your life (which can be replenished by eating food).  There are invincibility and extra life power-ups, and there are giant springs allowing for higher jumps.  Each of the five stages consists of two levels and then a boss fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Master System game follows the same basic storyline as the Genesis/Mega Drive and Game Gear Taz-Mania games however the gameplay and levels differ between all three games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Master System game was developed by Sega Enterprises (Sega Japan) and was a PAL-only release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
