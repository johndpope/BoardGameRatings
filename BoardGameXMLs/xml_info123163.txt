			<description>On a small gameboard the players have to us their piece to create a row of four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing pieces for are shaped like egg timers. Each player has a side based on the color of the egg timers which are red and green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 hexagonal and 4 round timers of each colour. There are 4 smooth topped times and 4 rough top times of each colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to create a row of four timers with the same feature.&lt;br/&gt; - Identical by colour, so 4 reds or 4 greens.&lt;br/&gt; - Identical by shape, so 4 round, or 4 hex.&lt;br/&gt; - Identical by surface, so 4 with a smooth surface or 4 with a rough surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns each player places one of his timers (i.e. his color) on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at one point a row of 4 timers with at least one identical feature (i.e. color, shape, or surface texture) is created, then the game is over and the winner is the player that formed the line of four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
