							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tower of Dr. Alienstein (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generic Adventure Location for Your Role Playing Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its Alive-Alive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A creepy, crumbling tower sits out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by a run-down graveyard. Loud laughter erupts from the confines of the shadowed place. Thunder cracks and lightning crackles, drawn to electrical rods on the roof. In that moment of brilliaqnt light all manner of horrors are glimpsed: strange, abominations shambling about the grave yard, a hulking brute on the roof; and a tall, pale alien thing in a lab coat. As the rain pouds down. You check your weapons and move in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready for frightfully creepy entertainment, as the players in your role playing game must confront the uncanny horrors of this unique location, rich with campy creatures and sinister alien plots. It is timeless pulp, fitting for the late Victorian through today. The game includes gamemaster maps of each level, descriptions of abominations and  the masters of the tower, Dr. &lt;br/&gt;Viktor Shelley and the menacing Dr. Alienstein. The book is generic and easily adaptable to most games, but just in case, we have included an alternative skill system and conversion tables so that you may more easily bring this hide-away of horrors to your gaming table. Need some unusual twists, we have included the Cosmic Eye; a series of tables to help you find inspiration and keep your ideas fresh and lively...er, well...un-lively&amp;hellip;anyway. Easy to use comparative tables help to describe how the ranks in the game measure up to the real world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are easily adapable, with their conditions and abilities described in simple terms. You will be up and running in minutes. Have a blast and well...break a leg. Don't leave it behind; there is no telling what Dr. Alienstein might do with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Horror Stories Always Have Sequels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 25 Story Hooks to Keep Your Characters Guessing. Our story hooks provide you with inspiration and alternatives for what type of story you may want to run. These story hooks, range from the macrabre to the kooky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What this Book Contains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Four Levels of the tower, one sub-level, and the roof&lt;br/&gt;     Descriptions of Dr. Viktor Shelley, Dr. Alienstein, the Creature; and a group of undead, scientifically augmented monstrosities.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 25 story hooks to keep the stories coming&lt;br/&gt;     The Cosmic Eye, a collection of tables that make answering simple questions a lot more fun&lt;br/&gt;     Comparative Tables to gain real perspective of what the simple ranking system means&lt;br/&gt;     Conversion tables for converting the generic ranking system for statistics to other common dice mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Like a play set for RPGs. The Tower of Doctor Alienstein is a generic product, intended to be dropped into a pre-existing campaign. All descriptions and statistics are given in broad, easily adaptable terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weirdly horrific, this book will quickly be one of your favorites. Definatly an adventure location that will be talked about again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
