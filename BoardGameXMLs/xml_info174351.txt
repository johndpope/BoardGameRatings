			<description>A splendid action game for young people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourteen perforated sheets are provided and on each are 6 pairs of words which can be separated by tearing along the Perforation which runs down the middle. Each pair consists of related words, e.g., BEE&amp;mdash;H1VE, BIRD&amp;mdash;NEST, etc.&lt;br/&gt;INSTRUCTIONS TO M.C.&lt;br/&gt;PREPARATION FOR PLAY&lt;br/&gt;Tear each sheet along the perforations so that there are 168 slips in all. The first halves are distinguished from the second halves by the spot in the top right c&amp;oacute;rner of the former.&lt;br/&gt;Distribute the second halves about the house or hall with the printed faces upwards and retain the first halves.&lt;br/&gt;List the players by name or number on a score sheet.&lt;br/&gt;Give each player a &amp;ldquo;first half&amp;rdquo; slip.&lt;br/&gt;HOW PLAY PROCEEDS&lt;br/&gt;At the word &amp;quot; GO &amp;rdquo; the players set off to find the counterpart of the slips they hold. A player does not know what the word is, but on seeing the words on the &amp;ldquo;second half&amp;rdquo; slips he will recognise the one he is looking for by its close connection with the word on the slip he is carrying.&lt;br/&gt;When a player beiieves he has found the correct counterpart he presents the two slips to the M.C.; if correct the M.C. records one point for that player and gives him another slip.&lt;br/&gt;If during the game a player presents an incorrect pair of slips to the M.C. he must resume looking for the correct counterpart and is not given another &amp;ldquo;first half&amp;rdquo; slip until he finds it.&lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;If he cannot l&amp;oacute;cate the counterpart and would prefer to have another &amp;ldquo;first half&amp;rdquo; slip, he is entitled to do so but one point is deducted from his score.&lt;br/&gt;THE WINNER is the player who scores the hlghest number of points in an agreed time or when the whole of the slips have been used.&lt;br/&gt;The material in each packet provides for about eight young people. If more are taking part extra perforated sheets should be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;The game can be varied by distributing the first halves and giving the players the second halves.&lt;br/&gt;SOLUTION SHEET&lt;br/&gt;On this are listed the correctly paired words.&lt;br/&gt;N.B.&amp;mdash;The pairs of words have been so chosen that there should be little doubt in a player&amp;rsquo;s mind as to whether he has found the correct counter&amp;not;part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
