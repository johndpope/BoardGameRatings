			<description>The cure for whatever ails you! Hypochondria is a rummy-style game in which players compete to have their hands of illness cards cured by the rotating staff of physician cards. Each turn, players draw a new hand of illnesses and try to match sets of them to specialists and physicians, each of whom will treat a different sort of set. After all specialists have seen a patient, or a player manages to cure their entire hand, a round ends and players earn points for illnesses left uncured in their hands. At the end of several rounds, the player with the lowest number of points is the least sick, and therefore the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
