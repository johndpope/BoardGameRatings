			<description>Each player has 12 chips in 6 colors and a small board with corresponding color fields plus two free spots. Into these, two chips are put. The players then take turns rolling two color dice. When one or both colors match, the players can take the chip(s) and put them in their color fields, and new chip(s) are put into the free spots. The first player to fill up all 12 color fields is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is entirely luck driven with no strategic decisions whatsoever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
