							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Syndicate V: The Corporate Future</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syndicate is a fast-paced, simple role playing game of the near future. Life in near future is cheap and short, and players must always be careful and on the edge. Syndicate was originally meant for realistic cinematic campaigns, but is good for any campaign with need for fast realistic system. Cinematic does not mean that players cannot die. They die, and very easily. Cinematic in Syndicate means that players can make feats typical to action movies and is not hit as easily as common folk, making the game session more like action movies than realistic real-life stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syndicate V: The Corporate Future is a Cyberpunk setting developed around the RIP game system.  Prior editions of the setting were similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
