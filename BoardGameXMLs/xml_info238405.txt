			<description>A calming walk through the park is nice&amp;hellip; but what if you could design the park?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Park is a unique card-laying game designed for up to six players. You can even play it as a solo challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, a player must score the most points before the end of the game.  Points are scored by connecting the paths on the playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
