							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jack Hobbs Table Cricket</name>
									
			<description>An action cricket game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the batsman, the other the bowler. The two, rather scary, figures have handles so that their arm can be pulled back and then released forward. The bowler's arm will launch a ball at the batsman. He, in reply, will try to swing his bat and connect with the ball.&lt;br/&gt;The player who scores the most runs (i.e. hits) will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir John Berry &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; Hobbs (1882 - 1963) is widely regarded as one of the best opening batsmen of all time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
