							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Continental Soccer Game</name>
									
			<description>An action football (soccer) game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must assemble the game before you can start play. The board has four legs and is, in effect, a table. Insert a number of rods on each side. When assembled properly, the rod handles will freely rotate when you twist them. Along any rod there will be a number of football players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the ball is in play you can twist a player so that he 'kicks' the ball. Of course, your opponent is trying to do the same thing at the same time so play becomes frenetic from the start. The onject is to kick the ball into your opponent's goal. The player who scores the most goals, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These type of games are most often seen at gaming arcades in Britain and I guess the same applies to the States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
