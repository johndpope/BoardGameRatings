			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other word games, in WOW: World of Words there's no waiting for turns. When the timer starts, all players make as many words as they can in just one minute. Turn over a blue card for the first letter and turn over a red card for the last letter. Players score points for each unique word of five or more letters, with bonus points for longer words. Special cards add exciting twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Report from &amp;quot;World of Words&amp;quot; annual convention:'&lt;br/&gt;I have news that I hope you'll be happy about.  Our Games Gang play-tested 12 new word games.  WOW was undoubtedly the simplest of the 12 games we played, and this is a tough crowd.  But we all loved playing it.  Sometimes simpler is better, especially in a situation like Words Weekend when getting up and running on a new game is so great.  Gloria totally concurs, too.  We loved the elegance and purity of the game -- nothing is extraneous or fussy.  I think this may be the first time we have ever played a card game at Mohonk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
