							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Behind the Mask: H.A.C.K.S.A.W.</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The Behind the Mask series goes beyond the media hype and comic book exagerations to uncover the real people who wear the costumes, fight the super villains, and live with the moniker, &amp;quot;hero.&amp;quot; Where did they come from? What do they want out of life? Who are their most hated aversaries? Each issue of Behind the Mask asks one hero to answer these questions uncensored and unscripted, no subjects are off limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features Include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Full M&amp;amp;M stats -PL12&lt;br/&gt;    Areas of Specialty, Methods, and Objectives&lt;br/&gt;    Allies and Enemies&lt;br/&gt;    Personality&lt;br/&gt;    Origin&lt;br/&gt;    Combat Tactics&lt;br/&gt;    And we make a few sugestions on how to incorporate the hero into your own RPGs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue we get up close and personal with one of the most talked-about heroes in recent history, the H.A.C.K.S.A.W. Combat Droid. Believed destroyed last year in a highly publicized battle with General Steele, the H.A.C.K.S.A.W. has recently returned to active duty with a new chassis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
