			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winter has come to the Forgotten Realms! In Deadwinter Disappearance, our heroes are tasked to aid a village where the children have been vanishing in the middle of the night. What horrors await the adventurers in the haunted woods of the winter-witch? Can the characters track down her candy cottage before it&amp;rsquo;s too late?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A colorful winter story, loosely based on the German fairy tale Hansel and Gretyl. Deadwinter Disapearance features a haunted forest, a talking bridge, and a horde of evil snow men!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadwinter Disappearance is a winter-themed adventure for three to five player characters of 5th level. It can be played as a self-contained adventure, or inserted into a longer campaign. It is simple to set-up and run with minimal preparation or resources. Deadwinter Disappearance does not require any maps, and the adventure can be played without a grid, if you prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
