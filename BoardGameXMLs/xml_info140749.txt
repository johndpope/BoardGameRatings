							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cultic Cryptomancia</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cults are a classic element in fantasy from the historical to the horrific, and the Cultic Cryptomancia explores the uses of cults of every kind in your campaign, from secret sects that live in the shadows and prey upon the weak-willed or disillusioned dregs of society to the near-forgotten relic rituals echoing down from ancient times and still practiced by scattered adherents, covens, and rural traditions handed down from the oldest folkways far from the watchful eyes of the younger gods and civilized ideals of modern society. This product is replete with rules elements to bring any cult to life, including archetypes for apostate inquisitors and sublime bards, and the  Eldritch mystery for oracles containing 14 new revelations. For cultic characters of all types there are 8 new feats, from Ectastic Euphoria and Flagellant Focus to Sacrificial Summons and the dreaded Heart Ripper. Of course, no cultic product would be complete without a trove of forbidden magical mysteries, with 13 new spells including exsanguinate, torch-wielding mob, and orgiastic rite. The Cultic Cryptomancia is an ideal complement to a Gothic Adventure Path or any game where characters encounter eldritch writings, forbidden rites, and the masked, robed, or empty-eyed cultists who have given themselves body, mind, and soul to powers beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Jason Nelson with the Legendary Games design team of Clinton J. Boomer, Liz Courts, Crystal Frasier, Matt Goodall, Jim Groves, Tim Hitchcock, Neil Spicer, Todd Stewart, Russ Taylor, Greg A. Vaughan, and Clark Peterson, with amazing illustrations by Tim Kings-Lynne and Colby Stevenson. Who better to provide you with creepy constructs and alternate rules for creating and using them in your Adventure Path campaign than the very writers of those adventures themselves? Answer: no one. Legendary Games Adventure Path Plug-Ins supplement and enrich your campaign experience, offering adventures and supporting products that incorporate and expanding upon unique concepts, themes, and rules subsystems introduced in the Adventure Paths while filling in the background characters, items, and locations that make those adventures come alive in delightful (and often dangerous) detail. Legendary Games combines stellar writing talent with innovative layout and product design and top-notch artistic values that we think will bring you back again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check out this 14-page gothic-themed accessory and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
