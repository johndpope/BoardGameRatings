			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the several ways to advance a creature, adding racial Hit Dice is the least effective. Giving a creature class levels grants them access to spells, class abilities and massive ability score increases, while applying templates can grant a host of new abilities. When you increase racial Hit Dice, often all you get is an increase in hit points, a better BAB, new feats, and better saves, which a creature given class levels gets as well as all those tasty class abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing racial Hit Dice often gives a creature that is too weak for its CR. There are few if any rules for scaling racial special abilities to keep them challenging for higher level parties. This ebook offers upgrades to the special abilities of 20 core monsters, from the ankheg and black pudding to the gibbering mouther and yeti, enabling the GM to keep those creatures relevant at higher challenge ratings with increased racial Hit Dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab a copy of this ebook today and use the 80 plus abilities inside to make your creatures unique and more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancement powers is a Creature Powers Sourcebook for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, suitable for GMs and Players of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This material can easily be adapted to fit into any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
