							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tri-Checkers</name>
									
			<description>This game has the same object as traditional checkers: either capture all your opponents' men or trap them from moving. The difference in this case is that there are two opponents rather than one, and the last player standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard is adapted from an American board; that is, eight red-and-black squares along the home or back row with the dark square to the player's left. This board consists of three 24-square grids connected in a Y-shape. The fourth row of each grid is elongated and stylized to allow the board to connect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard reverse is a typical, 8x8 American-style chess board. The game includes rules of play both for traditional checkers and Tri-checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
