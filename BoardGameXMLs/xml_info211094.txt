							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cretacea: The game of gargantuan survival</name>
									
			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cretacea is a game designed for using miniature dinosaurs in skirmish style wargaming where the primary objective is to survive and dominate. Cretacea is inspired mainly by the great dinosaur documentaries of the late 90&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short gaming rule set will allow you to grab some dinosaurs, terrain and be gaming in no time. Cretacea is designed to be used with 1/100th scale dinosaurs (roughly similar to 10mm regimental scale) but you could use any dinosaur toy or model as long as their scale is relative to each other. Bases of the dinosaurs should not exceed their physical dimensions to any particular extent and they should be based individually, even small and tiny dinosaurs. Tokens have been included in this set for every dino listed! Each game lasts about 30-45 minutes and is more about acting on your opportunities than being overly tactical in this way the game often keeps you on your toes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
