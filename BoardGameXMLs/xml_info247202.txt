							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guild Ball: The Ratcatcher&#039;s Guild â€“ Paying The Piper</name>
									
			<description>Vermin, that&amp;rsquo;s all they are, more akin to their quarry than to men like you or me. Led by fear and guile, the Ratcatcher&amp;rsquo;s are vicious thugs trying to force others to dance to their tune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; Mallet, Mason&amp;rsquo;s Guild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the depths of the miserable forgotten undercities, the Ratcatcher&amp;rsquo;s swarm to the pitch eager to bring rot and ruin to any who get in their way. The despot captain Piper is the worst of the lot; unleashing haunting melodies that permeate through the pitch - compelling not only his own team into the fray, but luring the enemy to dance to his jig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offering an exciting new method of board control, coaches of the Ratcatcher&amp;rsquo;s will spread disease and poison throughout the opposition. Sapping their strength and will to resist, the influence of the Piper spreads across the pitch like a plague until eventually everyone&amp;rsquo;s dancing to the master&amp;rsquo;s tune. The Ratcatcher&amp;rsquo;s are a formidable threat on any pitch they scurry onto, perfect for the coach who enjoys toying with their opponents before springing the final trap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neglected and shunned no longer, the time has come to pay the Piper - this set includes a ball, 6 player cards, bases, 3D terrain piece, goalpost and 6 players: Piper, Squeak, Miasma, Pelage, Skulk, Scourge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
