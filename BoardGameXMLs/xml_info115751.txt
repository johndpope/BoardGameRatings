							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner</name>
									
			<description>There was a time when mankind and monsters coexisted in peace, but The Great Disaster put an end to that era. The world changed radically, with all the monsters of the planet disappearing in an instant, leaving behind only jewels that radiated tremendous energy. This energy source became known as jewel power and enabled the survivors to revive their civilization. Now, the peace achieved through jewel power has been endangered by a new threat. Strange Abominations have mysteriously appeared and unleashed legions of monsters on the helpless populace. To combat them, an organization known as the Order was established to study jewels and harness their power. Their research led to the formation of an elite class of warriors called Jewel Summoners, those with the power to summon monsters from jewels and control them in combat. With the aid of the Order, it is up to these powerful Jewel Summoners to restore peace once again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
