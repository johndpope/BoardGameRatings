			<description>Players are princesses who want to charm the Prince.&lt;br/&gt;For this they must create the perfect love potion by collecting the most secret ingredients with the same color in the player's cauldron, while spoiling the potions of the other players with differently colored ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll die and may choose and put ingredient with the same color to the cauldron with the same color so that other players can&amp;acute;t see the color of this ingredient. If someone thinks the ingredient is incorrect She may cry out: Charming. If You were correct You may put any of Your ingredient to the cauldron of this player. If You lied She may put any of Her ingredient to Your cauldron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player who runs out of ingredients may announce that the love potion is ready.  The player with the most ingredients matching the color of her cauldron wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
