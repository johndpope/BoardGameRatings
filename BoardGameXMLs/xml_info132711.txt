			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blast-A-Way is a 3D, physics-based puzzle game featuring 6 themed worlds and 96 individual stages. To solve each level, the player must rescue three &amp;quot;boxies&amp;quot; and reach the exit. Boxies are usually trapped in the level geometry, and the player uses a variety of tools to free them, including impact bombs, sticky bombs, and splash bombs, teleporters, and colonizers. Sticky bombs allow for timing delays, and may also be used as a risky way to move the player from one area of the level to another (literally blasting them across gaps). Teleporters allow the player to travel between non-contiguous areas. All bombs and teleporters are color-coded, interacting with surfaces of the matching color. Later in the game, &amp;quot;colonizer&amp;quot; bombs may be used to change the color of various surfaces, and &amp;quot;splash&amp;quot; bombs absorb colors as they bounce toward their target. Lastly, some levels include energy fields that alter a bombs color as it passes through, as well as reflectors and launchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
