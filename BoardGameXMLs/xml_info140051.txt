			<description>Carrier based flight is the ultimate challenge in aviation and in Carrier Strike Force you can climb into the cockpit of three super detailed high performance aircraft from around the world and land or take-off from the deck of moving aircraft carriers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carrier Strike Force has a truly impressive fleet of aircraft that will keep you on the edge of your seat and a set of 6 exciting missions plus a further 6 open-ended practice missions for users of Flight Simulator X to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HMS Illustrious, or &amp;ldquo;Lusty&amp;rdquo; as she is known by her crew, is the second of three Invincible Class aircraft carriers and features the AV-8B II Plus Harrier aircraft similar to that on the front cover. 4 Gas Turbine Olympus engines power &amp;ldquo;Lusty&amp;rdquo; making her a marinised version of Concorde, with a top speed in excess of 30 knots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USS Bonhomme Richard is an amphibious assault ship with a primary mission of embarking, deploying and landing elements of a Marine force in amphibious assault operations by helicopter, landing craft, amphibious vehicles or combination of theses means.  In this package you will be landing a F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter on her decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charles de Gaulle was commissioned in September 2000 and is a 38,000t, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, constructed at Brest in Brittany. Following sea trials in 1999, she had the deck lengthened by 4.4 metres and can operate a fleet of up to 40 aircraft including the Rafale M fighters included in this package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New technology has meant that the aircraft carriers in Carrier Strike Force actually move, presenting the flight simmer with a real challenge to land the aircraft on a moving deck.  The carriers are strategically based around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each aircraft is dressed in authentic paint schemes and with beautifully rendered graphics, including animated flight control surfaces and accurate flight models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
