							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Finger Twister Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a game in Daiso's Joint Party Series of games. &lt;br/&gt;Players place their figures on a small board according to the outcome of spinning a special spinner, which indicates a spscific colour and the finger which must be used to touch a spot with that colour on the board. &lt;br/&gt;Players who are unable to do so lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a different game from the game called 'Finger Twister' in the BGG database. This game uses all five fingers (unlike Finger Twister) and the board has a different arrangement of spots and also includes special spots known as 'breathless points'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instruction under 'breathless point':&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You can touch whom you are interested in through the delicate balance position! Sometimes physical contact bring people together.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there's also a caution on the label: &amp;quot;Please note that this game doesn't always let boy meets girl.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
