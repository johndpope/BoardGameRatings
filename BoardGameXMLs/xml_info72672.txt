			<description>From the box: Ox Blocks is a game for 2 players. The object is to make a straight line of X's or O's horizontally, vertically or diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player elects to play X's, the other O's. Either player may start by rolling any one of the Ox Blocks. If a player throws his own symbol (X or O) he may place it on the board in any position he wishes. If he throws his opponent's symbol, he must still place it on the board. In this case he will try to help his opponent as little as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If either player throws a Block with the open face upwards, he may remove one of his opponent's Blocks from the board. If his opponent has no Blocks on the board, he must remove one of his own Blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to throw the Blocks until one player makes a complete line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
