							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Interpretation of Dreams</name>
									
			<description>Interpretation of Dreams lets everyone play amateur psychiatrist in an unbelievably funny game where with the aid of a specially compiled Dream Dictionary you will get to know yourself and your friends better.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player writes down an account of a dream. The moderator collects all the sheets and reads a dream aloud to the group without identifying the author. The group then identifies the symbol words in the dream and these are looked up in the Dream Dictionary. Each player writes an analysis of the dream, which are read aloud to the group. The players also write down a guess as to who they believe wrote the dream. The winner is the player who has the most correct identifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
