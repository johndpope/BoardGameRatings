			<description>Easily charge and store your Wii Remotes with Nyko&amp;rsquo;s Charge Station for Wii. The Charge Station includes NiMH batteries, exclusively designed for the Wii Remote, each providing up to 25 hours of play time. Each battery is easily recharged by placing the Wii Remote in the charging dock. The charging dock conveniently plugs into any standard wall outlet, allowing for rapid recharging of batteries in 8 hours. The Charge Station includes custom battery covers with contact pass-through points so you can charge the batteries while they are still in the remote. Each battery cover is also rubberized for superior grip during intense gaming sessions. The Charge Station matches the d&amp;eacute;cor and styling of the Wii, and is small enough to fit in any home entertainment center. Compatible with Wii U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Manufacturer's Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
