			<description>To score points by memorizing details from and answering questions about a passage of text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players, either individually or in teams are invited into the world of some of the greatest storytellers ever. Short extracts from famous and classic novels take you into their world of thrills, chills, comedy and romance - but can you memorize what you have read?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can, and can answer your questions correctly, you'll score points. From simple &amp;quot;either/or&amp;quot; questions to real tests of memory and recall.  Memorise is an exciting and tense battle of wit and nerve.  Tactics and strategy may allow you to secure valuable bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is simple to learn and, unlike most question and answer games, requires no previous knowledge.  All the answers are in the passage that you have just read - but can you memorise them?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game also gives you a flavor of the contents of a number of famous and classic novels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Memorise appears to be a reprint of Echelon. The text and question cards are exactly the same, but a cheaper board and playing pieces have been substituted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
