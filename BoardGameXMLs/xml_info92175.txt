			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder is a side-scrolling arcade hack 'n' slash game released in 1992 by Sega. It was the first 32-bit game in the series. It still remains an arcade exclusive as of 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters are Goah the giant, Stern the barbarian, Dora the Kentauride, and Little Trix, a young elf lad who carries a pitchfork. None of the characters from the first game are playable, although Gilius Thunderhead from the first game rides on Goah's back. The main enemy is once again Death Adder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple players could cooperate to complete wrestling moves on one enemy. Depending on the cabinet, the game allowed up to two, three or four simultaneous players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an overall improvement on the original with better sound, graphics, and gameplay. As well as introducing multiple paths to the franchise, the magic aspect was adjusted. Though still found in the classic Golden Axe pots, the magic spells did not increase in power with the number of pots collected but required a set number to work. The Revenge of Death Adder was the only Golden Axe game in which one of the magic attacks was not offensive, as Trix grew apple trees with fruit that replenished health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are allowed to choose different pathways at two two-ways crossroads. Depending on the version, the unchosen paths are skipped entirely or have to be passed later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
