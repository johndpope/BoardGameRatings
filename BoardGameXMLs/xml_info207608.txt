							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Milligan Class Hospital Ship</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to replace the trio of aging Centaur-class hospital ships HMHS Centaur, Polkan and Kinnara in Royal Navy service, the Milligan-class was successfully exported even before the new ship design had been accepted and entered service, eventually serving in several of the larger national navies, system navies and defense forces across both Earth and Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The traditional role of a hospital ship is to provide medical care in times of armed conflict for the naval squadron&amp;rsquo;s personnel and marines it is attached to. But apart from this primary role, hospital ships such as the Milligan-class have a wide variety of secondary roles, often tasked to provide emergency response support where needed. They are in reality fully equipped mobile hospitals that are able to bring medical care directly to the location most needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being only armed with sandcaster turrets and a point defense node array the Milligan-class relies on her ship&amp;rsquo;s identification beacon to announce her non-combatant, humanitarian role within naval service. Society owned hospital ships use the same beacon identification protocol that the military use with appropriate differences to broadcast operator status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 15: Milligan-class Hospital Ship comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The Milligan is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the ship comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action as well as a short story written by Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, these ships could easily be used in any science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
