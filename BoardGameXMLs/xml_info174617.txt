			<description>WW2: Lost Chronicles is a PNP wargame for 1-2 players. The game is a fan made project for fun &amp;amp; sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a tactical wargame based on historical battles &amp;amp; fictional what if battles. Game scale is 200 meters per hex &amp;amp; roughly 10-15 minutes per turn. Game unit is platoon size(company for USSR). A game will last 6 - 12 turns or with a variable turn system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a regimental commander who controls 4 - 9 companies. All companies are color coded &amp;amp; under command of a battalion HQ. A HQ can issue orders to three companies (three colors). Platoons of same color are from same company which should share same morale &amp;amp; training. Morale of a company will vary from scenario to scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air-support, OB artillery, reinforcement, mines, snipers, hidden units, weather change &amp;amp; other unexpected battlefield events will be handled by cards. Leadership will be implemented by command points &amp;amp; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a solitaire mode in which a player will play as a fictional regimental commander who will do daily routines like refit, replace units or send units for patrol &amp;amp; recon when there is no action. Enemy force is unknown until first contact. Your regiment will gain more &amp;amp; better resources if you proof yourself in battle. If you see too many casualties, you may request to retreat from battlefield &amp;amp; end the battle of the day but withdrawal request is not always permitted depending on the overall battle situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a battle-fatigue system. As a regiment commander, you choose which of your one/two battalions or attached companies will be upfront for attack or defense mission. The company will get one fatigue point for mission without contact and two fatigue points for contact with enemy force after each mission. A company's morale will drop by one if fatigue point is 2 or more. So you need to decide whether to send more troops upfront or call troops back for refit to remove fatigue points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
