							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Suite Life Double the Fun Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Turn up cards for points until you decide to stop and you keep your points for that turn. If you keep going, you wager the amount of points you have accumulated and push your luck to gain more with each card you turn up. If you turn up a Moseby, you lose all the points you gained for that turn, UNLESS you get a Joker Zack, which makes you immune to Moseby. Collect pairs of Zack and Cody cards for extra points. The player with the most points when the cards run out is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
