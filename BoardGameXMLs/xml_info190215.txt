							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sociopolio</name>
									
			<description>A veritable relic from the cold war (1974). Sociopolio is played part like Parcheesi and part as Monopoly, and the setting is an imaginary socialist/communist Puerto Rico. The object of the game is to become the &amp;quot;National Work Hero&amp;quot; by reaching the center point of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is color printed and styled as Parcheesi, except for each advancing tile which has text similar to the Monopoly board. The gaming pieces are flat coin-like tokens in transparent acrylic. The currency is black ink over white paper, printed on one side. The currency has pictures of different famous Puertorrican pro-independence figures like Albizu Campos and Lola Rodriguez de Tio and display prominently the phrase &amp;quot;Banco Nacional de Puerto Rico&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;community chest&amp;quot; (with a red star on the back of the card) and &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; (with the Puerto Rican flag) cards have such bonuses as &amp;quot;Merit; you have fulfilled the work assigned to you by the Revolutionary Committee&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Voluntary Work at the Hostos School&amp;quot;. If you are lucky you may even get a &amp;quot;Double ration of fish, pay two pesos&amp;quot;, or a &amp;quot;New pair of shoes&amp;quot;. Instead of advancing to the next railway, you advance to the next &amp;quot;red star&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;flag&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;Along the way, in each space on the board may have hazards, such as &amp;quot;You didn't perform the work assigned, pay a 10 pesos fee&amp;quot; and rewards such as &amp;quot;You helped fixed the neighbors house, earn ten pesos&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owning this game back in the day would have certainly landed your name in a government black list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
