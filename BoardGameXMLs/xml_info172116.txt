			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the Fantastic Four!  You want the Fantastic Four team--Mr. Fantastic, Human Torch, Invisible Woman, and The Thing--to go on an exploration mission with you.  You must reach them all before you can fly away with them.  But Dr. Doom, Mole Man, and Annihilus are out there to prevent you from carrying out your plan.  However, you can count on Silver Surfer to give you a helping hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantastic Four was published as part of the Marvel Comics Super Heroes Game Book, and the board is a double-page spread of the book which is laid flat to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with four markers and rolls two dice (or in this case presses the &amp;quot;electronic die&amp;quot; twice), multiplying the numbers.  They then place a marker on a space that displays the resulting number.  If another marker is already on the space, the marker must be placed on another matching space. If the square has instructions, the player follows those instructions. If the player lands on a space with a villain, their marker is stuck there until all other markers are placed. A Silver Surfer space allows the player to move the marker to any space. The first player to place one marker on each member of the Fantastic Four wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
