							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triple Tier</name>
									
			<description>A game very similar to Sorry.  Players have 5 pieces of three types that they move from their start spaces on tier one, up to their home spaces on tier 3.  Two pieces can only move around the board to the left, two can only move around to the right and one can move in either direction.  Landing on certain spaces by exact count lets you move up to the next tier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by rolling a single die and then picking which of your pieces to move in the direction they are allowed to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
