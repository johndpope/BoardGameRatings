			<description>Funny Farmyard is a card laying game from the turn of the century to create funny combination images of English farm animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 32 card deck is shuffled and dealt equally to the players.  Every card is numbered 1 to 4, the first player plays a #1 card from their hand, the second player a #2 and so on.  If the next player does not have the correct number in sequence, they are skipped over until the 1-4 sequence has been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The four cards are placed close together on the table as each person plays, and the result will be that some extremely funny and curiously-shaped animals will be made.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who plays the fourth card to complete the animal keeps the set.  When all the cards have been played the player with the most sets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
