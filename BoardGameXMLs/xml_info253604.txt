							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strike Team Hydra</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike Team Hydra is a tactical RPG set in the far future. Using the core Demon's Rise game engine, we have made several enhancements to suit the sci-fi setting and emphasize the use of action points. Now every action, including movement and attacks, uses action points. ​There is also a far greater emphasis on the use of new cover and suppression rules. Firefights, where units return fire to those that attack them, are also an integral part of the strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;​Set in a dark future where humanity is at war with a terrifying and mysterious alien faction, you will command the very best soldiers we can muster ... the elite Strike Team of the warship, Hydra. Lead your team through the chaos of a massive battle being waged for the control of a huge battleship, a vessel that cannot be allowed to fall into alien hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
