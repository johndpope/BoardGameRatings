							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Principia: Secret Wars of the Renaissance</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this game, you and two or more of your friends will get together and tell the story of some fantastic characters and their adventures in an alt-Renaissance style. What is alt-Renaissance? It takes the spirit of the Renaissance and uses it to tell stories of what might have been. Your Renaissance might be a world where Leonardo's flying machine actually flies, or Machiavelli makes a pact with Satan, or the Pope becomes the Emperor of the World. Or it may be a world where women gain political equality with men in the 16th century, where the Reformation never happened, and the Industrial Revolution begins 500 years early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Cool About This Game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time you play Principia, you'll ask a question about your world, such as &amp;quot;Is vengeance just?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Does the Duke deserve to rule?&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;Does God exist?&amp;quot; You'll answer these questions when you play, but only after the adventures and struggles of the characters you invent. Then you'll get to see how your answer changes the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also get to see historical characters like Michelangelo and Lucrezia Borgia in un-historical situations like fighting zombies, founding a democratic republic, or crossing the Alps in an airship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If these ideas appeal to you, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably like Principia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
