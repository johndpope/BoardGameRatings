							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Year of the Fall</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illiir&amp;rsquo;s children, guarded for millennia and favored above all others, have grown decadent upon the Alabaster Throne. Their empire, though still a mighty land, is in decline, and their Emperor would return it to its past glory. Advised by a foreign Queen, and guided by a divine being, the Emperor sets in motion a plot to place all of Onara under his dominion. All those that would threaten his domination must either fall or be brought to heel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrust into this web of intrigue, the heroes must navigate a treacherous landscape of plot and counter plot, and choose the side of right before all is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second year of adventures for the famed Living Arcanis campaign. Compiled and updated for home play, the Year of the Fall is ideal for both Living Arcanis players that missed year two and those playing a traditional table top RPG session. Designed for use with the Codex Arcanis and Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Arcanis, Year of the Fall is a world-spanning mega-adventure for the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular fantasy role-playing game. Year of the Fall should provide many weeks of exciting role-playing opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
