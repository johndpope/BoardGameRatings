							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cantinas and More</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not everyone in the universe is cut out for fine dining and a five-star rating. Cantinas and More supplies the Game Master a choice of futuristic eating establishments to whet your characters' appetites. Pick a venue to match your current campaign needs and pull up a chair for some quality food. Better yet, come for the atmosphere and a few juicy rumors. Complete with interior and exterior descriptions, plot hooks and character sketches, these haunts are for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Destinations series is your gateway to the universe, bringing you flexible, creative, stat-free settings that you can use to bring life and adventure to virtually any futuristic game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cantinas and More includes: The Blast-Off Bar - a slightly shady location with good liquor and decent food, though the ambience leaves something to be desired; The Pilots' Lounge - a restricted entry club with a wide range of services and contacts for these important personnel; Smith's Restaurant - a busy local eatery serving food fast and also providing news and gossip; and a roving food cart handled by two women, neither of whom is quite what they seem. Each establishment includes read-aloud descriptive text and (except for the food cart) a diagram.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
