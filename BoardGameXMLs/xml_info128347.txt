			<description>Mole Mania, known in Japan as Mogurānya, is a 1996 video game developed by Nintendo EAD and Pax Softnica, and published by Nintendo for the original Game Boy. It is also one of the least known works of Shigeru Miyamoto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story involves a mole named Muddy Mole (known in Japan as Mogurānya), whose wife and children have been stolen by the farmer, Jinbe. Muddy then had to go find his wife and children by finding his way through puzzle based worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, Muddy has to move a black ball to a gate at the end of the screen in order to get to the next screen. He can push, pull, and throw the black ball. Muddy could also dig into soft ground to find underground paths around obstacles. Choosing where to dig was a crucial element of the game's various puzzles, as creating holes in the wrong areas could hinder the player's efforts to advance. Dropping the ball into a hole would cause it to return to its starting point. Given the nature of Muddy's ability to move the ball, digging holes in the wrong places could make reaching the gate with the ball completely impossible, requiring Muddy to leave the screen and then return to try again. Along the way, there were many obstacles, such as moving enemies, pipes, barrels, weights, and bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mole Mania&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
