			<description>The game consists of number cards (1-10, 12, 15, 20, 25) and color cards. In a move, a player places two cards on an open stack. If he or she can place a number card higher than the previous one plus a color card of the same color on one stack, he or she gets to keep it (until it is taken away by another player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
