			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Splat!, you control a sort of spider called Zippy. You move around a maze, eating grass and plums, avoiding spikes and water. Simple enough, except that the maze itself moves around as well, and you can get trapped between a maze wall and the surrounding screen wall. As you cleared out levels, the screen then scrolled up to the next maze, and the hazards and scrolling get harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One nice feature was simulated speech. When you completed a level, the game actaully said ZIPPEE!!. Being able to control the Spectrum's speaker functions in this way was a novel surrpise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Splat! had a popular reputation with Spectrum gamers because despite its basic design, it played very well and rewarded practice and patience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
