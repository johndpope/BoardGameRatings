							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unepic</name>
									
			<description>Unepic is a mixture of platform game, role game and joke that takes place in a huge castle of medieval fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is set in the eighty's style, but completed with the most actual features that makes Unepic a very complete game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Daniel, a normal guy from today: great videogame player, big lover of sci-fi movies, novice player of role games, pot-head and overall, a bit horny due to a misterious lack of success with girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wait... is not Unepic a game of medieval fantasy? Why is the main character a guy from nowadays?&lt;br/&gt;To find out the answer you will have to play a little bit...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The castle of Harnakon is huge, more that 200 rooms and several ambiances, all of them with their monsters and its interacted characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In unepic you will find more than 100 weapons to hit and slain anything that crosses your way.&lt;br/&gt;A single weapon is not valid for everything. Depending on the monster you face, one class of weapon will be much better than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In unepic you will find tones of magic. There are 70 different spells that you can find in the following containers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
