			<description>from the manufacturer's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Back-to-Basics Baseball Printed Game features a 100 card, die-cut, No-Shuffle Fast Action Deck and complete rules.  Everything is printed in stunning, full-color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a full-fledged baseball simulation.  The game is fast playing and simple to learn, due to our No-Shuffle Fast Action Deck.  Every element of the game is determined right on the Fast Action Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back-to-Basics Baseball features a unique batter-pitcher interface.  Just like the real game, the action begins on the mound with the pitcher.  Using a modified log-5 methodology the batter and pitcher ratings are combined to arrive at every result.  While the ratings may look simplistic on the surface, they nail down each and every player to play on the diamond.  1961 Mickey Mantle will perform exactly as he did in real life.  As will role players like 1983 John Wockenfuss.&lt;br/&gt; Every facet of the game will come to life with amazing accuracy with Back-to-Basics Baseball.  Players will hit, pitch, field and steal bases just as they did in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
