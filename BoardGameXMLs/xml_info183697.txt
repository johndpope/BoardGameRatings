			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure in Hyperborea designed for from four to six characters of 5th through 7th level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a month ago, your party found itself in Port Zangerios, where you heard of an Esquimaux thief selling a treasure map. Low on wealth but high in courage, you sought him out. The man turned out to be a fearful ex-slave who had &amp;ldquo;acquired&amp;rdquo; the map from his Ixian master. The map is incomplete but shews the Isle of the Serpent in far-off Lemuria, where rests a fabulous treasure called the Feathered Crown of Nanasa (or so thought the Ixian). Pooling your money to purchase the unfinished map, you bought passage on an Amazonian trade ship. After passing through tempests and torrential rains that shimmered with auroral light, you have come to the great city of Jhaman Ket. Now you must seek out the location of the Isle of the Serpent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Fane of the Coiled Goddess takes players into an action-packed realm of adventure: the mythical world of Hyperborea, a sword-and-sorcery campaign setting inspired by the fantastic fiction of Robert E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, and others. This adventure is designed for Astonishing Swordsmen &amp;amp; Sorcerers of Hyperborea (AS&amp;amp;SH), a role-playing game descended from the original 1974 fantasy wargame and miniatures campaign rules as conceived by E. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
