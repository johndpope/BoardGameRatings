							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stock ~ Split</name>
									
			<description>Stock ~ Split is an economic game designed to teach players about the stock market. The game board has a slider to keep track of stock prices, allowing for variability between plays. Players move about the board by rolling dice, but different places offer different movement, depending on what was rolled (an even or odd for example.) Players buy and sell stock as the game progresses - there is no credit allowed in the game so if a player runs out of money then he or she is eliminated. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
