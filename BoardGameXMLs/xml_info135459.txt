			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuisances is unlike any other fantasy RPG sourcebook! It is a tribute to the early years of fantasy roleplaying games, a parody of the current state of the genre, a manual for keeping cocky and annoying players off balance, and a poignant philosophical expression of the post-modern, 21st century worldview. This funny and irreverent book has quickly became Skirmisher Publishing's most popular title &amp;ndash; and now it&amp;rsquo;s even better!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuisances: Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut, like its predecessor, is a parody of fantasy roleplaying games, a tribute to them, and a guide for an alternate (and more fun) style of play. This bigger, longer, and uncut version of the original Nuisances has been re-edited, expanded from 96 to 130 pages, and includes more of what you loved in the first edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hundreds and hundreds of aggravating and awful and things that can happen to players!&lt;br/&gt;     Scores of defective items!&lt;br/&gt;     Unfortunate NPC personality traits!&lt;br/&gt;     Many, many random d100, d12, and other Random Tables!&lt;br/&gt;     23 new unsavory Feats (49 total), as well as a section on Subtypes!&lt;br/&gt;     19 new character Defects (59 total), along with a section on problems associated with wearing glasses!&lt;br/&gt;     Five new cursed and unsavory Magic Items (31 total) !&lt;br/&gt;     Scores of defective items!&lt;br/&gt;     An expanded selection of &amp;quot;Random Monster Pornography&amp;quot; !&lt;br/&gt;     A new Archtypical nuisance NPC, along with two associated spells!&lt;br/&gt;     An entirely new chapter on Skills!&lt;br/&gt;     New random tables throughout the book and additions to many of the previously existing tables!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
