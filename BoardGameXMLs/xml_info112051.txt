			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not every leader rides into the face of the enemy on a shining steed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secrets of Tactical Archetypes offers six new options for conflict-oriented cavaliers, gunslingers, magi, rangers, samurai, and summoners who want to do more than just win battles-they want to win the war! Create a celestial commander (summoner) and call forth the devout against heresy! Play an inspiring commander (cavalier) and show your allies how to lead by example. Design a mechanist (gunslinger) and let spellcasting foes try to claim your sidearm from cold, calculating fingers. Give a howl and let your pack hunter (ranger) loose his wolves against any foolish enough to contest him. Epitomize the serene, unflinching resolve of bushido with the shogun (samurai) or weave a cloak of protective magics around your allies with the war warder (magus). Each archetype offers a distinct and complete theme, shifting your character's emphasis towards the wise command of allies operating as a unit. Show the enemy that good leadership doesn't discriminate - master The Secrets of Tactical Archetypes today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
