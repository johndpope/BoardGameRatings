			<description>Flip Flop Pikku Myy (Little My / Moomin character) is a childrens game where the aim of the game is to collect cards by throwing the Little My game pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn player places all the Little My pieces (two sided head, torso, hands, legs and feet pieces) in a dice cup, shakes them up and tips the pieces on the table. Once pieces have been thrown player arranges the pieces to form a picture of Little My.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player then compares the picture formed by the pieces and three open Little My cards on the table and if there's a match (colors and facial expression) player collects the card. If there's no match, player can select pieces and rethrow them twice. After the third toss it's next players turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when a player has collected 7 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
