							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Macho Women With Guns (d20)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The world as we know it is gone, swept away by the tide of history and the rash actions of pride stricken men. Washed away, the simple joys of celebrity worshipping magazines, daytime TV and chocolate. In other words, the world as we know it has been turned into Hell on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early in the 21st century things went horribly wrong. The world was ripped apart as a great war rent great nations asunder. Meanwhile, a horrific, man-eating plague and devastating economic collapse sapped the very essence of those the war had spared. Temperatures rose as the long-term effects of global warming were finally realised and millions of square kilometres around the equator now lie in blasted ruin. Even as the world looked set to rebuild itself after the traumas it had suffered, a powerful earthquake levelled most of the major cities already weakened by the terrors of global conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now women have taken their place as the dominant gender, controlling the remnants of the civilised world and oppressing men under their stiletto heels. Call it 21st century empowerment, call it exploitation if you like, it is a fact, deal with it. In this cut-throat world of the post-apocalyptic horror every girl is out for herself, getting whatever she can by whatever means necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those men who survived the effects of the man-eating plague are enslaved and subjugated by barbaric cultures in which men are treated as second-class citizens or mere property, precious but inferior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Macho Women with Guns is a complex, clashing, mishmash of different styles and periods. Almost every Science Fiction and Fantasy clich&amp;eacute; you can think of exists here. The world of today is populated with every size, description and type of woman from Renegade Nuns hunting down the Bat-Winged Bimbos of the Devil on the streets of Los Diablos to the members of Alice Capone&amp;rsquo;s gang stalking the clubs and dens of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a machine gun in each hand and a whole lot of attitude Macho Women with Guns is a light-hearted jaunt into a world of mindless violence, destruction and high heels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s bust some balls!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
