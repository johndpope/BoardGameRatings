							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gustav Vasas äventyr i Dalarne</name>
									
			<description>A roll and move game based on the Swedish king Gustav Vasa&amp;acute;s flight from the Danish army in the early 16th century. According to the legend Gustav spoke to the assembled men of Mora, Dalecarlia, trying to convince them to start a rebellion against king Christian of Denmark. The men did not want to fight for those reasons though so on ski he tried to flee to Norway. But he was caught up by two Swedes telling him that the men in Mora had changed their minds and they now wanted Gustav to lead the rebellion. In 1523 Gustav Vasa was crowned king of Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
