			<description>A trivia game on sports, branded after the most popular Italian sport newspaper, La Gazzetta dello Sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players answer questions based on the colour of the space their pawn is currently standing (there are 4 types of questions) and, if they are right, get to spin the arrow on a spinner, which determines their movement: if they land on a space marked with &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;, they collect a fiche corresponding to one of 10 different sports. Aim of the game is collecting all the 10 different fiches and finally passing to a final set of questions. The spinner may also result in challenges between the players, where fiches are stolen from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
