			<description>Developer Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only from a distance does beauty truly exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the mystery is gone and the details are revealed, beauty ofen dissolves into ugly truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the starry night sky. Shimmering and vast, dotted with mystery. A romantic will prove endless possibilities in the universe simply by looking up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This story is set among those stars, at the center of the dirt and grime that shines so brilliantly from light-years away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small crew sets out on a simple mission. The kind of mission that's more likely to produce relationships than results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so it does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beautiful Relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
