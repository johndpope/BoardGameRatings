			<description>Part of the Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher, Amarillo Design Bureau (ADB):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Module R11 includes over 80 new ships, including Division Control Ships (cruisers with twelve fighters and six gunboats but no heavy weapons), fast light cruisers (war cruisers with half of the heavy weapons and 25% more warp power, used for deep raids and reserve squadrons), theater transports (which provide quick wartime resupply for your scattered squadrons), and Patrol Tenders (war destroyers that carry three gunboats for patrols, convoy escorts, and similar missions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Also in Module R11 are auxiliary carriers for heavy fighters, a construction dock, more skids and duck tails to customize your freighters, a light monitor, and work boats (civilianized gunboats intended for RPG adventures). Modified skiffs will be available as landing craft for those poor Marines without ground assault variants of the local gunboats. Many unique ships are in this product. The Federation is getting a National Guard survey cruiser, while the Klingons get the AD5W escort. The Romulans are getting the FAK and FAB, while the Tholians are getting heavy web tenders. The Andromedans are getting a construction station, while the Orions get a special new ship everyone will want (to kill). The Lyrans make out like bandits with tug, scout, and carrier variants of their NCA. Isolated ISC outposts are building system defense variants of their destroyers and frigates as well as a unique blockade-running cruiser.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Module R11 is due out at the time of Origins 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
