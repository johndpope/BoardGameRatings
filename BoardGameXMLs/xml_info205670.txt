			<description>A Free Puzzle Resource&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puzzles are a mainstay of classic fantasy adventures, and when you can include one in your own adventure, your players face another challenge to enjoy and overcome. Unfortunately, not everyone has the ability to create their own puzzles and many commercial adventures simply don't include them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[In this product] you'll find a familiar type of puzzle that has been modified into a fantasy-style brainteaser for your player's gaming pleasure. You can drop this into your game or campaign with very little effort, or create your own unique puzzle using the included guidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
