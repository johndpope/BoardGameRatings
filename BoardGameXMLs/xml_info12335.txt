							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Market Garden</name>
									
			<description>Operation Market Garden was the audacious plan to seize a bridgehead across the Rhine River in Holland, 1944.  Though scale is not mentioned it appears to be operational level (the Allies have fourteen &amp;quot;5-3&amp;quot; parachute units, as a gauge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features weather effects and special rules for airborne drops, armor attack and engineers.  Optional rules include a &amp;quot;Short Hook&amp;quot; objective for the Allies occupying the towns of Goch and Doetinchhem instead of closure to the North Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;238 die cut counters (Allies are blue, Germans are red), 12-page rulebook, a 24&amp;quot; x 28&amp;quot; three color map sheet, and a cover sheet. A six-sided die is needed as well as some paper and pencils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
