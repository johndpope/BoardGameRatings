			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 2nd edition of the Book of the Manor presents the revised economic system to use for knightly manors in King Arthur Pendragon. This useful book provides guidelines for players who want to personalize their particular corner of Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your manor a place to generate income? Book of the Manor offers ways to increase the income from your land, ranging from animal herds to logging the woodlands to establishing new fi elds to constructing gambling houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or is your manor a place to express your knight&amp;rsquo;s personality? Here are details about building improvements that provide the manor holder with annual rolls or checks for appropriate Traits and Passions, such as a Guest House for Hospitality, Large Mews for Falconry, and many, many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And don&amp;rsquo;t forget the Commoners! Replace their Structures (Mill, Bakery, etc.) that have been destroyed by war so they don&amp;rsquo;t hate you, or provide Developments (Well, Armory, etc.) so maybe they will even like you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Religious? Family-oriented? There are options herein for every knight of Arthur&amp;rsquo;s realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also contains all previous economic data, and some additional information (cost for burials, knighting, etc.). Everything you need to track your manorial income is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
