							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Christmas Advent-ure</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Advent Calendar with a difference - T&amp;amp;T style!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuletide fun with all the usual nonsense for a festive game session!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic portal is the Doorway to Christmas, and will lead the party into a merry little Christmas adventure, before they continue on their miserable way to the fabled Ice Palace, or whatever adventure lies next for them in your game world. Unlike previous Christmas adventures, this one doesn't have a&lt;br/&gt;criminal mastermind who is trying, for some ridiculous reason, to ruin Christmas. This is a quirky game, not to be taken seriously and to be played over the festive season as a break from poor TV shows, endless games of charades or another round of Monopoly! If you like the way that T&amp;amp;T can lend itself to almost any game style, then you'll like this. It's all silly, and a bit ridiculous in places, but should, I hope, give you and your players some role- playing festive fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dungeon is a little different, as it is set-up like an Advent Calendar. If you have time and can be bothered, amend a real advent calendar by placing pictures behind the doors to represent what's in the room, and give it to the players in room B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
