							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Throne Vacant</name>
									
			<description>Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Charles II of Spain died in November 1700 the both mentally and physically weak king had no heir to the crown. His kingdoms included not only Spain but both parts of the Low Countries, Italy and colonies in the Philipines and the Americas. Now two dynasties claimed the Spanish throne, the French Bourbons and the Austrian Habsburgs. Charles last will proclaimed that Philip, Duke of Anjou (grandson of Louis XIV) was to be offered the whole Spanish empire. However, the German emperor, Leopold I had launched his son the Archduke Charles as pretender to the throne. England preferred the Electoral Prince Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria who was Leopold&amp;rsquo;s grandson. In February 1701 the 17 year old Philip was crowned in Madrid and was reluctantly recognized by England. In the same time French troops secured the Spanish Nederlands and cut of England and the United Provinces from Spanish trade. This resulted in the Treaty of Den Haag 1701 which formed the great alliance between Austria, England and the United Provinces and was later supported by Prussia, Hanover, Denmark, the Holy Roman Empire, Portugal and Savoy. The treaty did actually recognized Philip as the king of Spain but more important, it retained the Spanish trade, gave the Spanish territories in Italy as well as the Spanish Nederlands to Austria and formed a defensive alliance against France. On the other side Bavaria and Cologne supported the French in this upcoming conflict. When Portugal joined the great alliance the focus turned to put Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war now started slowly in Italy where an Austrian force commanded by Eugene of Savoy invaded the Duchy of Milan, one of the Spanish territories in Italy, which prompted a French intervention. Things are now set up for A Throne Vacant&amp;trade; to begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Throne Vacant&amp;trade;( # 107-1 ) is easy to learn and is played in a fast phased manner. The units are blocks in regimental and army size for greatest flexibility in taking steps and differentiating the quality and strength of the troops, like in its sister game Pax Baltica. The high quality map is divided in territories which you have to conquer order to control it. This is made by taking each and every town in a territory. Navies will also play an important part in ATV in the sense that you have to keep the sea lines open to the colonies, and of course transport British troops to the continent. As this intriguing conflict covers the whole of western Europe the map covers a large area from the Atlantic coast in the west to Prague in the east, from northern England in the north to Oran in the south. Playable nations are England/Great Britain, France, Spain, Austria and The United Provinces. Other countries represented in the game are Portugal, Savoy, Bavaria, Denmark and The Holy Roman Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, why don&amp;rsquo;t you enter the roles of some of the great military commanders of history, Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Villars or Vend&amp;ocirc;me. Lead them to great victories and secure the Spanish crown for your pretender to the throne. We are quite sure that this game will bring a Machiavellian smile to your face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, packed in a book case includes a 50 x 70cm-size full color map, 80 high quality wooden blocks, 4 dice, various markers and rules, including different scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
