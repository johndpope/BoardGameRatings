							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fish&#039;n Derby</name>
									
			<description>Compete at the Fish'n Derby on this lake on a board.  Travel around the lake to find the best fish'n spot and go fishing.  If you're in the right spot, you automatically catch a fish.  If you're not in the best fish'n spot, then you must roll high enough to catch a fish.  The fish you catch will range in weight from 1 to 10 lbs at various lengths.  Each round only lasts so long as you must decide what fish to keep or throw away.  At the end of each round, compete for one of the three trophies.  Win all three and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
