							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Motor Cars</name>
									
			<description>Party game that tests the players' knowledge of motor car manufacturers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a card with 26 clues to the name of a motor car. For example;&lt;br/&gt;Clue 1: A Wanderer = Rover&lt;br/&gt;Clue 13: A Famous General = Wolseley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one cryptic clue;&lt;br/&gt;A Beheaded Duck, which is meant be a (M)allard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are generally British cars as you might expect in a British game but two relate to American cars. I don't think many Brits would know Dodge or Plymouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a guest has finished all 18 solutions, their card is handed to the host. The first to do so, with 18 correct answers, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this box is much larger than any other party games that I have from this era. It is also bright and colourful, another trait often missing from similar games. Unfortunately, the company must have decided that this presentation was too expensive because they soon reverted to the more traditional sized and look of most party games by their competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
