			<description>A game for two that's a real blast! An abstract game with a connection element -- be the player that has the most pieces showing in your color by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* An hexagonal grid, in the shape of a hexagon, containing 61 hexes.&lt;br/&gt;    * Two sets of 30 double-sided hexagonal pieces:&lt;br/&gt;          o 12 Connectors (one line joining two opposite sides) with the opponent's 12 Alternators on the reverse side&lt;br/&gt;          o 12 Alternators (three lines joining three, alternating sides) with the opponent's 12 Connectors on the reverse side),&lt;br/&gt;          o 3 Destructors (six lines joining all sides) with the opponent's 3 Burn-outs on the reverse side)&lt;br/&gt;          o 3 Burn-outs (six lines joining all sides) with the opponent's 3 Destructors on the reverse side&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A play consists of one of placing one marker - face-up with the colour of the player whose turn it is - on any unoccupied space on the board. The player then traces a path ('reaction') through as many pieces of the opposing colour as he can. A path is a continuous line passing from a piece of the player's colour to one of his opponent's. Once the path is established, the opponent's piece is flipped over and the piece rotated in such a way that at least one of the lines on it joins up to the path. If there are now no lines on the new piece that point to another opposing piece, or if the flipped piece is a Burn-out, the 'reaction' is over, and the player's turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is for each player to have the most pieces showing his colour at the end of the game. If there are an equal number of each, the game is a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
