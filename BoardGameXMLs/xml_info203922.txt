			<description>This is a game about getting to know the German town B&amp;ouml;blingen developed by a group of pupils at a local school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is inspired by Monopoly. Players take turns rolling a die and moving around the board, buying properties they land on. Landing on an opponent-owned property requires you to pay money to them. landing on your own property again allows you to advance to higher position there, increasing the amount of money you get when others visit the property.&lt;br/&gt;There are also spaces that require players to answer trivia questions about B&amp;ouml;blingen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player is broke, and the player with the highest amount of money (including acquired properties) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
