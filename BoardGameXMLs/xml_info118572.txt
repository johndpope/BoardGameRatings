							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">We&#039;re gonna hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line</name>
									
			<description>Patriotic game that drew its inspiration from the popular song during the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules inside the lid as follows;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    The game may be played by any number.&lt;br/&gt;2.    The object of the game is to get all the washing hung on the line (i.e., set out on the table in front of each player).&lt;br/&gt;3.    Shuffle the small Washing Cards, and deal to each an equal number. Put any cards left over back in the box.&lt;br/&gt;4.    Shuffle the large cards and place them face down in the centre of the table in one pile.&lt;br/&gt;5.    Each player chooses any three Washing Cards from his own hand, and passes them on to the player on his left.&lt;br/&gt;6.    Everyone takes it in turn to pick a card from the central pile, and places it face up alongside. He may hang an article on the line as soon as he picks a card with the correct washing cost. A player picking a hazard card takes back into his hand any of his washing on the table that is specified, or otherwise obeys the instructions on the card. All hazard cards count as a turn. Each time the central pack has been gone through, re-shuffle and carry on.&lt;br/&gt;7.    When one player succeeds in hanging up all his washing, the other players add up the money-value of the washing not hung out, and this is counted against them. Then proceed with the next round.&lt;br/&gt;    Any number of rounds may be played, the winner being with the least money-value at the end of play. Alternatively a price-limit of, say, five shillings or seven shillings and six pence may be fixed. Any player reaching this limit drops out, and play continues until only the winner is left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
