							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Solomon&#039;s Keep</name>
									
			<description>Near the town of Dead Hawg, past the Grimwood, at the very peak of Mount Awful, there stands a crumbling tower of mortar and stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within this foul edifice, the blackest necromancer of modern times, Solomon Dark, sits on his horrible throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Solomon's Keep, your goal is to storm the Dark Lord's lair, unbind his minions, loot his evil possessions, and prove once and for all to your teachers that you're not as stupid as you look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you enjoy the play style of action RPGs like Diablo and Torchlight, you'll love Solomon's Keep!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find treasure, destroy monsters, and improve your skills so that you can win the final battle with Solomon himself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
