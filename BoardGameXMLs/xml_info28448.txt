							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kampfgruppe Zwei</name>
									
			<description>Kampfgruppe Zwei is the second volume of a series of books which attempt to present a system for accurately representing combat during the Second World War from the perspective of small units and individuals. This title places it's emphasis on the wide variety of ground vehicles which were involved in the conflict. Whilst it is perfectly capable of being played as a 'stand alone' system in it's own right by those who are exclusively interested in vehicle combat, it is also designed to fully integrate with the companion volume 'Kampfgruppe Eins' (Infantry Combat) for those who wish to explore joint operations between the two arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that is required to play are models to represent the appropriate vehicles and terrain, a suitable playing area, six sided dice and a measuring device. Players are then at liberty to recreate combat involving motorcycles, Tiger tanks and everything in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
