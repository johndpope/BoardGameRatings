							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Regional Settings: Indo Toal</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land of Indo Toal is a hotbed of political intrigue, massive warfare, and incredible adventure. From its ancient history as a war zone of giants and dragon-riding elves to the eldritch human dynasties who?ve come to replace them, Indo Toal flourishes amidst savage violence and lavish spellworks with the power to change the face of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in Regional Settings: Indo Toal: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Four New Races: From the brutally sophisticated Darkfae Hin to the savage Wildlings of the Diamondbone Highlands, Indo Toal offers players and DMs unique character options with a variety of new racial choices. These new races, and staple fantasy races are complemented by a collection of feats that build upon the original ideas woven into Indo Toal's extensive history. &lt;br/&gt;     Four New Spells: The spells included in Regional Settings: Indo Toal are not only designed to be useful to adventurers (as is ephemeral lantern), but also reflect the regional culture's unique influence on spellcrafting (like detect illocai). &lt;br/&gt;     Two New Monsters: Designed to reflect the unique wildlife of Indo Toal, the Shadowgarden Tree Frog and Unau Burden-Beast are not only interesting creatures in their own right, they also form an intricate part of life in the region. &lt;br/&gt;     Twenty Six New Feats: Regional Settings: Indo Toal offers a large collection of feats, most of which have specific roles to play in the culture of the realm (like the Illocai feats), as well as feats that can be transplanted to other settings without changing a single word (like High-Born). &lt;br/&gt;     Four Detailed Organizations: The Philosophers' Club and the Binders of Kuol offer characters a chance to become a part of the exciting political landscape of Indo Toal, while the Diamond Order seems to exist simply to facilitate adventure. These organizations emphasize the diversity of Indo Toal itself as well as the interconnectedness of characters, regions, and themes of any campaign. &lt;br/&gt;     New Items: Three new exotic weapons and three new alchemical creations evoke the unique nature of Indo Toal, but can be easily transplanted into other campaigns with ease. &lt;br/&gt;     Weaving Tips: Indo Toal wasn't meant to be quarantined. These helpful suggestions and provocative questions will help to connect the region to other parts of your fantasy landscape, creating a smooth, organic feel. &lt;br/&gt;     A detailed history and description of the region, its history and people, complete with full color maps and a timeline for easy reference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
