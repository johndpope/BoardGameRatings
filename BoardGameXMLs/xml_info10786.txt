			<description>Gates Skill is a connection game.  The board is an 8x8 array of holes, and the pieces are gates - effectively a line between one hole and an orthogonally adjacent one, with one end attached to a hole, which it can rotate around.&lt;br/&gt;The object is to have an unbroken series of your gates connecting two opposite sides of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's possible to capture opposing gates by surrounding them with yours and possibly the edge of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key gimmick is that, as noted, the gates can rotate.  On your turn you can rotate a gate instead of placing one, and if you can win or capture by rotating gates you can rotate any number of them at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
