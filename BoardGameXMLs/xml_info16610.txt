			<description>Scaventure Kids asks kids Ages 6 - 12 to locate items around the house or yard or even create, perform or draw new things themselves. Whether it's demonstrating a pet trick, making a sandwich a gorilla would like or learning to hula dance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Editorial Review from Amazon.com:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A scavenger hunt in a can, Scaventure Kids provides everything needed to plan and execute a challenging hunt. Included in the cardboard container are 150 cards, instructions, and team stickers. The cards each have four items for a team to find or do. Cards ask players to do things like &amp;quot;Find two bags with different store names&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Have your team act out a scene from your favorite movie.&amp;quot; Each team takes out cards and has 30 minutes to carry out the tasks. At the rendezvous, the teams share their finds and winners are chosen. For rainy days, vacations, or parties, Scaventure Kids is a simple and creative activity that fosters teamwork and creative problem-solving. --Lee Strucker&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
