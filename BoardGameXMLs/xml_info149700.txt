			<description>On July 16, 1861, the federal Army of the Republic was ordered to Richmond to capture the Confederate capitol.  The two armies met at a railroad junction town called Manassas near a stream called Bull Run.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Now the commanders of the opposing forces can re-live and re-fight that famous battle.  The board is stylized representation based on actual maps.  The map is printed on vinyl coated paper with one inch hexes.  There are 54 card stock printed pieces enclosed in clear hard plastic cases that stand upright.  This is in essence plastic-cased minatures. The game has a hidden strength factor the effectively simulates the raw, unseasoned troops in the actual battle.  There are also provisions for artillery fire, and terrain modifiers.  Victory is obtained by eliminating the opposing player's 6 strength General, two 3 strength generals or all the enemy troops.  Victory can also be obtained if the opposing player or team surrenders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
