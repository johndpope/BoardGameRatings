The Black Dragons want him out alive, while everyone else has a price on his head so big that it's scaring the small fish away, but the big time hitters are all drooling at the chance to hit Jerry and cash in big-time.  On top of that, even the FBI guarding Jerry are salivating at the price-tag around his neck, and some of them have agreed to work together to take the little rat out themselves...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is the fifth adventure in the Wellstone City Chronicles for the Wellstone City setting.
