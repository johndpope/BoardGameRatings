			<description>Players are aiming to get their secret wagers to earn the most points. It is played with a deck of 56 cards consisting of 2's to 7's from two packs of cards. Plus 1 King of each suit and 4 Jokers. Finally add the layout cards of 1 Ace of each suit and another Joker.&lt;br/&gt;The layout is placed on the table in this order from left to right:&lt;br/&gt;Club Ace, Spade Ace, Joker, Heart Ace and finally Diamond Ace&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 12 cards. From these he selects two cards which will be his secret 'wager'. He may choose two of the same suit or one each from two of the suits. His chosen cards are kept face-down in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining 10 cards that a player has are used to influence or deter cards in the layout to get as far left as they can. Being a Knizia game the card play is quite novel and a little complex even.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When each player has used up his 10 cards, that ends the game. The secret 'wagers' are revealed. If the suits you picked are in the first 3 positions you get 3, 2, or 1 point (for 1st, 2nd and 3rd) if the black suits or Joker are in those positions. You score double points for red cards that get into the first 3 spots which reflects their 'start' at the back of the order from the Start. If a suit you bet on comes last you lose 3 points regardless of the colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer suggests that you play one hand equal to the number of players and the player at the end with the most points, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
