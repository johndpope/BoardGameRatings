			<description>Do you know where the UK&amp;rsquo;s first motorway was built in 1958? Was it 8, 18 or 28 miles long? Can you name the English pop band often referred to as the Fab Four? In this version of BrainBox we take a look back at England&amp;rsquo;s most successful and influential people, events and inventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple concept can be played by all ages and in large groups as well as a 1 person game. Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material and designed in the UK, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players 1 or more&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 to 88&lt;br/&gt;Contains 54 illustrated cards, 1 rules card, 1 timer and 1 eight-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
