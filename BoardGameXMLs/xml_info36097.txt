			<description>&amp;ldquo;Simulation of Soviet-American Relations during the Cold War Era (1945-1991). One player takes the role of America (USA). The other player is the Soviets (USSR). Players use Power Tokens to keep track of their Scores in the Areas of Power. Use poker Chips, coins, counters, etc. to represent PT. There are 5 Areas of Power: Military, Economic, Social, Espionage, and Territorial.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are 3 ways to achieve Victory. General Victory: If your scores in the 5 AOP are greater than your opponent&amp;rsquo;s for two consecutive turns, you win. Power Victory: If your scores in any 3 AOP (except Espionage) are double or greater than your opponent&amp;rsquo;s for two consecutive turns, you win. Crisis Victory: If your opponent goes to zero (or less) in any AOP (except Espionage) you win.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game provides three setups: Equal, Random, and Historical. Card play generates changes in the AOP levels of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
