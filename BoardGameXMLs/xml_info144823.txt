			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EVEN THE SMALLEST PERSON CAN BECOME A BIG HERO!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halflings are often regarded as lazy, boring busybodies by the rest of the world. But inside those bodies beats a heart of fire! In Halflings: Tales from the Fireside you'll get a look inside halfling culture and society as well as learning new options for your halfling character. While this supplement is specifically designed for use with the Labyrinth Lord role-playing game, it can easily be adapted to any old-school fantasy game with minimal effort!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You'll Find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items: From the Fancy Waistcoat to the Lucky Sling-Stone, your halfling will always have a trick up their sleeve!&lt;br/&gt;     New Class Alternatives: Now you don't have to become a Sheriff! Whether a Treasure-Seeker, Stout-heart or Lucky Fool, you'll always be ready for adventure!&lt;br/&gt;     New Monster: Learn about the Boogans! A twisted race of creatures that plague the halflings!&lt;br/&gt;     And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
