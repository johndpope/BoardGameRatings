			<description>The Ember has gone out, but the game is not over! The popular game from 2016 is being rebuilt with a fresh reprint, revised rules, and brand new art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A completely standalone game that has its roots in Ember: the Magical Card Game, Neon is a brand new game that is compatible with the Ember, but has a completely new system of gathering the elemental energy to conjure creatures, along with a questing system, and an experience-points system that allows you to buy items, gain familiars, or to level up and increase your power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neon is played with 15 creatures from One to Five VP, and each creature sits in its own stack of five cards. Most of the creatures have powers, and one has a super power, while another has no ability at all. You may only conjure the top card in your turn, and each creature will drain some - or all - of your magical energy, so choose wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
