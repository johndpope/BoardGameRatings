			<description>Fron the publisher Website:&lt;br/&gt;The Honour RPG is a table-top role-playing game. It is played with pencils, paper and your imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based in the fictional city Of Heung Gong (styled on our own Hong Kong) players take on the roles of seemingly ordinary citizens.  These characters allow the players to delve into a world of crime, adventure and even the supernatural.  The player-charaters (PCs) will confront both criminal and the lawful agents of the city, they will prevent wrongs whilst also committing crimes and at some point they will meet the Inhuman, the super-beings on whom all of humanity's myths and legends are based.  In short, the players control the characters in a story of the eternal battle between law and chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
