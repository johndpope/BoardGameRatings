							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fourthcore Alphabet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOURTHCORE ALPHABET is a reference for D&amp;amp;D Dungeon Masters who are building and running dark, deadly dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each chapter of FOURTHCORE ALPHABET spotlights a different element of fourthcore dungeon design, beginning with a short essay that describes how the element fits into the fourthcore aesthetic. These essays are followed by a table with which you can generate hundreds of examples using only your twentysided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary purpose of this book is to stand alongside C1: Crucible of the Gods as a primer on fourthcore design. All of the elements featured in this book are quintessential to fourthcore adventures, and much of the material overlaps so that you might come away with a clear and&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive understanding of the genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this book references the 4TH EDITION rules, every effort has been made to present the material in a way that makes it easily adaptable to other systems. DMs running gothic deathtrap dungeons in games like OSRIC or WRATH will find much to use in the following pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
