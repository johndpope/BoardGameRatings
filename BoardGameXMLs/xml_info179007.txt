			<description>Tumo-n is a game of piling up monster cards. The board starts with the largest monster (size 5, two cards) on the board, and players take turn putting a monster on the pile. You can't put a bigger monster on a smaller monster, though, and little monsters won't be able to hang on to a small ledge. Special actions may also give you an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as one player is unable to play a monster from their hand, they lose the round. The game is won by the first player to win three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
