							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows Upon Lassadar: Siege at Dalnish</name>
									
			<description>The wars with the Grayking have taken their toll. Lassadar's defenses are not as they once were, the Wardens are greatly reduced in number and magic is seemingly drained from the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the South now arises a new threat. Twelve dread barons have formed a pact and pledged to take Lassadar for their own. They have gathered their armies and new allies - the Trulls, hulking brutes that hurl stones like mobile catapults - and have come north to Dalnish, a border city and first line of defense against invasion, to lay siege.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Dalnish stands ready to repel the invasion but supplies and soldiers are limited. As the Captain of the Guard, it is your responsibility to hold out long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Rally your men, ready your weapons. They are upon you.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solo tower siege game lasting about 20 minutes and is the first game in the 2nd Lassadar game trilogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, and the forces you command, must hold out long enough until Reinforcements arrive (drawn from the Event deck). If you can succeed in this you will drive the Barons and their armies back across the Southern border. If all of your Tower&amp;rsquo;s battlements are destroyed by Enemy Units or all of your Tower Units are slain or destroyed you lose the game and Lassadar is invaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;42 cards, divided into Defensive Units, Enemy Units and Events are payed on a 2 section game board. Each Unit has a set of attack and defensive values. Using Action Points units played by the player can be deployed, engaged and repaired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique to this game are Damage Pattern footprints that players must use effectively to combat Enemy Units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of Event cards act as an AI in the game changing game play as the rounds progress. These cards are drawn when sufficient damage is done to the Enemy Units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice counters have been provided along with the card files/player board. Players may substitute 8mm dice if they prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st Place - Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Themed Game - 2012 Solitaire PNP Contest&lt;br/&gt;2st Place - Best Artwork for an Entered Game Category - 2012 Solitaire PNP Contest&lt;br/&gt;Grand Prize - 2012 Solitaire PNP Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
