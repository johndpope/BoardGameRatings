			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are just some person wandering on the street when a distraught and dying government agent begs you to take her watch and continue her mission.  You will see full-motion video on your watch which will give you instructions as you seek to prevent the release of a virus which could wipe out civilization.  Aside from solving the puzzle, you have to battle mafia members, clown killers, and other foes who want you eliminated.  Worse of all, you only have 15 minutes to get the job done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally developed before the Sega CD was discontinued and was almost completely finished, save for a couple of video playback feeds.  Good Deal Games acquired the rights and published the game several years later.  Since it is technically missing a couple of features (though not ones that impede game play), Good Deal Games released Citizen X classified as a beta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
