							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Virion</name>
									
			<description>Virion is a war strategy game where players battle for territories using troops, tactics cards, and bio-weapons (virions) that they develop by investing their resources. The goal of the game is to be the last player to possess a capital. Different regions have different allotments of troops/money, thus changing a player's strategy from game to game. Battling is dice-based, with tactics cards being used to modify the battles. As virions are developed they become more powerful, becoming game-changers. Players must develop a hospital infrastructure to allow them to deploy their troops and save them from enemy attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
