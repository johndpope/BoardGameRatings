			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don't always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn't have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that's needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bullet Points are a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Concept: Seven feats designed to give bards more options for their class features, similar to the options available to classes that focus on weapons or spellcasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Arcane Bridge: You can smoothly transition from one performance to another.&lt;br/&gt;    Arcane Cadenza: You can use the mystic energy of your spells to fuel an improvised bardic performance.&lt;br/&gt;    Eldritch Arrangement: You can use your mystic bardic performance to rearrange the elements of a spell, to generate an altered result.&lt;br/&gt;    Extemporize: You can use your artistic talents to quickly change how you cast a spell.&lt;br/&gt;    Performance Focus: You have strived to master a specific kind of bardic performance.&lt;br/&gt;    Transcendent Music: You can use your artistic ability to focus through pain and distractions.&lt;br/&gt;    Virtuoso: You are capable of acts of performance beyond the reach of lesser performers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
