							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crumbling Epoch</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gods have left, magic has been reinvented when the old powers burned out, and humanity has survived multiple extinction-level events. There are five classes, including humans touched by the divine, and weak-blooded vampires called Thirsters. Fighters can focus on weapons and armor, or reflexes and style. Wizards use their life energy to fuel their potent magic. Anyone can use armor and weapons in this dangerous world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple game has 12 pages of rules, and the rest is support. There are no attributes, one saving throw roll, and damage-reducing armor&amp;ndash;a whole new flavor. Here you will find all you need to run a dungeon crawl without a DM, all on a 2 page spread, for 2 settings! Quick-start tools for a campaign world include a region generator, a religion generator, and a unique monster builder. Several examples of play help grasp the new rhythm of the rules. Finally, each class in the book comes with a Pocket Mod character sheet, so a quick-start game has sheets for the players with rule summaries and class-specific information!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other fine writers contributed to this game. The appendices include three classes to allow play in Jack Shear&amp;rsquo;s Devilmount, along with his essay explaining Lumpen-Ones. An adapted spellbook from Wampus Country, based on Erik Jensen&amp;rsquo;s work, expands what spells wizards can find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crumbling Epoch can be played on its own, but it is also compatible with Dungeons and Dragons B/X monster stat blocks and treasure. The game plays very differently, but it can allow you to re-use those old modules and have a completely new game experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
