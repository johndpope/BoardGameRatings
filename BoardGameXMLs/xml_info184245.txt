			<description>Space is a hard place and making a bit of scratch out here is even harder. Racing against fellow scavengers you must reach derelict ships and earn enough cash to buy your way out of this long, harsh and tedious life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Space Junkers, 2-4 players compete to grab fuel cells and spend them to reach derelict ships. Players roll dice and place them on fuel cell cards in order to outbid or block their opponents. Valuable fuel cells are used to buy derelict ships, earning victory points. The first to 12 points has collected enough from the derelict ships to move on to a better life. May the best salvage company win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
