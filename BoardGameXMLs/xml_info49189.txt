			<description>Although Oerth is the dominant world in Greyspace, it is definitely not the only cradle of life in this system.  Worlds such as Kule, Borka, and Edill have their own civilizations.  Each has its own secrets to entice and threaten explorers courageous enough to brave the perils of wildspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book details the dragons of Edill, the undead of Gnibile, the humanoids of Borka, and many others.  It describes their societies, their views of the universe around them, and their relationships to the other inhabitants of the Greyspace system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the planetary denizens of Greyspace are not the only challenges awating brave adventurers!  There are also spacefaring companies and starborn peddlers, adventuring groups, explorers' societies, and interplanetary pirats.  In addition, the crystal sphere is home to monsters totally unlike those encountered anywhere else: the porton, the skyline, and the dreaded horg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greyspace is a 96-page accessory for the SPELLJAMMER campaign setting.  The SPELLJAMMER box set is meeded to use this product.  The material in theis accessory will enhance any GREYHAWK campaign in which the concept of spelljamming has been (or is about to be) introduced.  Your players are in for new excitement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
