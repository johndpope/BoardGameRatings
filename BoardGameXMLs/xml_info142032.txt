							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Agency</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They've Always Been With You&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people think they're a government agency, but they couldn't tell you exactly which government.  Others think they're a mysterious inter-corporation taskforce on exploiting alien technology.  The truth is stranger than any speculation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founded over two hundred years ago, The Agency watches over humanity and does its best to guard it against the coming darkness.  Armed with advanced technology and an unparalleled communications network, their well-suited agents and paramilitary assets are ready to step between humanity and whatever comes our way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, that's how it's supposed to work, anyways.  Working entirely on their own with nearly unlimited funds, they may have gotten too big for their britches from time to time.  After accidentally unleashing terrors like M.E.C.H.A.N. and Doctor Sul on an unsuspecting world, maybe the Earth would be better off without this kind of &amp;quot;protection!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See the history and the inner workings of the mysterious organization known as The Agency. Meet the people who currently run it, and hope that their character flaws don't doom mankind! Included are new Psionic Disciplines, New Cyberware, new weapons, new ammunition, new armor, new miscelleanous equipment, specialized pharmaceuticals, and a bucket of high-tech, advanced Vehicles for all of your '80's action-movie needs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are files on Agency Personnel; meet them as allies, face them as enemies, or simply try to figure out which is which!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
