							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chasing Alice</name>
									
			<description>Following the White Rabbit, Alice entered the Queen&amp;rsquo;s palace. Some problems happened between them, and Alice is now being chased by the Queen. Alice must find the White Rabbit among the Trump Soldiers, to escape from the palace. The White Rabbit might know where to go. Alice who wants to catch the White Rabbit and the Queen who wants to catch Alice&amp;hellip; The hide-and-seek between Alice and the Queen of Heart now begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Chasing Alice is a 2-player game, and each player becomes Alice and the Queen of Heart. With your reasoning, find where the opponent is. The player who catches another first wins the game. The victory condition for each player is different, however, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need a different strategy on each role. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget! Catch her before you get caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a role as Alice or the Queen of Heart. Two players share the space of game board and their locations on the board are hidden. Each player uses a recording sheet to mark his location and information of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s location.&lt;br/&gt;In one&amp;rsquo;s turn, do one action of two as follow.&lt;br/&gt;1. Move: Choose one of the cards and place it face up in front of the Blind Cover. According to the suit on the card, change your location to the adjacent box. &amp;lsquo;The adjacent box&amp;rsquo; includes all 8 directions. You cannot move to the box you have ever been. The Queen may move the White Rabbit only once, and Alice may move herself twice. Make sure you mark your path for each move.&lt;br/&gt;2. Trace: Reveal the two cards in your hand to the opponent, and announce a single location with the card numbers combined. Trace the selected box and the adjacent boxes. The opponent must say how many boxes she had been among those 9 boxes.&lt;br/&gt;After an action, a player can say &amp;lsquo;GOTCHA!&amp;rsquo;. This action is optional, and you can decide whether to do it or not. If you succeed, you win a victory; otherwise you lose the game immediately. Carefully do this action for the game. The condition for catching the opponent varies in different roles.&lt;br/&gt;- The Queen of Heart: Guess where Alice is, and point exactly one box on the Game Board. If it is correct, the Queen wins a victory. Otherwise the Queen loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;- Alice: With no pointing, both players reveal their location. If Alice and the White Rabbit are near enough to reach within a box, Alice wins a victory. Otherwise Alice loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game end&lt;br/&gt;If any of the players succeed or fail the action &amp;lsquo;GOTCHA&amp;rsquo;, the game ends immediately.&lt;br/&gt;Or if the Game Cards run out (which means each player took 5 turns) without determining any result, Alice fails to escape and the Queen wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
