			<description>Forged Realms is a simultaneous tactical dueling card game that plays in about 10 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build an army from a large pool of spells and creatures including the Border Knight, Necromancer, Siege Troll, Crypt Wolf, Goblin King and more. You then have only 5 turns to try and drive your opponent from the battle field using tactics, scouting, speed, flanking, and combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you will place one Creature or Spell faced-down in each open Rank on the battlefield at the same time as your opponent. When both players are finished deploying, you then simultaneously reveal cards in the same Rank and resolve the spells and abilities of creatures. The newest Rank also is called a Scouting Rank where the fastest creature outmaneuvers the slower creature and immediately deals its damage to the opponent. Finally, any creatures that were revealed in earlier turns do battle with each other to try and defeat the opposing creature in that rank. Once opened, the creature here can go right through and do it's damage directly to the player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forged Realms is a game of planning, surprise, scouting, using abilities/spells and controlling ranks to try and defeat your opponent by lowering their armies moral to 0 in only 5 turns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 4 factions to choose from in the Core Set, you have up to 10 combinations to make your army with. Each pre-built deck can be changed and built as see fit thus giving players hundreds of deck combinations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
