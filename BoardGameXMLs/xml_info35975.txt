			<description>&amp;ldquo;Battle between ancient armies. Each figure represents a general, camp or unit of troops. Victory: You win if you destroy your opponent&amp;rsquo;s General or 8 of his units. A Camp counts as 2 units.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chits or miniatures are used to represent the combat units. The game is played on an 8x8 grid (or chessboard) to represent a small battlefield. Each army consists of  a General, a Camp, and eleven other units. Each player places his units on his back two rows. Units may not stack. The players draw from a deck of cards and use their hand of cards to initiate movement and combat, and to defend against attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
