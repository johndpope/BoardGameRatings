			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SPACE PATROL Needs YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Space Patrol! Help protect innocent lives from the scourge of space piracy! Fight interstellar crime! Let the Navy play its wargames, the real action is in the merchant lanes with the Space Patrol. Join the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s elite crime fighting organization now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Space Patrol is a supplement for the Cepheus Engine rules and 2D6 SciFi OGL games. This book contains complete rules for creating Space Patrol characters with four detailed careers - complete with expanded event and mishap tables - expanded world descriptions discussing legal codes and interstellar law, a complete description of the Space Patrol&amp;rsquo;s organization, as well as its standard equipment. Busy GMs will find dozens of NPCs from all Divisions of the Space Patrol, as well as some of the Sub-Sector&amp;rsquo;s most notorious criminals. But beware: if these villains were easy to catch, they would already be behind bars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Space Patrol book includes complete descriptions of the ships used by the Patrol, from the humble Cutter to the mighty Ballista-Class Frigate. It provides extended details and full deck-plans for three ships - the 100-ton Relentless-Class Pursuit Ship; the 200-ton TL 12 Tasman-Class Q-Ship; and the 400-ton Dragon-Class Corvette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
