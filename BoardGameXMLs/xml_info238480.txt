							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sabrina the Teenage Witch Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Help Sabrina in her quest to become a fully fledged witch. Collect your friends and Aunts before entering the other realm and coming face to face with your evil twin Katrina. But beware, Salem is up to his tricks and may cause problems along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the part of Sabrina, who must travel through three zones before entering the Other realm. The board is divided into four realms. 46 picture tokens are placed randomly on the spaces in the realms at the start of the game. On their turn, a player must roll the six sided die and then decide which direction to move through the realms. The aim is to collect tokens, the winning of which is determined by the roll of a 20 sided die each time a counter is landed on. There is also a deck of Salem cards that are drawn when a player lands on a cat token. These cards have actions that can be good or bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the first player to collect 8 tokens, 2 from each realm, finishing on the Other realm in the centre of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
