			<description>OBJECT OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;Grangol is a simulation of a football match between two teams. The ultimate goal here as in any football match is to score more goals than your opponent!&lt;br/&gt;Actions alternate between players.First they attack and then defend using cards.&lt;br/&gt;PLAYING THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;The player draws a card and gets ready to play a card.&lt;br/&gt;In each turn you draw one more card and play one card unless specified otherwise in the text of the card played.&lt;br/&gt;The first player is the attacker.If he loses the ball do to a card played by the defender he is in turn defending.&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 &amp;quot;Field&amp;quot; cards which represent the playing field in sections (2 areas, 2 three-quarter, 1 midfield). When one player makes a successful action (both attack and defense), this section turns the field immediately in front of her with&lt;br/&gt;arrows in his favor, to indicate that this is now in that section of the field.&lt;br/&gt;DURATION OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into two parts, each time ends as soon as you turn the  &amp;quot;recovery&amp;quot; card or when a deck is depleted&lt;br/&gt;Between the first and the second Half cautions and dismissals will be reset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
