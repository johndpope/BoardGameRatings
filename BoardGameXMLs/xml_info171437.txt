			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Sonic Adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sonic 3D Blast 5 has music that is notorious for its poor quality.Sonic's controls work the same as the Mega Drive games, except poorly programmed and sluggish in comparison. There are numerous enemies ripped from Sonic the Hedgehog 1 &amp;amp; 3 although they're reduced to moving back and forth in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sonic Adventure 7 is a hack of a pirated game called Sonic 3D Blast 5 and originates from China. The game adds color, alters some of the graphics and changes the order of the levels. What used to be Sonic 3D Blast's intro was replaced with a Sonic &amp;amp; Knuckles' intro and the title screen is a very poor digitisation of Sonic Adventure's boxart. Strangely, the game includes a manual which is mostly a poorly done edit of Sonic Blast's manual, with most references to Knuckles being replaced with the Sonic Adventure 7 logo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sonic Adventure 8 has the intro music from S3DB5 again, with the second and fourth level being the first in this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pok&amp;eacute;mon Jade re-uses Sonic Adventure 7 colors are a bit more detailed than Sonic Adventure 7, the music is rearranged, and you control a Pikachu sprite. The game crashes when you complete the first level due to a programming error making it impossible to complete the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
