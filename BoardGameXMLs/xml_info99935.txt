			<description>States of Siege Series #10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep Up The Fire! is a solitaire States of Siege series game set in 1900 Peking (modern day Beijing), China where Foreign Legations (areas assigned to Imperial powers including ambassadors, business people, and a handful of troops to provide security) are besieged in their Compound by Chinese anti-imperialist forces. The Chinese &amp;ldquo;Boxers&amp;rdquo; (Society of the Harmonious Fists), with the Imperial Manchu forces of the Qing Army, are angry and determined to expel these foreigners from China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Legation Compound siege, you must coordinate the various foreign detachments that have joined to defend their position until a Relief Column arrives. You also command the Relief Column, battling their way from the port of Taku, inland through hostile territory, to break the siege at Peking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this game can also be enjoyed in teams working together (just as the Eight Nations had to), deciding how best to defend the Legation Compound and get the Relief Column to Peking in time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of five standards-based lesson plans are also available for classroom teachers should they wish to use this game as a teaching tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a race against time as the Chinese forces besieging the Legation Compound are attacking relentlessly while the Relief Column battles its way to the rescue. With limited time and relentless attacks on the Compound, will you manage to Keep Up The Fire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 2.5 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each unit represents one Chinese or Legation unit, or 1 International Gun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
