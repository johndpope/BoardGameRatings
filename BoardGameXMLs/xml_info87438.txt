			<description>&amp;quot;Gołębie&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Pigeons&amp;quot;) is a non-collectible mini card game for 2 players in which they take the roles of pigeons. They &amp;quot;fight&amp;quot; with the patience of people waiting at a bus stop. The purpose of the game is to be the bird that reduces their patience the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are total 5 character cards. Each character card has different number of marks printed on it. These marks are called &amp;quot;patience&amp;quot;. During the play &amp;quot;patience&amp;quot; on those cards will be covered by player's markers as they play their pigeons cards.
