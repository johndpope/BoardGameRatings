			<description>Cra$h is a simple dice game that utilizes probabilities, luck, and a lot of book keeping to simulate the vagaries of the stock market. The game is comprised of six rounds were each player takes a turn to try and beat the odds or try not to lose too much money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cra$h is a simple game and was envisioned to help parents encourage basic mathematics skill and to open children up to the idea of the stock market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cra$h uses 6 ten sided dice as the amount of money you wager on the stock market. you may choose to roll up to all six dice. This is then compared to the market mood die (the 7th d10) anything below this number loses cash(k), anything that beats the market gains cash(k), anything that matches gains 10k.When a Player rolls triples it causes a crash and all players need to roll to see how much they lost. With each player starting with only 50K this game is fast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until there is only one player left or whoever has the most money at the end of six rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leiker Games&lt;br/&gt;Give us a &amp;quot;Leik&amp;quot; on Facebook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
