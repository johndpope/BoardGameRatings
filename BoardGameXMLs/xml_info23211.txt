			<description>Aseb, 'The Twenty Squares game' (frequently misidentified as Tjau, &amp;lsquo;The Game of Thieves&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;The Game&lt;br/&gt;of Robbers&amp;rsquo;) was played from 3000 B.C. until 400 A.D. and is one of the oldest known games. It is similar in play and design as Senet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to be the first player to bear off all 5 of his pieces, by landing them precisely on the last square.&lt;br/&gt;Once successfully borne off, a piece plays no further part in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYER TURNS&lt;br/&gt;The players throw once each alternately, and move a single piece by the appropriate number of positions. A&lt;br/&gt;move must be made, and made in full. If no move is possible, then the turn is forfeit (passes to the other&lt;br/&gt;player). When forfeiting a throw, the opponent has the option of adding the forfeited throw to his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO MOVE THE PIECES&lt;br/&gt;Each player enters the pieces onto the board from his reserve and moves them as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move forward only. As pieces reach the last square (by exact throw), they bear off; be the first to&lt;br/&gt;bear off all your pieces and you win! The marked squares give you an extra turn; when you land on them, you&lt;br/&gt;get to throw the sticks and go again. Only one piece may occupy any given square; if you land on an opposing&lt;br/&gt;piece, it is removed &amp;mdash;sent back to the player&amp;rsquo;s reserve.&lt;br/&gt;To bring your first piece on, you must first throw a 4 or a 6; when that happens, you throw again and move&lt;br/&gt;the piece in by that amount. The remaining pieces can be brought in on any throw. Waiting for that initial&lt;br/&gt;throw of 4 or 6, particularly while the opponent is already moving, can be quite frustrating, so it is an acceptable&lt;br/&gt;variant to forego that rule entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
