							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tomb of Rakoss the Undying</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rakoss was a great wizard of ages past who served the Emperor of Maere. Tales tell of his prowess as a military strategist, but they also tell of his fall. It is said that although he won campaign after campaign for his emperor, just one failure earned the wrath of his master. The Emperor had Rakoss, his generals, strategists and personal guard sealed in a tomb somewhere in the Ganlaw Mountains, and cursed them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows what treasure was buried with Rakoss and his retinue, or what horrors remain to test any who might enter the tomb. Certainly only a brave few would dare seek out the final resting place of Rakoss, and even fewer can survive the terrors of The Tomb of Rakoss the Undying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Tomb of Rakoss the Undying&amp;quot; is a challenging adventure for 3-6 characters of level 4 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
