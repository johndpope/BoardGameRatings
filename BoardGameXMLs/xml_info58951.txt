			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did the contact for the secret agents pick an abandoned building for a meeting? Have investigators of the supernatural heard rumors of a haunting? Did your superheroes track the bad guy to a boarded-up mansion? Here&amp;rsquo;s help in detailing what they find inside. Tabletop Adventures provides 150 creepy descriptions in a modern setting: building interiors (and more) for use in any RPG from the pulp era to the present day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These descriptions run the gamut from simple signs of abandonment to weird things which may have a natural explanation to the downright horrific. A bloody handprint, steep staircase, dead rat and letters written by an unseen hand are some of the phenomena portrayed in this document. Send characters to a dusty library, wax museum, Gothic cathedral, or to the graveyard after dark. These slightly off-kilter descriptions are made for you, to ease the life of the Harried Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes 100 Bits of description which are small pieces you can use to add an eerie touch to your game, numbered so they can be used randomly. Each Bit is also provided in index card format for ease of use by Game Masters. In addition, there are more than 50 other descriptions that may depict particular features or detail specific locations. Illustrations by Bradley K. McDevitt only deepen the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
