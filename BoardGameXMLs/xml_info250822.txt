			<description>The best boxing game ever created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recreate the best fights in the history of the heavyweight division. Take on the role of matchmaker, trainer and cut man and lead one of 100 heavyweights to stunning victories in the ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From All-Time greats like Dempsey, Louis, Ali and the Klitschko brothers to Top Ten Contenders like Jerry Quarry, Zara Folley and Archie Moore, each fighter will perform for you as they did in the ring when they fought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And it isn't just the best of the best: rugged trial horses like Willi Besmanoff and Tex Cobb will do their best to pull off an upset win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it happens in boxing, it happens in Title Bout 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knockdowns, Knockouts, fouls, disqualifications, cuts, injuries and more occur with the frequency that you would expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unparalleled accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the fighters are rated in over three dozen categories, accurately portraying the fighter's skills both when fresh and when fatigued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn; fast to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though all aspects of boxing are included in Title Bout 2, thanks to the unique game design, illustrated rules and dozens of examples of play, you will be staging bouts in no time! And a typical 10-rounder can be 40 in 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create your own boxing history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Match Joe Louis against Mike Tyson; plot the strategies that Ali will use against a giant like Wladimir Klitschko. Or see if perennial contenders like Cleveland Williams, Bob Pastor or &amp;quot;Our 'Enry&amp;quot; Cooper can pull off an upset under your guidance and win a title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
