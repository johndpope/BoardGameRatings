							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Matchenck Race Book</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vicious, fast, and relentless; the matchenck are the hunters and assassins of the dravakor. A predator on two legs, a matchenck can follow a target's scent for miles, never giving up until warm blood washes over their clawed hands. They are terrible enemies to have, and hard friends to trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are matchenck. Since The Severing, you have been trying to reconcile your bestial urges with your new-found conscience. Getting people to trust you is difficult; they remember the horrible crimes you committed in the Emperor's name. But you must get them to trust you; the Empire has soldiers and agents everywhere. It's a hard fight, but there is one consolation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can't hide from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is part of a series of rules supplements for Dravakor, a fantasy role-playing game of heavy-metal intensity, using the popular Pathfinder rules system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Book Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete Rules for creating and playing Matchenck characters: The swift hunters of the Empire's armies.&lt;br/&gt;     New feats, especially tailored for these vicious killers.&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Items.&lt;br/&gt;     New Equipment.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules Clarifications.&lt;br/&gt;     Pre-made matchenck NPCs to use in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
