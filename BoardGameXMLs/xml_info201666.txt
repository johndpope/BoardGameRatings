							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Coming Storm</name>
									
			<description>Propaganda Pamphlet adventure for Weird War Two dual statted for D20 levels 5-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A military strike to recapture an Allied base against supernatural opponents. Storm clouds were gathering off the banks of the windswept Shetland Islands. White tipped waves crashed about the sleek dragon-headed ship carrying Hrothgar Runefist and his band. The shifting winds caused the canvas sails to flap like the wings of carrion birds over a battlefield. Hrothgar grasped at an empty scabbard and growled, cursing the Alf who had stolen his rune sword. On the island, a young fisherman's attention is drawn by a bluish glow upon the stormy sea. He rubs his eyes with disbelief as the dragon ship glides out of the fog and into the nearby harbor. The soldiers at the harbor are caught by surprise as ancient warriors surrounded by a blue nimbus of light quickly overtake their positions. Wolf-headed men leap off the dragon ship and begin shooting with MP-40's. The young fisherman starts the motor of his small boat and turns it around. He decides to head for the base at Scapa Flow. A Nazi flag flaps mockingly from the mast of the dragon ship as if it were waving him away....History is repeating itself in this new adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for the Weird War Two: Crusade for Europe RPG system  but also contains conversions for the d20 SRD system. They can also be used for any WWII-themed game system. Each is 16-page pamphlet containing everything a GM needs to run a single-session adventure. They also include a variety of new equipment, monsters, and technology for the WW2:CFE game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
