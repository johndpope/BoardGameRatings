							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leaving Solace Part 2: The Long March</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An After Zombies adventure for Experienced Survivors (Level 4 and up)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey north in a desperate attempt to give Solace Valley a fighting chance for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the first adventure in this series, it is assumed that the survivors are experienced (4th to 5th level) and well-equipped. If that isn&amp;rsquo;t the case, run other adventures to bring them up to the requirements of this adventure. In particular the published AZ adventures White Star Trailer Park and Solace Police Department are excellent sources of equipment for savvy survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also assumed the survivors have completed Leaving Solace, Part 1 prior to this adventure. That adventure sets up The Wave and the reasons for the proposed evacuation of Solace Valley and sets up the next stage of the campaign, the move to Ellis Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure will deliver a bit more of the unfolding story, and allow the PCs a chance to shape the course of events. New players in the drama are introduced, and a possible, or at least partial, solution to the threat is offered in the form of a submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
