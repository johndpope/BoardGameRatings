			<description>In LEGO&amp;reg; City, the Road Rescue crew is always on the job! These hard-working expert mechanics help out drivers in trouble, repairing their damaged vehicles on the spot or towing them to the big garage to get fixed up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to be a Road Rescue mechanic? Challenge your friends in a race to the Garage, helping out LEGO City's citizens along the way!&lt;br/&gt;(- from the publisher's summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This basic children's roll-and-move game appears in the September-October 2009 issue of LEGO Brickmaster Magazine. The board is printed on pages 14 and 15 of the magazine, and consists of a simple track of spaces (some with instructions) amidst imagery of sets from LEGO's 2009 City &amp;quot;Road Rescue&amp;quot; theme; the instructions appear in a sidebar next to the gameboard. LEGO elements are specified to be used as the player pieces and the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
