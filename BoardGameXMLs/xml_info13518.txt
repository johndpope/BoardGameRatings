			<description>This is a game of train building. To begin, players select a color, shuffle the tiles and lay them face down on the table. On a turn, you draw a tile and turn it face up. If it depicts several cars of your color, you play it to the table. If it has only one car of your color (or no car) you can either play it or discard it. Tiles played to the table must be connected in such a way that the tracks are joined correctly and the winding train grows longer with each play. A tile may not be placed so that the track turns back upon itself preventing another tile from being added. At first, players may add tiles to both ends of the train. When an engine or caboose is drawn, it must be added to the front or back respectively, thus reducing plays to only one side. When the train has both an engine and a caboose, the game ends. Players count all the cars of their color on the train, and the one with the most cars wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
