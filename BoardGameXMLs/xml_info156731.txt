							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fort Taztos</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Taztos is an outpost of the Ramala Legion of the Thardic Republic. It sits on the Salt Route that links the western H&amp;acirc;rnic realms with the kingdoms of the east. The fort has a permanent garrison of 100 (75 infantry and 25 cavalry), which is hopelessly inadequate for their appointed task of patrolling the huge Athul wilderness. Taztos may have the most skilled troops in the Thardic army and is regarded as &amp;ldquo;the hard school,&amp;rdquo; where a man fights well or not at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Taztos article describes the fort&amp;rsquo;s history, layout, and garrison. Also described are the nearby barrows, believed by most to be haunted. Additionally, GM and player local maps are included as well as interior plans for the fort itself, all in full-color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics release. Portions of this article were originally published in 1987 as part of the Thardic Republic module. It has new color artwork, significantly expanded plans and text, and an updated layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
