			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;STROKES will delight everyone from non-golfers to golfers just starting out...to regular golfers and even Professionals!  Conforming to the &amp;quot;Rules of Golf&amp;quot;, STROKES will provide all players hours of enjoyment.  Play for Tournament STROKES &amp;quot;Dollars&amp;quot;.  Select your game - Skins, Stroke Play, Matchplay, Foursomes, Stableford and mode.  It's Fun to play and educational too!  Now get ready..step onto the Tee and meet the challenge of STROKES - The Golf Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is rolling doubles on two diffident coloured die.  If you fail to get a double then then the player can choose to add the two die together within the rules (8 is the maximum total) to advance the ball token down each hole.  Like golf the player farthest from each hole has their turn.  When you land on the green, you can either try to roll any double to one put&amp;quot; or draw a card and look at the result.  Under certain conditions, like landing on a bunker space without rolling a double, you need to draw a hazard card.  Each hazard card has a section that applies to water, trees or sand that you must follow (depending on your situation)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
