			<description>De Boer Sjopspel is a game where players try to obtain all products listed on a shopping list. They do so by rolling a die to move on the board, trying to get to the items they need. The first person to get all the items and return to the cash register is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pawns are in the shape of shopping cards, made from plastic.&lt;br/&gt;The items come in the form of thick cardboard pieces which will be randomly placed on the board. Each card has a picture of the product printed on it. (User summary)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
