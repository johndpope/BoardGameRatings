			<description>This expansion contains eight new atoll tiles and lots of surprises. For example, there are atolls with only one or two usable islands, which can create 'blind alleys' but also 'springboards', and Bay Barons cannot be elected everywhere. Also, there are variable goods squares offering players a free choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second new ingredient is message in a bottle privileges, which wash up on shore and can be acquired. They allow additional actions such as intrigues and bribes, which make occupied posts unsafe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version also includes action markers, which are used to identify a tobacco factory which has already been used in a round, or an election held in a round, and to block standard squares in the three-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
