							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The British Army Desert War Game: Mod Wargaming Rules (1978)</name>
									
			<description>68 page softback book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;These rules were written in 1968 to wargame, at a tactical level, the desert warfare battles in a potential invasion of Iraq in the mid-1970&amp;rsquo;s. They are a piece of wargaming &amp;lsquo;archeology.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Land Rules for a Wargame in a Desert Setting in 1978 are an example of a military map based wargame. Written both for training and analysis, they have detailed information on matters important to the military and often ignored by hobby wargamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deployment times, lead times for preparation of assaults, ammunition constraints, shadowing retreating units and communications are all dealt with by the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Military wargames are traditional heavily umpired, with a large supporting case of assistants to help run the game, but this book contains guidance on how a modern wargamer can recreate the original game in a practical form on a single map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
