			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an RPG based on Shakespearean tragedies. Players take the role of Courtiers, and the Game Master is replaced by The Playwright. This is a semi-competitive RPG where each player has a Main Character, a sphere of influence, a secret goal, and an oath to the Grand Duke that each must choose to uphold or forswear. Most actions in this game are taken by one courtier against the sphere of influence of another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
