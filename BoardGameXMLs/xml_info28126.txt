			<description>From the box...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Med IQ makes honing your medical knowledge fun. The questions created by a panel of clinicians and medical educators headed by Morton Bogdonoff, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the Cornell University College of Medicine, deal with everything from medical lore and history to therapeutic decisions and case histories.  The game can be played with a group playing individually or in teams - or solitaire.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Game board&lt;br/&gt;192 regular question cards&lt;br/&gt;60 case study cards&lt;br/&gt;Scoring sheets (for solitaire game)&lt;br/&gt;4 pawns (ambulance, beaker, doctor bag, and microscope)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a trivia game that was apparently released in conjunction with the drug Actigall (Ursodiol). Each turn you choose one of the four basic categories: Lore, Vital signs, Therapy, or Miscellany. Another player draws a card and asks the question relating to the category you chose. Each questions has a number next to it. If answered correctly, move that number of spaces forward on the board. If incorrect, move ahead one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are case study spaces on the board that let you conduct a case study. Each case study has three questions and you move forward 2 spaces for each correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player/team reaches the end and is named &amp;quot;Doctor of the Year&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question examples:&lt;br/&gt;- Lore(3 points): In hypertension, what is the Pae mosaic?&lt;br/&gt;- Vital Signs(2 points): A 50-year old man presents with vertigo. He has horizontal nystagmus that rapidly fatigues. Which is the likely source of his vertigo; the inner ear or the cerebellum?&lt;br/&gt;- Therapy(4 points): What surgical approach to the pituitary gland has replaced the earlier technique of open craniotomy?&lt;br/&gt;- Miscellany(2 points): What characteristics of malignant melanoma s its most important prognostic indicator?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
