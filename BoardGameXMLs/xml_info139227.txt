			<description>&amp;quot;Viy&amp;quot; is a card game based on the story of Nikolay Gogol. The game is in development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will take a role of one of special orthodox monks fighting the evil spirits. Their task is to send the witch to the hell. It requires joint efforts to serve three nights for the repose of the &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; witch and to do not allow her to return to the living world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the same time the monks have to constantly clean the temple from arriving evil spirits, sending them back to the underworld. During the night the monk can be affected by one or more demons. If the brothers don't conduct an exorcism in a proper time, affected monk moves to the side of evil forces. Such player gets a special assignment. His sole victory depends on this exercise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
