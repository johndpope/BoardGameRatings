			<description>Game based on a character in a Spanish children's series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the cards are dealt out and play continues in the same way as quartet games. You ask another player for a certain numbered card. If that person has it, the card is given to the player who asked for it. Then he may ask another player (or the same player again) for another numbered card. If he gets a positive response, his turn continues. But if the player asked does not have that cards, the questioner's turn ends and the player asked starts the next round of questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to lay face-down in front of you any set of 3 consecutively numbered cards. These are safe and cannot be taken by anyone else. On future turns you may add further numbers as long as they are of a consecutive number. When all the cards are placed in such 'runs', the game ends and the player with the most cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
