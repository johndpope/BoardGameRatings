			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Profession skill on the Miscellaneous skill chart in the Magestry Player&amp;rsquo;s Rulebook may not look like much more than a single skill, but in this chapter you will learn about the many options that it opens to your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Profession skill by itself provides your character money. An Apprentice earns 3 silver pieces per event, a journeyman earns 10 silver pieces (1 gold crown) per event, and a master earns 20 silver pieces (2 gold crowns) per event. This money represents your character&amp;rsquo;s business between events and will be received at check-in of the next event that character attends. You will only receive one event worth of payment for each game you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your character is allowed hold multiple professions, but he must advance through the ranks in each of them separately, and no matter how many he holds, he will not receive more than 4 gold crowns per event at check-in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
