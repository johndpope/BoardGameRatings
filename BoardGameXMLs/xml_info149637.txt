			<description>Dead @ 17: The Battle for Darlington Hills is a deck-building game in which players fight for the side of good or evil, building powerful decks. This game, based on Josh Howard's Image comic book series, has players taking on the role of the main character Nara and her friends. They will have to collect and use an arsenal of weapons that can range from knives to powerful magic. These weapons are used to push back the seemingly endless army from Hell. One player will use an evil avatar to summon these minions. Using characters right out of comic they will attempt to open portals to Hell at locations around the town of Darlington Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The struggle between the factions plays out in the supply deck of cards as well as at the locations. Each card that the players acquire has a use for either the good or the evil player. The more powerful cards for one is a weaker card for the other. Players may take on aggressive or defensive strategies while building their decks. The game concludes as one player opens the gates to Hell or the other banishes them to the darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
