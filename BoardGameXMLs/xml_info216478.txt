			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Dispatches from Raven Crowking&amp;rsquo;s Nest Volume III. Pull up a chair, set your drink near your hand, and let&amp;rsquo;s talk. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much what this is. Chatting about games in general, and Dungeon Crawl Classics in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name implies, Dispatches has its genesis in my blog, Raven Crowking&amp;rsquo;s Nest. Dispatches has a few advantages over the free blog versions of the same material. First off, the material has been re-edited, cleaned up, and in some cases expanded. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, it is in print so that you can keep it on your gaming shelf. Finally, Dispatches will contain some new material as well&amp;hellip;a &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; for your continued interest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have opinions &amp;ndash; lots of them! &amp;ndash; but I&amp;rsquo;m going to dispense with the &amp;ldquo;IMHO&amp;rdquo;s and &amp;ldquo;IME&amp;rdquo;s, and assume that you, the Gentle Reader, are smart enough to know that I am talking about my own opinions and experiences. And, if I am wrong in that assumption, feel free to tell me so!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume focuses on articles related to creating sandbox environments. Although these articles use the excellent Dungeon Crawl Classics system, the general principles are adaptable to almost any game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    What is a Sandbox&lt;br/&gt;    Why System Matters&lt;br/&gt;    Recommendations&lt;br/&gt;    Initial Set Up For Sandbox Games&lt;br/&gt;    Initial Base of Operations&lt;br/&gt;    An Interesting Outdoor Area to Explore&lt;br/&gt;    An Overview of the Region&lt;br/&gt;    Initial Adventure Sites&lt;br/&gt;    Notes for Dungeon Crawl Classics Judges&lt;br/&gt;    Modules in the Sandbox&lt;br/&gt;    A Sample Minor Adventure Site&lt;br/&gt;    The Great Outdoors&lt;br/&gt;    Some Centaurs for Sandbox Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
