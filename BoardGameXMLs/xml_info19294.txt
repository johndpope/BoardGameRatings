			<description>Infinite Armies (iA) is a customizable card game published as a PDF.  The players can create any cards they want before printing them out and playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of game mechanics, you play on an imaginary grid that represents the battlefield. Half your territory, half your opponent's. You win by either destroying your foe's Staging Area, or running them out of cards by keeping units in their territory. The more powerful the unit, the faster your opponent's cards go away. When they're out of cards, they sue for peace. Game over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;iA has no &amp;quot;mana&amp;quot;. Rather, you get a certain number of actions each turn, which can include collecting resource points, deploying units, making attacks or using special abilities. If you can't deploy a unit, spend an action to collect the resources you need to pay the cost! And, iA minimizes the luck of the draw. Your opening hand is exactly what you want. You start each battle with the forces you think will bring you victory. Of course, your opponent is doing the same, and only one of you will be right...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
