			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defeat the blue suit and save Canada from electile dysfunction in this cooperative game guaranteed to raise the best-glued toupees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Minister Most Sinister, you play as one of the four challengers vying to topple the toupee. Candidates race around the campaign trail trying to collect sets of cards that ridicule Stevie's shortcomings on Business, Science, Security and Popularity issues. Will you work together to take back some of the Sinister-engineered disadvantages and give your fellow candidates enough resources to challenge and defeat Stevie in time, or will individual greed allow the Worst-Past-the-Post system to squeeze out another Sinister win?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have no fear: unlike the longest election in over a hundred years, Minister Most Sinister doesn't take 78 days and hundreds of millions of dollars to play. This fast-paced game plays in under 20 minutes with 2 to 4 players. And with 18 different Election Rules, each new game will test your campaigning abilities against the Man in the Blue Suit's devious schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
