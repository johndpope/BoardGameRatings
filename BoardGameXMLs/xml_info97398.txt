							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hank&#039;s Golf Resort</name>
									
			<description>Hank Powerman&amp;rsquo;s dream was to run the perfect golf resort.  He&amp;rsquo;d just won the one million dollar lottery; problem is, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to design one.  That&amp;rsquo;s where you come in.  Hank will hire you to design the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest golf course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this unique card game, players must build a golf course by buying holes, and amenities (IE Pro Shop, Pool area, etc.), then using your &amp;quot;Fore!&amp;quot; cards that you were dealt with in the beginning of the game, by constructing your course, laying down the cards on the table making sure the cart path connects with each other.  Continue to lay the cards until you have all 18 holes on your course, but beware your opponents can sabotage your course with gophers and floods.  Don't forget, you also need employees to help you run Hank's Resort to help you combat your opponent's disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Its a game that's Par for the Course!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
