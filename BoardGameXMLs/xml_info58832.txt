							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enlightened Monk</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Enlightened monks are paragons of intense physical and mental training, joining the body and mind into one complete being which utilizes the strength of the two combined. Presented within the pages of The Mind Unveiled: Enlightened Monk is a new variant psionic base class - the Enlightened Monk - as well as a variety of new feats and Ki styles to use with this new base class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presenting a psionic take on the monk class, the enlightened monk channels his internal energy into a variety of abilities - some familiar, some brand new. Truly combine the powers of the body and the mind in this new release from Dreamscarred Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 11 pages of new material, The Mind Unveiled: Enlightened Monk details everything you need to play or use the monk class with a psionic slant, as well as offering several new feats to enhance the playability of the monk - both the standard, and the variant Enlightened Monk. The Enlightened Monk can be added into any normal game, working within the same boundaries as the traditional monk, but with new options and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mind Unveiled: Enlightened Monk is written by Andreas R&amp;ouml;nnqvist, whose other works include High Psionics: Psicrystals Expanded and High Psionics: Sequestral Feats.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
