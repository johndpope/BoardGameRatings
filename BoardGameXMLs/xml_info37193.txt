			<description>Imagine a world where the Magic is dying.  Where dragons and wizards are forced into hiding as their numbers dwindle.  But the Spirit of Magic gives a final push to save itself and six brightly colored dragon babies are born to powerful parents.  All the creatures in Ohadi, a magical land of majestic mountains, rolling rivers and forbidden forests, must work together to teach the babies their dragon skills before the Magic disappears forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first dragon to earn all 5 Dragon Skill cards, receive a dragon name, collect each of the 3 treasures from the King's Castle, and return to the cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player plays a dragon moving around the board collecting various items and avoiding spaces that deter progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
