			<description>A luminous observation game: The cards all look the same at first glance, so it's not so easy to pair them up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is create as many pairs as You can. Players mix the cards then place them on the table with the &amp;quot;5 geometric forms&amp;quot; side facing upwards. All the players play at the same time. Once the signal is given, each player looks at the cards and tries to find identical pairs. As soon as a player thinks he has created a pair, he takes two cards, places them in front of him and continues to search for other pairs. But watch out for mistakes as the cards are very similar!In fact, all the cards contain the 5 same geometric shapes; only their location differs from one card to the other. You are not allowed to touch the cards except to finally take them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when there are no more cards in the centre of the table, or it does not seem possible to create another pair (if the players have taken incorrect pairs), each player checks the pairs that he has created. Winner is the player with the most correct pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     48 luminous cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
