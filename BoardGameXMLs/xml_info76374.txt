							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragons of Legend (d20 Edition)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dragons.&amp;quot;  Even the very word is enough to illicit a visceral reaction.  Every culture in the world has legends of these fearsome beast, and every one is distinct.  There is no reason to use generic Dragons in your game when the world is full of unique examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons of Legend presents five stories of dragons from around the world:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Hi-no-kami from Japan&lt;br/&gt;     The Irish Fire Dragon&lt;br/&gt;     The Lambton Wrym of Britain&lt;br/&gt;     The Ryu-Hime (Dragon Princess) of Lake Biwa, Japan&lt;br/&gt;     The Pre-Columbian Piasa from what is now Illinois&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These stories are told in as close to their original form as possible.  (When dealing with myths there is always a question of which version is the &amp;quot;Original&amp;quot;.)  Not only do these legends go into detail about the type of damage the dragon can inflict, they describe how to the beasts can be overcome.  Even if you do not intend to use these legends in your campaign, player and GMs alike can learn from the methods employed by the heroes of the stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons of Legend provides game mechanics for each dragon, and other creatures from the stories.  These statistics are as easy to use as a standard monster, but they are written straight from the legends, not to fill a predefined place in a Challenge Rating X dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re tired of using stereotypical dragons strait from computer games, flip through Dragons of Legend and confront the player's characters with one of these fearsome foes, for an adventure worthy of being retold down through the ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
