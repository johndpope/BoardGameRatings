			<description>22ra (translated &amp;ldquo;to 22&amp;rdquo; points) is a card-driven game that simulates basque hand-pelota  games between 2 players, or 4 players when playing doubles. The objective is to score 22 points by playing cards, so that the opponent cannot or does not want to reach the ball or makes a foul when hitting the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of three separate decks of cards: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         The Player Trait&amp;rsquo;s cards, consisting of &lt;br/&gt;             Movement cards (Mugimendu) &lt;br/&gt;             Force cards (Indar), and&lt;br/&gt;             Skill cards (Abilezia)&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;         The Serve Deck (Sake), with &lt;br/&gt;             Normal serve cards (Arrunta) and&lt;br/&gt;             Risky serve cards (Ausarta) &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;         The Hit Deck, which consists of three Subdecks: &lt;br/&gt;             The Bounce Back cards (Botez Atzera), the ball is hit after it bounces&lt;br/&gt;             The Defence Volley cards (Airez Defentsa), the ball is hit before it bounces&lt;br/&gt;             The Good-play cards (Jokaldia), with different special hits and plays. &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents the fronton, divided in 7 squares (A1, A2, B1, B2, D, F and R), contains also a scoring track and 5 Timeout spaces for each player (Atsedenaldiak).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses seven Player Trait cards, at least 4 Movement cards. Then each player is dealt 4 Good-play cards. A start player is chosen randomly (the server in the first point) and the game can begin: the server chooses a Serve card. If the serve is good, the receiver must hit it back either after the ball bounces (from the same square where the ball is, using a Bounce Back card) or before the ball bounces (from the square directly in front of the ball, using a Defence Volley card). Play continues until one player fails to hit the ball (cannot/does not want to hit or hits a ball badly), therefore losing the point (Falta) or the other player makes a great hit, directly winning the point (Tanto). After each point, the players recover a Player Trait card and replenish their hand of Good-play cards (up to 4 cards). The first player reaching 22 points wins immediately the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In double games, the teams are formed by a Forward and a Defender, and the games are also played to 22 points. The rules are the same, except that each player chooses 4 Player Trait cards (at least 2 Movement cards) and that they can exchange the Good-play cards before the start of each point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
