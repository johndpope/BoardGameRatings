							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crop Circles</name>
									
			<description>This may be the strangest game you have ever seen! Players begin by building Stonehenge using nicely-produced blocks, but this is just the start of the strategy. The first player, as a druid or as an alien, to place their altar in the center of the stones (and not having it removed by a competing Merlin card) can collect the Sun Circle and the Heal Circle. Bring these Circles to the Eastern Ley Line, declare the Summer Solstice, and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is wild and fun. It includes Planet counters, start counter, UFOs, crop circle cards, Andromeda counters, Yule Circle counters, Zenith Circle counters, Lunar Eclipse Circles, Star Circle counters, Circle and Night dice, and much more. Super components, creative rules with lots of mystical imagery, but most of all good fun as the secrets of the Crop Circles are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
