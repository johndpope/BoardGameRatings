			<description>PLANET PIONEER is a fast-paced, family-friendly card game for 2-4 players, ages 8 and up. It's easy to learn, but tough to master!&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Starting at a Base Station, you build structures, add Oxygen, Water, Crops and other items needed to create your new colony on a distant planet. You may even encounter hostile or friendly aliens. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game claims the planet and victory!&lt;br/&gt;SETUP: Separate all Base Station cards from deck. One per player. This is your starting point. Set aside any unused Base Station cards and out of play in a Discard Pile. Shuffle the deck and deal five cards to each player. Place the rest of the deck face down. This is the Draw Pile. Each player will need a total playing space of approximately 14&amp;rdquo; across and 16&amp;rdquo; down to create a grid of 5 cards across and 4 cards down. Place your Base Station at the top center.&lt;br/&gt;STARTING THE GAME: The player who had their birthday most recently goes first, then play continues around clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;FIRST ROUND: During your turn, draw a card from the Draw Pile.&lt;br/&gt;Lay any card in your hand with a Level of 1, or an Alien Visit, next to or above your Base Station.If you cannot play a card, place one face up in the discard pile. This ends of your turn. Cards can only be played side to side, or top to bottom, but not&lt;br/&gt;diagonally. Play continues until each player has placed a card next to their Base. This completes the first round.&lt;br/&gt;SECOND ROUND and BEYOND: On the second round, each player has the option of playing any card in their hand with a Level of 2&lt;br/&gt;or less, Alien Visit, Alien Attack or Meteor Strike. Third round can play Level 3 or less. Fourth round Level 4 or less. Fifth round Level 5 or less. Each rounds afterwards you can play any card, but you cannot repeat identical cards you have already&lt;br/&gt;placed in your colony, unless detroyed by meteor.&lt;br/&gt;OPTIONS OF PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Lay down a Defense Laser/Force Field card to your colony to protect it and any card next to it from Meteor Strikes and/or Alien Attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Lay down an Alien Attack card on an unoccupied space in an    opponents colony. They wait 1 turn.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Lay down an Alien Visit card on an unoccupied space in your colony. You take 1 turn.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Lay down a Meteor Strike card on top of a card in your opponent&amp;rsquo;s colony (except Base, Force Field, Defense Battery or Alien Visit). It is destroyed and cannot be rebuilt upon, except with a Meteor Cap. Any Level of that card is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Lay down a Meteor Cap card on top of a Meteor Strike.&lt;br/&gt;WINNING THE GAME: The final round is determined when one player has filled a full grid of 5 cards across and 4 cards down. All other players have one final turn and the play ends. Add the Level of all cards in your colony,except those destoyed by Meteor Strikes. Subtract from that the Level of all remaining&lt;br/&gt;cards in your hand. &lt;br/&gt;Highest total claims the planet and victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
