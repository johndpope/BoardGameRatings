							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Simulacra Games: The Wilson Wolfe Affair</name>
									
			<description>A cooperative games for one or many players, where you receive a crate full of seemingly innocuous goodies &amp;ndash; but &amp;ndash; after looking things over, finding hidden clues, and solving puzzles... you unveil a sinister conspiracy that covers the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You open the box to find a collection of strange artefacts seemingly from the world of 1930's animation; letters, animation cels, booklets, puzzles, games. With very little instruction included, you will start sorting through the objects and putting things together, and you'll find that below the surface lies a deep and engaging conspiracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you make progress by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;reading letters and diaries&lt;br/&gt;    piecing stories together&lt;br/&gt;    making deductions&lt;br/&gt;    fact checking&lt;br/&gt;    breaking codes&lt;br/&gt;    solving puzzles&lt;br/&gt;    finding messages hidden in plain sight&lt;br/&gt;    playing games&lt;br/&gt;    chasing clues online&lt;br/&gt;    cracking riddles&lt;br/&gt;    discovering unique interactions between objects&lt;br/&gt;    and looking at what&amp;rsquo;s in front of you in a different light&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to unravel the narrative story, and and find out all you can about the shadowy organisation that lurks behind the scenes of the film industry. The game is completed when all the puzzles are solved and the mystery is revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part puzzle hunt, part at-home-escape-room, part mystery game, it's the most immersive experience you can have on board game night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
