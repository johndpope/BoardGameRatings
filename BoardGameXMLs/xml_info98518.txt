			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trystell as a setting dates back 11 years now, to 1998, the very time when Tab Creations grew out of it's predecessor, Tab Comics. Trystell itself is a descendant of the earlier Swords &amp;amp; Arrows comic, but it was really the development of the Trystell setting into a standalone tabletop role-playing game that prompted the setting to take on a life of its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since that time, Trystell has undergone at least three editions, and been converted into a multitude of different systems. Campaigns set in Trystell have been run in a number of cities around the country, and it has even been used for several LARPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you hold in your hands &amp;mdash; or read on your computer screen, for those so digitally inclined &amp;mdash; is the fourth edition of the Trystell setting, and the second major revision the setting has underwent since its creation. It is also the first and only reboot of the Trystell cannon the setting has received.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you find this work both interesting as a player and useful as a GM's tool. And enjoy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
