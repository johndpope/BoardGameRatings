			<description>Custom Robo V2 (カスタムロボV２, Kasutamu Robo Buitsū) is a robot fighting game developed by Noise and published by Nintendo. It was released for the Nintendo 64 in Japan on November 10, 2000. Later, on February 19, 2008, it was released for the Virtual Console in Japan, but it is unknown if it will be released in any region outside of Japan for the Virtual Console. It is the second title of the Custom Robo series, as well as the last of the series for the Nintendo 64. It is also the first title of the series to allow up to four players to play, instead of two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle system in Custom Robo V2 is very similar to the first one, except it features tag-teaming, which was never used in later 3D Custom Robo titles except for Custom Robo: Battle Revolution for the Nintendo GameCube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Custom Robo V2 is divided into two main parts the over world and Robo battles during the over world parts of the game it plays like any other RPG meaning that you play as a character in a free roaming world where other characters follow. The main object of the whole game is to finish its plot by collecting every Robo, battle part, and other items that the player wants, while winning every battle that moves you from one part of the storyline to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Custom Robo battles, the object is to reduce the opponent's hit points from 1000 to 0 by using different Custom Robos, guns, bombs, pods, and dash attacks. Battles begin with both robos being launched out of a Robocannon which is controlled with the control stick. There are six ways your robo can land once shot out of the Robocannon. Custom Robos are arranged in groups that are similar to their abilities. An endurance bar is located above the hit points. Once it runs out the robo gets &amp;quot;downed&amp;quot; which means that it stays fallen for a couple seconds. After it gets up, it goes into &amp;quot;rebirth&amp;quot;, where it stays invincible for about 3 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Custom Robo V2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
