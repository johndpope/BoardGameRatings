			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[The] entrance is made of tough granite and was once decorated with elegant carvings and lettering.  Now, however, it is in absolute ruin, choked with rubble from the raid.  It is evidently impenetrable, and no amount of searching or digging will reveal any way to gain entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fan-created, hand-written scenario is intended for low-level characters and was written as an expansion to B2: The Keep on the Borderlands.  An overland hex map locates several areas from both scenarios.  Written abt. 1982, the scenario has enjoyed with circulation since abt. 2015 as both a collection of JPG images and compiled PDFs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
