			<description>&amp;quot;The Furiously Fun Game for All Music Lovers.&amp;quot;  The object of the game is to earn points and advance game piece up the game board by correctly identifying song titles and/or artists played on your CDs, Mini Discs, cassettes or other music sources such as the radio, television or the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components consist of a hinged, black box such as old record collections used to come packaged in; a game board, half of which is the actual playing board being a facsimile of the controls and knobs of a turntable, and the other half being a facsimile of the turntable itself; six playing pieces in the form of Ernie Ball guitar picks; one 15-second sand timer; one drawstring bag to hold the timer and picks; and an actual vinyl record which, when placed on the turntable side of the board, becomes the game spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DJ plays music, spins the record and the players try to answer any questions put forth by the DJ about the music being played. Either a solo player makes the guess or all guess depending on which way the spinner points. Sometimes all can guess but for one player who has been &amp;quot;muted.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player or team which reaches &amp;quot;11&amp;quot; on the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
