			<description>Them Bones is a 4 player perfect-information strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the bone yard isn't a lively place, it's most definitely an active one, especially the underground scene! And all that activity has come to a head now that it's Halloween night. The Necromancer has returned to this unhallowed yard with his once-yearly promise to revive ONE skeleton. Factions have been established, lines drawn, and the fight is on! And you'll be damned if he picks somebony else AGAIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Them Bones starts off like any normal graveyard - with all of the skeletons in their graves. But the necromancer is coming and only ONE skeleton will get a second chance at life. You'll have to work together with your competitors to eliminate other skeletons, but it'll be up to you alone to take and hold the central Masoleum while the necormancer casts his spell. Don't forget to use of the graveyard's underground tunnel network to move between graves and get the jump on your competition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skeletons are captured by being surrounded by any two opposing skeletons (mixed-force captures are allowed!). The first player to capture and hold the center space for one full round wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
