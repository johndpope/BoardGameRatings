							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Table Cricket Game</name>
									
			<description>The Table Cricket Game is played (as noted in the rules) &amp;quot;...as per the rules of real one-day limited over cricket.&amp;quot; The batsman draws cards from a deck and the fielder places his pawns on the spaces on the board marked by dots, such as &amp;quot;silly point&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;midoff.&amp;quot; The batsman then plays his cards one after the other, and tallies his runs. Each card has a type of hit (such as &amp;quot;Full-blooded drive to Mid-on&amp;quot;) as well as a F and NF section, showing how many runs would be scored if the fielder has placed a pawn there (F for &amp;quot;fielder&amp;quot;) or if there is no fielding pawn there (NF for &amp;quot;no fielder&amp;quot;). Scores are tabulated on the score sheet pads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No publisher or designer was listed on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
