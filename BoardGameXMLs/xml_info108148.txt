							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Vore 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From our Pre-Hot Chicks product line, we bring Doctor Vore into the world of the Earth of 2015. His one life's dream, to feed the starving masses of the Earth TO the starving masses of the Earth has progressed nicely, and he is poised on the edge of creating the most perfect food ever made... made of people, that is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But things are not all as they seem, and even a cruel and inhuman criminal organization bent on rendering helpless people down to nutrients can have darker secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctor Vore 2 is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game.  It includes game statistics for the Doctor and his close associates, his minions, and some standard random victims. More, it includes more tentacles for Tentacle Monsters, the Super Powers that allow a character to create these tentacles on their own, and some of the most bizarre and dangerous twists and turns yet encountered in Hot Chicks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil. It's what's for dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
