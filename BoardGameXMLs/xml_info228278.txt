							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Climate Change in Copenhagen, December 2009 - Instructors Manual and Roles</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is set in the Copenhagen Climate Conference (COP15) in December 2009. The game begins with presentations by the IPCC faction to explain the need for a treaty followed by the opposing position by the climate denier faction. After this, the various countries present initial proposals and the less developed countries (LDC) and those most effected make their argument for justice on the issue. As in the real negotiation, the key players are the USA and China. Neither wants to go first and ultimately they will need to negotiate privately to find a compromise. The sticking points are how much reduction to require, the level of transparency required, and whether the treaty is legal or political. There is also debate over funding adaptation by the LDC&amp;rsquo;s. The students will succeed in getting a treaty if they can find appropriate compromises. In some cases, they fail to reach a treaty if either the US or China is intractable on their victory objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
