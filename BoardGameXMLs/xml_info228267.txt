			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Treason Walks the Land...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble stirs in Dunador! The King lies dead of a wound received during a hunting expedition. His brother, Lord Edrin, challenges the rightful Crown Prince, a half-trained young man named Edmund, for possession of the throne while Edmund travels on a pilgrimage to the holy shrine of Nevron. Forces throughout the kingdom vie for control of the realm. Can the player characters find the Crown Prince and protect him from the treacherous forces at large in Dunador?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N3: &amp;quot;Destiny of Kings&amp;quot; (1986), by Stephen Bourne, is the third adventure in the novice series for AD&amp;amp;D. It's up at the upper end of what could be considered &amp;quot;novice&amp;quot; play, though, with the pre-rolled characters being 3rd and 4th level. It was released in February 1986.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like N2: &amp;quot;The Forest Oracle&amp;quot; (1984), this adventure is offered as a generic adventure, not specifically based in any existing AD&amp;amp;D setting. Suggestions are given in the conversion guide to place the adventure in the Forgotten Realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of the Dungeons. One of the most impressive elements of N3 is its complete lack of dungeons. Instead - as was increasingly the case by the mid 80s - the players are heavily embroiled in a plot. They must find the prince of Dunador and return him home safely. Elements of investigation and intrigue thus find their way into the game. There is also some opportunity for wilderness adventure - a quality that was also becoming more common in AD&amp;amp;D by the mid-80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future History. A decade after its original publication, Wizards of the Coast updated &amp;quot;Destiny of Kings&amp;quot; to 2nd edition AD&amp;amp;D and reprinted it (1998). It was one of the few classic adventures to receive this treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conversion guide allows DMs to run the original module with 5th Edition rules and provides a reference sheet for encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this conversion guide you will need a copy of N3: Destiny of Kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
