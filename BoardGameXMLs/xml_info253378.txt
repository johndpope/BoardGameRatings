							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Order of Vaxx</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Shepherd Option For Pugmire Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Church of Man serves as the religious foundation of the Kingdom of Pugmire. Shepherds of the church uphold the Code of Man, share its teachings and live by its tenets. While all Shepherds believe that the core teaching to Be a Good Dog is the most important aspect of the Code of Man, there are some who place the teaching to Protect all from the Unseen as a very close second. The most zealous of these guardian-shepherds draw the attention of a secret order within the Church of Man, called the Order of Vaxx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Vaxx is a collection of shepherds dedicated to protecting all from the Unseen, no matter the cost. Through an ancient alchemical concoction dating back to the time of Man, Shepherds of the Order of Vaxx arm themselves against the Unseen by taking a small measure of dark power within themselves. This potent alchemical potion, known as Vaxx, allows the shepherd to gain amazing resistance to the magics of the Unseen. Some members of the Order of Vaxx further refine this ability, learning to use the powers of darkness in defense of the light!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order of Vaxx is a Shepherd option and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Details regarding the Order of Vaxx, a secret order within the Church of Man&lt;br/&gt;    A new Shepherd Trick: Inoculated&lt;br/&gt;    Eight Refinements for the Inoculated trick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
