			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you at the bank to make a deposit, or a withdrawal-of the illegal kind? Is the bank manager subjecting the poor mining town to exorbitant interest rates, and you've come to &amp;quot;talk some sense into him&amp;quot;? Have you caught wind of a black hat's plot to blow the bank sky-high with dynamite, thereby eliminating his debts? With D20 Cartographer, the story is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Western Maps&amp;quot; are full-featured encounter maps designed for Wild West campaigns.
