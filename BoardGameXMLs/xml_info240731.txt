			<description>Busy Work is a fast-paced multiplayer game that makes a frantic and hilarious gameplay out of the monotonous aspects of office work. You and your colleagues (up to 8 players) compete to answer as many customer emails as possible before the morning meeting while constantly being interrupted with phone calls, pop-up calendar reminders, &amp;lsquo;urgent&amp;rsquo; physical tasks, and more. Will you win the coveted employee-of-the-day bonus and lord it over your co-workers at happy hour?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
