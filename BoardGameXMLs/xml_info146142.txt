			<description>From publisher description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Co-operative Deck-Building!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Csenge was identified as a precocious talent my mages from the Council at a young age. Unfortunately, she did nopt take well to the dsicpline and ,eventually was expelled. After a number of years developing her talents in her own way she became a formidable battle mage, much sought after as a mercenary. The Council decided it was better to have her inside throwing balls of fire out, than outside throwing them in. She is now a full member of the Council, much to the chagrin of her former tutors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Hard Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magistra Csenge is a new Hero deck, fully compatible with the base game. It introduces a new mechanic, mana, that makes forcing combinations of cards more critical than ever. She also takes time to develop his deck, making her hard to manage for short Start Phases. She is recommended for experienced Bulwark players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
