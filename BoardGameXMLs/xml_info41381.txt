							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pixie Play Tray</name>
									
			<description>This is a collection of three card games and a tray to play them in.  The cards are square and of thick cardstock.  The plastic tray has 3x3 playing area of recessed squares -- to allow stacking while preventing slippage (&amp;quot;great car fun&amp;quot;) -- and a deeper square to the side for the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game has its own small deck:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Wiggle Worm: There are 2 head cards that start at opposite corners; the rest of the cards show parts of one or two worm bodies that pass through the card.  A connection game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Cross Word: Each card has a letter.  Players try to spell words across and down, and perhaps diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Tick-Tack Whoa: The cards show either X, O, or &amp;quot;Whoa&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
