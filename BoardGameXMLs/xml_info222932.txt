							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fargone: A Dystopian Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>Fargo, 2125. In the frigid, poverty-stricken, high-tech sprawl at the edge of the plains, a robot runs a food cart selling egg bake as a front for the Internal Police sting of an illicit artificial-consciousness-transferrance ring. Drunkards dig through trash heaps for electronics worth repurposing. Cars float past, gliding towards domes filled with wealthy families pitting their children against one-another in feuds fueled by privilege.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Midwest.  Sure, it's exciting getting pushed through a portal in a mad scientist's laboratory or stealing a car packed with extra-dimensional ore. But how about the bag lady down the block who asks everyone she meets if they remember Favre and the glory years, tailgate parties with beer brats and cheese wheels and deer heads mounted on wood paneling. She's ancient, but rumor has it she used to work for a top-secret division within Torvalis, so maybe she's an experiment gone wrong or a first-class ticket to high-science adventures...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplaying goes beyond escapism and gives people safe spaces in which to explore the problems posed by contemporary life. While talking about environmental devastation, xenophobia, class warfare, and privacy rights, players can decide whether they'd like to live in a future that involves fights to the death with cyborgs waist-deep in snow on the banks of the mighty Red River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
