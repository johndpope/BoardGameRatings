			<description>PUTTING IS FOR WIMPS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is nothing that can beat the feeling of a perfect hit with the driver! This game is all about the two best features of golf: Hitting furiously long drives &amp;amp; kicking your friends butts! That is why we have produced this network based, action golf game with the driver as your only weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has three major difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Unlike most golf games there are no bars to show when to start and when to finish your swing. It is more difficult our way, but in the same time a lot more fun. You have to learn the behaviour of your character and learn when to press in order to get a perfect hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. When you have hit the ball you have to use the phone&amp;acute;s gyroscope in order to steer the ball. No matter if you hit a &amp;ldquo;monster shot&amp;rdquo; or not, the wind will be a big challenge for you. Of course the wind varies from course to course and gets more and more difficult to handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. When you feel somewhat confident that you master 1 &amp;amp; 2 above you are ready to enter the battle mode. In battle mode you will definitely experience difficulty number three; the stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place at four different arenas with different access levels depending on your own ranking. Everybody starts out as Duffers with a limited acces to only New Down Under. As you progress and level up you will gain access to our other arenas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the fact that the game is network based you will be able to play against your friends independent of what platform they are on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
