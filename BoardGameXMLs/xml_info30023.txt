			<description>Ligny&lt;br/&gt;Incomplete Victory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleon's strategy was to cross the border in secret and attack the Allied armies before they could combine and outnumber his army. If he could engage them separately, then his army would outnumber theirs in individual engagements. To that end, he had sent Ney's 2nd Corps and 3rd Cavalry Corps to block the Allied army at the crossroads of Quatre Bras on the same day, so that it could not proceed down the Nivelles-Namur road to bolster the right of the Prussian position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prussians had deployed along the Ligny Brook. They held all the farmhouses and a good defensive position, with most of their advance forces under cover. In fact the Prussian three army corps' positions were so good, that Napoleon at first was deceived into thinking there was only one army corps. However, Bl&amp;uuml;cher had overstretched his left flank, and exposed his right to French artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Napoleon's Last Battles Quadrigame.  It was sold separately as a folio game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Folio version includes rules, a 17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; map and 100 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
