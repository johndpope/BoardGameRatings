			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spearhead LRP aim to provide quality live-roleplay events set in a unique, gritty, high fantasy campaign world, where every action has a consequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are new to live roleplay then you may initially find it all a bit confusing. Think of it as instead of controlling a character on a tabletop or in a computer game you actually don costume and armour, pick up a weapon and go on to act out your chosen character. As your character you work with other players to solve puzzles, trade, negotiate and when all goes wrong, defend yourself against often monstrous bad guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign guide and the rulebook lay out the basics of the gameworld and the mechanics behind the events. Please take time to read through. If you have further questions, contact us and we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to answer any queries. The website is a further source of information and by registering on the forums you can introduce yourself and garner further details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
