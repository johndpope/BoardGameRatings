							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of the Teachings of the People</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, there were the stones and the plants and the beasts. And, to name them all came The Ancients.&lt;br/&gt;The days in the garden were simple for the ancients. For food they need only reach to the trees, for drink to the clear stream. They still dwelt in instinct, rather than wisdom.&lt;br/&gt;Being delivered to the garden, The Ancients had all but forgotten the dark Before Time. But it was still strong in the hearts of the Prophets and their kin. And Strong in the lands outside The Garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, we record their teachings for the ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game text is provided as a text-only file for reading, the PDF version is required as a print-and-play version for actual game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
