							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shank</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Shank is a 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up developed by Klei Entertainment. It features melee and ranged combat. It was announced at Penny Arcade Expo 2009. The game was released on Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and PC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was written by God of War co-creator Marianne Krawczyk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On August 5, 2010, Klei announced that they would release Shank's OST for free to download on their official website, if 1500 people joined their community on Facebook. They reached their goal in 3 hours and, thus released the full soundtrack for free which has been remastered to be &amp;quot;suitable for consumption&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing as Shank, players must travel on a 2D plane through each level defeating enemies in their path. Three buttons are respectively used for attacking with knives, a chainsaw and one of various guns, which can each be combined into various combos. Players are also able to leap onto or grapple enemies, as well as throw grenades.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shank (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
