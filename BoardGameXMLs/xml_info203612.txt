							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kraven Manor</name>
									
			<description>Turn out the lights, take a deep breath, and prepare yourself. Explore the depths of the immersive, atmospheric world of Kraven Manor. Uncover its secrets, solve its mystical puzzles, and face the growing threat within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kraven Manor challenges you to explore an expansive manor and discover the mysteries that lurk in its dark corners. You have the power to dynamically alter the layout of your environment by interacting with a miniature scale model of the manor, located in its extravagant entryway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamically build the manor around you. Find miniature room models and carry them back to an increasingly elaborate scale model of the manor. Adjusting the model causes rooms to move and appear in real space, awaiting your arrival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each new room exposes revelations into the troubling past of William Kraven. Face your fears and see if you have what it takes...the doors of Kraven Manor await you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
