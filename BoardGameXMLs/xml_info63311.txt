			<description>This expansion introduces merchants in the game Lovagkor. For every city there is a kind of goods which it can sell and another kind which the city can pay for. Players move around the board buying, carrying and selling these goods, which are produced again after a few turns. It can also be played using only the board of the base game. In that case players choose a goal from many possibilities (like earning 7000 tall&amp;eacute;rs at first or earning the most tall&amp;eacute;rs in 20 turns) before starting the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
