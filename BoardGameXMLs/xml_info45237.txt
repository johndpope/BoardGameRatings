							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great City, Graveyard</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great City graveyard is placed on the northeast part of the city. A thick white-stone wall surrounds the entire complex. A single gate, situated at the very end of the Holy Way, gives access to the graveyard. The gate houses the graveyard keeper with his servants. Inside, the graveyard is a peaceful place. White stone mausoleums alternate with solitary trees dotting a green carpet. Tombstones with small inscriptions and holy symbols are scattered everywhere, beside the many pathways that run on the grass carpet. Just under the graveyard, a great crypts complex exists. It houses the family tombs of the city most representative people.&lt;br/&gt;In this product you will find the maps of the graveyard gate, two mausoleums and the entire crypt complex (two maps) under the cemetery. The number of the maps, where shown, refers to the Great City blueprint.&lt;br/&gt;A small description of each map follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Graveyard Gateway. This gateway is entirely built in the thickness of the cemetery wall. The gateway is a two storey building with a basement that links directly to the crypts complex. On the ground floor you find the guardpost, a small office, a kitchen and a workroom. On first floor the keeper of the graveyard lives along with a small force of servants. The basement gives access to the western catacombs and provides space to store coffins on the way to catacombs.&lt;br/&gt;     West Mausoleum. This great mausoleum belongs to one of the most important family of the city. It features a ground floor with a memento mori chamber. A first floor features a large balcony overlooking the ground floor. Underground, the mausoleum has two more levels, containing dozens of sepulchers and sarcophagi. On the second underground level a secret door is hidden; it leads to the western catacombs.&lt;br/&gt;     East Mausoleum. This mausoleum belongs to a noble dwarven family of the Great City. It is partially buried in the ground and a small pathway deepens into the earth before reaching the ground floor, which is actually 5 feet below the level of the ground. On the ground floor a large pool of fresh water stands in the middle of the first chamber. On the ground and underground level you can find dozens of tombs. On the underground level a secret door is hidden; it leads to the eastern catacombs.&lt;br/&gt;     Western Catacombs and Eastern Catacombs. This vast underground complex has three known entrances: from the basement of the graveyard gate, from the East Mausoleum and from the West Mausoleum; although it is said that many other entrances are hidden among the tombs that dot the surface of the graveyard. The catacombs feature many crypts belonging to wealthy and noble families of the Great City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
