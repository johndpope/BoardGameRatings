			<description>From the rules - Battle at Sea, the new game of National Defense, is played on a cloth surface which is marked with two sea lanes of 16 spaces each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players assume control of a fleet and moves his fleet through his respective sea lane attempting to sink as many ships of the enemy fleet as possible.  When one fleet has been moved completely through its sea lane, the battle is over.  The player who sinks the greatest amount of enemy tonnage is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special embossed dice are used to determine hits.  Gunnery ranges, destroyers laying smoke screens, and aircraft carriers allow for varied game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very rare game of naval combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
