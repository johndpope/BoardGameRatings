			<description>Els xinos de l'Oracle is a humorous betting game based on the legislative Catalan elections of November 1st 2006. Originally intended to play after dinner, during the tallying of the ballot, to have a funny evening waiting for the definitive results and playing with the possible post-ballot government coalitions... but obviously, you can play it at any other time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 8 cards with the possible future government coalitions and 12 tokens representing the seats in the Catalan Parliament (allocated according to the polls). In each one of the 8 turns each player must choose a coalition card, and once revealed every player must select three seats (from the party or parties he decides). Summing up the seats chosen by all the players, the coalition with most seats will be the winner of that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
