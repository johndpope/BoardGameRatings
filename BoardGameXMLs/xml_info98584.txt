							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Battle</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting race through space in a running battle with enemy starships. Three dimensional screen action looks like you're plunging through a time warp on your way to hyperspace! Fire your missiles and take evasive action to avoid enemy lasers! You have full control over your spacecraft's speed and direction--and you can play to any score for long or short games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Battle combines the fun and fast action of flying a space ship down a 3-D tunnel while trying to escape the missiles of an enemy ship by speeding up or slowing down. You can even destroy the enemy yourself by launching your own missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The star ship of player l is designed like an X. The star ship of player 2 looks like an H.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For one player games, the Arcade automatically becomes the enemy and flies the second star ship. Since both sides have an unlimited supply of ammunition, the action is very fast-paced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
