							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Underground Game &amp; What&#039;s the Letter?</name>
									
			<description>A box of two party games together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Underground Game:&lt;br/&gt;Any number of players above 2 can play although 4 to 12 players provides the greatest fun. It is ideal for all ages from 11 years upwards and will be of particular appeal to those who enjoy crossword puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is handed a card on which there are 32 clues to the names of stations on the London Underground. A time limit should be set in which the players must find as many answers as possible. When the time limit has expired, players may take turns to call out their answers which the M.C. will confirm if correct. Players score 1 point for each correct station.&lt;br/&gt;For those not familiar with the London Underground, maps are supplied. These should be passed round to give each player an equal chance to use one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's the Letter?&lt;br/&gt;Each player is handed a card and must answer the questions using one or two letters from the alphabet as applicable. The M.C. should announce a time limit of say 5 minutes for this game. Players are given one point for each correct answer with extra points if they have more than one acceptable answer to a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
