			<description>Confidence is a &amp;quot;word poker&amp;quot; game in which players will have to test their vocabulary and their nerve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will attempt to make words that contain all of the letters dealt from a &amp;quot;Payoff Deck&amp;quot; and at least one of the two letters dealt to them as a hand.  A player may &amp;quot;cash out&amp;quot; with a word at any time, but since the point values of the letters increase - sometime dramatically - when more &amp;quot;Payoff Letters&amp;quot; appear, to gamble on &amp;quot;just one more card&amp;quot; is a tempting option.  But there are risks:  the inability of a player to make a word will result in a zero score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confidence is a game for two to four players, although variant rules are included which allow more people to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
