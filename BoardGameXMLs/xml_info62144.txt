			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many who carry the Vigil, it&amp;rsquo;s all about putting the boot down. It&amp;rsquo;s about jacking a shotgun shell into the chamber and filling a werewolf&amp;rsquo;s muzzle full of silver shot. Witches can&amp;rsquo;t whisper their dark curses with a collapsed trachea. A vampire won&amp;rsquo;t feed off the weak and transmit their nest of infections if his body has been turned to grimy ash. Kill &amp;lsquo;em all, let the Devil do the math. Right? If only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some creatures can be redeemed. Others claim they can, but they either woefully underestimate their monstrous addictions or are just lying so they can avoid getting that face full of shotgun spray. What&amp;rsquo;s the dividing line? How can one tell? Are those fiends that choose to be what they are more or less dangerous than those who have been dragged headlong into the dark night? Is a vampire worse than a witch because he cannot easily turn away from his monstrous state? Is it even reasonable to feel mercy for something that&amp;rsquo;s practically a disease?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, imagine being a hunter cell tasked with something that may very well go against its members&amp;rsquo; shared Vigils. Imagine being handed some bloodsucker who claims he seeks redemption, and perhaps more importantly, he&amp;rsquo;s got a head full of verboten information that he&amp;rsquo;s willing to info-dump on anybody who will protect him and help usher him to his so-called salvation. Imagine receiving orders to keep this creature safe, a blood-hungry creature driven by a seething beast within, who&amp;rsquo;s taken pleasure and gained life from the act of killing. Worst of all, imagine that this fiend has a whole hoary host of enemies, both hunter and beast, looking to make him pay for sins real and imagined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is reaching for another&amp;rsquo;s redemption worth it? Is it even possible? Does the cell embrace or oppose their orders from above? Can a creature like this be brought to redemption, or is it all one big awful lie?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
