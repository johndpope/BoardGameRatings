			<description>Each player starts his / her own penalty area, aiming at the enemy from 16 meters out. As you come through a good question to answer, divided into six categories and three levels. Throwing of two dice determines how difficult (or easy) the question and the category is. Got a question correctly, you may continue to dribble on the basis of the direction that the back of the card prescribes. &lt;br/&gt;In addition you must think carefully about the choices you make, because you can get a red or yellow card. An injury makes you one turn to watch from the dug-out, a yellow card forces you to skip a turn. If you collect two yellow cards or a direct red then you move back to your own penalty area and from there to set up a new attack. &lt;br/&gt;If you reach the penalty area of your opponent and you answer the question correctly, then you score a goal and you have won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
