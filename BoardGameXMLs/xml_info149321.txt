			<description>Mezmo is a collaborative game for 3 to 11 players, ages 5 and up. In the game players take turns adding a single tile to a slowly growing game board where the other players judge whether or not the played tile fits the &amp;quot;Theme&amp;quot; of the pieces it connects to. The game focuses on the personal judgement of each of the judges, as was as the current player's ability to convince others of their artistic vision. Failure to appease the judges forces the player to take back their piece, as well as receive another random tile from the bag. The game ends when one of the players has no more pieces to play. It's a laid back, casual game that inspires alot of conversation and thought, and is best played with a creative crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
