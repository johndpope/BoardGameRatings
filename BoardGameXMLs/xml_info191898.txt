							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roller Derby Final Jams</name>
									
			<description>Roller Derby Final Jams (RDFJ) is essentially a race game based on the sport of Women's Flat Track Roller Derby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RDFJ components include skater cards depicting jammers and blockers from two rival teams. Players will use custom dice and team assist disks to navigate their jammers past their opponent&amp;rsquo;s blockers in order to score points before time runs out in last few remaining jams of a closely contested derby bout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optionally the game can be customized by removing the skater cards that come with the game and then substituting trading cards available from some roller derby leagues. This allows players to simulate competition between actual roller derby teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
