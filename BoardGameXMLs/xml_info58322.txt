			<description>(Translate from the book Introduction)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first big conquest in a wizards career is to be accepted by a School - that means that his feats are notable enough that these auspicious fraternities note him. In a way, to affiliate to a School confers status to a mystic, segregating him from the mass of mediocre or inexperienced sorcerers; advantages like a bigger spell list, and the renown conferred by the organization are at his disposal. But, in the end, what is a school? How's the relationship between the members? What are the rules of power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For millenia, the Schools of magic hided their secrets in ancestral libraries, in obscure temples, in cryptic mysterious symbols. Their fountains of arcane knowledge, capable of open the gates of hell, to command the elements and nature or to trick the senses were previously inaccessible to the uninitiated... until today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gates of the Schools are finally open in this new edition of Tagmar so you can have access to the ancient secrets of these organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
