			<description>&amp;quot;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies, known in Japan as Gyakuten Saiban 5 (逆転裁判 5, lit. &amp;quot;Turnabout Trial 5&amp;quot;), is an upcoming adventure video game published and developed by Capcom for the Nintendo 3DS. It is the seventh total game in the Ace Attorney series (not counting cross-overs) and the fifth installment of the main lineage. It will be the first in the series to be released on the Nintendo 3DS. The game will see Phoenix Wright return as the main protagonist and will take place a year after Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. The game is slated for released in Japan on July 25, 2013, and as a digital release in North America and Europe in Fall 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The game looks to continue the style of gameplay from previous installments, in which the player must utilize evidence and find contradictions in witness statements to prove their client innocent. Like previous games, gameplay is split up between Investigations, in which players find evidence and question witnesses, and Trials, where they must use the evidence to expose contradictions. Areas during Investigations are now presented in 3D, allowing players to change their view and zoom in on areas to find clues. A new system, called the Mood Matrix, gives the player the ability to gauge the emotions of a witness, such as tones of anger when mentioning certain topics. If the player notices a contradictory emotional response during testimony, they can point out the discrepancy and press the witness for more information. Another new feature is a backlog function, which allows players to review previous dialogue in case they missed anything. The title now features full 3D graphics and character models, allowing more dynamic camera angles during gameplay. The game will also feature downloadable costumes via DLC.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ace Attorney 5&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
