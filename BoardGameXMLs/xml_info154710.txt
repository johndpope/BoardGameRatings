							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bog Billy</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dwelling in the crawl spaces and rubble covered heaps of the Old Ones, live cunning man eaters known as Bog-Billies. Although slow in the open street or swampland trail, they are often much faster than a humanoid excavator who, on his or her hands and knees, has fallen for the bait, and foolishly crept into the ambush of these foul mutants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also called Floor Devils and Nailbiters, these disturbing looking, distant human off shoots are the 5th in The Mutant Epoch RPG&amp;rsquo;s free line of Creatures of the Apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 7 page document includes a close up player handout version as well as a highly useful old school blue inked ruin map showing a typical Bog-Billy lair denoting baiting points, tunnels, and bone and relic filled larders where captive PCs are taken to await their grisly fate. This foul mutant&amp;rsquo;s description also includes a &amp;lsquo;bait item&amp;rsquo; treasure table and rich selection of mutations to make them extra nasty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
