							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hollyworld</name>
									
			<description>What if the world really worked the way it did in the movies? And what if you knew this up front? That's the premise of Hollyworld, where everyone's an actor, everything's a movie and you can't be killed by an explosion if you are running away from it at the time. Why? It's just the way things are, just like it's always possible to fall from a height, and children and cute creatures must be rescued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How hard can it be when your character only has two stats (Style and Substance), and getting star billing is more important than actual competence. See? It's just like the real thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hollyworld is a simple little .pdf file that will set you back a measely couple bucks, though we may have printed copies for sale at conventions. Acting. It's not just a job, it's an adventure. --publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
