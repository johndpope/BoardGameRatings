			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party receive a note from a mysterious figure named Wylashtin urging them to visit him and take up the exploration of an alchemical &amp;quot;factorium.&amp;quot; If they accept, they'll find themselves exploring a most unusual ruin in an even more unusual location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes from the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for an organized group of 3-6 adventurer level characters. If the GM is using this adventure for a different number of characters, or for a group of characters of a different ability level, the adventure should be adjusted accordingly. If the GM is working with a different sort of adventurer group, it may be necessary to modify the conditions under which the party becomes involved in the adventure. While this adventure has been designed and written for DragonQuest, it can be easily translated for use with other game systems. The GM will need to make the necessary interpolations beforehand in order to do this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
