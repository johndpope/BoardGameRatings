							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The All New Act One</name>
									
			<description>From box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The all new Act One is the Exciting game where everyone gets to make a scene! In a race against the clock, players do almost anything to try and get their teammates to guess the titles of popular movies and TV shows. The sooner teams guess correctly, the more points are scored. But who cares who wins, when it's this much fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple to play: Guess the Movie or TV title correctly and score points. Player race against the clock (40 sec.) per card. Players must &amp;quot;act: (read) each scene on the card. Better acting will help. We suggest first to 20 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
