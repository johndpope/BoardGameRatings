							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Project ALPACA</name>
									
			<description>In Project ALPACA, players will take on the role of a psychically gifted candidate for a secret government project. The clandestine Project for the Assessment of Latent Psychic Ability Control and Awareness (ALPACA) is seeking talented operatives. Players will compete head to head against another candidate to see who will move on to become a full-fledged member of Project ALPACA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project ALPACA is a quick round-based two player strategy card game. In the game, players attempt to have the highest Strength value by playing psychic Ability cards that benefit them in the round. Each round is played simultaneously, so players must try to deduce their opponent's plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project ALPACA is played over 10 rounds in which players attempt to achieve the highest Strength value. Each player has a small deck of 10 Strength cards [1 - 10]. Each player starts the round by flipping over the top card of their Strength deck, revealing the top card. The player with the highest Strength value wins the round, scoring a point. After 10 rounds, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make things more interesting, players have a psychic Ability deck they will use to change the outcome of the round. This includes changes such as adding to their Strength value, subtracting from their opponent's Strength value, or even reversing the win condition, making it so that the lowest Strength value wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
