							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rubbish Game</name>
									
			<description>An educational board game themed around recycling and conservation, designed in Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sole mechanic is roll and move without the rolling, as each player moves exactly three spaces on each turn.  Recyclable material tokens are distributed evenly between the two to four players. They move along the branches on the board. When they land on an appropriate recycling spot in their turn, they can leave a token.  The first player to recycle everything wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with a poster and a &amp;quot;Personal Pollution Meter&amp;quot; (printed on the box insert).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
