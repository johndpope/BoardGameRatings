			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Mountain is a tabletop dungeon crawler for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is published as a play book, containing the rules, a space for custom rules and over 50 game boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A free, printable game board template and pocket rule book is also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to escape the other player's dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;Each player creates a dungeon on an 8x8 grid. This contains a starting point and exit point. A class system can be used to predict the difficulty of a dungeon allowing for fair play or else to create a handicap for games between players of different experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place several items throughout the dungeon. These are Big Monsters, Small Monsters, Traps, Hammers and Gems. The position of these items does not change during gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat with Monsters is decided with attack points that are assigned when the monsters are placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a second blank grid the players are given the starting coordinates. Players then navigate their opponents dungeon by calling out directions. Players continue their turn until they attempt a move into a wall or certain items. As they progress the players mark their progress on the grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to exit the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;Number of lives used, monsters defeated and items collected can also be counted as points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
