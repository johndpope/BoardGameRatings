			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in Yugoslavia in 1943, during the height of World War II, this tense and exciting scenario focuses on the struggle between Allied and Axis special operations teams to seize control of information critical to control of the Balkans. Players can assume roles as military or civilian operatives in one of four opposing factions, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the SS Ahnenerbe occult operations division, the Communist partisans, or the Chetnik royalist freedom fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little by little, however, the characters will begin to realize that their war is not the first to have left its mark on the region in which they are battling for supremacy - and that their actions are uncovering a powerful and dangerous evil that is beyond anything they ever expected to face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WitchFinder is a Cthulhu Live 3rd Edition script set in the Balkans during World War II that includes introduction, timeline, prop, and costume information and character stats and bios for 30 characters. This electronic script comes with three different variants - color, black-and-white, and background-free - and each of these comes in low-resolution screen-friendly and high-resolution printer-friendly versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed for the Cthulhu Live 3rd Edition horror live-action role-playing game, WitchFinder can easily be adapted for use with almost any other horror or action RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
