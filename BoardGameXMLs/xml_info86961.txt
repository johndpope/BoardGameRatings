			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bactron is a French arcade-adventure game. Bactrons are living blobs of antibiotics who are injected into patients to cure infections and diseases. The goal of the player is to guide a bactron inside the body of a terminally ill patient, undo the damage done by multiplying viruses and destroy them by releasing the enzymes found in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses an isometric 3D display engine. Each room is a different puzzle to solve as each different virus has its own behavior, and enzymes are often found in hard to reach places. There is a time limit, as viruses keep multiplying as long as they're not neutralized and the patient's temperature rises. Once it reaches 42&amp;deg;C, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game received a lot of praises at the time of its release for its animation and graphics (by Bruno Masson) and its musical score by Michel Winogradoff. The first edition of the game was sold with a metal badge inside, so Bactron players could recognize each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
