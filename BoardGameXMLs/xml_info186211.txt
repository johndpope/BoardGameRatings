							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Camel Up</name>
									
			<description>Witness the craziest camel race of all time, as things really go topsy-turvy when camels stack up and entire pyramids turn upside down. As members of Egyptian high society, you gather in the desert with one simple goal: to gain the most money by backing the right camel to win a leg or even the entire race. However, in this race, it&amp;rsquo;s not just the lucky ones who can beat the odds. Reading the dynamics of the race and having a good sense of timing is just as important when it comes to backing the right camels and taking the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAMEL UP is a simple, quick, and outrageously exciting family game that can be enjoyed by up to 8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
