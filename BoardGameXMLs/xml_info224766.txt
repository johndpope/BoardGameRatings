			<description>In Landmarks, direct the growth of a city by drawing buildings on the shared map at the locations indicated by rolling the dice. When you roll coordinates for already claimed land, you get to draw more details, creating buildings that score more, while changing the skyline for all players. Manage your budget carefully to adjust the dice and pay for major landmarks. Each page tells a different chapter in the life of a city from rural village to capital city, using a different set of buildings each game to score points for adjacency, sets, groups and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landmarks is the third in the line of Spiel Press roll-and-write game books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
