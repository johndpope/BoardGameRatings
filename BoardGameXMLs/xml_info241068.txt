			<description>Planetary earthquakes ravage your homeworld. Before long, the planet will be no more. Your only hope of survival is to build your colony ship, transport it to the launchpad, and launch into space in the hopes of finding a new world to call home. However, you must be the first to escape your world because the force required to launch your colony ship will result in the absolute destruction of the planet as you leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cysmic is an epic sci-fi strategy wargame set amidst a dying planet. Players assume the role of one of the factions on the planet that is fighting desperately to survive. Throughout the game, players gather resources, capture enemy units, and work to construct their colony ship. Once built, the colony ship must be moved to the launchpad at the center of the board and launched into space. The faction to do so first not only escapes with their lives but also ends up destroying the planet with the force of their ship's ignition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
