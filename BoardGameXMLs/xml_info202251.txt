							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of the Penguins</name>
									
			<description>It's the year 3001, the habitat of the Penguins reduced during the global warming and became very small. The Penguins evolved to less friendly animals and became truculent. Now every piece of ice is important to survive. Several clans fight for there lives. This game is played with two of those clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this game is to survive with as many penguins as possible, attack other penguins and nourishing your Inuit family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a card out a line of three open cards and that card indicates the actions you are allowed to perform. There are three types of actions. Lay down your tiles, move your penguins and attack other penguins. When you fight, you role dice!!&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 types of tiles, most of them with a special effect to be carried out. So be careful where you place your tiles, &lt;br/&gt;it could harm yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile you have to support your Inuit family, by slaughtering killer whales, seals and opponent penguins. Every fight will be rewarded whether it is successful or not. It's your effort that is rewarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
