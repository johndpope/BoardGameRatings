							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RMS Titanic</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RMS Titanic is an unusual concept in that it is a simulation of a salvage company investigating the wreck of the famous ocean liner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At your disposal is a vessel packed with salvage gear. The most important is an advanced submersible called the TSI, which is fitted with sonar, cameras, a robot arm and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately this gear does not come cheap, neither are the running costs of such a challenging operation. The player must therefore court publicity through promoting discoveries in press interviews. Attracting wealthy sponsors can also help with funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TSI can also bring up items found through exploring the wreck. These can either be sent to the laboratory for analysis, or sold for additional funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the TSI with it's grainy video camera to explore the vessel is therefore key to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was advertised, but never released for the Spectrum and Amstrad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
