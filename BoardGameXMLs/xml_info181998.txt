							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Society of Eccentric Inventors</name>
									
			<description>The Society of Eccentric Inventors is a board game for two to five players. Each player takes on the role of an inventor and member of the eponymous Society of Eccentric Inventors. In their boundless wisdom, the Society has decided to put together a friendly competition to determine the greatest inventor among their ranks. To win that fine honor, inventors must manage their resources and eccentricities and watch out for spies, as each inventor creates remarkable inventions to impress and outdo his or her fellow Society members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
