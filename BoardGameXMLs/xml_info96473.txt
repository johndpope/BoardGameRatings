			<description>Politically incorrect these days, in the fifties it was quite acceptable to make a game about Big Game Hunting on Safari. The animal cards are very nice though.&lt;br/&gt;44 cards. Players aim to collect sets of three of the same animal. There are 6 cards of each animal per set and seven sets in all. So two sets of each animal can be 'bagged'.&lt;br/&gt;There are also two 'Hunter' cards which allow a player to possibly take a set of another player that has already been 'bagged'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
