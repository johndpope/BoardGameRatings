			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontier Horizons is a complete science-fiction roleplaying game with extensively developed rules.  Character creation begins with the selection of race (eight are provided) which will influence subsequent choices.  Characters have Ability Scores (Strength, Endurance, Toughness, Flexibility, Coordination, Speed, etc.) which can be either randomly generated or purchased using a point pool.  The random method or the point pool will be influenced by race.  Typical values range from 2-8 though higher scores are possible.  Most characters are assumed to have cybernetic enhancements, Drawbacks, and Special Abilities.  Demographics and appearance can be selected or randomly generated from tables.  Similar tables are provided to support random background and history generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters select and Occupation which is somewhat like a traditional Class but less restrictive.  The Occupation will grant certain skills at specified levels.  Dozens of Occupations are provided.  Characters also select Skills from a lengthy list.  Characters gain experience and may improve Skills.  A well-defined Psionic system is included, and a very well developed robotics system also is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are resolved through either Skill Checks or Ability Checks.  The checks are made against a modified Task Difficulty, which must be exceeded with 1d10 plus Ability modifier and possibly plus other modifiers.  Combat is fairly complex with numerous situations considered, including:  melee, ranged, grenade, underwater, and weightless.  Lists of weapons and defenses are provided, separate from a quite lengthy section of equipment and vehicles.  Another lengthy section details cybernetics and genetic manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that Appendix E includes all game tables; this appendix also was published as a standalone PDF (&amp;quot;Appendix E - Game Tables&amp;quot;) document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
