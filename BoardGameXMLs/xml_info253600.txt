							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruins of Radagga</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the banks of Lake Pertalo, there is a small, isolated village that has no name. The area was originally discovered by a band of Mueran miners, who set out from Mahabra, looking for veins of minerals in the lower ranges and foothills along the southern edge of the Vaulbic Mountains. They made their encampment on the shore of the lake and set out every day to search for the metals and gems that they hoped would bring them wealth. After several years, they had to admit defeat in finding the minerals for which they searched. However, by then the encampment had grown into a full-fledged settlement. Huts had become homes, gardens had become farms. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to be mined, but enough to keep a metal worker or two busy. Pickaxes were exchanged for plows and scythes. The Muera chose to abandon dreams of wealth in exchange for the tranquility offered by the place they now called home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
