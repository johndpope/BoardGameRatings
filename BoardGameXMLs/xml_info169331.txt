							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Six Degrees of Separation</name>
									
			<description>Six Degrees of Separation challenges players to build their own chain of Actors and films that separate two actors by 6 Degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must race to be the first to create an alternating chain of 8 actors and 7 films they have in common. With six actors between the first and last, you get a separation of Six Degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no turns. The game ends when one player has succeeded in completing a six degree chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it's not that simple...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Films and Actors each have different point values. The winning player is not necessarily the the first player to achieve six degrees, but the one with the highest value chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will find Action cards that can help them or hinder their opponent(s). Maggie Smith might have a Wardrobe Malfunction on the red carpet or &amp;quot;I, Frankenstein&amp;quot; might be voted Best Film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having started his film career in 1978&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Animal House&amp;rdquo;, by 2000 actor Kevin Bacon had come to appear in many of the most successful films in the last decade of the twentieth century. Appearing in such films as &amp;ldquo;JFK&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;A Few Good Men&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Apollo 13&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Hollow Man&amp;rdquo;, just to name a few, Kevin Bacon seemed to have worked with just about every other popular actor in Hollywood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1993&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Six Degrees of Separation&amp;rdquo;, with Stockard Channing, Will Smith, and Donald Sutherland, speculated that every person on the&lt;br/&gt;planet was only removed from another person by no more than six other individuals between the two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for a new parlor game to make its way through the L.A. party scene, and eventually into the general population called &amp;ldquo;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&amp;rdquo;. Players, starting with Kevin Bacon and another actor from any film that had ever been made, are challenged to create a chain between the two using films in which pairs of actors appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
