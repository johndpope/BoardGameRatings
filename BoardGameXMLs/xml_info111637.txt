			<description>Taken from the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;it is a card game for 2, 3, 4 players. Form your Tribe and start your battle facing the attacks of wolves, buffalos and eagles that your adversaries will try to throw on you! The challenge starts! &lt;br/&gt;You must do more points than your adversaries forming one or more patrols  built with your own cards. The player who first arrives to 100 points wins. The points are obtained by the red ability spheres at the base of the tribe cards or of the passive defense cards (1 ability sphere = 1 point).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content:&lt;br/&gt;1 handbook with rules; 90 playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
