							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Manhattan Missions</name>
									
			<description>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Manhattan Missions is a 1991 PC (MS-DOS) game featuring the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to complete a number of missions, consisting of side-scrolling levels, culminating in a final battle with the Shredder. The gameplay is loosely similar to the original Prince of Persia. In between missions the Turtles can rest, regaining lost hit points, but the player only has a limited amount of time in which to find the Shredder. The game is designed to be played with a keyboard, and utilizes a key to switch between walking and fighting modes. Each Turtle has the ability to arm and withdraw his weapon. Each Turtle wields his signature weapon and a number of shuriken. Holding the enter key makes the Turtles attack, and the spacebar is used to block enemy attacks based on which arrow key is held.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Manhattan Missions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
