							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Valedictorian&#039;s Death</name>
									
			<description>From the Half Meme Press web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Valedictorian's Death is the roleplaying game of stories in old high school yearbooks. Each player, aside from the gamemaster, will take ownership of a member of the senior class as their personal character and play out the events of a few weeks leading up to the discovery of the valedictorian's dead body. Players will vie to be perceived a prime suspect, someone with a possible motive, or perhaps a shaky alibi, but they'll do this with great care. The way to win when points are counted at the end of the game is to narrowly avoid culpability in the death, allowing ultimate guilt to rest with one of the other players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
