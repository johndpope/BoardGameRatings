			<description>Deathmatch Classic or DMC is a multiplayer mod of the popular first-person shooter, Half-Life. It was released as a free download concurrently with the 1.1.0.7 patch of the game on June 11, 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMC was conceived by Valve as a tribute to id Software, and is essentially a remake of the multiplayer component of id's Quake. It took three months to develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original release included five maps converted from Quake. The gameplay is similar to Quake deathmatch, with essentially the same weapons (except the one for melee combat, which is Half-Life's trademark crowbar instead of the original axe), armour and power-ups. DMC also imitates Quake's physics, which allows an advanced player to gain a lot of extra speed or jump very high by using a number of movement skills such as bunny hopping and rocket jumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The default game speed in DMC is somewhat slower than in Quake. The weapons scale from the basic shotgun to the rocket launcher and the &amp;quot;shaft&amp;quot;, a powerful directed energy weapon. Three kinds of bonuses are scattered over the maps, which give the player a temporary special power: &amp;quot;quad damage&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;invulnerability&amp;quot;, and the &amp;quot;ring of shadows&amp;quot; which turns the player into a ghostly, almost invisible figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Deathmatch Classic&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is also available as a stand alone game on Steam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
