							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Crawl Unlimited Extra Forms Book</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet contains player and GM forms useful for the Dungeon Crawl Unlimited roleplaying game system. Character sheets, equipment and magic lists, they are all here. The GM will find organizers and information sheets to make running a DCU game even easier than it already is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the game forms there is extra material about the world of Epigaea. The calendar/weather/moon phase chart is included at its full size. There are two calendar/log sheets suitable for game log use and two maps showing the world beyond the Seven Kingdoms. There are also two blank maps to allow city and other feature placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, there is a complete bonus adventure: Moon of the Goblin Sage. Set in the village of Plonk on the world of Epigaea, this adventure picks up where the introduction to Epigaea leaves off. Garvin the Minstrel spoke truly: the sages have arrived. Well, not quite. Perhaps if goblin bandits hadn't waylaid them along the way... Moon of the Goblin Sage presents a complete adventure that can start a DCU campaign or fit nicely into an existing one. It has new monsters, new magic items and a complete example of the DCU dungeon generator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
