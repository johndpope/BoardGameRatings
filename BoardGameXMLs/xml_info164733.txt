			<description>Spice Winds is a card game, where the cards, and the whole table become the board. Players play ship captains and traders in a wild and hardly explored archipelago, exploring and trading between the islands, trying to make their fortunes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is made up from a custom card deck:&lt;br/&gt;Some cards are scattered on the playing surface and become the islands to trade between.&lt;br/&gt;Some form an event deck - controlling random events that may beset players journeying between islands&lt;br/&gt;Others form a marketplace that is used to control the price of goods throughout the game&lt;br/&gt;The remainder are used to record player wealth, ships' cargo or provide player information and determine other events through the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players seek to generate wealth through trade, and convert this into stockpiles of spices ready to ship back to the Old World.  The first to amass a stockpile of 5 chests of spice is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
