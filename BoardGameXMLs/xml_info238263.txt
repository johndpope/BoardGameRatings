			<description>The Apocketalypse has arrived! A zombie outbreak has happened right in your town.&lt;br/&gt;Its time to scavenge for gear and hope you do not run into to many zombies!&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the last and only survivor of the Apocketalypse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apocketalypse is a quick and fun dice elimination game, with a few cards thrown in for good measure. Each player selects a random character that has a skill that will hopefully keep them alive, such as extra dice or rerolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players scavenge and are dealt a random card that is either gear or a zombie. You then roll a number of attack and zombie dice, based on the characters skill and what gear or zombie card they scavenged. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky and roll well you heal or escape from the zombies, if you&amp;rsquo;re roll isn&amp;rsquo;t so lucky zombies will take a bite or two and you&amp;rsquo;ll loose your health tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player with health is declared the Survivor of the Apocketalypse and wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole game fits nice and neatly into your pocket so you can take it anywhere you go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
