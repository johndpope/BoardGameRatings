			<description>Two cosmic adventurers are in a tricky scenario and must work together. By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You look at each other skeptically before powering up the massive collider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Why are we doing this again?&amp;quot; you ask, hesitantly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your partner shrugs, but you know the answer. It's always the same with you two. Succeed and get paid, or fail and get vaporized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of the pentaquark in the early 21st century shed some light on the conditions inside neutron stars. Now, in Twin Stars: The Quark Star you are trying to create the hypothetical Quark Star, an even more dense state of matter. Calibrate, Test, and Experiment with your particle collider, and Capture 5 Quarks to win. Lose if funding reaches $0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Quark Star is a scenario in the Twin Stars solo system by Jason Tagmire and Mike Mullins. The game consists of just 3 cards and players will provide their own dice and coins/tokens. Each scenario comes with 2 all-new characters and can be interchanged with others for a very different gaming experience. This is the first in the Twin Stars family and was originally offered as a stretch goal for Button Shy's Pentaquark Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
