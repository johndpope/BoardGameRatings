			<description>Clubs is a card game about taking calculated risks. The goal is very simple: win as many club cards as possible - that's the only suit that scores points. The lower the club card you take, the more points you could win. But there's a catch: The last player to go out for the round does not score ANY points. So players who get too greedy might pick up a pile of clubs, but end up with 0 points for the round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First there was Hearts, then there was Spades, and now North Star Games is bringing you Clubs. The suit of clubs finally gets some respect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;Clubs is a climbing game similar to Tichu, Haggis, Big Two and The Great Dalmuti. It can be played with 2 - 6 players in less 30 minutes.  There are two ways to earn points in Clubs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Play all your cards as quickly as possible each round.&lt;br/&gt;    Win tricks with clubs in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play a round, deal out 10 cards to each player. Players may call Double or Nothing anytime before playing their first card.  The player to the left of the dealer leads with a Trick-Type.  Legal Trick-Types include any singleton, pair, 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind, or any run of 2 or more cards. Players can either pass or follow with a similar hand of higher rank.  When all of the players have passed consecutively, the pile is taken by the person who played last. That player leads with a Trick-Type of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score bonus points for playing all of their cards each round.  A 6-player game has all of the following Bonus Cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    12 bonus points + points for clubs&lt;br/&gt;    10 bonus points + points for clubs&lt;br/&gt;    8 bonus points + points for clubs&lt;br/&gt;    5 bonus points + points for clubs&lt;br/&gt;    2 bonus points + points for clubs&lt;br/&gt;    0 bonus points.  Do not score points for clubs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player out for the round does not get bonus points and does not receive points for any clubs he may have taken. The points for clubs varies from 5 points (for the 1 of clubs) to 1 point (for the 10-15 of clubs). The first player to 50 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
