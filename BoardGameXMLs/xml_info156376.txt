			<description>Objective: Be the first moving all of your ten meeples into target positions (two coloured crosses)&lt;br/&gt; - moving by turns -&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a colour placing his/her 10 meeples into starting positions (colour matching corner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn each player moves one own meeple (with a knight's move in Chess). Spaces with other meeples can't be entered, also opponent's target positions block. There are four central positions which must be cleaned during next turn; other wise your meeple is sent back to starting position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;Likely publishd during 1930's&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
