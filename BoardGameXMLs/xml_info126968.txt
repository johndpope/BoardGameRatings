			<description>McPixel is a new take on point'n'click adventure games. It's like you took old Lucas Arts adventure games, put them into blender and add few shovels of gunpowder and rocket fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 100 levels and you only have 20 seconds to solve each of them. You fail - stuff blows up and you continue to the next level, for as long as you beat the entire batch. Batches have 6 levels that you play round and round, since playing 100 levels straight would be too much for a human brain to take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Levels in McPixel are anything you can imagine. A deserted island, an alien spaceship, death star, school, train, plane, stadium, sewers, lighthouse. Just anything! And it all blows up in the end. Well, unless you can do something about it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And don't think that the solutions will be obvious! it's a point'n'click adventure game after all, so the most obvious choices are bound to fail. and the most annoying adventure game feature has been gotten rid of. I mean, dialogues, monologues and text et all. there is no time for small talks if you only have 20 seconds! So instead of starting a useless banter, McPixel just kicks balls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
