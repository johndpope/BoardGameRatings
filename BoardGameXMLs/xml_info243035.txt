							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Goblins Who Ate Christmas</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lot of nonsense is spoken about Christmas. It is a time for family, you&amp;rsquo;ll hear people say, or perhaps that old chestnut about how Christmas is a time for giving. Poppycock! As you are reading this book, you must be a gamer, and as a gamer you know the truth &amp;ndash; Christmas is about games! Yes, in part it is about getting games as gifts &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;ll allow the non-gamers that much &amp;ndash; but more importantly it&amp;rsquo;s about playing games. And yes, more likely than not, some of the players may be family, but that&amp;rsquo;s beside the point &amp;ndash; and let&amp;rsquo;s make this point very plainly &amp;ndash; a Christmas without games is no Christmas at all. But that is just what the Great and Glorious King of All Goblins intends and only Santa and his elves can stop him&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A System-Neutral silly adventure for the family!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
