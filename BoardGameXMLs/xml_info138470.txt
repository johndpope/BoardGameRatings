							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Erie Railroad</name>
									
			<description>Erie Railroad is a railroad stock game set around Lake Erie in northwestern Pennsylvania. The game is for 3-5 players and lasts about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take the roles of Industrialists - like William Henry Vanderbilt - who have hidden interests in railroads and try to maximize their profits. The players try to make the most money by auctioning shares of the different railroad companies and by paying out dividends at the right moment to get the most money out of the company. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released as part of Winsome Games's 2013 Essen collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
