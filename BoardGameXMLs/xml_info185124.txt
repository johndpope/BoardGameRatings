			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game offers a vast range of options for characters of all classes. This is great when a player wants to explore variations on a theme, but it comes at a cost: the character options for each class have been published across many places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Books (hardcover compilations such as Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&amp;trade; and Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Combat&amp;trade;, plus the various companions, adventures, and chronicles);&lt;br/&gt;    PDFs (from Paizo and from third-party publishers);&lt;br/&gt;    Websites, blogs, and other online sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be intimidating to new players, and inconvenient to experienced players. The Echelon Reference Series aims to make this easier for everyone by gather information for each class into a single book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echelon Reference Series: Rogues collects information about the rogue and ninja classes. The base classes, archetypes for both classes, and rogue talents, advanced talents, ninja tricks, and master ninja tricks are all contained within. This book also has feats appropriate to both classes and their archetypes, and there are stat blocks for NPCs of all levels and many races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains material from the PRD and from third-party publishers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
