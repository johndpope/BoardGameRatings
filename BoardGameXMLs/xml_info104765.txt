							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shifter Duel</name>
									
			<description>2 players duel for control of a endlessly shifting plane of existence. By moving gems around a grid of tiles, the players lay claim to the map. But, at the end of your turn, you must shift the board, moving 1 tile. The winner is the first person who can force their opponent into a position where they can not shift the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to The Game Crafter wanted me order the game before I can put it up for sale, I (the developer) have chosen to just post the rules in PDF form here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
