							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kickabout League</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kickabout League is a multiplayer five-a-side soccer (English: football) game. Players begin with four controllable team members, some intended for defence, some for midfield, and some for scoring. As they play rated (and unrated) games, the players will become more and more experienced. One can sell or trade the characters for money, and, put together with your earnings, you can buy upgrades, new characters, and even new fields to play on. In ways other than just rating, you can rise through the ranks and become the League Champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
