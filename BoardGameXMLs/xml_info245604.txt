			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In It Lives! Muhahah!, in a small town where several people have gone missing recently, screams were heard coming from the house belonging to the less than popular local magistrate. The local blacksmith went to investigate but has not been seen since. He, and the magistrate, were courting the same woman; could they have had an argument over her? What is going on is actually more dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is aimed at d100 systems but is generic enough in nature to be adapted to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter and one page is ads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
