							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Conductor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A villain in search of his equal... The Conductor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 12 Rogue, The Conductor is a villainous mastermind who is actively searching for a hero who can rival his genius. No ordinary superhero will do, so he will first test the mettle of his chosen arch-foes by sending his PL 10 lieutenant Overclock. The Conductor's super-charged battlesuit backs his considerable brains up with a pretty brawny set of combat abilities, and Overclock has the speed to keep up with most &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; heroes by himself. The Conductor and Overclock add more depth to the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conductor and Overclock are both designated &amp;quot;Blue&amp;quot; for their technological origins. Unlike many villains, The Conductor is a very proactive villain who is actively searching to make a hero his foe. His brains and his ego demand he seek out the bravest, noblest, and most intelligent foes to test himself against. His love of technology also makes him a great foe for tech-themed heroes of any stripe. Overclock serves as an early indication of The Conductor's interest in the heroes, as well as an indication of the kind of person their mysterious foe is. Both characters are class acts, villains who hail from an era when superheroes were measured by their Rogues Galleries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
