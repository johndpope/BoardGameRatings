			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're an adept looking for more utility, a thaumaturge looking to actually do something, or a GM looking for story-seeds,&amp;nbsp;33 rituals is guaranteed to be self-descriptive. Create a shrunken head, have a magickal rap battle, cut off your own shadow, get into a fist-fight with the living embodiment of your drug addiction, and so much more. Whether they're hilarious, tragic, or terrifying, the rituals contained within may not always be a good idea to use, but they&amp;nbsp;always lead to interesting stories.&lt;br/&gt;33 Rituals Includes:&lt;br/&gt;-16 New minor rituals, including three new charging rituals that will leave your players scratching their heads at whether it's worth it&lt;br/&gt;-16 New significant rituals&lt;br/&gt;-5 New unnatural entities, linked to the rituals above&lt;br/&gt;-The grandaddy of them all: A major charge ritual. Forced Ascension.&lt;br/&gt;Remember, when all is said and done: You did it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
