			<description>The Legendary Starfy, known in Japan as Densetsu no Stafy Taiketsu! Daīru Kaizokudan (伝説のスタフィー　たいけつ！ダイール海賊団, lit. &amp;quot;The Legendary Stafy Confrontation! Daīru Pirate Squad&amp;quot;), is a marine platform video game developed by Tose and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. It is the fifth game in the The Legendary Starfy video game series. On June 8, 2009, the game became the first in the series to be released outside of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the events of Densetsu no Stafy 4, the protagonist named Starfy was sleeping in bed, a rabbit wearing an astronaut suit named Bunston, fell from the sky through the roof of Pufftop Palace, bouncing on and waking Starfy. While Starfy couldn't understand, a group known as the Terrible Trio arrived inside of Pufftop Palace and grabbed Bunston. Before they could flee away, Starfy used his signature Spin Attack against the Terrible Trio, making them drop Bunston. After Starfy knocked them out, they wondered where Bunston went, and decided to vanish in smoke in order to avoid Starfy and search for Bunston. A short time later, Moe the clam curiously rushed inside the room and asked Starfy what the commotion was all about. Then Starfy didn't answer him and tried to jump into the ocean to pursue Bunston in order to find out about him, while Moe tried to pull Starfy from the edge of the cloud of Pufftop Palace, but then Moe failed to stop Starfy and slowly slid off with him. Meanwhile, Starfy's sister Starly protects the Pufftop Palace from the Terrible Trio and its soldiers, who are looking for Starfy and/or Bunston.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Legendary Starfy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
