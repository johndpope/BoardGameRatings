							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Viking Raiders: The Fortified Medieval Harbor</name>
									
			<description>The Fortified Harbor was an extension designed for Vikings and supposed to be released in 1991. It was never released due to technical issues. General design was almost completed, but the translucent film used for the black line drawing had slightly stretched when passing in a copy machine, probably under the influence of heat. Duccio Vitale didn't have the money to redo all four maps and the project aborted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 years later, Buxeria got access to the original files and was able to restore them. The 4 maps that make the complete Fortified Harbor and the various counters intended for the game are now available for sale but the various booklets which were supposed to be provided originally were never written.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
