			<description>Okay, don't panic now, but monsters are lying underneath your bed. You're quite sure of this because you've seen them first-hand &amp;mdash; but wait? How many were there? What color were they? And couldn't some of them actually have been teddy bears?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gute Nacht Monster, players roll six dice each round, with the dice showing monsters and teddy bears in three different colors. All players need to remember these dice as quickly as they can because the dice then disappear under the bed and a task card is revealed, with players being asked, for example, how many green monsters are present. All players answer in secret, and whoever is correct moves their figure one step closer to the light switch. Whoever manages to turn on the light wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
