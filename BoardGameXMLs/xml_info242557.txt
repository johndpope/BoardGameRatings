			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of items that could be found by players at theatres and suppliers of the same. These include scenery items, equipment, props, make-up, costuming and special effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list can be used to flesh out a location with useless items, or could be a potential source of loot following an apocalyptic event. Items could be sued as camouflage or as distractions, some are useful tools. Other items are most likely simple clutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;45. Flame Retardant Solution (Used on flammable materials, especially wood based, to improve safety and reduce the chance of them catching fire, in plastic spray bottles and containers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
