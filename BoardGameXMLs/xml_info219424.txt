							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Early Pacific Battles</name>
									
			<description>This game kit published by Bruce Moore covers all aspects of 1942 battles in the Pacific.  Air to Air, Air to Surface (fixed installations and naval task forces), Naval Surface and Land Combat are all treated as well as multi-player strategic combat embracing all of the above.  Scenarios are included for the significant engagements as well as several hypothetical meetings, for example, War Plan Orange III battleship duels and surface action off Malaya had Prince of Wales and Repulse escaped air strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game kit aspect is the supply of hundreds of small coloured blocks to which unit details must be glued.  Torpedo tracks and cloud formations for strategic game weather handling must be cut out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
