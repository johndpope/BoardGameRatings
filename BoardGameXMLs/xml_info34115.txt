							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Logic</name>
									
			<description>Lewis Carroll's Game of Logic was initially published as a book with two boards and a set of cardboard counters. The game employs Carroll's bilateral and trilateral diagrams to solve logic puzzles in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the preface Lewis Carroll remarked:&lt;br/&gt;     Besides nine counters, it also requires one Player, at least. I am not aware of any Game that can be played with less than this number: while there are several that require more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
