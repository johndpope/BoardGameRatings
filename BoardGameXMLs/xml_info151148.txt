			<description>The Elf Lord is a Kickstarter bonus tile, which replaces the Druid in the Hero Deck and and adds some different strategic choices for the Hero player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Players shuffle and play their deck as normal. If the Hero player wants to include their KS Elf Lord tiles, they take these 4 tiles and shuffle them, placing them face down next to their draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play: When the Hero player is playing one of their Wild cards, they may discard the Wild card rather than using the ability and draw one of the face down Elf Lord Wild tiles playing it instead. This is an optional action enabling the player to play the original Wild card or choose to play the Elf Lord. They make this decision prior to seeing the Elf Lord card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional Rule: If the Dark Lord player is more experienced and wished to handicap themselves, they may allow the Hero player to have the KS ELf Lord Wild tiles face up and choose which one to play each time rather than the cards being random.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Aloof ELf Lord: After the Battlefield that the Elf Lord Tile was played on, the Tile is returned to the box and not shuffled back into the other tiles. Therefore, the Elf Lord will only only appear on the Battlefields 4 times, being discarded to the box when the respective battlefields are resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
