							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zen Garden</name>
									
			<description>Zen Garden is a handmade, limited edition boardgame using 10mm miniatures to simulate a battle between two squads of Samurai in a snow-covered garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a small zen garden upon which miniatures are moved with the help of movement sticks (to determine ranges and movement) and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An activation system similar to the one found in other games by Ganesha Games (such as Song of Blades and Heroes) makes sure that the turn length and the number of actions performed by every model varies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each differently armed samurai has a card detailing the warrior's combat skill with various weapons and the amount of protection offered by his armor. The card is flipped when the samurai is wounded, showing reduced values on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed by Massimo Moscarelli and sold exclusively online and at conventions. The rulebook is in Italian but an English translation is available as a free download on the ganesha games website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
