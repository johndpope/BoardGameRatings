			<description>Medspil is an entertaining quizgame, where you will use your knowledge and strategic skills to win over your opponents. You either play alone or in teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are always 3 possible answers to each question, and your or your team chooses the question category each turn. There are five different categories; Nature, Science and Health; Entertainment; Useless Knowledge; Sport and Games; History, Geography and Tourism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First team pick a category, and answers a question. If the opponents disagree, they can supply their own answer - but if it's incorrect there will be consequences. The team that answers correctly will move the category line towards themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First team to get three category lines on their side of the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no dice or luck in the game, only you and your teams knowledge and will to take a chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
