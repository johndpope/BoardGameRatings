			<description>Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter (イースII, Īsu Tsū)  is an action role-playing game developed and published by the Nihon Falcom Corporation, and first released in June 24, 1988 for the NEC PC-8801. It is the sequel to Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished, and takes place immediately following the end of the first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Adol as he battles his way across the land of Ys. As in the first game, Adol's strength is measured in a typical RPG fashion: He has numerical statistics such as HP, Attack Power, and Defense Power that determine his strength. These stats are increased by raising his experience level through battling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also returning from the first game is the combat system. The player attacks enemies by running into them, and the enemy takes damage according to Adol's Attack Power. A new addition to Ys II is the Magic system: Adol can acquire several different spells he can use throughout the course of play, such as a Fire spell for attack, and a Time spell which can stop enemies as long as it is active. The use of magic consumes Adol's MP stat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished – The Final Chapter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
