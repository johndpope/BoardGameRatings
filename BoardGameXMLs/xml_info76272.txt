			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noblesse Oblige is a free supplement for 7th Sea and Swashbuckling Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the file's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is more to 7th Sea than sword fighting. While swashbuckling is a core of the game, so is interaction at court. Would the three Musketeers have had any adventures had they not become agents of the Queen and run afoul of the politics of Richelieu? Would the dark games of Dangerous Liaisons have been so devious without the civility of court? Could the Count of Monte Cristo have truly gained revenge without gaining social power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a mixed bag of systems and details to help you expand on life in the courts of Th&amp;eacute;ah. It adds new rules and abilities for courtly characters that will leave the swordsmen in their wake at social occasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We begin with &amp;lsquo;The Courts of Th&amp;eacute;ah', an introduction to life in the Thean court. This article details courtly life and the positions and titles that can be acquired by the ambitious. This is followed by detail on fashion in Th&amp;eacute;ah. This article helps you dress your characters for court and figure out what they are wearing and how to repair the sword holes. The next article is an optional system to expand reputation. The system has come under criticism in the past, so this small expansion should help make more sense of character's renown. Then for the courtiers we present social combat rules. This system allows courtly characters to trade wit with deadly masters of sarcasm for reputation. However, take care, in Th&amp;eacute;ah words can kill as surly as a blade. Finally we present two articles originally published in Valkyrie magazine, but updated and revised for this book. D&amp;eacute;licatesse is a new sword school suitable for courtly ladies, and Mirage reveals the secrets of one of the three lost bargainers' arts. So welcome to court, but take care. Every move is watched, every lie examined and each breach of etiquette can mean ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
