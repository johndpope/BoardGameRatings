			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1978 Battlestar Galactica series inspired a video game for Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox in which the player plays as Commander Adama as a younger man, and flies a number of missions in different craft against Cylon ships, following Adama's career during the First Cylon War. It retains many design elements from the 1978 series though it was set in the new series universe. The game was an attempt at a bridge between the new and old series and feature the voice talent of Dirk Benedict as LT Starbuck and Richard Hatch as Capt Apollo. It was developed by VU Games and Warthog Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
