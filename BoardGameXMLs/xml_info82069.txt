			<description>A good overview and quick hands gives payoff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many slightly different card pairs litters the table face down. When the cards are turned you need quick reaction. The quickest player wins the pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first glance this looks like a game of memory, but the card pairs are a bit different. One player starts by turning one tile, and play continues this way around the table until two matching tiles are face up. As soon as anyone sees the match, everyone tries to smack their hands down on the oldest matching tile (i.e. not the one just turned). The quickest can claim the tile pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Tiles are _not_ turned face-down again, so the amount of face up tiles increases during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last pair is gone.  The winner is the one with the most claimed tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
