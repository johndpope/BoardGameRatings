			<description>From cover&lt;br/&gt;PLAYING THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 incredible landscapes, increasing in difficulty, for you to conquer before you fianlly reach your goal and fly away to safety in the awaiting mothership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complete each level you must move all the way around the moon to enter the transportation hut which will take you to the next moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not have limites number of lives but instead a limited amount of time. Each time you die you loose 10 seconds and are regenerated to continue where you left off, so it pays to be careful but not go too slowly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a limited ampun of fuel which is displayed on your control panel, this is used up when you THRUST. It can be filled up by collecting the fuel pods on the lunar surface. You can also collect the small ammo dumps to increase your firepower. Some of these are special target seeking ground skimming missiles which are particularly effictive for hitting the land mines and ground based offence units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
