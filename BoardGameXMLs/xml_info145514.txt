			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on gargoyles. A storied creature, fantasy gargoyles are inspired by the fearsome-looking carvings that adorn gothic architecture, which, themselves, were designed to resemble demons. Often depicted with the ability to transform into stone, and associated with protection and defensive abilities, the gargoyles of Pathfinder don&amp;rsquo;t share either of those common attributes. This book introduces the figurine gargoyle (CR 2), a mysterious creature which appears to be a statuette of a small imp, and has a penchant for ganging up on their enemies in massive mobs, and attacking foes by dropping heavy objects on their heads.  Also included is the draconic gargoyle (CR 6), which is patterned off of dragons, instead of demons, and has a breath weapon of rocks and debris, and reflexively turns to stone to avoid magical attacks. Finally, this book introduces the soul eater gargoyle (CR 11), which can drain the life essence from those it grapples to create more soul eater gargoyles, and can also turn its body into animate stone, making it stronger and more durable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
