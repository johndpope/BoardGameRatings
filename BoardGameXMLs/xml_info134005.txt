			<description>Pop 'n' Spawn is a 2-player abstract strategy board game where players attempt to occupy territory with mushrooms. Once placed on the board, mushrooms have the capacity to spawn endless copies of themselves in different directions. Players struggle for supremacy by growing, defending and capturing mushrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take alternating turns to play. On each turn a player places one mushroom of his colour on an empty square on the board. Before placing the mushroom, the player chooses the direction of the mushroom to be up, down, left or right; the direction is indicated by an arrow on the mushroom. After playing the mushroom the player's turn ends and his mushroom(s) will now spawn: each of his mushrooms on the board will make a duplicate of itself in the direction of the arrow on the mushroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mushrooms that spawn towards each other will combine their directions allowing them to make copies of themselves in multiple directions. If a player's mushroom spawns towards his opponent's mushroom, it will attack and capture it, changing the colour to its own. However a capture can be prevented if the defending mushroom has a direction opposed to the attacking mushroom. After spawning the turn passes to the next player and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of grass squares which are worth 1 point as well as flower squares which are worth 3 points. A player earns the points on the square in which he has a mushroom. The game ends when there are no more empty squares on the board and the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play online: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.popnspawn.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.popnspawn.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
