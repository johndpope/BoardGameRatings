							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halo: Fleet Battles – Covenant CPV-Class Heavy Destroyer</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the war progressed the crews of the CPV's found a newfound purpose as executioners and heralds, wielding excavation beams with deft hands and claws to carve meaningful sigils into cleansed worlds and leading battle groups against remnant UNSC forces judged unworthy of meeting the fleet's Supreme Commander. Veteran crews also found a new currency of honor in using their well-practiced skills to assist the artifact hunting fleets that scoured former human worlds for Forerunner relics and war trophies, with many turning quasi-mercenary and offering their services to Ministry leaders eager to one-up each other with treasures and baubles recovered from the glassed ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
