			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alien 3 games are side-scrolling platformers loosely based on the third movie in the Alien Franchise. In all versions of the game you play Lt Ripley after she crash lands on the prison planet Fury 161, and must rescue prisoners and escape, destroying the Aliens in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite some similarities to the movie all versions of Alien 3 share much more in common with the second film Aliens. For example, all versions have multitudes of Aliens (rather then just one as in the film) and Ripley has a Flame Thrower &amp;amp; Pulse Rifle as seen in the movie Aliens (unlike in the movie Alien 3 where she has no weapons at all).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the Alien 3 games were chiefly designed for the SNES and Sega Genesis, they were also ported to several other consoles as well. Due to the wide range of processing capability between the consoles several different versions of the game were made, some of which differ greatly from other versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien 3(Game Boy/Released 1993)&lt;br/&gt;The Game Boy version is possibly the most unique of all versions, built from the ground up as a totally different game.&lt;br/&gt;Although players still had to explore the levels and free prisoners the game is played from a top-down perspective in an adventure game format rather then a platformer one, and you also encounter several characters from the movie during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
