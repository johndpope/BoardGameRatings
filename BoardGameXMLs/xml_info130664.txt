							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paper Route</name>
									
			<description>Paper Route is an analog re-creation of classic video game action. You will be scrambling to press buttons to complete combinations, only you will be using cards instead of a video game controller. Your goal is to deliver papers, avoid danger, and vandalize houses better, and faster than your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paper Route is a turn-less &amp;quot;real-time&amp;quot; game. At the start of a round five houses are paired with five obstacles. Together, they form a sequence of buttons that players must play in order to score their points. Once both players agree, the round begins and the players flip cards, one at a time, from the top of their deck and play them on a house. The faster you can play, the better... but be careful! If you mess up, you lose a life and if you lose all your lives, your opponent wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paper Route uses the Cardboard Arcade game system.  Cardboard Arcade consists of a deck of cards that represents a classic arcade controller.  The Controller Decks are generic and allow for the re-creation of many different arcade classics with a common component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paper Route and Cardboard Arcade have been released under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/&lt;/a&gt;.
