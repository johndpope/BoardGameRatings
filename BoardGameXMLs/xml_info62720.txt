							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dajobas, Devourer of Worlds</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tulita tribes of the Razor Coast once bowed before his insatiable hunger, and offered sacrifices of slaughter to his wanton maw. Forsaken for an age, Dajobas, the mighty shark god was cast into the deepest reaches of the Razor Sea. His hunger for carnage has festered in the lightless depths for hundreds of years, but his hour of apocalypse is finally at hand. Drawn to the world of men once more by the scent of bloody seas, Dajobas rises anew. Learn everything you need to know about this horrific deity including new domains, feats, spells, weapons, and a prestige class in this eight page obeisance to He Who Eats the World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
