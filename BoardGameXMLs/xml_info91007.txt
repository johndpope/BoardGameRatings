			<description>BrawlBall is a game about sport. And combat. But more about the sport. Just a little combat. Really.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BrawlBall is a two player game, that has been created during the  One Full Sheet Label Contest. Trainers create their team by selecting a race, providing the base stats and then selecting players with different strengths and weaknesses to flesh the team out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it might be tempting to stomp the opposing trainer's players into the ground, the actual goal of the game is to get the ball into the opposing players' end zone while denying the opponent to do the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since everything you need is on one single page, crafting this game takes less than an hour.&lt;br/&gt;Due to the high flexibility during team creation (there are 49 combinations to create a single player and 11 players in a team) BrawlBall offers a high replay-ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
