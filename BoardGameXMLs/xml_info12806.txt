							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythical Basketball Championship</name>
									
			<description>A tabletop basketball simulation using fictional teams/players who play for the 'mythical' championship. Plays like a regular basketball simulation, but there is no way to ensure accuracy, since real players aren't being used -- on the other hand, that allows for a more free-forming game, without preconceptions as to HOW games should play out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
