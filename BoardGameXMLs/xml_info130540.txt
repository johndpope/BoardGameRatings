							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Toxic Cheese</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the recesses of Bartleby Brakepin&amp;rsquo;s mind lurked a taste for a legendary food. A taste arguably found in the very essence of every Ferren in Scatterpoint. Cheese! Glorious cheese! Ever since the Ferren were transported here some 500 years ago, cheese has been nothing more than a long lost legend. Bartleby knew the recipe called for milk, but there were no sources of milk in Scatterpoint. Th en one day he saw a litter of those feral cats that seemed to be everywhere. Everyone knew the cats were poisonous, but Bartleby was a chemist - perhaps he could neutralize the poison? For years Bartleby worked on eliminating the poison from the tainted cats&amp;rsquo; milk, and one day he decided the levels were low enough to actually make cheese. Ahh, the aroma was intoxicating and Bartleby couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist! Without any further tests he ate his newly made cheese and was instantly hooked. The legends were true &amp;ndash; this was the nectar of the gods! Umbriel herself would be impressed. More was needed, and it was needed now. Bartleby set to work. He knew this was his chance to leave the warrens behind and become a Cloudbreather. Bartleby began producing and selling Bartleby&amp;rsquo;s Blue Cheese &amp;ndash; so called due to the blue film that covers each batch, the deep blue streaks running throughout it, and perhaps that horrible feeling some people get in the pit of their stomach when they are denied their tasty treat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
