			<description>This is a slimmed down version of Ungame with new material created for children.  This is a non-competitive game that encourages conversation and communication. The game comes in a pocket-sized box and has different questions than previous versions of the board game. (The cards can also be used with the board game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of Pocket Ungame Kids Version material:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frank must do chores before he can play. How do you feel about doing chores ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joni wants Charlie to play a game with her. What game do you like to play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tara refuses to enter the contest because she doesn't like to lose. Say something about losing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kevin was tempted to cheat on a test. If you have ever cheated, tell about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
