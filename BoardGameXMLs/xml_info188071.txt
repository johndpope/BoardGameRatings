			<description>Life is Card is a deceptively simple social card game where everyone playing decides on a scenario and goal and then proceeds to attempt to complete it using six fundamental actions. A game can last from five minutes to an hour and is appropriate for most ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played cooperatively using one person as the antagonist or, more commonly, competitively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The players collectively decide on a scenario that includes a goal and a limitation or two (the rule book describes several scenarios). They then draw six cards and pick one to play all at the same time, action order resolves by the numbers printed on the cards from highest to lowest with each player describing their action. The next turn all players pass their cards to the player on the left and draw back up to six. A winner is determined when the scenario is either completed or impossible to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards: The six action cards are Grab, Use, Position, Plan, Rest, and Delay&lt;br/&gt;  Grab: You pick something up, pull something down, restrain something, etc. Anything having to do with grabbing.&lt;br/&gt;  Position: Anything related to movement: yourself, a shopping cart, your laser pistol. You can only position something you already have in your possession or grabbed earlier in the game.&lt;br/&gt;  Use: Activating something, whether or not it is the item's primary intention. Turning on a stove, throwing a grenade, pushing that shiny red button.&lt;br/&gt;  Plan: Just like a wild card, you can use a Plan to pull any card out of the draw pile and immediately use it. The card you drew keeps the number from the &amp;ldquo;Plan&amp;rdquo; card for action order.&lt;br/&gt;  Rest: This card does not have numbers. Leave this card in front of you, sit back, and relax this turn while the others blunder away. On any later turn, you may discard this card to play two from your hand (be sure to draw back up to six cards). These two additional cards still adhere to the action order based on their numbers.    &lt;br/&gt;  Delay: These cards also do not have numbers. If you play one, you can pick someone to delay their action until they are last in the action order after they have stated their action. You may also play another action card. You cannot Delay a Rest and you cannot play another Delay card as your additional action card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
