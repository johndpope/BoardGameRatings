							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secrets of the Steppes</name>
									
			<description>Information from the Mongoose website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North, beyond the vast, arid wilderness of the Sighing Desert lies a distant land that is usually only referred to by boasting merchants seeking to add to the price of their wares or else tellers of tall stories in the taverns of the Young Kingdoms cities. Secrets of the Steppes gives details on the geography, flora and fauna of the Dakwinsi Steppe and the regions which border this vast tundra land. In addition, the unique histories and customs of the nations and tribes who inhabit these areas are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shad is a civilized Ilmioran City-State whose harbour is often the last port of call by those who chance sailing further up the coast into the colder reaches of the Pale Sea. These northern waters are home to huge whales and colossal icebergs, whilst the bleak coastline of the steppe itself is the realm of the Alofians, a savage tribe of hermaphrodites. Inland, the Bastan nomads roam across the countless leagues of wind swept plains which stretch towards the Unknown East, hunting seals and mammoths. Although snow covers most of the region through its long winters, the margins of the steppe have milder climates and are home to primitive tribesmen. The Limnissi people dwell in the mazelike marshlands whilst the elusive Arbanni are a ghostlike, unseen presence in the tall, silent woodlands of their mountain range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are presented for the creation of adventurers from the lands described in this volume and also include several new background professions for Young Kingdom characters. Game statistics are given for a variety of animals, men and monsters. Finally 10 scenario seeds, tailored to the locations in this book, are written for use by Elric of Melnibone Games Masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
