							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seaside Inlet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 40 x 40 inch Battlemap of a Seaside Inlet Holiday Hotel, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hope your stay at the Seaview Hotel was pleasant. But now it is time for business&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Tunnel Snake arms dealer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seaside Inlet is a single level exterior map of buildings built on the shore surrounding a small inlet of water in the center of the map with a bridge connecting the west and east sides of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seaside Inlet is intended for use in modern games, working best as a tourist trap useful for crime, spy, and urban fantasy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A View to a Feud:  The Tunnel Snakes have their run of the town of Seaside. They own the Seaview Hotel and its attached bar and outdoor patios in the west. Their boss owns the mansion with a rooftop pool in the northeast. They also own the former motel in the southeast that has been closed for some time. A series of tunnels have been dug underneath the motel. They use the tunnels to smuggle arms (or change this to drugs if it fits the game better) to the motel and sell the guns to the highest bidder. The motel rooms are used to temporarily store the guns until a buyer can be found.  The signs outside the former motel are meant to scare people away from the &amp;ldquo;condemned&amp;rdquo; building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the Tunnel Snakes have not gone unnoticed by the police who have arranged for undercover police officers to be the next buyer of the illegal arms. Unfortunately for the police, a rival gang arrives during the middle of their negotiations to buy the guns. The beautiful tourist trap of Seaside is riddled with bullets as the two gangs fight each other with the undercover cops caught in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters could be any of the three factions here. As undercover cops they need to convince the Tunnel Snakes they haven&amp;rsquo;t double-crossed them, perhaps by helping to fight off the rival gang. The Tunnel Snakes want to kill their rival gang and may turn on the cops once they are through with them. The rival gang is here to get the money and weapons after killing as many Tunnel Snakes as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
