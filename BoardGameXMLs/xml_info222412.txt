			<description>Learn to recognize and name the 4 basic emotions with this game. The children take turns in rotating the dial. When the dial stops, the child whose turn it is, takes a card with the same face as indicated by the dial and places it on his assignment card. The first to fill his or her assignment card wins the game. The assignment cards are all different. It is possible to do a group activity with the large emotion cards or use the cards for group discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
