			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lazy Raiders is a puzzle game for the Xbox 360. The game stars Dr. Diggabone, an archaeologist/explorer on a quest to find artifacts on the American continents. The problem is that he is so lazy that he only waits around waiting for something to fall into his lap. The player facilitates this, however, as they have the ability to rotate or flip the map in order to change the locations of everything by altering the gravity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each level the player can use the analog stick to move the map around a central axis and make Dr. Diggabone collect treasures and avoid traps. The goal of each stage is to collect the treasures, and every fifth level has the player competing against a thief for the artifact. There are 80 different levels included in the game over three settings: Arctic, Mayan, and Wild West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
