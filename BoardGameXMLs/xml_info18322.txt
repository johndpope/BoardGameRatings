			<description>Players answer questions to collect cards. If the question isn't answered, the person asking the question gets to keep the card. The person with the most cards at the end of the game wins. Questions fit into 4 basic categories; wilderness skills, plants, wildfire and land &amp;amp; sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player is the person who has the best snacks, or knows the most constellations, or has never had poison oak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
