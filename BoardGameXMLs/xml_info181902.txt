			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very special module, as it marks the first in our L line (you can guess what it stands for). This module is based on the short story &amp;ldquo;A Haunted Island,&amp;rdquo; by Algernon Blackwood. Because his works are now in the public domain, we have taken the liberty of writing this scenario &amp;ldquo;in collaboration&amp;rdquo; with Mr. Blackwood, to give you the product he would have delivered had he written RPG supplements in the early 20th century. The overall location, the central action, and the descriptive language are (mostly) Blackwood&amp;rsquo;s, in his own words wherever we could justify his style. The greater plot behind the island are ours; we hope Mr. Blackwood would have approved of the direction we took his story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Haunted Island&amp;quot; will put your PCs straight into a classic ghost story:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small group of characters spends a fortnight on an isolated island in order to rest after a particularly harrowing adventure, perhaps to catch up on some scroll scribing. The island in question is on the edge of a frontier only subdued in the last twenty years, with the prevailing barbarian tribes still very much extant, though now mostly confined to an empire-sanctioned reservation located fifteen miles from the island. They remain a fierce people, but after a bru-tal defeat by the empire a generation earlier they mostly keep to themselves, though they are free by treaty to hunt and fish in the forests and lakes near the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a few days spent in relative peace and iso-lation, the PCs begin to experience an acute sensa-tion of fear when they wake up in their beds each morning. This sensation of fear heightens until they can no longer stand to repose in their beds, upon which they experience a phantom visitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note about system:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is published as a &amp;ldquo;system-neutral&amp;rdquo; product. That means that any specific implementations of rules are left to the end user, and Gothic Roleplaying Accesso-ries makes no claims of compatibility with any existing roleplaying game system. We have done this both for legal reasons and to make our products available to a wider audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
