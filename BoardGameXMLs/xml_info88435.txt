							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Many Monster Dice</name>
									
			<description>This game developed out of a BGG dice design contest game i posted a few months ago (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/552079/my-many-monster-dice-game-competition-win-gg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/552079/my-many-monster-d...&lt;/a&gt;). My solo game rules for the pictured dice (which can be purchased at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/&lt;/a&gt;) is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Dungeon Dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need the many monster dice, paper to keep track of your character and draw out your dungeon, and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the D20 to discover how many monsters you must encounter during your game and mark this value down. You must defeat this number of monsters to win the game without being slain yourself. Any gold and jewels you have left at the end if yours to keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, with the five numbered dice, assign one die to each 5 values - monster hit point die, and attack and defense dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the map die, drawing out your dungeon as you go. Be as artistic as you like in this. Stairs and doors always have traps. Each door you roll will enter into a room, and there will always be a unlocked exit door in an adjacent wall. The T corridor branches off into other hallways and you may backtrack your path if you wish during exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you roll a door or a stair check first for a trap by rolling the 3 trap dice, if two faces match that trap is sprung.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, if you rolled a door, you enter the room. Roll the colored monster die to see what level of monster you will fight, and roll the corresponding colored monster die to see what you will fight. You always have initiative in an encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To battle:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll your Battle Strength die and add that value to your Battle Strength for a magical weapon if you possess one. Then roll for the monster. Depending on the color and type of monster they will have different strengths and powers as summarized in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have defeated a monster you may roll for treasure using the Treasure Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the dungeon until you defeat/kill all the monsters you are required to. If you do this count yourself lucky you survived with your limbs and sanity intact. Spend your gold at the nearest wenchery or tavern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
