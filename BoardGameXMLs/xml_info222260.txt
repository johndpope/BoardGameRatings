							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Morphblade</name>
									
			<description>Morphblade was heavily inspired by Imbroglio. The core idea that your location determines your weapon is straight from Imbroglio, but along the way I changed pretty much everything else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you move around a hexagonal grid slicing, smashing and bursting waves of nasty red bugs. Each hex you move to turns you into a different weapon: on a Blades hex you can kill things to your sides, on an Arrow you can fire yourself through two enemies in a row. And between waves, you choose how to build out the grid to your own design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
