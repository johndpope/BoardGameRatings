			<description>A bingo style game with two variants.  In the first ruleset, the caller calls out an amount, and the players check their cards which show pictures of coins for a match.  A row of four across, three down, four corners or entire card wins (winning pattern announced at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second ruleset, the game is the same but the cards and calling are different.  Players have a card with coin amounts instead of pictures of coins.  The caller calls out a description of a set of coins (i.e. &amp;quot;two dimes and one nickel&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
