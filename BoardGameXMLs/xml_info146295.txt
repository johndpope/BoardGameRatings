			<description>&amp;quot;Free Flight is a very simple to learn and play, but it can be as intriguing as the player's imagination allows.The game is considered to be a cross between Backgammon and Chess with the added dimension of having three or four players, each using their own ability to combine luck with logic and skill to eliminate the opposition.  Since the roll of the dice is involved it assures that each and every game played is totally different than the previous games, creating exciting and unlimited variety.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The die roll determines which pieces move.  The six (Free  Flight) allows the movement of any piece.  The pieces are Omni (Queen), Digon (Bishop), Orthon (Rook), Trax (Pawn).  Diaginal taking of pieces, limited movement, and promotion are all part of the game.  There are also hazard spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
