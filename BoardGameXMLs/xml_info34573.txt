							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tornado Alley</name>
									
			<description>Several storm cells bear down on the town of Doomsville, Oklahoma (population 213).  Each contains an F1 tornado that will grow in strength and carve its own path of destruction.  Do what you have always wanted to...  Take control of one of nature's most dangerous forces: the Tornado!  Using your twister, destroy as much of the town of Doomsville and the surrounding countryside as you can - do a better job than the other players and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, you will need to properly control the path of the Tornado and manage its strength so that destroy high value buildings.  Some buildings can only be destroyed by extremely strong F5 tornadoes, while others can be wiped out with only an F2. You will manage the strength and path using a pool of &amp;quot;storm points&amp;quot;.  Each player starts with the same amount, but as you use them to plan your actions, the pools for each tornado will change accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doomsville rebuilds itself for each game; meaning that for each game there is a method for randomly building the town and the surrounding countryside.  This makes each game play distinctly different and puts the tornadoes into a fight to get the higher value buildings before their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for...?  Get to wiping Doomsville off the map!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE:  This game was inspired a couple of months after a small twister (F0 probably) tore up some trees in my yard in July 2006 and discussing it with my son.  Tornadoes are very dangerous and interesting facts and safety information about  tornadoes will be included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
