			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come and delight in the mess you make of mortal lives! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Folk, servants of Auberyon the Solstice King, they are race of mercurial essence and yet they are timeless, a race that cares very little for the consequences of their actions yet they keep the bargains that they make. They are the uncaring eldritch powers of nature, yet they are quick to take offense, all the while living with abandonment. They value entertainment, humor, and take on the aspects of various forms throughout their immortal existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create the fey you want to play in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. This product includes the new race The First Folk, alternate racial traits, favored class bonuses, two new archetypes as well as the Fey Racial Paragon class. In the Company of Fey gives you everything you need to fully integrate this new racial culture into established campaigns and bring their society to life as told to you in first person by Red Shuck of the First Folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t wait! Bring this legendary race into your game and show the world what they Fey can do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
