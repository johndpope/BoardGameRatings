			<description>Story&lt;br/&gt;The Academy of Magic is a place where disciples of magic learn the art of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, mysterious cases have occurred, cases in which students and teachers have been brutally murdered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These murders correspond to a legend that exists at the Acadamy regarding the conduct of a particular witch. Repeated tragedies at the Acadamy have made people aware that the legend of the existence of the 'Witch of the Acadamy' may indeed be true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get rid of the witch, 5 members of academy start the research about the  legend of the Witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the members of this group  is to find and to get rid of the witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way, the legend also says that the witch can transform into whomever the witch has killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means there is always a question about,  if one of the research members is already a witch.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Humans have their own magic which is different from magic users from far beyond the beginning of the academy. This magic is called &amp;quot;information&amp;quot;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The frightful magic of the 'Witch of the Academy' can celebrate the murderer as a saint, and can execute a bonny innocent  girl as a witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About this game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You become one of the 5 possible characters, and by gathering information about the witch, you try to contribute to the research and to become the most reliable character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also you must pay attention to the possibilities that one of the members is actually a witch, you may point out a member as a witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(In this game, you must discard a field card and take a field card.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discarded character card gives you information, while you point out a character as a witch by taking cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To tell the truth, there may be no witch amongst the members of the group. However, a character who is pointed out as being the witch may lose the trust of the rest of the players in the game and  may be executed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So it is important to gather information, but at the same time it is important to cast doubt on the other characters by spreading witch rumors, or by trying to avoid being accused of being the witch yourself.  The winner is the person who survives the swirling eddy of information and misinformation surrounding the Witch Distrubance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
