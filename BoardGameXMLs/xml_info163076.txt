			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations, you're dead and the afterlife isn't what we thought.  Play as Bhoots, Dolls, Ghosts, Ghouls, Skeletons, Vampires, Zombies and more in a game where you take on the role of the recently deceased.

But spooks be warned, as the Great Beyond can be a dangerous place.  Filled with demons, faeries, mummies and all other sort of things that go bump in the night, spooks must prepare themselves for anything.
