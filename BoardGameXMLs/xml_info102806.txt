			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module begins the first story arc of the Nishanpur campaign: Under the Sword. Characters need not have played any other Nishanpur modules, and it is expected this is the characters' first introduction to the City of Secrets. It is helpful if at least one character at the table has played in Temptations of the Flesh, and possibly also Bargains of Flesh and Spirit. It is recommended that other characters have played some Arcanis modules before and that they be somewhat familiar with the world of Onara, though this is not strictly necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is necessary to start the characters outside the city proper, as this city has many strange (to outsiders) laws. Please refer to the Nishanpur information packet available for reference if you need to review some further city background before beginning. Please note that in the area of Nishanpur itself, nearly everyone speaks in a whisper. This is part of the flavor of this city, and the GM is encouraged to roleplay this as much as is practical. Allow the players time to roleplay as well, and enjoy the flavor of this dark part of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
