							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Origins of the Society</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Lantern Society is solely a group of people interested in charitable works and bringing art in all its forms to people throughout the land. The Rumors that it is also a secret society of spies who are following some plan are quite false...aren't they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare find out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you pass the tests and be an agent?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What follows is your induction into the society, complete with secret handshakes and magical tattoos. There could be agents anywhere - some simply gather information and pass it along, never leaving their homes or jobs. Others find creative ways to complete missions and maintain their cover lives. Yet others work solely in the shadows and live seemingly without identities of their own. Oh, you want to join? Well, you may have the eye of a seasoned agent now - who knows if they'll put your name in a hat or what form your testing will take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn about the spokes of the Wheel and see what each one's speciality is. What is the overall plan? You'll find out soon. Inside this book there's everything anyone could need to create a Lantern Agent for GM's or players. There's new edges, hindrances and even some interesting magic along with a number of NPCs and a number of story threads. Plus, new secrets are revealed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
