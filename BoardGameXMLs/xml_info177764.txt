			<description>All across America trucks rumble across the interstate carrying products from manufacturers to retailers. As a small start-up company with a truck, an office and a dream you are throwing you hat into the ring to challenge the big boys. The freight has to be moved and there is competition for who can get to loads first and who can make the most profitable routes. But watch out, Smokey is on the prowl. So put the hammer down and let it all hang out. You have to get loaded up &amp;amp; truckin&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a player, you represent a small but growing trucking company seeking to pick up and deliver goods in the most efficient manner possible. Amassing money is one way to achieve victory, but there are other ways to score as well. It is important to dominate a region or two with the most deliveries while not ignoring the other regions. In the end, your deliveries will be compared to the other players to determine which company has the best overall presence in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players gain presence by moving their trucks from city to city across the United States picking up and dropping off deliveries along the way. You can specialize in high profit cross-country runs or you can make numerous short routes. On each turn the vagaries of the business will be determined by a deck of event cards. Each player will then get to buy new hubs and trucks before setting out to scoop up goods before a rival comes along and 'steals' the load.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
