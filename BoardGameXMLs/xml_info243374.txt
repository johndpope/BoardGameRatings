			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, and remains in development. Therefore, some of the game information may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not about the history. It&amp;rsquo;s about the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Memory of Us is a reminiscence of a friendship between a boy and a girl. A friendship made during tough times. Times of terror, pain, and exclusion in a world where people were forced to live in two artificially detached worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A friend in need is a friend indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside. Together you are stronger. Together, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing in the world that can stop you. With her, reality becomes much more bearable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find happiness in small things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When life gives you lemons, make a lemonade. Enjoy every day you spend with her and look for small pleasures and gems hidden among walls, decrees, and exclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
