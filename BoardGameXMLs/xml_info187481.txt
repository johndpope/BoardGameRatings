							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quality Street Monopoly</name>
									
			<description>This is a card game, a variation of the English game Pairs (known as Memo or Memory in Europe) but has unique twists on that type of game. The game was given away in Quality Street boxes of chocolates in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: To finish with property worth more than any other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing cards are placed at random face down on the table. Each player should also start the game with 7 Quality Street sweets!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the youngest, the players turn over two cards. If the property on the two cards is identical, the player keeps the cards and turns over two others. When two cards which do not match are revealed, they are turned over face down again, and the player&amp;rsquo;s turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in the playing cards are a number of &amp;lsquo;Community Chest&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Chance&amp;rsquo; cards. If revealed, the player accepts their reward or fine, and if it is the first card turned over, that player still turns over a second card as part of their turn. These cards are removed from the table once revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one &amp;lsquo;Go to Jail&amp;rsquo; card. If this is revealed that player&amp;rsquo;s turn is over (even if it is the first card turned), and they must miss their next turn. Unlike the Chance and Community Chest cards, this card stays on the table, so you are wise to remember where it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have a value on them (related to real values on a traditional English Monopoly board). So it is not the one with the most cards who wins, it is the one with the highest value of cards that wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
