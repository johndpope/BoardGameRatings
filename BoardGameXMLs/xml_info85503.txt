			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eye of Judgment: Legends is a PSP spinoff of the PS3 game The Eye of Judgment. At its core, Legends is a turn based card battle game but, unlike its PS3 relative, Legends does not make use of physical cards and does not need any physical peripherals. The game has the player travel a fantasy world defeating other characters in card battles. As the player progresses they improve their deck with more powerful cards and special powers. Legends includes more than 30 additions to the Eye of Judgment card deck, and some cards have been rebalanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
