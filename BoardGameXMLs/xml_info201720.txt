							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lonely Bears</name>
									
			<description>Lonely Bears is a 2-4 player casual strategy card game that will have you arming Billy-No-Balloons, Drunk Frank and Scaredy-Cat Matt to the teeth, with Ridable Nukes, Horny Nordic Helmets and all manner of other crazy weapons and armour to defeat your opponents... if you don&amp;rsquo;t get caught by a game-changing event!  &lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to kill your opponents bears by equipping them with cards drawn from the deck, balancing an offensive or defensive strategy tailored to the items you pick at random. Attack too soon and you'll be the target, but leave it too late and you'll be the victim!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
