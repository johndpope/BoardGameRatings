							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Colony</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are in deep trouble.  Children of respected knights of the realm, you've been slacking away and causing trouble.  Thankfully the King and his people respect your families and you haven't been banished, or worse.  Now you must travel down the southern coast to investigate a long standing rumor of a missing shipload of treasure from one hundred years past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will visit hidden port towns, island enclaves and see sights you'd never see from your boring northern stone city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pirates, sea monsters, a mystery to solve and wealth to retrieve for your king and country to help fund a coming war against the Drow. It's time to search for the Lost Colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
