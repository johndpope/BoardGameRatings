			<description>START YOUR ENGINES!&lt;br/&gt; A major corporation has come to today&amp;rsquo;s race looking for a team of drivers to sponsor. Unlike other sponsors, this corporation is not looking for a team that only cares about winning; they want a team that gets the crowd&amp;rsquo;s blood pumping with incredible speeds and daring maneuvers. A gutsy driver is just as likely to be remembered as a winning driver.&lt;br/&gt; Race Fans is a family card game for 1-4 people that has players controlling a team of race car drivers trying to gain fans and win a major corporate sponsorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race Fans is designed to be fast, fun, and easy to learn. The game revolves around 8 race cars in a row called the track. During the game, players use one of two different cards to affect the cars in an attempt to gain fans. Maneuver cards are used to change the position of the race cars on the track while thrill cards are used to gain fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
