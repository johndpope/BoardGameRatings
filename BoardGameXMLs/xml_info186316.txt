			<description>The city is full of fine foods.  You love to go out with your friends, wandering around and eating tasty things.  But you might have overdone it a bit.  You're all feeling a bit plump lately.  One of you speaks up: &amp;quot;Let's all dieting contest!  Whoever loses the most weight wins!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so it begins.  A pleasant game of watching what you eat while you stroll the streets and dine together.  If you feel an item has too many calories, pass it off on a friend.  Try to be the first to reach your goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players collect food cards, trying to keep the cards lowest in fat while passing off the unhealthy cards to their friends.  Whoever empties their hands first scores zero, while the other players count the amount of weight gained in their remaining cards.  After everyone has been start player once, whoever has gained the least weight wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
