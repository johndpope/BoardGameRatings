			<description>Chakra is a Chess variant played on the usual 8x8 board. Pieces include a king equivalent, a queen equivalent, a knight equivalent, a super-rook, a super-bishop, and pawn equivalents, but it also has some more unusual pieces:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Courtesan piece moves like a king but when in the same row, column, or diagonal as the friendly Emperor (king), controls the whole line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Transmitter consists of two pieces called chakras. Unlike other pieces they can be moved onto by friendly pieces; a piece that can move onto one chakra can also move onto the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules were published in The Gamer #3 (November/December 1981). Pieces were made available by mail order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
