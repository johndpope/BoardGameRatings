							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Complete Campaign</name>
									
			<description>A Complete Fantasy Saga for 1st- to 20th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;708 pages - the ultimate fantasy campaign!  The acclaimed War of the Burning Sky Campaign Saga comes to you compiled, enhanced and with loads of bonus new content! A complete fantasy campaign for D&amp;amp;D 3.5, for character levels 1-20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witness the terrible face of war in a world of magic...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the new year turns, the weather across takes a sudden chill turn, and the sky darkens as the grip of winter intensifies. Worry rises as regular channels of communication between nations cease like a candle suddenly snuffed. Slowly, throughout the lands claimed by the Ragesian Empire, rumors spread between isolated villages, traveling by foot and horse and word of mouth -- rumors that Drakus Coaltongue, the immortal emperor whose armies conquered every land he set his gaze upon, has fallen in a distant land to the west. How the tyrant was defeated is unknown, but if it is true, everyone knows that a war is coming. The generals of Emperor Coaltongue will strike for control, oppressed peoples will rise up in rebellion, and dangers once held in check only by fear of the mighty warlord will bring doom to the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those in power are preparing for the coming conflict, readying fervent armies and powerful weapons and subtle, deceptive plots, but two questions burn in their minds: who killed the seemingly-immortal Emperor Coaltongue; and what has become of the artifact that would let a man rule of the world? Who has the Torch of the Burning Sky?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E.N. Publishing presents a saga of twelve adventures where would-be conquerers bring the world to the brink of annihilation, and it is up to the heroes to decide who will rule in the aftermath of the great war &amp;ndash; perhaps an ally, perhaps themselves, perhaps even anarchy. They can usher the world into a golden age, or let it be scorched under a rain of fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    All twelve adventures of the War of the Burning Sky Campaign Saga&lt;br/&gt;    The Player's Guide and Campaign Guide&lt;br/&gt;    A massive rules appendix compiling all of the new rules material, classes, feats, spells, magic items and more from the saga&lt;br/&gt;    Five bonus sidequest adventures&lt;br/&gt;        More Spies in the Steam Tunnels&lt;br/&gt;        Moral Dilemmas&lt;br/&gt;        A Harvest of Hope Forlorn&lt;br/&gt;        The Old-Fashioned Way&lt;br/&gt;        Dreamcatcher&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    A short section covering Ragos, the capital city of Ragesia&lt;br/&gt;    A narrative prologue covering the events leading up to the War of the Burning Sky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the PDF version of the WotBS compiled hardcover deluxe version.  It contains all of the contents of the campaign saga subscription with plenty of extra material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
