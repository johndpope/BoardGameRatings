							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Brotherhood of the Fallen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a century ago, the vile &amp;lsquo;Brotherhood of the Fallen&amp;rsquo; unleashed a horrifying reign of terror upon the town of Redvale. Yet while the cult was ultimately vanquished by the legendary hero, Alexander Winterlight, the deep mental and physical scars which Redvale&amp;rsquo;s people suffered at the hands of the Brotherhood remained. For years, the town&amp;rsquo;s citizens lived with the constant fear that the Brotherhood may one day return to plague Redvale once more, but over the ensuing decades, memory of the atrocities which the cult perpetrated began to fade. This all changed but a few short months ago&amp;hellip; when the Brotherhood&amp;rsquo;s lost temple was seemingly uncovered in a nearby mountain range, a discovery that threatened to shatter the peace and serenity which the people of Redvale had enjoyed of late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the temple&amp;rsquo;s seeming discovery, a number of strange events have occurred in and around Redvale, events that have led the people of the town to wonder if the Brotherhood has truly returned, or if there could perhaps be some other sinister force at work within their midst? If only Redvale&amp;rsquo;s council could find a group of brave (or perhaps foolhardy) souls who would be willing to step forth and pit themselves against the menace that is&amp;hellip; The Brotherhood of the Fallen!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brotherhood of the Fallen is an adventure designed for characters of 1st to 3rd level. Yet those who are brave enough to pit their wits against the Brotherhood will need far more than a strong sword arm, as intrigue abounds within the town of Redvale, while all manner of fiendish traps and puzzles lie within the cult&amp;rsquo;s temple. So ask yourself this; are you truly ready to face the dangers which lie within?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brotherhood of the Fallen contains a 38-page Introduction Book and a 109-page Adventure Book, along with numerous maps and player handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
