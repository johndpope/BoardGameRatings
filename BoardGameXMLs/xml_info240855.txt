							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lockup: A Roll Player Tale</name>
									
			<description>The King has finally managed to clean up the kingdom. The heroic adventurers have captured the various vile minions and thrown them all into the dungeons. Enchanted gates and ruthless guards make escape all but impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lockup, you play as a group of minions locked in the King's dungeon -- the gnolls, the kobolds, the bugbears, the goblins, or the insectoids.&lt;br/&gt; If you can&amp;rsquo;t escape, you might as well make your stay as comfortable as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increase your reputation while keeping your suspicion with the guards under control. Sneak into the sewers, toil in the workshop, or spend time in the infirmary to collect valuable resources. Amass goon followers in the chow hall and craft contraband on the cell block to gain prestige amongst the rest of the nefarious minions within the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lockup is a worker placement game set in the Roll Player universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play takes place over three phases in each round:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Patrol Phase - New resources are placed on the gameboard, and the guards patrol the dungeon. Players with high suspicion are raided, and their chambers are searched.&lt;br/&gt;     Roll Call - Players take turns placing their minions in different parts of the dungeon, some face-up showing a unit's strength and some face-down, hiding the strength from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;     Lights Out - Each area with minions is scored based on the strength of each group of minions. Players receive resources and have the opportunity to recruit goons and build contraband.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
