			<description>Act as a stay at home mom trying to clean the house. Each player moves through their own house (a play mat) trying to clean. The first player with a clean house wins. The trouble is that there is a child in each house controlled by the game. The child moves through the house playing with toys and making a mess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A child with no toys will help clean up but it is risky to try to keep they toys from the child because the mom only has two hands to work with. The child cannot go into mom's room or the garage so toys can be stored there but it takes time to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part strategy and part luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
