							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">En Prise Chess Cards</name>
									
			<description>En Prise is a card game of chance and strategy that plays just like chess - for two to four players.  No separate board or pieces are required as the cards themselves represent squares of a growing board that takes shape as the game progresses.  A deck consists of 64 cards.  Each player uses 16 cards, matching the pieces and pawns of a standard chess set. They can choose one of four colours (white, black, red and blue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are dealt, face-up, into shuffled 'Battleplans' from which cards are played, in the shuffled order, into a central playing area.  Each card represents a square of a chess board.  A square can be occupied (card face-up) or unoccupied (face-down).  On each turn, a card is either placed as a piece/pawn or empty square; or moved according to traditional chess movement rules &amp;ndash; but they can only move within the board squares already created.  When a card is placed (a new square), it must be connected to an existing square of the board.  When a card moves, it is swapped with the destination card so the growing board is preserved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kings can be placed on any turn where there are at least six empty squares on the board.  If a player chooses to do so, all opponents must use their next turn to place their King.  The aim of En Prise, like chess,  is to checkmate opposing Kings.  When a player is checkmated, their board cards are turned over to become empty squares on their next turn.  The winner is the last remaining player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations described in the rules include En Prise Casino, En Prise Alliance, En Prise Memory and En Prise Blind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
