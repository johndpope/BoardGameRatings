			<description>In Memoriam 2 (known as Evidence: The Last Ritual in the US, In Memoriam: Le Dernier Rituel in France) is an adventure game for Windows platform, and is notable for its Alternate Reality-style gameplay, in which the player receives e-mails from other in-game characters, including the game's main antagonist, as well as being asked to find a lot of information and clues to the games' puzzles on the internet, both from real websites, and from specially-created websites that have been mixed in with other &amp;quot;real-world&amp;quot; domains. In addition to these, the French version of the game (only within France) offers (for a one-time fee) to send SMS messages to the player directly to their mobile phones, as well as the ability to call any of the characters and have a real phone conversation with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Evidence: The Last Ritual&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
