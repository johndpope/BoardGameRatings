							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vapor World</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal for your characters is to reach full Vapor godness. To do that, you have to turn into a dolphin. To do that, you have to communicate with your fellow Vapor demi-gods in ONLY a Vaporwave fashion. Yes, it's that easy to turn into a dolphin. Once you turn into a dolphin, no matter what you say or do, you'll remain a dolphin (Vapor god). Yes, that means you can talk about things that aren't Vaporwave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vapor World is a game for 3-4 players, ages 18 and up. The game takes anywhere from one hour to a whole day to play. Vapor World is a game about the music genre and Internet Phenomenon of Vaporwave. Each player takes on the role of a demi-god who has entered the world of the vaporwave by casting away the capitalist society that we live in, while being ironic about it. The goal of each of the players is to reach full godliness by turning into a dolphin. The game was written in an inebriated state by Banana Chan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
