			<description>An educational game featuring the building of the railways across North America in the 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;The board is overlayed with a square grid and each square has a number in it (from 2 to 10) and this is the cost of building a railway through that square. Railways are drawn on the board as they are built (similar to Railway Rivals).&lt;br/&gt;Two packs of Chance Cards, but these are way too lucky or unlucky. One pack is used until someone reaches the Rocky Mountains and then the 2nd stack is used &amp;quot;More in keeping with the 2nd phase of the game&amp;quot; say the rules.&lt;br/&gt;The Railway Pioneer with the most money after a set time, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
