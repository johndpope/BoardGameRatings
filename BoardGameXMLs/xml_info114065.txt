			<description>What is LangGuini?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LangGuini is a multi player card game for 3 or more players. The game was designed during the 2010 Global Game Jam in Philadelphia, PA. last year's theme was &amp;quot;Extinction&amp;quot; so we decided that the English language has been deteriorating rapidly so we needed some new words. Being big fans of party games we wanted to make a social game, hence the three player minimum. After almost a year of play-testing and messing around with the mechanics we really want to print this game and get it out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What comes in the initial deck?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck comes with a box with instructions printed on the back. 108 cards in the deck. 12 cards are the decision cards (hopefully to be replaced by DICE) 94 cards that each have two word parts listed on either the yellow or orange side. The final 2 cards are our special thanks and stuff like that cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LangGuini is played by one player being selected as the first to deal/judge. The player selects from one of the 12 decision or &amp;quot;dice cards&amp;quot; (hopefully to be replaced by DICE if we get enough pledges) to find out how many word parts and what color(s) will be used. After selecting from that portion of the deck the dealer selects the word part cards and uses the parts to spell out a word of their own design. After laying out the cards the dealer pronounces the new word for the other players to hear. Then in clockwise fashion the players explain what they think is the definition of the word. After all players define the new word the dealer becomes judge and decides who wins that round. The winner keeps the cards that were used and then takes the role of dealer/judge until they pick a winner and so on. The player who wins XX (number of cards, we play to 15 usually, take a break and start again) WINS the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
