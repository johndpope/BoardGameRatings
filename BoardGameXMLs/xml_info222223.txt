			<description>In this game, you control a strong young berzerker named Victor. Victor is a member of the Swordbearers, an order of fighters, mages, thieves, etc. The Swordbearers are tasked with guarding an ancient historic sword called the Einlanzer. At the onset of the game, Victor is tasked with being the last line of defense for the Einlanzer. Unknown forces besiege Swordbearer Temple and Victor is not able to keep them from taking the holy relic. Feeling disgraced, Victor sheds his Swordbearer title and, along with many other in his former order, decide to travel the world in an attempt to retrieve the Einlanzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
