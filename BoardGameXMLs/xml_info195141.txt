			<description>A monstrous board game encouraging kids &amp;amp; families to have imaginative fun with game play imaginative interaction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A classic dungeon setting is the backdrop as players assume the roles of tough hunters bound and determined to do three things: to defeat as many monsters as possible, to collect treasure, and to make it out unscathed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players become bona fide monster hunters as they delve into dungeons filled with beasts and obstacles. At the beginning of each session, players choose one of three game modes in which they will compete. Treasure Hunt, Monster Hunt, or Dungeon Escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each session, players choose one of three game modes in which they will compete:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure Hunt &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;Be the first to get to the treasure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Hunt &amp;ndash; Defeat all the monsters on the board, player with the most captured wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Escape &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;Be the first player to get to the finish exit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 4 boards can be arranged in numerous ways based on the number of players. Obstacle tiles including corridors, pits, locked doors, and secret doors are added to the boards. The number depends on the game mode being played. Monsters are then added to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls a d10 for movement through squares that make up the dungeon boards. When they get to obstacles they must make an extra roll to get past them. Sometimes loosing a turn, or having to turn around and find another path. When players encounter monsters they must reference the Monster's card to see how to defeat them. Examples are an opposing roll of the the die, rolling an odd number, rolling 7 or higher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
