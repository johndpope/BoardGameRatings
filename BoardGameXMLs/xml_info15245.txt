							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frantic Ants</name>
									
			<description>This game features a moving, battery operated track that marches the player's ants uphill and downhill towards the finish line. Each player has 5 plastic ants. On your turn, you spin the spinner and follow its instructions. If you spin a 1, 2 or 3, you place an ant on the first step of the first, second or third anthill respectively. The ant will begin &amp;quot;climbing&amp;quot; to the top of the hill and slide down the other side (where it starts climbing the next hill). If you spin a Short Cut, move an ant ahead to the Short Cut space. If you spin an Anteater, remove an opponents ant from the track and return it to that player. If you spin ZZZZZZZZ, you're asleep and skip your turn. Since all the ants are moving at once, it's best to make your move quickly. The first player to get all 5 ants to slide down the third hill and enter the Finish area wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
