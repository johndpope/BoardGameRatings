							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amundsen: Kappløpet til Sydpolen</name>
									
			<description>A fast to play and easy to teach dice game with a push-your-luck mechanism. Players are racing to be the first to reach the South Pole. The dice are rolled up to three times, while you try to form one of the combinations directly ahead of you on the game board. You can continue moving as long as you dare before setting camp, but if you fail, you must return to your previous camp. Choose your path carefully, and perhaps visit one of your depots to get some additional resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components are language independent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Roll to the South Pole (According to the designer, the games share theme and graphics, but differ in game play, with Amundsen being a light game and Roll to the South Pole being a more strategic affair.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
