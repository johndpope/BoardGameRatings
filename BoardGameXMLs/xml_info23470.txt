			<description>From the publisher's website...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capt'n Pike's Cruising North America is a fun and interesting board game with a nautical theme. Shiver me timbers, it's a totally new concept and there is nothing like it on the seven seas or in the market place. Do you know how many light houses surround Lake Michigan, where is Angel's Gate, how many teeth a shark has, what are your chances of surviving a lighting strike, what is a hawse pipe, where is the Norwegian Riviera, what is a drink water sailor, or who started Chris Craft boats? Find out the answers to theses and over 1000 more while playing Capt'n Pike's Cruising North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your vessel and cruise the West Coast, Gulf Coast, East Coast, Mississippi River system and the Great Lakes while answering nautical questions about weather, navigation, boat handling, marlin spike, seamanship, local points of interest and history. Great fun for all who have owned a boat and dreamed of cruising!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
