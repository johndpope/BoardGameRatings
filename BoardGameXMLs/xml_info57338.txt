			<description>This item was never released as a physical product but instead was made available on the publisher's website as either plain text or rich text format files zipped together with individual pictures of all of the monsters. The book was originally intended for print release, but the Savage Coast line was canceled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description for the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;The Orc's Head Peninsula supplement is part of the SAVAGE COAST setting. It deals with a primitive and barbaric land mass located to the west of the Savage Coast, inhabited primarily by nonhumans. To fully enjoy these adventures, the reader should have the SAVAGE COAST campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
