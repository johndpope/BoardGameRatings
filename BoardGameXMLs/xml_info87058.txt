			<description>NotChess is a game on an 8X* board that is a checker-like game, using pieces called Alternators. Any piece is able to be captured by an opponent whose piece moves onto the square of the piece being captured. (By replacement)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to become the only player remaining on the board. &lt;br/&gt; An Alternator moves as a chess knight when moving from a white square but it moves as a short range chess rook when moving from a black square. A player starts with six pieces on the rank closest to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
