							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bugs &#039;n&#039; Slugs</name>
									
			<description>Race to the finish by correctly answering questions about all those creepy crawly little critters! How long can a cockroach live with its head cut off? How many mosquitoes can a dragonfly eat in one day? The questions are multiple choice or true/false, so even if you don't know the answer, you have a chance of getting it right and learn something along the way! Most of the spaces are question spaces, but some spaces challenge players to complete an activity. For instance, without using your hands or feet, wriggle across the floor like a worm, then ask other players to guess what you are&amp;quot; (which may be awkward if adults are playing the game, but kids would probably find it enjoyable!). Fun and educational, you'll gather a wealth of knowledge about bugs and slugs by the time you reach the end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to be the first to cross the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
