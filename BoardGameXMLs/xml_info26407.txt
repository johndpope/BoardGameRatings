			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fabled elixir of Panacea. Named after the Greek goddess of healing, its properties were to prolong life indefinitely. Alchemists have sought for this cure-all remedy for ages. Finally the time has come for you and your fellow alchemists to put the final pieces together. But only one can be first to call the Gathering of Alchemists and announce the solution to the greatest riddle of all mankind. Eternal fame and glory will be your reward. It is time for the discovery of Panacea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Panacea is a self-released game designed by Jeph Stahl and it was distributed at Great Lakes Games IV for free to attendees. There are 50 numbered copies of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
