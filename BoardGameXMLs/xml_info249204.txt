			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it - Centaurs are cool!  They&amp;rsquo;re strong, they&amp;rsquo;re fast, and even non-centaurs can think they look good.  But if you want to bring them to life in your game world, you need more than &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rsquo;re pretty&amp;rdquo;.  How do they live, where do they live, and how do they fight?  Those are the things a world builder and a game master needs to know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So how about six different centaur societies?  Oh, and plus one for the satyrs and minotaurs.  Sure maybe every centaur culture in the world is exactly the same, you know, just like every human culture is the same in the real world.  (That was sarcasm - we know you got it.)  Different cultures for the centaurs is good, but even better, we give you the back story that explains why.  Do we think you&amp;rsquo;re converting your game world over to ours?  Of course not!  We&amp;rsquo;re world builders; we take a little from everywhere, so you may as well take a little from here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 20 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 41 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
