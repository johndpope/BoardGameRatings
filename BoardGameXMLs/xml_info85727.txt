							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloodline Levels</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bloodline rules are clever, but unsatisfying to many players. Not only do you have to give up one or more character levels (and the Hit Dice and attack and save bonuses that go with them) in order to have a bloodline, you need to decide during character creation how strong your bloodline will eventually be, and if you don't carry through, you suffer a massive XP penalty. Fifth Element Games resolves these issues by adapting our Background Levels mechanics and applying them to bloodlines. Bloodline Levels presents 42 bloodlines, including the 35 standard bloodlines, 5 undead bloodlines and 2 brand new bloodlines: the ettercap and the medusa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
