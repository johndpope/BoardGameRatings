			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME TO CONQUER THE KINGS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was created with two purposes in mind: first, for those of you who already play chess, Conquer the Kings is a fresh, exciting take on the classic game while maintaining the principles of movement and strategy that made the original so beloved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And second, for those of you that may have been intimidated by the original game, Conquer the Kings presents an interesting variance to the original that allows for learning to be had in a friendlier, perhaps more easily digestible manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's most intriguing is that neophytes and experts alike can sit at the same table and, at times and when necessary, join forces to reach the ultimate goal: Conquer the Kings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES CONQUER THE KINGS SO SPECIAL?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2, 3 or 4 players battle at a time (individually or in teams) - You get to talk about your moves too!!! Work together in teams to discuss strategy, or to help out a weaker player.&lt;br/&gt;     Unlimited openings, strategies and styles of play are available&lt;br/&gt;     Pawn Movement arrow - Allows you to move your pawns as a unit;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either Forward, Left/Right Flank or Retreat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player has complete discretion on the initial setup of his/her pieces&lt;br/&gt;     Alliances between players are allowed, and sometimes necessary&lt;br/&gt;     Friendly banter between players is anticipated (but keep it clean!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, who amongst you will be the last one standing? Who amongst you will Conquer the Kings?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
