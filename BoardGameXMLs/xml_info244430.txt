			<description>Each player starts with 25 letter tiles and builds their own color-coded crossword. Players begin by each building a &amp;ldquo;base word&amp;rdquo; that uses all three colors (pink, yellow, and blue). In each following round, after any one player rolls the dice for a &amp;ldquo;color combo,&amp;rdquo; every player connects one new word to their own crossword, matching the color combo rolled. Match the color combo by using any combination of both colors rolled &amp;mdash; and only those colors &amp;mdash; to form your entire new word. The game continues in rounds until the first player to use all their letters in their crossword (and then quickly grab both dice) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different ways to play: &amp;ldquo;Standard&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Express.&amp;rdquo; Standard has a relaxed pace of play, while Express is a fast-paced word race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
