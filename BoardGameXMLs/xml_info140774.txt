							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stack &#039;em up Stan</name>
									
			<description>A family game for 2 or more players.  It must be played on a hard and level surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to stack the objects as high as possible using only the mechanical figure &amp;ldquo;Stan&amp;rdquo;.  The lifting operation is performed by deploying a trigger on Stan&amp;rsquo;s back.  Players take it in turn to add one object to the stack.  After rolling the dice, the player must use Stan to lift the current stack, maneuver it and balance it on top of the item depicted.  If the stack should fall, the current player is eliminated from the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player remaining is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
