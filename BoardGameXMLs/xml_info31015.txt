			<description>A new and exciting way to play with words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this ever-changing, two player game of fast &amp;amp; furious world building fun, players race to make the highest scoring word from the 7 SCRABBLE letter cubes. it's a real tug of words! You must think quickly - once your opponent calls, you only have 15 seconds to find a higher scoring word - spot it, and you get to move the shuttle one space towards your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly all the cubes move, and there's a new set of letters !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
