							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Original Gangsta&#039;</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've been with the gang since you were a kid, and even before you joined back when you were just a little vato, you dreamed of wearing the colors. You joined the gang with the same fervor that patriots join the military, ready to live and die to defend your few blocks of turf, your small time drug empire and your homies. Prison hardened you, and as you took on mission after bloody mission for the gang, your status and reputation only increased. Now, you're on the verge of being an OG, a shot caller, one of the old school bangers that give orders to the up and comers and live a life of hard won respect. You're still tough enough, crazy enough for the street, and still ready to grab your iron at the first sign of disrespect or danger. This 5 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Sanctuary: City of Secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
