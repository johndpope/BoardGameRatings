			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THRILLING TALES: Suddenly The Door Bursts In!, written by Shannon Kalvar, is the premiere release in Adamant Entertainment's new series of short THRILLING TALES products, each describing a single encounter that can be dropped into any pulp-genre adventure to spice things up! Each release contains a brief encounter, a discussion of how characters might interact with it, and an array of elements you can introduce to further complicate the situation. You can use the supplement to jump-start a stalled situation, or as a jumping-off point for an entirely new adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first release is based on the famous quote from pulp author Raymond Chandler: &amp;quot;When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional user information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure has later been re-published in the compilation Suddenly... Encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
