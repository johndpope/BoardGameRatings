							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mech Force: International Defense League</name>
									
			<description>In Mech Force, each player takes on the role of a Mech warrior, whose purpose is to defend the planet from an invading force. Warriors do this by upgrading their mechs using mech modifications (or mods) and obtaining Combat dice to take into battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each successful engagement will earn the warrior Victory Points (VPs), Enemy Cards (EC) and resources. As their VPs increase, they&amp;rsquo;ll gain access to new skills which will give them the edge against the enemy (and other players.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be aware, some enemies will be too powerful to take on alone so players will need to work together. But how much and with who is up to each warrior, as a problem shared means half the reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be too greedy though, if the threat level climbs too high, Earth will be overrun and everyone loses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
