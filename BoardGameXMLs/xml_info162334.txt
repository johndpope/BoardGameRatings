							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Super Powers: Boost Patches</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most super power sources have dangerous side effects and are permanent. Boost Patches are the exact opposite, instantly providing superpowers for a limited duration without consequence, as long as the user doesn&amp;rsquo;t activate more than one patch at a time. Used by many of the missing heroes and villains, Boost Patches are now found in many bases. Highly valued on the black market, base raiders must choose between selling them or keeping them for their own use. One patch can turn a normal person into a powerful superhuman, at least for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement allows you to add Boost Patches to your game of Base Raiders. It includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     14 Boost Patches, each with a new super power &amp;ndash; gain telepathy, super strength, and more!&lt;br/&gt;     New Loot rules, including guidelines to determine the value of a super power source&lt;br/&gt;     Design your own Boost Patches&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure Seed: The Lost Treasure of the Candy Man, as featured on the [rpgpodcastepisode=120286 RPPR Actual Play Podcast].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
