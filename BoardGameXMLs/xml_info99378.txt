							<name  sortindex="1">Mr Turnip&#039;s TV Audition Card Game</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Turnip&#039;s Audition</name>
									
			<description>This may be the first British game linked to a TV character. A card game about set collecting but with a difference. As well as the cards and rules in the box, there is a clock with movable hands.&lt;br/&gt;A set is at least two cards, a Portrait card (of a character from the show) and an Audition card (with a time on it). Thus you can only claim a trick if the Time element is the same as the clock currently shows.&lt;br/&gt;The clock starts at 9.00 a.m.. The first player may lay down a set if he also has the correct time. Then the second player has the same opportunity, and so on round the table. However, if a player does not have a set to display, he draws a card from the deck and the clock is moved on one hour. Now the next player has to have a set that includes the new time, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
