							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Von Bottom&#039;s Hoard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A zany and dangerous mansion-crawl that pits players against a small army of maids, butlers, and a fat baron sitting atop a dragon's hoard with a blunderbuss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Baron Augustus Von Bottom was given his title and lands for slaying the mighty red dragon Incinerax and claiming his hoard for himself. He lived as a prosperous and kind noble for many years, but the seemingly never-ending pile of gold soon began to drive him mad&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;He now suffers from dragon sickness; from a combination of the sickening draw of the dragon's gold, and over a year of eating dragon meat. He's grown fat, crazy, and has gone to ridiculous and absurd lengths to protect his mountain of gold&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;He lives in a grand manor to the north with his dozens of maids and butlers. Rumour of his cruel nature and tremendous wealth have reached you. Only you can stop his madness, and claim his 300,000gp gold pile for yourselves!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is open ended, procedurally generated, and has over 15 fully fleshed out NPC's to fight/befriend/betray/romance/save! Plus, over 18 pieces of custom art!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Open ended design and multiple endings ensure this adventure is never quite the same way twice.&lt;br/&gt;    15+ weird and unique NPCs to help or hinder the heroes, including a dog-riding wildman, a baby dragon, a gorgeous elven butler, a demented patisserie, and a princess polymorphed into a cat.&lt;br/&gt;    An enormous dungeon map with 30 rooms of traps and treasure.&lt;br/&gt;    Compatible with all d20-based roleplaying games, including Dungeon World, Pathfinder, D&amp;amp;D (all editions), Labyrinth Lord, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
