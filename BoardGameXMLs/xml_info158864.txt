			<description>A game where each player fullfills as many emergency orders he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each new order determines the address of the emergency, what kind of vehicle(s) that is needed (fire truck, ambulance or crane), the situation, the task and if there is a delay or not. The players take their corresponding vehicle(s) and moves on a cardboard board with a die roll. If more than one vehicle is needed, the task cannot be accomplished before all vehicles have arrived on the spot. Vehicles are returned to base afterwards, but new emergency calls may come on the way there (die = 1).&lt;br/&gt;If an opponent's vehicle is closer to the address, and that vehicle is not currently on a mission, you can require the vehicle as your own for the mission. This vehicle could be called back if the owner needs it for an emergency of his own, but only if the vehicle is not busy with a patient (in an ambulance) or wrecked car (on the crane).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each order gives 1-3 points if fullfilled. Winner is the player with most points when there are no more order cards (24).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 cardboard board with a city map&lt;br/&gt;24 emergency order cards&lt;br/&gt;12 rubber cars in 4 colors&lt;br/&gt;1 die&lt;br/&gt;1 rule sheet pasted on the back of the box lid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game share some similarities with the later MB game: The Emergency! Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
