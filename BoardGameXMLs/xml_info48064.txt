							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sarcophagus Legion</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sultan Mehmet rules his desert kingdom with absolute power, save for the trackless wastes of the interior where the authority of his army and bureaucrats holds no sway. The nomadic dervishes that call this inhospitable sea of sand their home recognize no authority greater than the warlord who leads their individual band. The two people are effectively at war, and have been for centuries. Recently, Sultan Mehmet&amp;rsquo;s beautiful wife Syriana fell into the grasp of the dervishes when the caravan with which she was traveling came under attack. Now, her desperate and humiliated husband has turned to courageous and resourceful adventurers to see to it that she is returned safe and unharmed. The Chasm of the Damned is designed for 4-6 characters of levels 2-4 and is compatible with 1st Edition gaming.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
