			<description>16 Memories is a memory game with 3 different ways to play and 7 different tile sets to play with.  Although the three game variants are different, they all give you 1 minute to memorize what's printed on 16 different tiles, then test your ability to remember what's on each tile after they've been flipped face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first variant has players bid to the right to try to recall what's on each face-down tile.  The second variant has players move a shared pawn along the tiles, tying to recall what's on the tile the pawn lands on.  The third variant has all players write down what they can remember, then comparing answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 Memories is a game for two to four players, although you could probably play it with five.  16 Memories uses a pawn, a die, a one minute timer, a custom board, and a custom set of tiles. A four-player game takes about 5 minutes to play.  16 Memories is  appropriate for Ages 7 and up, but all the players should be age-peers (A parent against several children would have an unfair advantage.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
