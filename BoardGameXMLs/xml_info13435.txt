							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vive la difference! de Remy Martin</name>
									
			<description>Remy Martin produce Cognac and this promotional game, published with Ravensburger, is for the connoisseur and bon vivant amongst you (them that knows a bit and likes a good dinner).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a roll &amp;amp; move tour around Europe, trying to land on the given city and answer a quiz question. Players collect gourmet cards and coins, worth victory points. Answering questions correctly allows players to make jumps around Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production is superb, all in the style of Remy Martin's luxurious corporate packaging of black with red &amp;amp; gold highlights. The map of Europe is black with gold lines, the cards are black with photos of delicious meals, the dice are black &amp;amp; gold. Even the box inlay is black velvet. The player's tokens are casks, the city marker is a tiny cognac bottle in a clear plastic case. And the 20 golden coins, held in a small leather pouch, are proper weighty metal coins, stamped with grapes and the company's logo and date 1724.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book (a full color magazine) has rules in French, English, German, Dutch, Italian &amp;amp; Spanish. The rest of the booklet is a lavish product promotion, showing how the cognac is made and the product range. All in all, a nice bit of promo for both Remy Martin &amp;amp; harmony in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
