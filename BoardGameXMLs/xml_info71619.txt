							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Werewolf of Europe</name>
									
			<description>Adventure 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northern Europe, 1 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pale, full moon begins to rise, heralding another night of terror in the small, isolated village of Tharn Grivet. You, along with your hastily assembled comrades, check your seemingly useless weapons before posting guards and going to bed. Laying on your raised pallet, your mind is filled with the horror that grips this place. Somewhere, nearby a monster, virtually immune to weapons and magic alike, is waiting to kill again. Each morning brings the discovery of a new, mangled body, today the victim had been one of your comrades who had been guarding in the predawn hours. Suddenly the night is shattered by a shrill howling. Grimly determined and sickeningly afraid, you leap from your bed, grab your pitiful weapons, and move out into the erie night. As your small group assembles their faces are filled with resolve. There have been too many deaths already, there can be no more. Tonight, for better or for worse, you will find .... the WEREWOLF of Europe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
