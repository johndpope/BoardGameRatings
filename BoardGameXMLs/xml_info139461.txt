							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Priests of Shadowglade</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernatural suspense, horror, and action await the unwary in Shadowglade! 500 years ago, the world ended. More than that, it was forgotten, the minds of those alive scoured clean of knowledge, history, and identity. In the intervening years, society has rebuilt as best it could, new alliances have been forged and blood-sworn enemies made as the surviving nations have begun to rediscover their roots. Out in the wilds and darkness, however, not all that lurks is friendly...or human...or even alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faith is paramount in a world lost in darkness, and no world is darker than that of Shadowglade. The priests of the realm represent a great many faiths, but all have a singular goal: to bring peace to their flock, wherever they may be and whatever trials they may face.&lt;br/&gt;The Priest is a 20-level class written for use in the Shadowglade campaign setting but suitable for other settings as well. Essentially a divine bard, the priests of Shadowglade offer support to the downtrodden, words of encouragement and, with the righteous fire of their faith, condemnation of those who would harm their charges. Included in this booklet are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Levels 1 - 20 for the Priest! While Shadowglade operates with a strong Epic 10 recommendation, all players interested in the class should be able to play it anywhere!&lt;br/&gt;     Favored Class Options, Traits, and Defects! Small hooks, but strong additions to the right back story, several hooks in the form of class options, traits, and defects are included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
