			<description>Cat People is a card game for 3 - 5 players that will put you in the role of cat lovers. Through every round you will experience hilarious situations, you will adopt cats and will constantly play with them. But watch out! If you gather five felines, you will become an erratic and babbling crazy cat person, and you won&amp;rsquo;t be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the match you will deal with a max of 5 cards in your hand. In these cards, you will find events, adorable kittens and rebel kittens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each event card has a unique and special rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adorable kittens are loving felines willing to help you throughout the adventure by activating a special trick every time you play with them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By contrast, rebel kittens are sullen animals, territorial, or simply chaotic. They always go against you by activating their special trick if you refuse to play with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, there are also job cards that will grant you unique professional skills and toys for your kittens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win, you need to take advantage of your event cards in a way that benefits you as a player, while simultaneously overwhelming the rest of the players with kittens. When a player gathers five kittens, he or she will turn into the crazy cat person. The crazy cat person will receive no benefits from his or her job card resulting in victory being unachievable. Instead this player will now have the ability to throw cats at normal people, taking revenge from the players that led to his or her state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one able to keep him or herself mentally sane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
