			<description>Players can learn and test spatial perception. A map is seen from above. Players play simultaneously. A 'view card' is shown and all players no try to determine as quickly as possible from which area of the map this 'view card' could be seen from. The first player to grab the pawn and place it on a spot can check the back of the 'view card' to see if it was correct. If the player was right he/she can keep the 'view card'. The player with the most 'view cards' after all 48 cards have been collected wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
