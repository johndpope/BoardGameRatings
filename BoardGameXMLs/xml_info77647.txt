			<description>Digimon World DS (デジモンストーリー Dejimon Sutōrī/Digimon Story) is a role-playing video game and the first Digimon game for the Nintendo DS. The original Japanese name of the game is Digimon Story. The game bears a resemblance to Digimon World 3, features 300 Digimon, and uses Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to match Digimon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player assumes the role of a Digimon tamer and embarks on a journey to discover, tame, raise, train and command more than 230 unique Digimon. Unlike most of the character collection-driven games in the series, Digimon World DS's gameplay continues after the character collection is completed. The player can build Digi-Farms to raise, evolve and communicate with the Digimon. Using Wi-Fi and local DS wireless connection, players can interact by exchanging Digimon, engaging in battles, and pooling resources to create rare types of Digimon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digimon World DS marks the first appearance of several Digimon, some that later appear in Digimon Savers, like Gawappamon, the evolution of Kamemon. Chronomon Destroyer Mode/Chronomon Holy Mode, the game's final boss, also makes his first appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game introduces two special Digimon, DotAgumon and DotFalcomon, both of which have the appearance of sprites which look like their V-Pet counterparts. These Digimon seem to have no special qualities except for useful traits, and being able to be degenerated back into their In-Training forms, then evolve into more powerful Digmon. The forms for the Digimon are in-training, rookie, champion, ultimate, and mega.[&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Digimon World DS,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
