							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mobile Infantry Field Manual</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mobile Infantry Field Manual is an update to the Starship Troopers Roleplaying Game, and all rules within should be considered to replace those in the main rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, trooper. By making the choice to put the safety of the body politic above that of your own, you have demonstrated the qualities necessary to becoming a citizen of the Federation. After your term of service, you will be granted many privileges due to a citizen and be permitted to wield political authority, shaping this great Federation as it reaches out to span the stars!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you join the Mobile Infantry, you are no mere foot soldier. By putting your trust in the Federation, you also receive a guarantee that you will never be assigned to combat duty unless it is absolutely necessary. You can also be sure that the officer giving you orders, and thus risking your life, will be dropping into the combat zone with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are now part of the greatest military machine ever developed. Your armour and weapons are the best the Federation has to offer and, unlike the militaries of old, has not been developed by the lowest bidder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have the tools. You have the training. Now go protect the Federation from our enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
