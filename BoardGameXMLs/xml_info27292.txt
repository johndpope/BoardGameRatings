			<description>&amp;quot;Windkracht 10&amp;quot; was in 1997-98 a rather successful Belgian TV series on a &amp;quot;search and rescue&amp;quot; team located in the military base at Koksijde on the Belgian coast. This family boardgame was published in 2006 to accompany the launch of the unavoidable movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game simulates the rescue missions. The board divides the Belgian coast and part of the sea in sectors. You have to respond to an SOS, pick up the survivors with one of the six helicopters and transport them to a nearby hospital corresponding with your playing color. The helicopters can be moved by all the players. Each player decides in secret how many spaces each chopper will move. You gain points for each successful delivery (the number of points depends on the mission). After a fixed amount of missions, the player with the most points wins. Event cards spice up the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 6 cardboard &amp;quot;3D&amp;quot; Seeking rescue-choppers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
