			<description>On a star-shaped board divided into a grid of 300 equilateral triangles, players take turns to place irregularly-shaped pieces (pentiamonds) of their color.  When no more pieces can be placed, players score points for each chain of pieces of their color which connects two or more vertices of the star.  (Adjacent pieces in a chain need not share an edge:  touching at a corner suffices.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAX also comes with a set of 44 tangram-style puzzles, consisting of outline shapes which the solver must reproduce by assembling the game pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
