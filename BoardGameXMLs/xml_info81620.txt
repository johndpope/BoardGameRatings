			<description>Overview from game designer:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attercop is a new board game where two players take on the roles of Attercop and Meratoo. Meratoo is the hapless spider who must cross the web of Attercop. Meratoo, must gently feel his way across the web before being caught. Hidden, Attercop stalks - probing, deceiving, sneaking for her prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's devious, it's cunning, it's sneaking good fun !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How the game is played, from game designer :-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attercop is a game for two players. One player is Attercop, a spider with a reputation for cunning, and a lady with an appetite. The other is Meratoo, a little spider nervously trying to cross her web. The aim of the game is for Meratoo to make his way from one side of the web to the other, whilst Attercop tries to catch him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web consists of 44 connected points, each covered by a &amp;quot;blank&amp;quot; tile.  Meratoo travels from blank tile to blank tile, gently feeling his way accross the Web trying to avoid running into Attercop. Meanwhile, Attercop has a number of tiles to represent her legs, which tease the web and try to bluff the Meratoo player into her grasp, by being able the change the position of the tiles on the web. Here's the catch: the Attercop tiles remain face-down on the web, undistinguishable from the blank tiles, and they can be moved along with the rest of the web tiles. This is how Attercop probes her way around the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Attercop the game is all about bluffing and enticing Meratoo into her grasp. For Meratoo it is all about staying alert, testing the web and calling Attercop's bluff. The game is fun to play, generates lots of laughs , is a light-hearted and quick game, and is great for both kids and adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
