			<description>So you wanna be a Superhero&amp;hellip; is an adventure game where you get to play an aspiring hero attempting to save the world. From the moment your hero steps out of his home, he will be righting wrongs by investigating suspicious activity, arresting bad guys and otherwise protecting the good citizens of Big City.&lt;br/&gt; It won&amp;rsquo;t be easy, as a matter of fact, the bad guys are as tough or tougher than your hero, especially in the beginning. And although he&amp;rsquo;ll likely not win every encounter, he will learn from his mistakes and grow stronger and stronger.  Eventually, he&amp;rsquo;ll be powerful enough to rid the city of all 7 supervillain bosses and save the world, well, at least he&amp;rsquo;ll save Big City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you wanna be a Superhero&amp;hellip; features 61 supervillains, 4 Hero characters and their respective markers, a rule book, 4 six-sided dice and a map of Big City. Encounters and missions are assigned by die-rolling and chart lookup. It is incredibly unlikely that two games would ever be the same. The combat system features &amp;lsquo;exploding&amp;rsquo; sixes allowing super-powered possibilities. There is experienced-based character building, nosey reporters, dedicated sidekicks, worshiping fans, and useful gadgets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you wanna be a Superhero? Do you have what it takes? There are crimes to investigate and criminals to round up. There are supervillains running amuck and you are the only hope for justice and protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what you got, Hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
