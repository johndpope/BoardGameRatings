			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Collect 5 matching Fruitz from the Seed Pile, the Good Soil Pile, or another person to fill up your row!  When the Fruitz have been pick, the person with the greatest Harvest wins!  Try to avoid the deceitful and wicked Sinful Nature card or you could be in a jam.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fruitz of the Spirit is a set collection game of set collection.  Cards display pictures of various fruits and are named for virtues mentioned in Galatians 5:13-23.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to collect as many sets of five matching cards as possible from a total of nine different card types.  Each player starts with five face-down cards.  They turn one up at a time, and may take the card from the face-up draw pile if it matches or draw a face-down card.  They may also take any matching cards that any other players have face-up.  A Sinful Nature card causes the player to lose a turn. When a player makes a set of five of the same card, known as an orchard, he may harvest the orchard by turning the cards upside-down and setting them aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the draw pile is exhausted.  The player with the most harvested orchards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
