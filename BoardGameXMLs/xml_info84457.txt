			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embark on an incredible mission, but beware!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Dr. Rex Ronan as he shrinks to perform high-tech laser surgery on Jake Westboro - who suffers from long-term tobacco use. Use Rex's laser scalpel to vaporize tar, plaque, phlegm, and pre-cancerous cells. Stop a heart attack and remove nicotine addiction before it's too late! Defend Rex against Microbots implanted to thwart his mission, using the laser scalpel and martial arts moves. Follow the path of smoke and nicotine. Discover the harmful effects of tobacco use, make headlines with Rex and save Jake's life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supported by grants from the U.S. Public Health Service Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and the State of California Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
