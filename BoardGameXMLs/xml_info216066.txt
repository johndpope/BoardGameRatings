							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Warfare &#039;47</name>
									
			<description>Dust Warfare '47 is the latest incarnation of the Dust Warfare miniatures game. It is a fast-playing tabletop miniatures game set in an alternate history of WWII, in which alien technology has changed the nature of warfare in the era. The Axis, Allies, and Sino-Soviet Union (SSU) fight not only for their peoples' political goals, but also to secure the coveted vK alien technology used to power their war machines. Players build armies of 28mm scale miniatures and face one another on an open-table top using measure tape and specialized dice. Dust is a game of strategic planning, tactical maneuvering, and dramatic firefights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dust Warfare '47 is a community-driven game that picks up where the original Dust Warfare left off. New units have been added, existing units have been re-balanced, and core rules have been tweaked. While the official version of Dust (Dust 1947) which is published by Dust Studios is now the only sold version of the game, Dust Warfare '47 is officially sponsored by Dust Studios but maintained by the community. To play Dust Warfare '47 simply requires the same miniatures used for the official Dust 1947 game and a free set of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
