			<description>From Publisher Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flip 'n Link Time is an engaging and action-packed strategy game. Players explore time in three forms: digital, analog and written word. Simply match the analog clock or word time on the game cards to the digital time on the appropriate playing piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, a player must strategically create a link of five playing pieces. But there's a trick! Players must plan ahead to avoid being trapped by their opponents and having their playing pieces flipped to the opponent's side. The action continues until one of the players creates a link. Players win with clever strategies and a bit of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
