			<description>Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, Sweet Home follows a team of five people who venture into the deserted mansion of the deceased Ichir≈ç Mamiya to photograph and restore his frescoes. Upon entering the house, the door locks behind them and the group discovers that the mansion is haunted by Lady Mamiya, among other creatures. The player guides the five characters, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, around the mansion, trying to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features randomly encountered battles which the controlled character or party of characters must fight or run away from. If a character dies in battle, he or she cannot be revived throughout the course of the game. The five characters have a specific skill that is necessary to complete the game, although items that serve the same purpose can be found if one of the characters dies. For example, should Akiko (the team's nurse) die, the team may find Pill Bottles which can be used to heal ailments. Depending on how the player ends the game, there are a total of five different endings the player may receive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sweet Home (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
