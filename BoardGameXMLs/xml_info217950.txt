			<description>Are you ready for Act II? Play as iconic characters as you challenge players to a Battle of Strength or a Battle of Wits using Shakespearean insults and the art of bluffing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steal The Show! is a race to collect five comedy masks, and the first player to do so wins. If a player receives five tragedy masks first, however, they're eliminated from the game. In more detail, each player takes on the role of a character. Characters have unique gameplay abilities as well as a strength value (used in a Battle of Strength) and a wit value (used in a Battle of Wits). One location card is always in play and changes throughout the course of the game; location cards modify the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards (Insults) are used during battle to enhance the strength and wit value of the character as well as insert some trickery to mix! Don't forget bluffing! Players can use bluffing techniques to assist with a numerical boost as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steal The Show! Act II: Theatrical Party Card Game is a standalone expansion for Steal The Show! that features new characters, new locations, and new actions/insults that can be played on their own or in combination with the first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
