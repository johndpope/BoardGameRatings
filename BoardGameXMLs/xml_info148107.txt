			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Power Room and Computer Room is a full-color, 40 x 20 inch, floor plan of a Power Room and a Computer Room, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card version contains ten, double-sided card tiles. Each over-sized tile is 8&amp;rdquo;x10&amp;rdquo; and printed on sturdy 12 point card stock. The UV coating on the tiles keeps them spill resistant, lets you peel transparent tape on and off them without damaging the tile, and allows you to mark the tiles with dry wipe markers then wipe them clean. As you can see in the images below, the card version has the square grid overlay on one side and the hex grid overlay on the other side. We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out. The full layout map is not included with the printed card pages to reduce their cost to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Time for a data transfer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Power Room and the Computer Room is a triple room map of a power and computer room with a small connecting corridor and security desk in between them. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Power Room and the Computer Room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rooms can either be used together in a set or used on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Power Room and the Computer Room are intended for use in near or far future science games. These rooms are suitable for use in a starship, star port, or space station as the station&amp;rsquo;s or ship&amp;rsquo;s power and computation centers. The power room can be used in an industrial complex or factory on a planet. The computer room could be used as a server room or secret government facility for storing data on a planet. The computer room could also make an excellent library in a far future game. These rooms could be adapted to a modern setting as advanced cutting edge power stations or data storage for a government or corporation.&lt;br/&gt;The computer room makes a tempting target if it holds secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One scenario is a group of rebels, a rival corporation, or enemy space federation of the government, corporation, or space federation keeping the data a secret make a bold attack on the facility that holds the computer room. They attack the facility by boarding a spaceship or space station or by making a sneak attack on a planet-side factory by attacking it from the outside. Once they get to the computer room, they use their hackers to extract the secret information and then have the hackers plant a computer virus. They then proceed to the power room and shut down the power to remove any automated defenses that would hinder their escape. With the power off, they make their escape with the information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters need to stop the attack from outside or the enemy space marines boarding the ship and then get the power back online. Once they get the power back on, they get a nasty surprise. The hackers put a computer virus into the computer station that activates on reboot. Now the Player Characters need to stop the computer virus from erasing all the data from the memory banks. After all this, the attackers have a major head start but the Player Characters must hunt them down to retrieve the stolen data. This sets up a chase or investigation scene, as they need to try and find them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
