			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the height of Araby&amp;rsquo;s Golden Age, scientists and magicians experimented openly with mystical relics and the elements of the earth to unlock the secrets of longevity, prosperity, and knowledge. While Alchemists were naturally reluctant to share all of their findings, some results were coded into arcane books that helped move everyone closer to the ultimate truths of the universe. Even so, the prestige of unlocking nature&amp;rsquo;s secrets through experimentation and the honor of achieving one&amp;rsquo;s great work, was enough to inspire intense competition among the great minds of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alchemea is a reimagining of the designer's game Magnum Opus. When those rights reverted back to the designer in 2016, Daily Magic Games sought him out with an idea to streamline his 300-card deck builder into a 104-card tableau management game that retained all of the flavor and unique experimentation concepts from the original with added player control and set in the amazing world of Daily Magic's Merchants of Araby game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Alchemea, players take on the roles of Alchemists in the mythical land of Araby. Each player builds a tableau called their &amp;quot;Laboratory&amp;quot; where they practice trade skills to earn funds to gather mystical and elemental materials for their experiments. Those materials are cross referenced on the game's unique &amp;quot;Discovery Matrix&amp;quot; to determine the outcome of the experiment and to reveal a secret piece of knowledge to help the player in future experiments. The 3x3 matrix is set up randomly so each game you play will be different and the optional Alchemist role cards add even more replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, the players earn prestige for their discoveries and accomplishments and there are multiple paths to victory. Do you concentrate on finding the hidden formula to create the Magnum Opus, or do you seek a more grounded path in medicines and base metal transmutations? Will you collect all of the secret books of knowledge or wait for others to blaze the trail and win through skillful application of their discoveries?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, the alchemist with the greatest prestige will become the Chief Alchemist to the Caliph of Araby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
