							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Potlatch</name>
									
			<description>Four of the oldest families of the great Kwakwaka'wakw tribe have gathered for the biggest Potlatch ever assembled.  For eight days and nights, there will be carving, rituals, and most important: gifting.  The family giving the most gifts at the end of each day is granted the Speaking Stick, letting that family decide the course of the next day's festivities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Great Potlatch, players control the actions of one of these four families for eight rounds to earn the respect of their fellow tribesmen.  At the end of the festival, the family who accomplishes the most will lead the tribe until the next Great Potlatch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;6 Wooden Role Markers (2 each: Shaman, Elder, Carver)&lt;br/&gt;1 Wooden Speaking Stick Marker&lt;br/&gt;48 Potlatch Cards&lt;br/&gt;20 Totem Pole Cards&lt;br/&gt;4 Ancestor Cards&lt;br/&gt;24 Wooden Potlatch Markers (6 in each player color)&lt;br/&gt;1 Day/Night Card and Wooden Marker&lt;br/&gt;16 Wooden Bad Reputation Markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available from Small Box Games November 2008.&lt;br/&gt;The Great Potlatch&lt;br/&gt;3-4 Players&lt;br/&gt;Ages 10 and up&lt;br/&gt;45 Minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was later revised as Potlatch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
