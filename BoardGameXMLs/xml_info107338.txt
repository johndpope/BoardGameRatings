			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is all about how kids are the only ones who can save the day, and wrangle the zombies that have invaded their town. It is presented in a third-person view. There are four characters from which to choose (all can be used in co-op), and each has their own style of &amp;quot;weapons&amp;quot;. Cash is earned when you turn in your catches. This cash can be used to buy powerups during the game. There are 20 missions and most require the player to capture a certain number of zombies. Some levels also unleash a boss that must be defeated. The overall feel of the game is that it is designed to appeal to younger gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-player can either be co-op or competitive and is able to be played locally or via the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
