							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Loadouts: Monster Hunters</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When sinister forces assemble and speed is of the essence, those who stand against the darkness don't have time to go shopping. These brave souls need GURPS Loadouts: Monster Hunters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This book contains ready-to-go packages of gear -- weapons, protection, and equipment -- from GURPS High-Tech, GURPS High-Tech: Pulp Guns, Volume 1, and Pulp Guns, Volume 2 (which are required to make full use of this book). Loadouts are designed for heroic roles at two different budgets and in two eras. All packages are complete, so getting locked and loaded is as simple as picking the gear that fits your budget and weight allowance. And each loadout includes lenses for further customization. Whether you're a slayer, scout, or sage . . . in TL6 or TL8 . . . on a budget or money is no object, this book has what you need:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;* Optional rules for gear and guns, including new rules for those wanting more oomph from existing ammunition. (When you're in a monster movie, bigger ammo is better!)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;* A selection of new weapons and equipment that are especially useful for those who hunt creatures of the night.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;* A 13-page appendix of equipment lists, with the information formatted so that it's ready to print and include with your own character sheets.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Let the forces of darkness cling to the shadows -- now you've got the flashlight and flares to find them, the right weapons to take them down, and the chalk to draw outlines of the bodies.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
