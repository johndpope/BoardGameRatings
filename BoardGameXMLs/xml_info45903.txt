			<description>AssassinX is a short RPG of bloody murder and violence, written in a 24 hour fit of pique. This free download contains some explicit language descibing violence and several uses of generally inapropriate swearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AssassinX is a short RPG of gory violence where the players take on the roles of professional (or not quite so professional) killers with a job to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes full rules for designing a deadly and unhinged killing machine, and then throwing it into a nihilistic nightmare of murder and mayhem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play is a pencil, 2 ten-sided dice, a few friends you can trust not to call the cops on you, and your own sick imagination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entirety of this fully playable RPG was designed, written and laid out in 24 hours. There are some typographical errors and other mistakes that have remained because of the short time frame, but they have been left in to preserve the status of the game after the first 24 hours of development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
