							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Memory Challenge: The Wizard of Oz 75th Anniversary Collector&#039;s Edition</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Celebrate 75 years of the classic and beloved film The Wizard of Oz, with the world's most popular matching game! Players match their favorite Picture Cards from a variety of categories including characters, film scenes and objects from the film. Wicked Witch of the West Cards are non-matching and give a positive or negative strategic directive. New Character Cards allow players to assume the role of one of their favorite characters from the film. Each Character Card has a bonus symbol that also appears on 1 match of Picture Cards. If you make the match with your character's bonus symbol, you get a onetime positive move. The player with the most matches at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
