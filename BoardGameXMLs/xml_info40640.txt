			<description>Amore is a game for word lovers.  The deck has 108 cards: in each suit, the whole alphabet plus a second set of vowels; and 4 jokers.  Rarer letters are worth more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the main Amore game, players are dealt a 9-card hand, and there are two rounds where each may discard 1-3 cards in exchange for new ones, similar to draw poker.  Then they score the highest-scoring words they can find.  Finally there is a bonus round, where hands are passed to the right, and those who can find a higher-scoring word than the original owner earn double the difference in points.  The game ends when the deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for Amore versions of Solitaire, Poker, Rummy, and &amp;quot;Crazy Aitches&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
