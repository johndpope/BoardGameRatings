							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">White Magic (D20)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White is the colour of the spirit. Studying it grants the student the power of foresight and other extra sensory perceptions, as well as great influence over the those that exist outside the material realm. The magic even allows the mage to call on spiritual and extra-dimensional entities to directly intervene in the material world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most gifted of White Mages are Oracles. Their sensory powers are far beyond those of others, and their words and Visions are able to descry the fate of empires or even entire worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Clerical or Mystical domains &lt;br/&gt;    a linked reclassification of one twelfth of the spells of the players handbook, with some new spell effects to fit the spells into Chromatic Magic Theory &lt;br/&gt;    a whole new character class, the Oracle. This spellcaster is gifted with Extra sensory perceptions, and a great command over White magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
