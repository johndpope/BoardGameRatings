							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Prep Academy Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher: &amp;quot;Princess Sofia is new to Royal Prep Academy where she is learning the way of a princess. She's lost her dance shoes, teapot, schoolbook, and other valuables, all around the enchanted building. Help her find her prized school supplies, and discover fun lessons from the Good Fairies along the way.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a hide and seek game for 2 players. Princess Sofia (the seeker) tries to find the supplies that the hider is hiding around the academy. The hider draws from a stack consisting of different supplies, some of Sofia's friends, and a wildcard lucky guess card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the hider draws one of the supplies, it is hidden by having the seeker cover their eyes or look away from the game play area. The hider then hangs the item behind one of the many windows. The seeker then spins the spinner to determine how many &amp;quot;peeks&amp;quot; behind different windows they will get (1-4 peeks are possible).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a Sofia friend is drawn, the hider shows the seeker which window the friend is behind, and this encourages the seeker to use their memory so they don't search behind those windows on future turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, if a wildcard/guessing card is drawn, the hider selects one of the supplies and hides it in their hand. The seeker then gets to guess which item is in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of fun for kids as they hide items and use their memory and luck to find the charms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
