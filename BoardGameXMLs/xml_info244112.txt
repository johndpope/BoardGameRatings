							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Campaign:  North Africa 1941-42</name>
									
			<description>Free print-and-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Division and independent brigade level - few units and fast play - 7.5mis/12kms per hex which is larger than AH's Afrika Korps.  Campaign game has 4 11x17/A3 component mapsheets perfect for the scale.  Campaign game has 45 half-month turns - IIFeb41-IIDec42 - and could be long, but many turns may be spent just fortifying and rebuilding, as historically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also excerpted subgames - gamelets - of individual battles with individual maps for half-hour lunch games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features a preliminary tank vs. (anti-)tank combat (table) customized against the German/Italian panzer/tank regiments/division constants by Allied tank types.  (Allies get to start with British A13 cruisers.  :-) ) Of course, if the 88s score a hit on defense - first, with their long range -  they can (Disrupt or) kill any tank/armoured brigade indiscriminately, especially if it isn't supported by a support group's 88-suppressing artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously Disrupted (during tank/anti-tank phase) panzer/armor units forced to retreat from their battlefield in the following general combat are not recovered - are instead lost/eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise, game is classically simple/abstracted - no airpower (necessary).  Supply is abstracted as well and also modeled by unit replacement/rebuilding abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axis units hidden (except when engaged), unless/until they get to Alamein at which time Monty takes control and the intelligence advantage is reversed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple strategic withdrawal/bugout - &amp;quot;Gazala Gallop,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Matruh Stakes&amp;quot; - rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
