CLIMBING THE WORD PROBLEM TRAILS allows the students to experience these adventures and more, while developing their abilities in understanding the steps that help them determine the answers to word problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reinforce the procedure for solving word problems with the 4 levels of difficulty built into this game appropriate for the earliest levels.
