			<description>From the back of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raiders of a Different Stripe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caravans are being attacked, and this time the assailants aren't goblins, bugbears, or other minions of the Hark. The Half-Elven Renegades have attacked a convoy of wagons, and taken sun elves hostage. Can you find the half-elves hidden stronghold and save the sun elves from a fate worse than death?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nurture and Nature is an adventure for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons (3.5 Edition) game. It can either be played as a stand-alone adventure, or as part of the LGR - Legacy of the Green Regent&amp;trade; campaign offered by the RPGA. Designed to challenge 4th-level D&amp;amp;D heroes, this adventure pits them against a twisted foe using half-elf bandits to further its own twisted ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this adventure, a Dungeon Master also needs the Player's Handbook (D&amp;D 3.5e), the Dungeon Master's Guide (D&amp;D 3.5e) and the Monster Manual (D&amp;D 3.5e). This adventure is set in the Forgotten Realms game world, and it may also be useful, but not necessary, to also have a copy of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario was distributed with a six-page pull-out illustration and handout section and a three page maps pullout section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
