							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red-Handed</name>
									
			<description>From the Manufacturer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can have a &amp;quot;green thumb,&amp;quot; turn &amp;quot;blue in the face,&amp;quot; or be &amp;quot;tickled pink,&amp;quot; but don't get caught Red-Handed. From &amp;quot;blue jeans&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;blackjack,&amp;quot; and from &amp;quot;Yellowstone&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;Red Sea,&amp;quot; Red-Handed is the game where every colorful clue gets you a shade closer to a win. Guess the answer on the game card and your opponents will be &amp;quot;green with envy&amp;quot; as you get to pick from the Score Card pile. Pick a Score Card and you're well on your way to a win! But pick a card with a red hand on it, and you've been caught &amp;quot;Red-Handed!&amp;quot; Luckily, you won't have to cut through any &amp;quot;red tape&amp;quot; to get back in the game. Be the first player to collect five (5) Score cards and you're the 'thumbs up' winner! So &amp;quot;roll out the red carpet&amp;quot; and sharpen your &amp;quot;gray matter&amp;quot; - you've just been &amp;quot;given a green light&amp;quot; to play Red-Handed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
