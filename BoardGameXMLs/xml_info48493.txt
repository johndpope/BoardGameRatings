							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Eastern Bank</name>
									
			<description>There is a place where three titanic Corporations are forced to exist in fatal proximity, locked in a bitter struggle for territory, resources, and dominance. Where uncertain allies and lethal enemies battle from darkened boardrooms to bloodstained streets. Where the balance of power lies upon the edge of a knife. Where the sound of a single gunshot could ignite the fires of war across the entire world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a place where the vestiges of government, desperate to retain control, have forced through devastating new laws that will see you dead for the slightest transgression. Where barely-human killing machines stalk the streets as judge, jury, and executioner. Where there is no appeal, and where you are always being watched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a place where failure is unthinkable, for the repercussions could be disastrous for your Corporation and fatal for you. Where the lethal weight of the law is just one more weapon your rivals will seek to use against you. Where you must fight in the shadows, and leave no trace of your victims. Where you absolutely must not get caught... whatever the cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place is the theatre for your next assignment, Agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Eastern Bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Corporation supplement details everything you could want to know about the lethal Capital Code Zone known as the Eastern Bank, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     UIG forces within the region&lt;br/&gt;     Geography, organisations, personalities and history&lt;br/&gt;     New equipment, trainings, licenses and downtime options&lt;br/&gt;     A range of locations including Spire Cities, underswells and installations&lt;br/&gt;     New system mechanics which present more options for your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
