			<description>NASCAR 09 is the twelfth installment in the EA Sports NASCAR series, it is the sequel to 2007 game NASCAR 08.  Through the career mode, &amp;quot;Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup&amp;quot;, Gordon leads a mentoring program, a new feature offered in NASCAR 09. This is also the third EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system for Mobile phone version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In October 2007, Electronic Arts moved the PlayStation 2 game development to a new studio in North Carolina to be able to get better information with the NASCAR teams in an attempt to improve the game. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were still made at the old studio.  Due to the development team using certain resources to work on key features in the game, no car manufacturers were present in this title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jeff Gordon mentors the player in the new &amp;quot;Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup&amp;quot; career mode that has a completely revamped 3D menu interface. With Jeff's help, the player signs contracts, builds their reputation, and earns performance points by winning in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour (PlayStation 2 only), NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, the NASCAR Nationwide Series, and the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. One new feature in NASCAR 09 is &amp;quot;Own The Track&amp;quot;. This allows the player to compete against friends or other gamers and own all 22 tracks in the Sprint Cup Series. Also new is the new &amp;quot;Sprint Driver Challenge&amp;quot;, in which the player complete challenges in all sorts of situations to earn rep and performance points. In the game there are two driving styles available for the player to choose from: Normal and Pro. The Pro driving style is more suited for experienced players, while the Normal mode is better suited for beginners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, this is the last NASCAR game to be produced by EA, and the last NASCAR game for the PlayStation 2, after suffering from slumping sales, the difficulty of installing new features, and the lack of popularity. In 2009, NASCAR Kart Racing was released, replacing any 2009 installment for the annual series. It may be EA's last game before their exclusive license with NASCAR expires. Yet the door to NASCAR games for the PlayStation 2 has been shut, as Polyphony Digital's Gran Turismo 5 was not featured for the sixth-generation console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For game players in Canada, while the game was still released only in English, the instruction manual and box cover were bilingual, with text in both English and French.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NASCAR 09&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
