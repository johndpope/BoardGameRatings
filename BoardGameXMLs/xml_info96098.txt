							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Party de famille</name>
									
			<description>Music, dance, laughter. What a mood! What a party! Here's your goal: gather as many guests as possible to your family party. Try to create that party atmosphere that only key guests can create, like Gerard and his guitar, or by combining the trainer and his animals. It would not be so difficult if it wasn't for your opponents who will do everything in their power to break your party. Party de famille is a card game with 4 players, played in teams of 2. Overall, try your luck, start your invitations for the best family party ... and let the fun begin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a trick-taking card game. You must bet on how many trick-taking you can make in a round to make points. If you and your partner get it right, you get to count ambiance points, which consist of card combinations, as well as trick-taking points. If you got it wrong, your opponents get the ambiance points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game end when a team reaches 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
