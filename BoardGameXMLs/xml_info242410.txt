							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Museum: The Black Market</name>
									
			<description>Away from prying eyes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Museum is about the wonders of the archaeological world, the light, the colour, the textures of these wonders of history put on display for all to see!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What some don&amp;rsquo;t realise though is that there was a dark underworld that shadowed it. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Black Market, where anything is obtainable&amp;hellip;if you can pay the price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Market is the fourth expansion for Museum and adds a market system to the game where you may purchase Objects and Notoriety cards to complete your collections and harass your adversaries. For those of you looking to put a more aggressive emphasis on the interaction between players in Museum, this is the one for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Objects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 30 object cards featured in the expansion are all from civilisations outside of the ones present in the base game. You&amp;rsquo;ll know them by their rather unique appearance (Images coming shortly) and the fact that they only have one attribute! For example, there&amp;rsquo;s the Viking Longship that will only sport a Navigation Icon or maybe the Terracotta army, the famous guardians of emperor Qin Shi Huang which only counts as a Chinese card? These and many more are purchased exactly like any other object and can give your collections a much needed boost!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Notoriety Cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Museum has always had a pleasant level of player interaction, with each player concentrating on building up their Museum. With these new cards though, you can throw many a wrench in your opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans! Purchased like an object card, they follow exactly the same rules as a standard notoriety card except their effects are much more aggressive. Steal objects, create counterfeits, and steal prestige right out from underneath your opponent&amp;rsquo;s noses! The ends justifies the means!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these new cards will be available on a separate market board . When cards first appear, they&amp;rsquo;ll cost more but as they stick around for longer, their cost will go down. So, do you shell out right from the start or wait for a better price at the risk of having them stolen out from you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Market expansion includes 60 new Contraband cards (objects and Notoriety cards) as well as new characters, events and Notoriety cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
