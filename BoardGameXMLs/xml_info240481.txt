			<description>Susurrus: Season of Tides is a free-to-play story-driven web game of conspiracy and horror in an urban fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed by a design and writing team with unique backgrounds in live-action role-playing games, Susurrus features faction-driven competitive play that rewards players for advancing a chosen cabal&amp;rsquo;s goals, while leaving room for plenty of single-player exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player characters will be transformed into a vampire, werewolf, or mage upon awakening to a hidden magical world that seethes in the shadows of familiar modern life. From there, they&amp;rsquo;ll discover spiderwebs of secrets and conspiracies, survive uncanny beasts and walking nightmares, and build unique powerbases of connections and resources. Players will be joined and aided by a vibrant and diverse cast of NPCs, with whom they can develop personal relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring stunning art from a veteran illustrator and world and character design from one of the most acclaimed theatrical live-action writers in the country, Susurrus: Season of Tides is available on your web browser now, in Early Edition! Much more high-quality and accessible storytelling will be added to the game in the coming months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
