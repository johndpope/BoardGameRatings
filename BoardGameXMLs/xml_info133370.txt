			<description>Hero Must Die is a worker placement + tower defense game for print &amp;amp; play. You are a little evil mage serving an overlord of a dungeon built under a kingdom. You have three little loyal goblins as your minions at start. You need to help your overlord to defend your dungeon by getting more monsters &amp;amp; traps. You may also send your small army to raid the kingdom above or propose a plan to kidnap the lovely princess. But if you made too much troubles to the kingdom above, more heroes will come to invade your dungeon. So you need to fill your dungeons with more &amp;amp; more powerful monsters to fend off the parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a co-op + competitive game for 2-4 players. The goal is to gain most favors (VPs)from the overlord, so that you will get the most powerful monsters under your command. At start, a player is assigned to guard one of the 4 floors of the dungeons. The bottom floor is not available yet. You may request to swift floor with another player by playing a plot card in the Court phase. Obviously, you don't want to guard the first floor &amp;amp; let your monsters as cannon fodders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Court phase. you may play a plot card to propose a mission like burning the town...etc. If no other player plays a recommendation card, you will lead the mission yourself. If someone play a recommendation card, that player may recommend another player to take the mission instead. VPs will be rewarded for successful missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 3VPs. You may lose vps by letting heroes pass your guarding floor, or gain vps by defeating heroes. The more vps you gained, the more say you will have in court phase. Beware! you won't want to see your VPs drop to zero. Your overlord is not a forgiving boss for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
