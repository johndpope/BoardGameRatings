			<description>Gears of Glory is a game about a group of adventurers racing their automobiles, those incredible new inventions that go faster than a horse and carriage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prove their worth, both drivers and their vehicles need to survive the grueling route across mountains, lakes, forests and villages. They will face fuel shortages, overheating motors and exhaustion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn of the game, a player has two actions and may spend their all-purpose racing cards to move, explore, repair, refuel, or even push, if they must. They must visit villages to refuel, climb mountains to gain fame and reach checkpoints in their quest for glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player reaches the final checkpoint, at which point, the other players have a limited number of turns to also reach it. The player who finished first is not necessarily the winner, as players collect fame points through various feats, including reaching the most mountaintops or visiting the most map tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 8 double-sided modular map tiles, 110 cards, 4 custom-shaped wooden cars and fuel tokens, several player boards and bonus tiles, among other components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
