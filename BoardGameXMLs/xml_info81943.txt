			<description>USER SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tempest X3 was released for the PlayStation November 30th, 1996 and includes three different versions of the video game Tempest. &lt;br/&gt;The first version is Tempest X3, designed specifically for the PlayStation, utilizing its 3d graphical prowess (powerful at the time) with updated visual effects and game play additions, which are noted below. &lt;br/&gt;The second version is a port of the original arcade game of Tempest, which is a tube shooter, involving an abstract space theme. Tempest was originally created to be a 3d version of Space Invaders, but evolved into something completely different, having it's own unique theme.&lt;br/&gt;The Third version is Tempest 2000, another updated version of Tempest, which was previously released for the Atari Jaguar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INFORMATION FROM WIKIPEDIA:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The following gameplay differences [of Tempest X3] from the original version were identified by Jeff Minter [who made Tempest 2000] himself in a Usenet post:[citation needed]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The &amp;quot;AI Droid&amp;quot; only follows the player, instead of acting autonomously. A new, &amp;quot;Super AI Droid&amp;quot; powerup rectifies this somewhat, but it takes a very long time within a level to acquire it.&lt;br/&gt;    * Pulsars now move slowly around the top of the Web if they reach it (rather than electrifying the whole top edge the moment they arrive).&lt;br/&gt;    * The Particle Laser is no more effective than the normal laser against Spikes (in the original, it destroys them very quickly).&lt;br/&gt;    * Some of the harder, &amp;quot;sticking point&amp;quot; webs have been removed from the game entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entering the name &amp;quot;YIFF!&amp;quot; on the highscore table will activate a secret mode, allowing the user to choose to play the original Tempest 2000 game; however, any high scores made in this mode are not saved, the music (wave-captured from the original modules) is muffled and the effectiveness of the Particle Laser against Spikes is not restored even in this original mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayStation version of Tempest X3 includes support for Namco's rotary neGcon analog controller.[citation needed]&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tempest X3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
