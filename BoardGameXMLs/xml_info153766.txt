			<description>The board game ego&amp;sup2; is all about the ego of the players: their preferences, opinions and interests &amp;mdash; and as one of the players you want to do the best job you can deciphering the ego of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with ten chips, and the bank has ten chips, too. Each round, a player reads a question listed on the card as well as the three possible answers. He secretly selects one of them, then the other players simultaneous try to guess it, betting 1-2 chips on their guess. If they answer correctly, they double their bet; otherwise they lose the chips. When the bank runs out of chips, the game ends and whoever has the most chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel to ego and a standalone game, ego&amp;sup2; contains 480 new questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
