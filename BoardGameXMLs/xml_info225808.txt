							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thing in the Valley</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T1 The Thing in the Valley - A terror has come to the valley community of Riversmeet. Farmers, herdsmen, and woodsmen have fallen victim to a mysterious and horrific creature. Amidst the terror, questions go unanswered&amp;mdash; what is this terrible fiend, where did it come from, and what is its dark purpose? The call has gone out to summon a band of adventurers to put an end to The Thing in The Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T2 The Things in the Forest - The Barbarian Lord and his army emerged from the Darken Wood and swarmed across the land. Eventually his army failed and the greed-driven invader retreated back to the wild lands of the north. He was never seen again. Many years later, a dark and horrific creature fell upon a peaceful valley many miles from the Darken Wood. Through the mystery of fate, these two events are directly linked. Now is the time to find and destroy The Things in the Forest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thing in the Valley and The Things in the Forest are adventures for four to eight characters of 3rd to 6th level. This module requires the use of the First Edition game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
