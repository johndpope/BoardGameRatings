			<description>Larue is a tile placement game in which players alternately place triangular tiles on a board such that at least one edge colour matches that of an adjacent tile.  The object of the game is to be the first player to have placed all of their tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in brightly coloured box with the (brief) rules printed on the back of the box.  Contents are: A card game board about 28cm square to which is stuck a card border enclosing a 24cm square play area; and 72 right-angled isosceles triangular tiles, each displaying three coloured sections.  All the card components are about 2mm thick are fairly well made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a solo version suggested whereby the player attempts to fit all the pieces into the playing area (while observing the tile placement rule)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
