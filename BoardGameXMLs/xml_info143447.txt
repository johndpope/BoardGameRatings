							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cottonwood Contest: Cousins</name>
									
			<description>The Cottonwood Contest: Cousins is a stand-alone solo game. Two decks can accommodate two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cottonwood Contest: Cousins has more types of goods than The Cottonwood Contest, and it introduces a new type of item: vegetables that can be planted in fields and then processed after being harvested. It also does not include any field/pasture cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your grandparents were so impressed with the outcome of your parents' contest that they decided to have one of their own. You and your cousin are competing for a large parcel of your grandparents' land in the small but growing town of Cottonwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have three years to show that you can make your farm more profitable. You may plant grain and vegetables, raise animals, and gather apples and mushrooms from the countryside. You may sell goods at each of the three Markets, and enter the income in your ledger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your cousin does not want the work of going to the annual market, and made a deal with a local store to receive the average price for each good sold. To determine your cousin's score, you will multiply goods sold by their average price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cousin who has the most money in their ledger after the third year wins the contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
