			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your group has been requested by Archbishop Telamor Constran from the Church of Koassak to go on a rescue mission for one of his missing brothers who was taken by pirates. You have been enlisted because of your growing fame to barter a release out of the Pirate Lord Hannibal the Black. After three days of storms you awake to a really bad sound....Abandon Ship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is part of the Filbar series and it is suitable for a group of adventurers of 4th through 6th level. While part of the Filbar realm it is easily adaptable to any campaign and most systems. While this is a short and seemingly easy adventure, once you understand most of your armor is at the bottom of the sea floor things aren't as easy as you would think!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
