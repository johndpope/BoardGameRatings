			<description>From publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low budget original board game for 2 &amp;ndash; 8 players, packaged in the foil as a magazine. In role of the most well-known gentlemen rogue and very cheer and wanton ladies a player try to collect the points of their realized desires. The only strategy and erotic game all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juchajdo! is a humorous Czech adult-themed game illustrated by one of best Czech illustrators Kaja Saudek. You'll need two sets to play with 8 players, one is enough for 4 of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards with male and female characters and play them on a square grid. The deck also contains some special cards, that can be used when placing these characters or when doing various actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have some character(s) in game, you can move them. All characters have some preferences, when it comes to &amp;quot;partnership&amp;quot; and you try to &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot; your characters with those, that are matching these preferences (getting them to the same square).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot; one of your characters with one of opposite gender, the owners of both score points by the preferences of their character and &amp;quot;qualities&amp;quot; of the second one. Unless of them play some special card, both of them are removed from game thereafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having a very nice price for such a game, it is a cheap print on waxed paper, cut-before-play, is full-colour, and especially if laminated can remain for a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
