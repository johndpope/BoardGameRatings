In 5 rounds, players program their decision about price, production, research, and expansion in order to earn more profits and become the most successful company in the world by earning more money than rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanics with bidding and action selection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the rounds consist of 8 simple phases: planing, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, sell. and profits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the planning phase all players simultaneously make a decision in the next year by patching their 2 plan cards and all of their development tiles. This plan will determine all of other phases, as players will use planed actions in further phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During pricing phase, players will change their price, according their decision.

At the end of the phase all unsold smartphones are utilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the profit phase, you get income for your smartphones. All sold phones get you as many dollars, as their price. Also the player who sold more phones in the region gets profits for controlling the accessory market. At the end of this phase all sold smartphones discarded from the map - and a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 5 rounds the richest player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
