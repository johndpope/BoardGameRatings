			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire adventure in which the characters are asked to recover a Imperial Scout X-boat Tender that has been captured by Pirates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The adventure ... deals with the rescue of a Scout-service X-boat Tender that has been attacked by pirates. This adventure is unique in that it doesn't require a referee to play. As such, it may be played solitaire by a single individual, or cooperatively by several individuals controlling a single character each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure requires the basic Traveller booklets (Books 1, 2, and 3), High Guard (Book 5), Traders and Gunboats (Supplement 7) and either Shapshot (Game 2) or Azhanti High Lightning (Game 3). This adventure works equally well with the combat systems presented in either Game 2 or Game 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the boarding actions conducted during this adventure are resolved using the Lone Wolf programmed opponent rules for Snapshot or Azhanti High Lightning.  ...and are also included as an appendix to this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
