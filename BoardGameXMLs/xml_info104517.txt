							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation: Weapons Disaster</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cobra has grown very ambitious. Only the GI Joe Team can match their fierce new firepower in OPERATION: WEAPONS DISASTER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything that moves, YOU can make it go faster. Wheels, that's your codename - enemy vehicle and weapons expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Cobra starts throwing new weapons and vehicles at GI Joe Teams all over the world, Duke sends for you. Flint and Lady Jaye are under fire from Cobra gun cycles in Africa; Bazooka and Roadblock are bushwhacked by Cobra combat tanks in New Mexico; and Iceberg and Sci-Fi are pinned down by Cobra snowsleds in the Alps. But you can't be everywhere at once. What is Cobra up to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must weigh your choices carefully - but quickly. And be prepared to face Cobra's most ingenious machinery. In any event, this looks like a good time to field test your new combat motorcycle. Peel out, Wheels, you have no time to lose as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
