			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Levels of Wrong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, the Containment Zone of Chicago has held many levels of wrong. One level is the bad things that frequently happen there&amp;mdash;the various assaults against CZ residents, and the people who go missing or turn up dead. That level of wrong is bad enough, but it gets worse for the people who are foolish enough to look into the reasons behind the wrongs. The scope and range of evil in the CZ is enough to warp even the most stable of minds, and only the desperate or deranged voluntarily look into the darkest corners of the sprawl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That, of course, means that shadowrunners find themselves diving into those corners all the time, and another chance is about to come their way. A young woman has gone missing, and Becky 99, leader of the Desolation Angels, wants her found. The runners will face the challenge of digging through the darkness of the CZ to find this woman&amp;mdash;and then living with whatever it is they discover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Rumblings continues the series of Shadowrun Missions diving into the toughest dangers Chicago has to offer. Whether runners have followed the full storyline or are just jumping in now, the Mission provides enough adventure, danger, and mystery to keep players enthralled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Rumblings is for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
