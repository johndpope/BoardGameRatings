							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Holmes and Watson Committee</name>
									
			<description>The Holmes and Watson Committee is about creating your own mysteries adventures as you play. Players are given power over the plot to guide the clues and information towards a villain of their own choosing. The game is loosely based off the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. While some homage is paid to the intrepid duo, this game is not about celebrating the ingenious works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Instead, the villains, tropes, and atmosphere of Victorian England are put at the players&amp;rsquo; command to do with as they please. The point of the game is to solve the mystery, collect the reward, and eventually match wits with the likes of the infamous Professor Moriarty. --publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
