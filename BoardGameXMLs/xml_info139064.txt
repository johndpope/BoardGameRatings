			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the shores of the Illgen river hard against the ruins of a once-mighty castle lies the village of Apia. The village marks a convenient spot to cross the river, but more than that offers a pleasant place to slake a thirst or enjoy a sumptuous meal. The canny know to order Sanna&amp;rsquo;s golden mead during their stay at the Bee's Knees Inn while others might notice a certain sweetness to the local food, or a strange hum in the air, but only a few note the higher than average number of bees buzzing about the village. Few bother to investigate the old and dilapidated castle anymore, after being cautioned by the locals that the structure is both already well-explored and dangerously unsafe - which is true, but avoids mentioning that the old ruins are not entirely abandoned...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
