			<description>From the authors webpage:&lt;br/&gt;An adventure I wrote as a one-shot for Gen Con 2006, and as such might need a bit of adapting for your campaign. Its difficulty level is set for starting characters. Mr. Johnson's pregnant girlfriend has been kidnapped. Somehow toxic spirits are involved. Call you crazy, but you're pretty sure that's on the Surgeon General's list of things pregnant women should avoid. The team is called in to reinforce another team, only to arrive too late. They pick up the first team's job, and wind up in the middle of a pretty dark and twisted run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
