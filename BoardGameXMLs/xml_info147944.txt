							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Crypts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full color set of three 48 x 30 inch, floorplans of Crypts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module includes three crypt dungeons for use in any game. The first is a maze and dungeon full of coffins. The second is a pillared dungeon. The third is a shrine built into a volcano with a drawbridge that spans across a river of magma. Additionally, there is a tile page for the bridge down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters can use these three large crypt maps in a variety of ways. The first crypt is a rather large dungeon maze. The left hand side of the map with its many small rooms and hallways is a great place to start with small encounters with undead, tomb robbers, carrion feeders, and other monsters. The right hand side of the map has a large room with many coffins and skeleton-filled mass graves. This room is great for an epic encounter with an evil necromancer, with massive waves of undead coming out of the charnel pits or coffins, fighting a bandit leader and his grave robbers, or even a huge carrion feeding mother monster laying eggs in the chamber. These doors are usually barred from the outside, unless something has opened them, like the grave robbing thieves, the necromancer&amp;rsquo;s hulking undead assistant has smashed them open, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second crypt dungeon with the multiple pillars makes for a great setting piece for an epic large fight at the bottom of a dungeon. Pillars provide cover for archers and magicians and plenty of shadows and concealment for stealthy characters to sneak around and flank enemies. The open middle of the room is a great spot for warriors to enter a grand melee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third crypt makes for a tough encounter because it is a narrow bridge that the Player Characters must fight on, making ranged and spell attacks the biggest part of the encounter and falling off the bridge to the river of fire is almost certain incineration. On the other side is a shrine with a demon dog idol. What creatures worship this demon dog? Do they offer this idol sacrifices? Perhaps they are about to sacrifice a person to the demon dog, releasing them from a steel cage and leading them up the scaffolding to the demon dog idol&amp;rsquo;s head. It is up to the Player Characters to stop the sacrifice. The guards will try to stop them from reaching the other side by wheeling the drawbridge up, so the Player Characters will need to incapacitate them before they can succeed at lifting it up to get to the other side. Then they&amp;rsquo;ll need to deal with the head priest, the executioner, and the other worshipers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product makes an excellent additional resource for our Ossuary module, as these maps can be laid down so that the entrance is across from the northern bridge exit of that module as an additional area to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
