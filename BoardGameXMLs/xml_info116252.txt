							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Sherwood</name>
									
			<description>From the Inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robin Hood and his merry men are confronted with their biggest challenge to date!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil Cult of Sagalia has taken control of Sherwood Forest instilling fear into the hearts of the forest dwellers. They are relying on you as Friar Tuck, Robin and the rest of the band to rid the forest of this evil force and then get back to normal pursuits like robbing the rich to give to the poor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the meantime Robin and his men battle valiantly on, but the odds are definitely stacked against them. Werewolves roam the forest day and night watching and waiting for any likely looking prey (actually they're not particularly fussy!). Hideous animated skeletons appear when they're least expected and should you be unfortunate enough come across one of the Priests of Sagalia, well, your days are numbered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
