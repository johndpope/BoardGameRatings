							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All the Strange, Strange Creatures Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;There's a horror movie called Alien ? That&amp;rsquo;s really offensive. No wonder everyone keeps invading you!&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For much of our history humans have gazed up at the stars and asked the question: are we alone in the universe? The answer, of course, is no! The galaxy is teeming with life. Aliens populate every corner of the universe, and many have visited our humble little planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the Strange, Strange Creatures is aliens. Aliens the Doctor has encountered on his adventures. Aliens he has not yet met. Aliens he hopes to never meet again. This supplement provides the Gamemaster with the details of just some of the alien races that the Doctor has encountered, from Daleks and Cybermen to the Vashta Nerada and the Skovox Blitzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as providing rules and background for each of the aliens included, this supplement also gets beneath the skin of each of them. What makes them tick? What do they do? How do you use them in your adventures? What sort of stories do they appear in? What else might you do with them? And how do you go about making up your own aliens?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
