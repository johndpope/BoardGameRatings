							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Executive Producer</name>
									
			<description>Executive Producer is a worker placement board game where players attempt to maximize profits from making movies. Acquiring the proper actors, directors, and locations for a given script is imperative for financial success. Each script is categorized as either action, comedy, drama, or horror. Actors, directors, and locations are tailored for certain roles and must be selected carefully. Properly marketing films allows players to collect residual income as they prepare for their next film premiere. Players are tasked each turn with allocating meeples for casting, purchasing scripts, marketing, fundraising, or acquiring bonus features, as they strive to become the most successful Executive Producer in the industry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
