			<description>The object of this abstract strategy game is to bring together 4 sun pieces (2 each of 2 different colors) into a connected chain.  Each player has a hidden goal card with his 2 colors.  This means that many times two players have a color in common, making it a challenge to help yourself without helping your opponent even more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 6x6 grid of points.  24 planets are placed at random on these points at the beginning of the game.  8 sun pieces are placed in the square spaces formed by the grid points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you can move any one planet to any empty point on the grid, or, if a sun is surrounded by 4 planets, you can move that sun to an adjacent space.  The only restrictions are that you cannot undo the last player's move or move a planet away from a completely surrounded sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win immediately if your 4 suns are connected in a chain of any shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
