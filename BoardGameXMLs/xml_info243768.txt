							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The School of Sorcerous Arts</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The ruins of the School of the Sorcerous Arts was a common destination for spell casters, academics and sages. It was once a thriving research destination that was one the frontier of  research into magical items. Many of the resident mages used to &amp;quot;mine&amp;quot; the old statue in town for its valuable metal. No one knows what happened at the school to cause its destruction but it has lain quiet for centuries. Most of its above ground buildings were tumbled down in a massive explosion leaving debris and stonework for miles around the old school. Some speculate that the underground portions of the school are still intact. With the recent incursions of monsters and magical constructs some think that the debris that buried the school has been removed in some places.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Side Quests pdfs provide GMs with interesting NPCs and locations to use with or against your player group. Side Quests can be interesting stops along the road or a one shot side quest if the full party isn't present for the evening of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of a Town including a tavern, meals and costs, patrons and some rumors, town goings on, any stores, brothels or other significant places of interest in town as well as a short adventure or dungeon crawl to fill a evening or two of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
