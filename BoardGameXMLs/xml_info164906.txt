			<description>Table Top Racing uses settings and environments similar to the Micro Machines series, with its basic gameplay similar to the Mario Kart series. Much like Micro Machines, the player controls a miniature toy car, with tracks comprising various elements of a larger structure, such as a kitchen table, a garage workbench, a Japanese restaurant, and a picnic table. Much like Mario Kart, cars have simple, arcade-like controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has two options as to how to control the cars; &amp;quot;Tilt&amp;quot; features accelerometer steering (tilting the physical device to the left to turn left and to the right to turn right) and &amp;quot;Simple&amp;quot; features touch to steer (where the play touches the left side of the touchscreen to turn left, and the right side to turn right). Both modes use auto-accelerate and auto-brake. Within most races, the player can collect items which can then be used during the race, such as &amp;quot;speed boosts&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;projectile attacks&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, the goal of each race is to compete against multiple other cars, with the aim of finishing first. However, there are also several other modes of play; such as catching up to another car who is given a head start, elimination-style races where the last car every twenty seconds is eliminated, and time trials. At the end of each race, the player is given a zero to three star rating based on how well they performed, with better scores awarded with higher amounts of in-game currency, which can subsequently be used to upgrade and customize the player's vehicle, or buy new vehicles. The game also features in-app purchases, allowing the player to use real life money to purchase in-game currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Table Top Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
