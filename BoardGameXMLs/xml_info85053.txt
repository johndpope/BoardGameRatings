			<description>With this MONUMENTS - Wonders of Antiquity expansion No.2 the Game gets even more sophisticated. Create a set of three cards with different symbols (ship, scroll, helmet) and buy Pergamon from the bank using one action.&lt;br/&gt;From now on you may use one action to score additional victory points during the game. Count all complete sets in all players displays and score according points.&lt;br/&gt;Beware: The other players may spent one action and three cards to steal the tile from you to get the option of further victory points from what was meant to be useless stuff.&lt;br/&gt;You need not consider Pergamon - but be sure your opponents will!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
