							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BMX XXX</name>
									
			<description>BMX XXX is a 2002 video game published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, and PlayStation 2. It was developed by Z-Axis. It is a BMX game speckled with crude humor and nudity. The game allows the player to create riders as topless women in underwear bottoms and &amp;quot;unlock&amp;quot; full motion video clips of strippers in action. Consequently, BMX XXX was denied classification in Australia. While the game is available fully uncensored on the GameCube and the Xbox, the American PlayStation 2 version has no topless riders and the stripper footage is censored with small BMX XXX logos over the nipples. The game received poor reviews and sales, which was exacerbated by the negative attention over the nudity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;BMX XXX&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
