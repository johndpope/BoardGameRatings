							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warlord Chess</name>
									
			<description>A new set of rules to play the age-old game for two players, using a chess board and all of the chess pieces. Warlord chess is designed to be simple and easy to learn, but offering a strategic depth and its main goal is to be played with nothing but the typical chess set you can find everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use pawns as Farmers, creating patterns in order to bring forth more powerful units such as Knights, Bishops, and ultimately the King and Queen to win the game- but there's more than one way to win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
