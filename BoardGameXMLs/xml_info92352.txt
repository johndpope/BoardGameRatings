			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holy Lands is a game that does not require a board, cards or a computer. It requires this book, a [Holy Lands Adventure Pack], some gaming dice a friend or two and your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The power of righteousness within the Holy Lands shines as a light in the dark world. This order stands in evil's way of total world chaos. The pagan lands attack from the outside while the devil and his demons infect the lands from the inside. One by one, they are destroying our spiritual allies. The survival of the Church is dependent on all Christians who will stand against the evil enemies and fight with the power of Holy Spirit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several tools are at your disposal. All are necessary and all have a special part to play in the offense of Truth. They range from the skills that God has blessed you with to sharp blades and even Miracles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
