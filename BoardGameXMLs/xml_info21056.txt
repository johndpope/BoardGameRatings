			<description>In Morocco, players become merchants in the open-air Moroccan market, trading their wares in an attempt to drum up interest, selling them when profitable and storing them in their warehouses in hopes of future gains.  Keeping a shrewd eye on what their fellow merchants are up to and a keen sense of timing will make you the richest merchant in Morocco!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morocco is an economic card game for 3-5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
