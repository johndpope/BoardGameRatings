			<description>WHERE IN THE WILD? combines fun, quick observation and learning.  The game introduces players to over 400 different animals and plants, details of which are provided within the accompanying booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;4 game boards - each comprising a picture with about 100 animals on it.  Each board is divided into a 3x3 grid.&lt;br/&gt;36 Riddle questions each containing two questions, one easy and one slightly more difficult (i.e.- I slide along and I slide along with a shell on my back).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A riddle card is turned over and one of the questions read out.  All the players then look at their gameboard to try an find an animal or plant that fits the description in the riddle.  The first player to find an answer can either say the name of the animal/plant or point to it on his/her gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the answer is correct the successful player takes the riddle card and uses it to cover then square on his or her gameboard where the answer was found.  Another riddle is then read out, and so on...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to completely cover their gameboard is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
