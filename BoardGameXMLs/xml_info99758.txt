			<description>Return to 3000 BC in Dawn of Nations, building your empire through war, trade, exploration and the favor of the gods. Race your neighbours to complete a Wonder of the Ancient World or end the game with a Great Flood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dawn of Nations players take turns to roll their three dice for one of seven Events on their player sheet. Some of these Events involve calculation; others require negotiation with another player; while some require you to chance fate and test yourself against the Gods. Players must keep an eye on their score and choose the right moment to try to end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dawn of Nations is a print-and-play dice game, available for free download. The game is suitable for three to six players aged 10 and up, and plays in 20-30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
