							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lucky Ducks</name>
									
			<description>Players each have a stack of cards, each card with 3 ducks of the same color, each with 2 of the 3 ducks having a hole in the center of their body.  The game board has large colored circles, the same colors of the ducks. The object of the game is to be the first to lay down all your cards, by placing them on the game board so that the ducks with holes match the circles on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player always has two cards face up to be seen by all, so opportunities for strategy occur by placing the ducks (vertically, horizontally, right-side up, upside-down) to block opponents.  Also, if a card cannot be placed, one from the board is removed, thoughtfully, so that the played is helped on his next turn, but not the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 playing board&lt;br/&gt;28 cards in 4 colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
