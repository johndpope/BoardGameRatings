							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Langstone Castle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. The map is 50x50, equivalent to 25 of our standard 10x10 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A vast castle. Moorland, full of heather, scrub and rock, is home to Langstone Castle. Surrounded by a moat on one side, the curtain wall is entered via a barbican which also serves as a prison and interrogation room. The bailey is open, with functional buildings such as a stable and blacksmiths. The main castle occupies the southeast corner, with a cobbled courtyard and doors leading to various rooms - a Great Hall, a Chapel, solars, kitchens and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Defend the fortress against marauding warriors, seek an audience with the king, besiege the castle of your enemy, infiltrate the grounds at night and assassinate the Lord of the Manor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map (with furniture) spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map (empty - no furniture) spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi full jpeg versions for VTT or poster printing (gridded and gridless, empty and furniture)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Whilst the download looks large, it consists of 6 separate files - just download the versions you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on VTT use - we have deliberately kept the quality of the file high, and you may need to resize the jpeg for use in your VTT software. Keeping the file size and resolution high gives you the flexibility to use the map how you want - crop out a particular section or use the entire map, the choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
