			<description>French abstract game. The board has 6x6 tiles on them. Each tile also has three round spots; on such a spot a pawn can be placed, some of these spots are yellow, white, green or orange. Each player uses four wooden pawns to play on the board (a white or a black set). The condition to move one of the pawns to another spot is that it has to be free and a green or orange color. During a game turn a player can either exchaneg a tile on the board, move his pawn to a green or orange spot or move a tile with an opponent's pawn on, in that case that pawn has to start again in the back row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective to win is to reach the last row of the opponent's side with all four pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
