							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sonic Labyrinth</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Sonic Labyrinth is a puzzle-come-platform game for the Sega Game Gear, released 17 November 1995 in Japan and in 1995 in North America and Europe. It is also playable on Sonic Adventure DX and in the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox editions of Sonic Mega Collection Plus. The game features isometric gameplay similar to the SegaSonic the Hedgehog arcade game and Sonic 3D. Sonic and Dr. Eggman are the only characters in this game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Players control Sonic by moving them around a pinball-like arena, using their power to roll into a ball to defeat Badniks and pick up keys in order to exit through the GOAL door to clear the stage. The only move Sonic can use in the game is the Spin Dash, because Dr. Eggman secretly replaced his famous red shoes with another pair: the Slow-Down Boots that took away his ability to run fast or jump, and they cannot be removed at all without the use of Chaos Emerald energy. Sonic does retain his ability to walk and Spin Dash, however there is a time limit in each stage so it is best to move quickly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sonic Labyrinth&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
