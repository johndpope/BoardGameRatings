			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new second edition includes new creatures, new magic, and new optional OSRIC rules not appearing in any other Usherwood Publishing product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This OSRIC expansion material includes;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New character race options;&lt;br/&gt;         Dragon Hordling; a tortured half-breed mixture of human and dragon. Use the creature's ability of limited flight and minor breath weapon to your advantage.&lt;br/&gt;         Half-orcs; two new sub-races of orcish original. The more intelligent goblinesque is allowed to become a magic-user of minor power, and the brutish orgre is a berserking behemoth.&lt;br/&gt;         Sarngoch; a mysterious race, taller than humans, and more charismatic than elfs. These demi-humans of noble appearance have an innate ability to cast limited arcane spells. But the magic within them is both a blessing and a curse!&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     New character class options;&lt;br/&gt;         The Jack-of-All-Trades; build a character whose skills are as unique as his carefully-crafted personality. Includes skills from the archetypical classes; assassin, cleric, druid, fighter, illusionist, magic-user, paladin, ranger, thief. Even include talents from new Usherwood class; the Vermean Monk.&lt;br/&gt;         The Vermean Bard;not just a single class with a broad range of unrelated skills. The Vermean Bard is a collection 7 different, yet related, minstrel classes;&lt;br/&gt;             Jongleur Magsman; combining both thief and bard skills&lt;br/&gt;             Lorist Priest; combining both cleric and bard skills&lt;br/&gt;             Lorist Ovate; combining both druid and bard skills&lt;br/&gt;             Lyrist Veteran; combining both fighter and bard skills&lt;br/&gt;             Sonneteer Magician; combining both magic-user and bard skills&lt;br/&gt;             Sonneteer Trickster; combining both illusionist and bard skills&lt;br/&gt;             Racaraide Bard; a true adventuring bard&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;         The Vermean Monk; a new take on the classic First Edition monk is a martial arts master, without the supernatural abilities that can unbalance your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Challenge your players with 28 new monsters, including six new species of dragon.&lt;br/&gt;     Reward your players with 10 new magical armor, weapons, and miscellaneous magic items.&lt;br/&gt;     Open adventuring possibilities with Usherwood's take on psionics; re-written from the First Edition appendix. These rules governing psionics are more spell-like in the way they are handled, and more easily incorporated into your campaign. This section also includes 14 psionically-sensitive monsters to challenge the would-be mentalists in your group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the Usherwood Adventures campaign setting, the material contained in the Usherwood Adventures Expansion for OSRIC is completely setting-agnostic, and easily adaptable to your campaign world. 122 pages of new material, much of it never published previously, and only to be made available in this publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
