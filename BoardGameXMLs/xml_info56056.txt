			<description>From inside the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is the first of the Loremaster Series, a group of fantasy aids designed to each provide the background for a complete campaign of any level. Laid out for your players on the four-color map are no less than 5 dungeons and 3 cities through which they may search for riches or death. But worlds are not all towers and dungeons, so the Loremaster series provides the cultural and political background for a series of wilderness adventures as the players journey across the map learning about their world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two maps (scale 1&amp;quot; = 20 miles) are provided, one labeled with suggested locations for each city or dungeon, so that you can release to the players just the information their characters might actually have. The dungeons and citadels are shown in sinister perspectives and laid out with numbered, keyed, floorplans - ready for you, as Gamemaster, to people them with creatures that will provide an appropriate challenge for your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second volume in this series is currently in development to allow you to widen the scope of your player's adventures and more will be forthcoming. Also available (by Spring '81) is a full-color continental map done in the same style as the back cover of this booklet. Ten million square miles of forests, savannas, steppes, deserts, mountains, islands plains and lakes on a 24&amp;quot; x 36&amp;quot; poster-sized map. Look for it at your hobby store.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
