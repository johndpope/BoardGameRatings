							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Invincible Iron Man</name>
									
			<description>The Invincible Iron Man is the title of a video game published by Activision and developed by Torus Games for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. It is a one-player side-scrolling action game in which the player battles various villains from the Iron Man and comic book series.&lt;br/&gt;Contents &lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The basic design has you traveling sideways, upward, and back and forth throughout massive levels full of armed opponents. You can use Iron Man's repulsor blasts and shoulder tackle to knock out his enemies, but each use drains a little bit more of the costume's energy. When the energy is depleted, you'll need to collect energy items scattered throughout the level or wait for the suit to recharge. ... There are also power orbs located in various areas, which you can collect in order to unleash a massive chest-mounted cannon or to detonate a bomb that clears the entire screen of enemies. Iron Man's jump ability is actually a boost that you can use in combination with the shoulder tackle in order to fly short distances.&amp;quot; Villains include Iron Man's cousin Morgan Stark, Blizzard, and the Crimson Dynamo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Invincible Iron Man (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
