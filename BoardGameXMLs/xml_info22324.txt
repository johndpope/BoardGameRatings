							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Branded The Game</name>
									
			<description>Object of game: Only one man survived the battle of Bitter Creek. Since there were no witnesses it was assumed the lone survivor had run as a coward. Having being discharged from his countries service with his sword broken and his insignia removed, he was a man BRANDED as a coward. As this man goes through life, he must demonstrate over and over his strength and courage in an attempt to clear and remove his unwarranted stigma of BRANDED. As you travel the trail you try to be the first player to show your courage by covering the name branded on the scoring line with discs won in battle at the various areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
