			<description>Japanese CCG created by Bandai and based on the pocket digital pet and anime series of the same name. Known as Digimon in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pit various monsters against eachother in battle, attempting to deplete the opponents of energy and striving to evolve their own monsters to more powerful forms by playing cards to enhance combat or advance the monsters through two or more stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster is denoted by a leter and colour type that is referenced vs the opponents monster to determine one of three types of attacks that can be performed. Players attempt to outperform their opponent by playing enhancements to increase the power of the attack, evolve to a more potent form, or to even change the colour type to one more advantageous. Cards may also be played to weaken or devolve the opponent monsters.&lt;br/&gt;The monster ending the battle with the highest rating wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each starter contains 34 cards and one gold embossed card and one special &amp;quot;hologram&amp;quot; card. Rules and battlemat are combined in a single mapfold sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Upper Deck release of the Digimon game in 2000 appears to use slightly modified cards as this with similar rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
