			<description>Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;週刊少年漫画のトーナメント編の優勝キャラを予想し当てる！&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;In the game of ブックメイカーズ (BOOK MAKERS), there is a manga, a Japanese comicbook magazine named &amp;quot;Shukan Shonen Boardgame (Weekly Boys' Boardgame)&amp;quot;, and a comic strip named &amp;quot;BOOKMAKERS&amp;quot; is the most popular in the magazine. Its story is heating up, and the most climactic event is about to begin: The Tournament Battles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players are readers of the manga &amp;quot;BOOKMAKERS&amp;quot;. The player who has been most excited at the manga wins the game. The game is published in the same format as 'Weekly Shonen Jump', a very popular weekly manga in Japan. The designer is publishing under his own label Ōtsuka seisaku (オオツカ製作) outside of his other work with KUA. The doujin publisher Gyunbuku-ya (ぎゅんぶく屋) is listed for design work on the game, not strictly as the game publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are nine competitors in the tournament. At the beginning of the game, each player is randomly assigned a competitor as their favorite character. Players take turns placing a competitor to form a tournament bracket. Then players secretly choose who will be the champion of the tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eight battles in the tournament. Most of a battle proceeds automatically, and rough probability of victory is calculated easily. But before the battle begins, players have some chances to place a fan letter face-down on a competitor to modify the result toward their favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are how you get excited (score victory points).&lt;br/&gt;1) You score points when your favorite character wins a battle, and ultimately, you score big points when your favorite character wins the tournament. &lt;br/&gt;2) Each competitor has a destined rival. You score points when your favorite character fights with their destined rival. Win or lose doesn't matter. &lt;br/&gt;3) For each battle, you score points if you have correctly predicted who will win the battle. &lt;br/&gt;4) You score points if you have correctly predicted the champion of the tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest total wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
