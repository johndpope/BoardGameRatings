			<description>From the introduction to the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1684&lt;br/&gt;The world is in turmoil.&lt;br/&gt;The Christians fight amongst each other.&lt;br/&gt;The English are between civil wars.&lt;br/&gt;The Spanish King is insane and epileptic.&lt;br/&gt;The Spanish are at war with Everyone.&lt;br/&gt;And...&lt;br/&gt;The French Invade Texas&lt;br/&gt;This is a short role playing game based on historic fact.&lt;br/&gt;However unlikely that may seem.&lt;br/&gt;In it you will play Robert Cavalier de La Salle, famous explorer of the French crown, or one of his compatriots. Together you will sail to the new world, south of New France and Louisiana. Your mission is to plunder the Mexican silver mines of the Spanish. To settle in a new colony at the mouth of the Mississipi river. To free fifteen thousand native Americans from the Spanish and convert them to the French cause. And most importantly, you will invade Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
