			<description>Fresh veggies! Fresh veggies! We have cabbages, radishes, and apples! Salad for diet, steak for celebration, and everything you need for your dinner is here. As a mom, you want to buy fresh food for your family, but you also don't want to spend too much money, so you have to focus on food that is on sale and grab it quick before the other mothers in the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mom's Happy Hours is a game of dexterity. The player needs to check their shopping list and make sure the food they want is in the basket. If you are the first one to complete the shopping list, you win the game. You can bring the food as your trophy back to your home now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
