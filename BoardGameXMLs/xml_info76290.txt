			<description>&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men and Gods is a free adventure for 7th Sea and Swashbuckling Adventures. Stats are given for both systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the file's introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a copy of AEG's Player's Guide, Game Master's Guide, and Ships &amp;amp; Sea Battles to run this adventure. Copies of The Crescent Empire, Islands of Gold: The Midnight Archipelago, The Explorer's Society, and Cathay: Jewel of the East are also suggested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men and Gods can either be run as a series of short adventures or as the basis for a larger campaign. The locations visited during the course of the story are spread across Th&amp;eacute;ah, and several weeks' travel time separates each setting. These gaps in the story are intentional, allowing GMs to customize the scenario to each individual's liking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men and Gods is intended for four to six characters of 10th to 12th level for Swashbuckling Adventures or roughly Master level characters for 7th Sea. It is highly recommended that the heroes own or operate their own ship, as they will be travelling from one end of Th&amp;eacute;ah to the other. Also, having at least one scholarly member of the Explorer's Society wo uld be helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
