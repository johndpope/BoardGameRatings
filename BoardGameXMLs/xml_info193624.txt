							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strata</name>
									
			<description>Strata is an educational game that is actually entertaining! It draws on facts and statistics from any discipline and challenges players to place new values within a &amp;quot;Strata&amp;quot; of existing facts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many children's books did Dr. Seuss write? Is it more or less than the number of people killed by Rambo in &amp;quot;Rambo: First Blood&amp;quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which has more, the number of tiles in a Scrabble set or the number of keys on a Keyboard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the kinds of determinations you must make to excel at Strata.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wonderful thing about the game is that anyone can play, and guessing well is as good as knowing. Also, because of its adaptability to any subject, and infinite number of expansions can be mixed in at later dates to cater to any player. Science, Sports, Music, Movies, Astronomy, History - there is nothing off limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
