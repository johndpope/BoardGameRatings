			<description>Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Simulation, is an space simulator published 1982 by Interactive Simulations and developed by Titan Computer Products and NASA scientist Wesley Huntress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accompanied by a thick &amp;quot;Spacecraft Operations&amp;quot; manual with a chapter on use in the classroom, this flight simulator was marketed as being as educational as it was fun to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation is centered around a typical Space Shuttle mission to service a space station. Mission phases include Earth Lift-Off, Orbital Rendezvous, Approach and Alignment and Docking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released for the Apple II in 1982 with positive feedback from reviewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Simulation&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
