			<description>&amp;quot;Based on the masterpiece gamebook series &amp;quot;Fighting Fantasy&amp;quot;, an adventure written by legendary authors Dave Morris (Golden Dragon, Dragon Warriors) and Jamie Thomson (Way of the Tiger).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Vognar Keep has fallen to a deadly foe. The safety of the northern continent of the Fabled Lands is threatened once more by the forces of Evil! After two centuries of peace the dark necromancer, Lord Nydaedus of Hagor, has returned from the grave to rekindle the flames of war in league with the Reavers, pirates of the Unnumbered Isles, and with his own legions of foul undead warriors.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;YOU are a mercenary, battle hardened and cunning. You will need all your skills if you are to penetrate Vognar Keep and destroy the threat to the land.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Many dangers lie ahead and your success is by no means certain. Powerful adversaries are ranged against you, and it's up to YOU to decide which route to follow, which dangers to risk and which foes to fight!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
