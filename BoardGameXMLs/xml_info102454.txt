			<description>Not a Traditional Wargame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Force was designed to help train military leaders in force management and resource allocation. It is not a traditional type of wargame. Instead, it puts players in the position of a national planner, making decisions about what force structure to create and maintain, where to allocate resources, and how to effectively manage the armed forces&amp;rsquo; budget during a simulated twenty-year period while facing current and emerging threats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the player seeks to find balance between the following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Conduct intelligence &amp;amp; counterintelligence&lt;br/&gt;    * Prioritize theaters of operations&lt;br/&gt;    * Manage strategic lift capability&lt;br/&gt;    * Create new units&lt;br/&gt;    * Update existing unit capability&lt;br/&gt;    * Conduct Research &amp;amp; Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Force models planning, allocation of forces, and research and development. The overall concepts are straightforward, but the game offers players complexity if they want it. With unpredictably (as in real life), each scenario is different, and each game is challenging. Operations take place within Areas of Operation (Peacetime Military Engagement, Irregular Warfare, and Major Combat Operations), and may change during the game year (stability). Unpredictably (as in real life), each game is different, and each game is challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Force has proven popular with both military and civilian gamers, and has numerous applications for training, education and competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer Jim Lunsford served as a U.S. Army infantry officer for twenty years and has done a tour as tactics instructor at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.  Many of the games he has designed are used by the armed forces for training, such as HPS&amp;rsquo;s Decisive Action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Force Play Options:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Single player vs. the AI&lt;br/&gt;        * Two player hot-seat&lt;br/&gt;        * Internet&lt;br/&gt;        * LAN&lt;br/&gt;        * Play by e-mail&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System Requirements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 400 MHz Pentium&lt;br/&gt;        * Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7&lt;br/&gt;        * 512 MB of RAM&lt;br/&gt;        * 360 MB free space on hard drive&lt;br/&gt;        * CD/DVD drive&lt;br/&gt;        * DirectX version 7 or higher&lt;br/&gt;        * TCP/IP network card and an Internet connection for multi-player games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
