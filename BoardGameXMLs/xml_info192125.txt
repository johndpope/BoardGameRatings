							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blackbody</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Cosmic horror from BEYOND SPACE&amp;hellip; Blackbody!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 14 Rogue, Blackbody is a powerful foe of all champions of light. Blackbody is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackbody&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;ldquo;Black&amp;quot; to indicate that his origins are mysterious and beyond the analysis of modern technology. Chosen by primordial forces of darkness from before the birth of the universe, Blackbody wields cosmic power unlike any other character in the Beacon City setting. He is the Champion of the Eternal Night, and is charged with strange cosmic power known only as Black Plasma. A terror to Power Level 10 characters, he can be a recurring villain to challenge an entire team of heroes, or a more personal Rogue for a cosmic-themed hero who fights on the side of light or life. His ultimate goal is the destruction of all creation, but before he can do that he must defeat all the champions who oppose him. Will your heroes be mighty and brave enough to stand against Blackbody?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
