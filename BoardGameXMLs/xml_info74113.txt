			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuck Oregon, Let's Go Find El Dorado (sometimes shortened to Let's Go Find El Dorado) is an entry in a Ludum Dare 48-hour solo game development competition where the theme was &amp;quot;adventure&amp;quot;. It is a physics-based parody/homage to the Oregon Trail series of computer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player uses the left and right arrow keys to control an ox (or possibly cow) pulling a covered wagon. In the wagon are five family members, who will lose health throughout the game depending on which illnesses and injuries they sustain, including dysentery, broken limbs, and cholera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The journey is made more treacherous by the constant exaggerated hills and mountains the ox (or cow) must overcome. Because the game includes a primitive physics engine, the ox (or cow) and its passengers will fall, flip, and find themselves upside-down frequently throughout the trip to El Dorado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
