							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Load the Longboat</name>
									
			<description>Load the Longboat is a dexterity game that involves putting wooden pieces on a suspended wooden platform, the &amp;quot;longboat&amp;quot;. The longboat is only attached at the center of the platform, so the balance is easily thrown off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces to put on the boat are different sizes and weights so loading the boat and keeping it balanced can be very tricky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the last player to not cause a spill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
