			<description>Coloured balls are drawn at random from the bag and placed onto the board, filling up all the spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player then draws one coloured figure at random to determine which coloured balls they will control and places it in one of the four home areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some neutral coloured balls are then removed depending on the number of players before the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving either one of their own balls or a neutral ball and the game ends when one player gets all of their own coloured balls into their home area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
