			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exciting! Different!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MEGA Role-Playing System is the first RPG of a new generation. The Norwegian inventors have provided a set of rules which contain all of the qualities most desirable to GMs and players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The qualities are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playability: The system developed due to disatisfaction with those games already available. Extensive play testing and continual improvement has made it a highly playable game. The rules have been designed to reflect real life making it simple to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realism: There are no artificial limits placed upon the abilities and skills of the character. Extensive equipment lists and realistic prices enable the character to be well equipped. There is also enough background information on things such as weather, religion and NPCs to allow the creation of a realistic campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat: Although not designed for the &amp;quot;hack-kill-slay-brigade&amp;quot;, the combat system will allow any fights to be resolved quickly and easily. Combat is highly realistic without being too complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also it is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn for the GM: The same principles have been used for attributes, skills, combat and magic. Therefore familiarity with the character creation and improvement is rapid. Most of the vital information has been compiled in easy to read tables making it very accessible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn for the players: Only minimal knowledge of the rules is required to create and run characters therefore they can enjoy playing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete: All necessary information for running a game is contained in this volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting: The good character generation system gives abilities according to previous experience. This means that a new character is unlikely to be unsuitable for adventuring. Furthermore, the players can play any creature (usually intelligent) within the GM's campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexible: The rules are flexible enough that any real-life situation can be catered for by the GM. They can also readily accomodate new skills, weapons, magic and spells, etc. The system is well suited for running an already existing campaign as it is easy to adapt. It is easy to change weapons, skills, spells or creatures without destroying the game balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fun: All of the above leads to the basic requirement of all games - IT IS FUN TO PLAY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
