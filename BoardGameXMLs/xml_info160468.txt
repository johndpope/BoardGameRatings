							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battles of Westeros: Premium Banner Pack</name>
									
			<description>Premium Banner Packs replace the banners included in the Battles of Westeros Core Set. Each pack comes complete with enough material to completely enhance your House Stark and House Lannister forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pack features 44 plastic banners with accompanying sticker sheets that coincide with the green, blue, and red banners for both Stark and Lannister. These banners are designed to enhance your Battle of Westeros experience while also allowing players to supplement their Core Set material with additional banners of your own choosing. These new banner packs are also great for players looking to create their own scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
