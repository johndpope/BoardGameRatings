			<description>from What This Is:&lt;br/&gt;Swords of Strange Aeons is a rules-light fantasy role-playing game of both high adventure and eldritch weirdness at the tail end of time, as the sun wanes in the final days of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;All characters are defined by traits. Traits are simply words or short phrases that a re used to define your character by determining what they will be good at doing during actual play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from The Core Mechanic:&lt;br/&gt;When a character attempts to do something and is opposed by either the environment or another character, they are initiating action. To resolve action, the player who in itiated it rolls 2d12 . One die is light in color and one dark in color. The light die is referred to as the Action Die and represents the effort put forth by&lt;br/&gt;the character initiating the action, while the dark die is the Difficulty Die and represents the opposition to the character who initiated the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When rolled, if the Action Die result is equal to or higher than the Difficulty Die result, the player rolling&lt;br/&gt;the dice narrates the outcome of the action. If the Difficulty Die is higher than the Action Die, the player of&lt;br/&gt;the opposing force (oftentimes the GM) narrates the outcome of the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
