			<description>Why do people climb rockfaces - because they are there and because they can.  Well you can if the conditions are right!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Crag they are always right.  Crag is a solo dice and card game that tries to simulate some of experience of rock climbing.  A route is generated from deck of cards and then the player attempts to move up it.  The longer the route, the harder the moves the more tired they become.  Placing gear can help if you fall, but it won't stop you falling, and you only have so much gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The files for Crag can be found in the files section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
