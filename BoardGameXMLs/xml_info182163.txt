							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zeppelin Games Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;Being a manual for correct behavior and proper conduct in the pursuit of entertainment in live role playing games, so that said games will be a joy for ladies and gentlemen of all tastes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;[T]he goal of [the Zeppelin Games] LARP is for the participants to fully take on the role of a Character. This means that where possible, you should talk as your Character would talk and do as your Character would do. You are an actor playing a Character, and your Character is your role. Of course, you also get to play scriptwriter, creating your own background story, motivations, dark secrets and heroic dreams &amp;ndash; not only that, but you get to be the costumier, bringing your Character to life with detailed costumes and props.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
