							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trip Hammer</name>
									
			<description>Trip Hammer is a game of speed requiring an accurate eye and a fast hand to score points on your opponent by being the first player each round to trap and lock the &amp;ldquo;trip hammers&amp;rdquo; on your opponent&amp;rsquo;s side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with two &amp;ldquo;trip hammers&amp;rdquo; on each side of the board; each player then attempts to strike their respective hammers with a game ball. When struck correctly, each hammer will flip to the opponent&amp;rsquo;s side. When a player has all the hammers on his opponent&amp;rsquo;s side, he or she must push a red knob to lock the hammers and freeze the action, scoring points. The first player to 10 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
