							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Second World War at Sea: Imperial and Royal Navy</name>
									
			<description>From the original Avalanche Press website entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Austria-Hungary dissolved in November 1918, the remnants of her once-proud fleet scattered among the victorious Allies, with most of the warships cut up for scrap within a few years. Had the empire somehow survived the Great War, through diplomatic or military means, she would have entered the crisis of 1939 as a considerable force at sea. &lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;Imperial and Royal Navy is a Second World War at Sea supplement exploring the possibilities of this alternate history. It has everything you expect in a naval game supplement: scenarios, ship data sheets, and playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by this unlikely fleet. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bomb Alley to enjoy most of the scenarios, and Eastern Fleet, Arctic Convoy and Bismarck to play all of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperial and Royal Navy was originally sold exclusively via PDF download.  In 2011 a printed edition with die-cut counters was published.  The supplement will be re-implemented in 2014 as SWWAS: The Habsburg Fleet, adding more ships and a set of scenarios aligned with the Second Great War at Sea story arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
