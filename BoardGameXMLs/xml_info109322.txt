							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exalted Domains of Storms and Savagery</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exalted Domains are a new option that grants clerics (and potentially other divine spellcasters) a truly special and unique connection to one aspect of their deity&amp;rsquo;s power in exchange for one of their domains. Rather than draw bonus powers and spells from two domains, the cleric with an Exalted domain has a greater focus on a single domain, and can utilize powers not available to any other character. Exalted domains can be used to create clerics with a special place of honor within the church, a renegade who might be seen as a heretic by the organized worship of his deity, or a unique foe that has a surprise in store for the PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Genius Guide to Exalted Domains of Storms and Savagery focuses on the domains most often associated with gods of the primal forces of nature, such as storms, plants, animals, and fire. If you want to create a specially blessed defender of the forests, an untamed master of flame, or a sage speaker for the sun and moon, these Exalted domains provide a quick, easy, balanced method for doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
