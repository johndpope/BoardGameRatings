							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost 254-563 (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost 254-563 is a small outpost of the Imperial Federation, located on the far fringe of the populated galaxy in an unexplored region. It is located on an asteroid in a small solar system with no habitable worlds. It serves as the hub for a mining community that has just begun to extract ore from the asteroid belt. It also serves as a small advance military presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost 254-563 is an introductory scenario for new players.  It also can serve as a &amp;quot;home base&amp;quot; for a campaign.  Note the HTML and DOC versions have three black and white maps as part of the document while the RTF version has the same maps as three separate GIF files.  Textually, the three versions are the same and vary only in layout and file format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Outpost 254-563 introductory scenario was retained (without significant changes) in all editions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
