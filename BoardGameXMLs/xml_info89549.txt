			<description>&amp;quot;Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1948 the Lone Ranger radio program made the following announcement, &amp;quot;In celebration of the 15th year of this program you can get your very own model of the Lone Ranger Frontier Town. With this offer you can follow the adventures of The Lone Ranger and Tonto.&amp;quot;  That day, faithful fans of the masked man and his sidekick rushed grocery stores all across America buying up boxes of Cheerios.  On each the 9 boxes of cereal were printed paper card models depicting an exact likeness of the wide-open, wild and woolly western town made famous by the Lone Ranger and Tonto.  Four play maps featuring locations such as the Sawtooth Mountains, the Powderhorn River, the Overland Trail and yes even the Lone Ranger&amp;rsquo;s Secret hideout were also made available via mail-order.  Once all 71 pieces were assembled children could follow along with their favorite radio adventures or play 1 of these 8 exciting scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 1 - The Race for Life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Start: Rimrock Bridge&lt;br/&gt;Game End: Old Spanish Fort&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary: While camping near Rimrock Bridge, the Lone Rnager overhears a band of bad-men plotting to ride to the Old Spanish Fort to give the commanding officer false information about an attack by Comanche Indians.&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Lone Ranger, the other is the band of bad-men. First to reach the fort wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 2 - The Sheriff and the Rustlers&lt;br/&gt;- More information needed -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 3 - Save the Bridge!&lt;br/&gt;- More information needed -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 4 - Find a Fortune!&lt;br/&gt;- More information needed -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 5 - Stop the Hold-up!&lt;br/&gt;- More information needed -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 6 - The Big Rodeo&lt;br/&gt;- More information needed -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 7 - Hidden Gold!&lt;br/&gt;- More information needed -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game No. 8 - Kidnapper&amp;rsquo;s Hide-out&lt;br/&gt;- More information needed -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY (General instructions printed on back of each map section)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Punch out game markers and circular playing discs. Place playing discs in container (such as a cup), shake well and allow each player to select one disc in turn. Each player then moves his game marker according to the directions on the disc he draws. Of course, no player may look at disc before selecting it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Start each game on spot of Ground Plan colored GREEN, which is nearest the starting location indicated for that particular game...And move toward goal on circular stepping stones printed on Ground plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. End each game on spot of Ground plan colored RED, which is nearest to ending location for that particular game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Playing discs marked &amp;ldquo;Overtake player ahead&amp;rdquo; does not apply in all games, since some players in some games will take entirely different routes to the goal. If you are playing a game in which this disc does not apply, either remove it from play or give person who draws it another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. It is up to each player to figure out shortest route to his destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. If you need more game markers for extra players simply cut them out of plain cardboard and color with pencil or crayon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
