							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The USS Ocius</name>
									
			<description>You and your party are the Officers that operate the USS Ocius [&amp;auml;k-E-uhs], an Akula Class mining and discovery vessel.  The game begins as the Ocius comes under unexpected fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having just exited orbit around Planet Kalos, the Ocius is caught off-guard and badly damaged.  The much larger and more powerful Zophosian ship will not stop firing until the Ocius is reduced to space debris.  Your only hope is to keep the ship intact and then boost to light speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The repairs and light speed calculations will take time, during which you, the Officers, must coordinate repairs, medical operations, defenses and return fire.  You will have crew at your disposal, but will also need to operate ship Modules yourselves.  If you can hold the ship together, and keep enough Crew alive, you just may make it out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USS Ocius is a cooperative game that combines role-playing, worker placement, and timed themes.  Players will need to coordinate as a team, and prioritize activities.  Event cards are drawn at the beginning of each round, indicating the challenges faced by the players.  The game has ramping stress in the forms of both time pressure and board collapse.  In addition, each Officer has a special ability that encourages them to stay put, while the problems that arise on the ship encourage otherwise.  Players must tactically Move, Command, and Use Expertise to accomplish their mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Don't let the quick play time and low bits count fool you, this is a strategy game.  It may be light at higher timer settings, but when going for low times, every action matters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is unlike any game you are likely to have played:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global Timer - actually race the clock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coop - race the clock while deciding who does what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worker Placement - accomplish tasks in multiple ways - makes for some intricate tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPG Elements - Officers have specialties.  Roles &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; right and are each crucial.  However, no one combination is better than the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical Blend - While dice are used, and Events are random, over the course of a game, choices still determine success.  There is a sensation of chaos at times, but strategy will prevail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
