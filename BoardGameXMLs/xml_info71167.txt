			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultima Vi: The False Prophet is the sixth game in the Ultima series by Lord British, aka. Richard Garriot and the final game in the Age of Virtue trilogy. This game takes a major step away from the game engines of the previous Ultima games, presenting Britannia as one seamless map viewed from a top down isometric perspective. No loading new maps for towns and dungeons. Also done away with is the 3D game engine for dungeons, instead the game keeps the same engine for all areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Avatar is called to Britannia once more, however his journey is interupted on the way and he is abducted by gargoyles. Just as he is about to be sacrificed for some unknown reason, the Avatar's companions, Shamino, Iolo and Dupre rescue him via a moongate created by Lord British and transport him back to Lord British's Castle. Once there, the Avatar learns that Britannia has been overun by an invasion of gargoyles and each of the eight shrines of virtue have been captured by the. It is once again up to the Avatar and his companions to defeat the evil plaging the land, but not all is as it appears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
