			<description>The game was published late in the lifetime of the Super NES, at a point when releases for 16-bit gaming consoles were not highly anticipated; in addition its developer Titus also enjoyed a poor reputation at the time. All of this combined to bury the release in obscurity. The game's graphics were however impressive for the SNES hardware, resembling the PlayStation video game Rayman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a young wizard who has to complete several levels. Enemies are defeated by using different ranged spells that can be found throughout the levels, with different firing patterns and power.  Some levels require players to pick up a certain amount of items while other require a boss battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall gameplay mechanics resemble an inferior version of Mega Man; like many other platform games released near the end of the lifetime of the SNES, Incantation was labeled repetitive and clunky in comparison with some of the system's classic earlier platformers like Super Mario World and Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Incantation (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
