							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wolsung: The Boardgame – Mini add-on</name>
									
			<description>An expansion to &amp;quot;Wolsung: the Boardgame&amp;quot;, a large family game for 2 to 4 players. They act as inventors and industrialists living in a fictional steampunk world, largely similar to the Victorian times. The inventors develop extraordinary constructions &amp;ndash; steam cars, golems and zeppelins &amp;ndash; in the race for the title of the best designer at the World&amp;rsquo;s Fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This add-on includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     5 optional Special Cards which can be used interchangeably with the original Special Cards from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 new Machine Cards: The Jokers. They represent specific types, but belong to no specific country, so they can be treated as belonging to any country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you start playing, put the Jokers into the appropriate decks - according to the VP value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have lots of fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
