							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lone Survivor</name>
									
			<description>You are inside Lone Survivor Hospital. Mysterious murders have been occurring there for the past three weeks. Electronic doors locked behind you as you entered.  Everyone in the hospital fears for his safety, and all the characters are fighting for their survival.  Will you be the last one to survive? To do so, you must eliminate all your opponents before they eliminate you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Lone Survivor is for each player to try to keep his/her character alive until there are no other players.  To survive, you need to eliminate all your opponents before they get you.  When only one player is the lone survivor, the game ens and that player is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to eliminate opponents, you must first move around the hospital and acquire a weapon.  Movement is accomplished via playing cards, while weapons can be picked up from their starting location, or stolen from another player.  A player may eliminate another player at the end of their turn if (1) you have a murder weapon in your possession, (2)you and your victim are the only two players in the room, and (3) you have the appropriate murder weapon card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
