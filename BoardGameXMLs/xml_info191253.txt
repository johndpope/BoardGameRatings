			<description>Shallows is a 2-6 player card battle game using 42 custom Whailz with unique abilities in a free for all competitive fray that can be played again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shallows uses a unique 6 suite Attack/defense system that is very easy to learn but allows each player to be unique in both his strategy and combat style. Players can opt for a fully aggressive tactic or even defensive approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanics is a combination of War and Mag Blast, but with the decision making on the player's side, not the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On top of that, this game is packed with parodies. From SNES games to 90's cartoons, animes to internet jokes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
