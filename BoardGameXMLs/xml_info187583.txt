							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Riders of the Pony Express</name>
									
			<description>As riders for the Pony Express, you'll risk life and limb to make a buck in the old west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spend 3 weeks in the saddle, claiming parcels and planning your route from Missouri to California and back. Make your deliveries and pick up helpful items along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riders of the Pony Express uses a unique and tense &amp;quot;count-up&amp;quot; auction to claim parcels every round, and then hazard tiles can spice up the roues between towns, forcing players to stay flexible with their plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rider with the most cash at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
