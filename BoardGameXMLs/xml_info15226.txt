							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Funky Phantom Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the 70's TV cartoon. &amp;quot;Funky Phantom&amp;quot; and his pet cat &amp;quot;Boo&amp;quot;, who lived during the American Revolutionary War, appear as ghosts to three teenagers and their dog when they stumble upon Funky's haunted abode. The time was twelve midnight. In the play of the game, the players collect units of hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll the dice and move along the track the number of spaces indicated. If you land on a Black Ghost space, you draw a card. Number cards (from 1 to 4) represent hours. A Boo The Cat card allows you to travel backwards for a turn. If you land on another player who does not occupy a Safe space, you may steal one of the player's cards. The first player who has a number of cards that total exactly 12 hours wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
