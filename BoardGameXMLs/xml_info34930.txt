			<description>A game about racing to the Moon and back, while avoiding pitfalls that open up in the board during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: &lt;br/&gt;- 8 wooden pawns in 4 colours (red, green, yellow, blue)&lt;br/&gt;- A 14&amp;quot; square board with a spinner, showing concentric zones players travel through (Launch Pad - Entry - Orbit - Moon Landing - Orbit - Re-entry - Safe Landing on Earth). The board has 40 holes in it, with a separate cardboard disc underneath. The bottom disc has 21 holes and can be rotated incrementally so through-and-through holes open and close in the board as they match up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have two pawns each, spin to see who starts (this is the only function of the spinner in the game), then move one space at a time from Launch Pad through the different zones, then back to Earth. If he lands on a hole in the &amp;quot;Orbit&amp;quot; zone that shows a dot in his colour, he can &amp;quot;shoot the Space Gun&amp;quot; (rotate the bottom disc one space left or right using a finger hole). This will make some new holes open and others close in the board, and any pawns falling through new holes must begin again. The winner is the first player to have both his pawns complete the journey to the Moon and back again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box says this game was based on &amp;quot;Outer Space Station #1&amp;quot; by Abel-Klinger, a game publisher in West Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
