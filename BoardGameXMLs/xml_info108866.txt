			<description>Forza Motorsport 4 is a racing video game by Turn 10 Studios for the Xbox 360. It is the fourth installment in the Forza Motorsport series, and was released in North America on October 11, 2011, in Europe on October 14, and the rest of the world on October 20. The game is the first in the series to support the Kinect sensor alongside the traditional controller-based gameplay. The achievements for Forza Motorsport 4 were released on August 27, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;Turn 10 has entered a multiple year partnership with the BBC's Top Gear. The content provided by the BBC's BAFTA award-winning television show Top Gear, includes narration from presenter Jeremy Clarkson during the virtual showroom (Autovista) navigation. The game will also feature the Top Gear test track at Dunsfold Aerodrome, near the village of Cranleigh, UK. The first in-game demo of Jeremy Clarkson in Autovista was revealed at E3 2011. An extra piece of content for Top Gear fans is the addition of the reasonably priced car, the Kia Cee'd. At E3, players were able to complete laps of the Top Gear Test Track and record their own times. The Top Gear test track in Forza 4 also features authentic camera angles during replays. The game also features Top Gear &amp;quot;Car Football&amp;quot; as part of the World Tour Mode, and also a Top Gear bowling mini game, both set on the official Top Gear test track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Forza Motorsport 4&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
