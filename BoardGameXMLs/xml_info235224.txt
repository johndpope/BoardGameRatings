			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The Working Mangonel is part of the Castle Builder System. It is made of &amp;quot;Dwarvenite&amp;quot; and contains some metal and rubber parts. This item was initially available as an add-on to a pledge level during the Castle Builder System Kickstarter.  It was not advertised during the Kickstarter campaign but was made available during the final order. The item comes in both painted and unpainted versions. There is also a painted error version that went to Kickstarter backers. The painted error version followed the raw sculpted model as a paint scheme instead of the artist paint guide.  Properly painted mangonels were sent to all kickstart backers who purchased the mangonel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Working Mangonel comes with these 13 pieces:&lt;br/&gt;(2) Catapult Blade         &lt;br/&gt;(1) Mangonel     &lt;br/&gt;(6) Catapult Stone         &lt;br/&gt;(2) Catapult Dragon Head         &lt;br/&gt;(2) Catapult Boar Head&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
