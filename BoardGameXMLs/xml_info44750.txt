			<description>From the back of the 96-page book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A NEW GAME for use with CHILL PLUS NEW CHILL RULES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a whole new maul-game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part One: The CREATURE FEATURE game.  YOU play the creatures in this delightfully weird CHILL game variant.&lt;br/&gt;- Play a werewolf... and bite the hand that feeds you!&lt;br/&gt;- Play a vampire... and put some new blood in your adventures!  CREATURE FEATURE is a whole new, fully developed game in 55 dark-humored pages. (You still need the CHILL game to play.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Two: New combat rules for CHILL.  Do you know the difference between a .45 and a standard NATO round? Think a spear should be less deadly than a musket when you're playing CHILL or CREATURE FEATURE? Then these are rules you've been waiting for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Three: New slants on S.A.V.E. Now envoys can battle one-on-one with a ghost, beyond the realm of their bodies! At last, S.A.V.E. presents the highly dangerous Incorporeal Disciplines: Seance, Leave the Body, and Incorporeal Attack. It's a whole new form of the Art! You'll also discover new skills and new equipment, and the modern S.A.V.E. organization. Don't-miss reading for every CHILL player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is designed for use with the CHILL role-playing game. Be sure to look for other fine products from Pacesetter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
