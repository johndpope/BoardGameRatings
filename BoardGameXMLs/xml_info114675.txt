			<description>Party game for up to 10 guests or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each participant is given a card with 24 clues to 24 different items of clothing. The clues can be quite cryptic so the game would have been better played as a team game. Several brains are usually better than just one. Example clue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clue: A bay&lt;br/&gt;Answer: Cardigan&lt;br/&gt;(Cardigan Bay is a well known area of Wales)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answer to each clue is an article or wearing apparel. The individual or team who get the most correct answers, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One in a range of games named as The &amp;quot;Dainty&amp;quot; Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
