			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World Empire III is the third game in the World Empire series.  You compete with up to seven other AI or human players to take over the world by means of attacking neighbouring countries.  Combat is resolved via an electronic dice roll.  Some countries share your ideology so are easier to conquer and maintain.  Keep too few armies in a hostile country and you risk a revolution occurring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released as shareware, with the full game available for purchase via mail order.  The shareware game did not have the 'expert' mode with fewer starting armies, and only permitted one AI opponent to be chosen whereas the full game allowed up to seven AI players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
