			<description>A quick memory game which consists of 8 disc like shallow cups that stack to form a tower. In the cup is a number, 1, 2 or 3. Each player has two chips and the aim is to move them onto a 1 disc, then from there onto a 2 disc and from there onto a 3 disc and then off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to do this wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the discs are stacked, only the number of the top one is visible and this disc is never in play. Each player in turn, breaks the stack somewhere to check the number. If it is a 1 you can place a chip on it, close the stack as you found it then break it somewhere (like a deck of cards, pick up half, place down, and put bottom half on top).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, when you open the stack, you find a disc with your chip on it, you can break it a second time. If the second break reveals a disc 1 higher than the one your chip is on, you can move it. So, if you split the stack and find you chip on a 1 disc, you can split it again and if you find a 2 disc move the chip from the 1 to the 2. Either way you close the stack as you found it again and only if you moved a chip, break it somewhere again (to confuse others). If you reveal a disc on your first break which has your chip on a 3 you can remove it from the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this way you move chips from 1 to 2 to 3. Always trying to remember which discs you've seen and which you have not, and what's on them - in face of every successful player breaking the stack quickly and nimbly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
