							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Porpher&#039;s Enchanted Garden</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure Beyond the Crystal Cave, Porpher's Enchanted Garden is for characters level 3-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago on this lovely Isle of Gartez, there lived a beautiful half-elven princess, Caerwyn, with her human lover, Porpher Blahar, a magic-user of some power. She, being a woman who knew, and got, what she wanted, had a beautiful garden created. Porpher is said to have laid an enchantment on it to enhance the garden's beauty, and pleasantly to beguile and tease those honored few who, on occasion, were invited as guests to enjoy the garden of their hosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But alas, all flesh is mortal, and even elves must die. So it was with Caerwyn in the fullness of time. After her passing, Porpher caused a tomb to be raised in the midst of the home that had given them both such delight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then he went about, and placed upon the garden new enchantments, bolder enchantments, of a more powerful kind, to guard and preserve its peacefulness from all intruders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When this task was done, he ceased his personal magicks and allowed his own life to slip away, leaving instructions that he and she should lie together for all eternity in the tomb within the garden of their love, so that even in death they would not be apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So it remains to this very day. There have been those who tried, spurred on by greed created with stories of great treasure entombed with the two lovers. For that is always the way with men -- give him a mystery, and he must solve it. Many failed to even enter the garden, and those who have and returned after a *cough* long absense, their minds and memories seemed to have been... altered. And I want to know what happened to my daughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
