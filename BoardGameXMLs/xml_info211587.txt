							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happier Little Automatons</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a happy little expansion to a happy little expansion, and it's sold right here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lowbie tinkers, this one's for you! The Remedial Tinkering line represents a dramatic shift in the way tinker expansions are designed and delivered. Rather than focusing on long-term class goals, Remedial Tinkering presents new subsystems that are viable right out of the gate at level 1 and only get better with more investment at the later levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happier Little Automatons expands upon the [Paint] invention subtype first released in Endzeitgeist top 10 nominee Happy Little Automatons. Unlike most inventions, paint is fairly easy to apply; while it can be quite difficult to add, say, a lightning gun to an automaton after it has already been turned on, a slathering of red paint (which, of course, makes it go faster) is as easy as upending a bucket. As a result, those who invest in [Paint] will find that this subtype is incredibly malleable and allows for the quick swapping of minor bonuses whenever and wherever, with some fancy inventions that consume coats of paint for larger, albeit temporary bonuses. Combo play, artistic hauteur, and somehow making lightning bolts use paint for fuel is the name of the game with Happier Little Automatons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happier Little Automatons absolutely requires Happy Little Automatons and the original Tinker Base Class to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An invention subtypes cheat sheet for those who don't have all the tinker expansions&lt;br/&gt;4 new tinker innovations&lt;br/&gt;2 new tinker greater innovations&lt;br/&gt;16 new tinker inventions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
