			<description>Clowns are moving around on a circus game board (using two dice). At first, they are trying to lure spectators into the tent by getting together in one square; later (when all seats in the color matching the clown's are occupied) they try to make them laugh. The audience consists of wooden chips with a serious and a smiling side, so they can be flipped over when they are laughing. The first color to have only laughing spectators, wins. At first, however, the colors are secret, so nobody knows who plays which color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
