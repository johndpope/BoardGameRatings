			<description>Swizz players use card decks to move their playing pieces around the board. As in its sister game, PanGaea, players must collect eleven special cards - in this case, they're called Resort Cards. When a player has collected eleven Resort Cards and lands on the start/finish space, the game ends. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
