							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flesh and Bone, the Devil&#039;s Throne</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of an interior map of the center of Hell .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome to Hell, newly damned souls!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare to enter Hell and take on all manner of demons and devils to reach the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Throne? This map is perfect for that campaign ending fight with a demon or devil and ending their evil machinations that have plagued the characters the length of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flesh and Bone, the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Throne is a mature, interior map of the center of Hell. The ceiling, floor, and walls are made of bones and sinew. Every step in the place makes a sound like bones cracking or a squishing sound as blood oozes out of the muscle mass below your feet. Eye stalks eerily stare out from the walls turning to stare at whoever is nearest. Massive four fingered hands reach up from pits in the room in order to grab newly arrived souls and drag them to their own personal Hell. Bony claws on the walls next to the balcony look like cruel imitations of balustrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flesh and Bone, the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Throne is intended for use in fantasy and horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infernal Judgment: The Devil sits on his skull throne made of the bones of demons and devils that have dared to defy him. From his throne the Devil judges the new arrivals to Hell, inflicting all manner of tortures equitable to the crimes the souls committed in life. After judgment they are kicked off the balcony to the four-fingered hands by his servants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters could be these newly arrived souls. For example, they could be playing their evil characters that have died over the years. Rather than accept punishment for their actions in life, they band together and try to take on the Devil and take his place. Without the gear they had in life, this may be a difficult task. Perhaps the Devil laughs at their attempted coup and makes them an offer to join his armies to fight Heaven&amp;rsquo;s own army of angels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or the Player Characters battle through Hell to get here and witness this scene. They came here to kill the Devil in the name of the holy Gods, but may realize that someone must take his place if he is slain to judge the newly arrived dead. Or was that one of the Player Character&amp;rsquo;s goals all along?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
