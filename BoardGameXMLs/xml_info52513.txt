			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of the progress made by Orion agents in the past, the small Carribbean republic of San Cristobal is still in peril. Political intrigues are boiling up within the country while ouside powers continue exporting their own brands of trouble to the tiny island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the duly elected president struggles to solve his country's problems, the deposed dictator quietly plots his return. A renewed military government would be a disaster for both Orion and the island itself. Any sort of armed uprising, whether successful or not, would halt the influx of tourists so crucial to San Cristobal's economy. The agents on the scene must uproot any potential coup before it gets the chance to begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But forces far more powerful and devious are playing for much higher stakes than control of a minor Carribbean island. Unless checked, the balance of world power could be drastically upset and thousands of lives jeopardized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's business as usual in San Cristobal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
