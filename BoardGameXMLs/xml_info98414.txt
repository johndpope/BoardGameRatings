							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Prix/Demolition Derby</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Prix (1 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, start your engines! The starting gun fires, and you're off in a flash, careening around dangerous turns in the race for the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Prix gives you all the excitement of formula-style racing, with three different race tracks and two skill levels to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Grand Prix is to be the first race car to reach the finish line. To check your racing time, watch the time clock in the upper middle part of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the race has started, use the joystick to move your car around the track. But, be careful not to crash into the other cars or into the race track walls. Skillful driving maneuvers are as important for success as high speeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first car to reach the finish line after completing the specified number of laps is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demolition Derby (1 to 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the thrills of a live demolition derby! Contestants ram their cars into each other until only one car remains running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the last car remaining on the field with your engine still running. Points start at the number you specify, but one point is lost each time a car is hit in the front. When a car finally reaches 0 points, it is out of commission. The last car with points remaining (and engine running) is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll stay in the competition longer by protecting the front end of your car and backing into your opponents. In this way, your car's radiator, engine, etc. will remain intact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
