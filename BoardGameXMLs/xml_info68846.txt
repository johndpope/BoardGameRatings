			<description>This is a game where players move their pawns around a hexagonal-grid board, and absorb bursts of radioactivity.  These bursts occur at random locations.  Each player uses the radiation they absorb to acquire cards with different abilities. The players battle each other until there is only one player left.&lt;br/&gt;The Mutant Abilities are tongue-in-cheek, and are of three different types, depending on the type of radiation absorbed: Alpha, Beta, or Gamma.&lt;br/&gt;The players track their hit points on seperate player sheets with plastic tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are expanded rules for serial/campaign play where players keep some attributes between games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
