							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enterprise: the Elite Trading Game</name>
									
			<description>Enterprise is a real estate trading game, with some resemblance to Monopoly, but with elaborations. While it is designed in Australia, and uses a few Australian expressions, the content and theme are not noticeably Australian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing area is a simulation of a planned city, divided into two zones : an inner Residential ring and an outer Industrial ring. The play proceeds on a circular track, with each ring containing a series of &amp;ldquo;sites&amp;rdquo;, of which two aggregate to a &amp;ldquo;subdivision&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate objective is to &amp;ldquo;evenly develop&amp;rdquo; as many of these sites as possible, without going broke !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Residential zone can be developed by building Cottages, Mansions, and Flats(apartments), while the Industrial zone is available for a variety of uses, represented by card &amp;ldquo;shares&amp;rdquo;( stocks). It is NOT necessary to land on a particular site to purchase it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate between each ring according to dice throws, and pay penalties for landing on other Players&amp;rsquo; sites. Several spaces mandate change of zone. Movement is subject to considerable randomization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives an initial land allocation of two &amp;ldquo;subdivisions&amp;rsquo; (two sites each of Residential and Industrial) ; plus a cash &amp;ldquo;float&amp;rdquo;. Players proceed to buy development items, initially from the bank. The pool of available items is limited, to induce competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inventory comprises: Cottages 14, Mansions 10, Flats 6 ( total 30). The space available to place these items totals 24. Prices range from a low of $100 for &amp;ldquo;Cottages&amp;rdquo; to $400 for a &amp;ldquo;share&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;Electronics&amp;rdquo; factory. More expensive items eventually provide a disproportionately higher return, but may be too expensive in the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are able to increase the value of their holdings by increasing the capital investment on each site from a single unit up to two units and/or more valuable buildings and upgraded shares. Any site must contain only identical items, but any subdivision may contain a mix ( eg cottages and mansions on adjacent sites; or, say, &amp;ldquo;railway&amp;rdquo; shares next to &amp;ldquo;glass works&amp;rdquo;).Various bonuses accrue when sites are &amp;ldquo;double developed&amp;rdquo; and/or when sites are &amp;ldquo;evenly developed&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These development items are available initially from a bank, but soon become tradeable between Players. Players short of cash for Landing fees may even have to trade/sell at &amp;ldquo;distress&amp;rdquo; prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all a Player&amp;rsquo;s sites are &amp;ldquo;evenly developed&amp;rdquo;, Players can attempt to buy more &lt;br/&gt;(vacant) land, from the bank only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has several unusual features:&lt;br/&gt;1. &amp;ldquo;stock&amp;rsquo; ( houses, shares etc) can be moved from one site to another, or even &amp;ldquo;off board&amp;rdquo; until required again.&lt;br/&gt;2. un-developed sites attract no landing fees (unlike Monopoly)&lt;br/&gt;3. there is some limited scope for trading of rationed items above their &amp;ldquo;bank price&amp;rdquo;, as Players seek to establish &amp;ldquo;double developed&amp;rdquo; sites&lt;br/&gt;4. The amount of cash available to any Player for buying at any one time is limited by certain arbitrary rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possible faults :&lt;br/&gt;1. The supply of in-coming cash seems too small compared to the amount leaving the Game via random penalties.&lt;br/&gt;2. Arbitrary limits on Players ability to spend seem unnecessary.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Game relies on a &amp;ldquo;Special Lucky Seven&amp;rdquo; rule that is easy to overlook ! &lt;br/&gt;4. The Rules are numbered, thus easy to reference; they are not however, arranged intuitively, and contain a few cryptic passages!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
