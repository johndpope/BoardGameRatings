			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t your reaction speed matter for more then the first round? Do you want Realistic, Standard d20, Cinematic, Martial Arts, or Anime-style combat? The Initiative System you use sets the tone for the entire battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help you customize combat and give your games the exact tone you want, Distant Horizons Games presents Mad Scramble - a dozen Initiative systems, 52 options for customizing them further, and a few new feats, poisons, and bits of magic to round things off. Enough new options to spice up even the most jaded d20 campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have fast and simple systems, detailed systems, systems for Cinematic, Anime, and Martial Arts combat, and several systems which aren't dependent on any one game system. Not only do they all work fine in d20, but you can pull and apply them to any game you play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everyone is in a Mad Scramble you don't want to be caught dead last, do you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad Scramble. Because sometimes, you absolutely, positively, have to go first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
