			<description>Strategic multi-player card game featuring an original, colour-coded, 80 card, tarot based deck. Cards are imbued with &amp;quot;special powers&amp;quot; to help players formulate their plans to dominate gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hand of seven (or eight) cards is dealt to each player. The first player to play all cards in his/her hand, &amp;quot;goes out&amp;quot; and wins the hand with zero Points. The other players count the point value of the cards they are still holding, and record them. A Game consists of five hands. Lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reviving the historic gaming tradition of the Tarot, Tarocchi or Tarok that originated in Europe during the 15th Century... Alliances, Accusations, Attacks, Arguments, Bluffing, Banter, Control, Challenges and Cheating are the ABC's of OCCO. Simple to Learn, Challenging to Master, Fun for ALL AGES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
