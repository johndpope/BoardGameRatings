							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OfficeDungeon: The Quest for Promotion</name>
									
			<description>OfficeDungeon is a card RPG for 2 to 4 players taking a humorous poke at the stereotypical office environment. Choose one of four Heroes and collect Promotion Points to crawl your way to the promotion you've always wanted. But be careful! Your co-workers and Bosses will want to knock you down a peg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the game is to have the most Promotion Points (PP) after either the defeat of the required number of Bosses or when the deck has been played through once. PP has another purpose, however: it is also player's currency, allowing them to purchase equipment, items, and companion creatures to boost their stats and stand a chance against whatever stands in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose their Hero Card at the beginning of the game, each representing an entry level position in the Office. From there, they encounter creatures, loot, and the dreaded Instant cards as they work their way through the 90-card deck. A simple, stat-based combat system and the ability to make your own shady backroom deals between players facilitate quick, competitive play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
