			<description>Author Summary'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A nest of goblins has sprung up in the hills near the baron's manor house. The local peasants complain of missing chickens, polluted streams, ungodly stench, and humanoid hooligans who won't get off their lawn. Something must be done!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The call has gone out from the baron. Any of his household servants who help to rid the land of this nuisance will receive a Saturday off&amp;mdash;with pay!  But his patience is limited. Near sundown he will visit the goblin den personally, and if he doesn't like what he sees his soldiers will drive the goblins away. Will you heed the call to adventure? Will you succeed in remodeling the goblin den? Will the baron reward you with Sunday off, so you can sleep in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Draperies is a light-hearted fantasy makeover game for three or more players. The baron's servants know how to run a household&amp;mdash;but can they teach an unruly goblin tribe to be good neighbors? They have only twelve hours to make the goblin den sanitary and presentable, prepare a reception for the baron, make an assortment of appetizing hors d'oeuvres containing absolutely no rat meat, and teach the goblins basic court manners. If they succeed, the baron will reward them; if they fail, they earn the baron's wrath, and the goblin tribe will be evicted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
