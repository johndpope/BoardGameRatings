							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flying Saucer: Vessel of Abduction</name>
									
			<description>From the Editorial Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flying Saucer is the seventh in the series of V&amp;amp;V locations &lt;br/&gt;presented as free PDF downloads by Dave Woodrum.  It is also the second of those that are a bit longer and intended to provide a more complete package for the GM with which to run adventures &amp;ndash; hence, it is the second to be termed a &amp;ldquo;play set.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flying Saucer is in some ways a sequel to the Tabloid Office location in that it uses the information provided in that action location about the alien Greys. Herein the Greys are used in a solo play mini-adventure.  Yes, this is the first time that a &amp;ldquo;freebie&amp;rdquo; includes a complete mini-adventure and we all hope that this addition is well-received by GMs and players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As editor, it is nice to see another such product from Dave Woodrum, who had been ultra-busy with course work from job related classes over the past several months.  Dave is also fully involved in the preparation of other projects for use with the Villains &amp;amp; Vigilantes game system and we can look forward to more of his creativity in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scott B. Bizar, Editor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
