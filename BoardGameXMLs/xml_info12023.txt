							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Omaha:  The Battle for the Beach</name>
									
			<description>Omaha: The Battle for the Beach is a free-for-downloading game available from the Armchair General website.  A Download Key is required; this is available to purchasers of the July 2004 issue of the magazine.  The download itself consists of a zipped Adobe Acrobat file, from which the downloader will need to print 10 pages of rules, tables, counters, and the map.  A color printer is recommended, but the game can be played on a black-and-white printout.  The rules are designed for easy assimilation and allow for a two-player game or a solitaire American player.  The download page contains a short historical background of the Omaha beach landing and several paragraphs of designer's notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has been redeveloped by the new LnLP staff improving the counters, maps, rules, and scenarios in the game.  You can find the new edition at&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230075/devils-beach-omaha-landings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230075/devils-beach-omah...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://store.lnlpublishing.com/category/battles-on-demand/the-devils-beach-omaha-landings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://store.lnlpublishing.com/category/battles-on-demand/t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have purchased Omaha: The Battle for the Beach at the current LnLP Store, we will provide you a FREE Print and Play edition that you can be download from your order history from the LnLP Store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Print On Demand Edition: The Print On Demand Edition includes full color printed, manual, player aid cards, larger maps, and counters printed on Sticker sheets and chit board to mount them on.
