							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boar King</name>
									
			<description>Here comes the Boar King! It messes up the crops and attacks other boars and people. To keep peace in the mountain, the brave boar hunters are recruited for the hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready? Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to put some glorious tattoo on your face as a token of blessings and braveness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal one player aid card and one hunter marker to each player. The game starts with the youngest player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In clockwise order, each player rolls the die and everyone acts according to the image shown on the die result. The player who is the last to perform the appropriate action must be painted a brush of tattoo on his face by one of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends immediately when at least one player&amp;rsquo;s face has been painted with six brushes of tattoo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
