			<description>Super Double Dragon, known in Japan as Return of Double Dragon (リターン・オブ・双截龍), is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. It was published by Technos Japan Corp. in Japan and by Tradewest in North America and the PAL region. Super Double Dragon is the fourth console game in the Double Dragon series developed by Technos, following previous titles for the NES, although unlike the NES games, Super Double Dragon is an original title and not based on any preceding arcade version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with previous installments of the series, the player takes control of martial artists Billy and Jimmy in their fight against the Shadow Warriors gang. The objective is to proceed through each stage and defeat all enemies, including a boss. The game consists of seven stages, which includes a casino, an airport, a martial arts gym, a fight atop a moving truck, a city slum, a forest, and the hideout of the boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the punch, kick, and jump buttons, the player now has a guard button for blocking attacks. If the player times the guard button right, their character can not only defend against an enemy's punch, they can also put certain enemies in an arm grab, leaving the enemy vulnerable to successive attacks. There's also a &amp;quot;Dragon Power&amp;quot; gauge under the life gauge, which the player can fill by holding down L or R buttons. While the gauge is filling up, the player can perform special attacks which vary depending on how much power the player has accumulated, which includes a flying hurricane kick. If the power gauge is completely filled, then the player's regular attacks will gain extra strength for a limited period. In contrast to previous Double Dragon games, Jimmy Lee (the Player 2 character) has different punching attacks than Billy Lee (Player 1). In the Japanese version, his Roundhouse Kick is also different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Double Dragon&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
