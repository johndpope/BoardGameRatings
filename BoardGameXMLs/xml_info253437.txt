							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Age of Steam Expansion: Kansas City Interurban</name>
									
			<description>Kansas City&amp;rsquo;s boom days of interurban railways started in the early 1900s and went away just as fast in the 1930s due to the rise of the automobile. This expansion map reflects the rapid growth of interurban railways and the competition to keep growing or go bust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Age of Steam expansion map features a Power Plant track in place of the Engine (Locomotive) track of the base game and requires players to make deliveries equal to or greater than their best delivery. All players start in hexes adjacent to Kansas City and expand outwards. The initial cost for the starting spaces and building a power plant make the beginning game very costly. Players must carefully consider pushing forward for longer deliveries because once they are done, there is no going back to shorter deliveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion map was released for attendees of the  inaugural Age of Steam Con in March 2018 and then made available for purchase at and after HeavyCon in May 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
