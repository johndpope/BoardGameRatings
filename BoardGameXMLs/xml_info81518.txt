							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Keg for Dragon (Savage Worlds)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northpoint is a remote village with no particular claim to fame other than its location in the foothills of the Ridgeline Mountains, home to an ancient dwarven kingdom known for its potent whiskey. Our heroes are traveling there to visit an old friend, an acquaintance, or to follow up on some rumor of your choosing when they are drawn into the village&amp;rsquo;s dilemma. The Iron Legion, a vicious tribe of imperialistic orcs, has recently begun to threaten the villagers, and have already cut off most travel along the North Road. Their intent is clear &amp;ndash; the conquest of Northpoint. For some reason, the Compact of Clipwing has not been honored, and the dragon that protects the village is nowhere to be seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our debut fantasy adventure, A Keg for Dragon is designed to be played in a single evening for a group of 4-6 players with characters of all experience levels, but works well for a starting group or as a one-shot break from your existing campaign. Easily integrated into any fantasy milieu, Old School Fantasy works well with the Fantasy Companion, and introduces no new rules or edges. You bring with it what you will. Ready for fantasy? Remember, Reality Blurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
