			<description>Pokk&amp;eacute;n Tournament is an arcade fighting game that combines gameplay elements from Bandai Namco's Tekken series with characters from the Pok&amp;eacute;mon franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pokk&amp;eacute;n Tournament, similar to the Tekken series, is a fighting game in which two fighters battle against each other using various Pok&amp;eacute;mon. Unlike most arcade fighting games, which use a traditional joystick and buttons, the arcade version is played using console-style controllers, which are designed so that players who are not used to arcade sticks can get into the game more easily. The game is planned to focus more on action, as opposed to the more technical gameplay of Tekken, allowing both hardcore and casual fans to enjoy it. As such, players can perform various techniques taken from the Pok&amp;eacute;mon series, such as special moves and Mega Evolutions (which can be built up from attacks using a 'Resonance Gauge'). Currently, nine characters, Lucario, Machamp, Suicune, Gardevoir, Pikachu, Gengar, Weavile, Charizard, and Blaziken have been announced, the latter becoming available in an upcoming update. Assist characters are also available to use: currently, Emolga, Fennekin, Snivy, Frogadier, Eevee, Lapras, Whimsicott and Jirachi and are confirmed as supports. Additionally, the game will not feature fighters from the Tekken series.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pokkén Tournament&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
