			<description>&amp;quot;The last of the Daleks have invaded the TARDIS Console Room. And it&amp;rsquo;s up to the Eighth Doctor, Romana and K9 to stop them from taking over the TARDIS. Whoever controls the TARDIS controls all of Causality.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three units. The Doctor player has the Eighth Doctor, Romana, and K9. The Dalek player has three Daleks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conflict takes place in four TARDIS areas: the Console Room, Library, Clock Garden, and Altar Room. Each player has a card deck which is used to randomly determine movement between the four areas. The cards are also used to resolve combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to defeat all opposing units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
