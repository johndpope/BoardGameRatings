			<description>From the rule-book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of all blistergames is to win by being the last player or team, with one or more active blisterpieces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with dice.  There are two styles of dice:  the blisterpieces (which have a different symbol on each die face) and the blisterblockers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book provides six variations of the game:  blisterboxes, blisterangles, blistercrosses, blistertriangles, blisterpokes and blisterballs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the variation in play the blisterpieces are oriented such that they all have the same symbol showing.  The symbol in play determines the movement that is allowed for that particular die (i.e. Blisterangles must move horizontally and vertically, Blisterpokes can move either horizontally or vertically).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequence of gameplay is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Player 1 rolls the 8-side die.  &lt;br/&gt;Player 1 moves one piece (die) the number rolled ensuring they follow the movement rules determined by the symbol on the die.&lt;br/&gt;If the die ends its move within 6 squares with direct line of sight a &amp;quot;Blistermatch&amp;quot; may be started.  During a Blistermatch the two dice being disputed is fought over.  If one player can form the take-out pattern (identified in the rules) the losing die is eliminated.  If a Blistermatch reaches a stalemate it ends and the game resumes as normal.&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay continues with alternating turns until one player eliminates the other players pieces or a stale mate occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
