							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder at the North Pole!</name>
									
			<description>It was a sad, sad day in Santa City at the North Pole when the body of Jolly JoJo, Chief Elf and toy designer, was discovered by Ebba Sneezer Scrooge, in the main toyshop.  Poor Jolly was found standing on one leg in a bucket of hardened cement.  He had been blindfolded and duct tape had been wrapped around his mouth. And oddly enough, his arms were straight up in the air&amp;hellip;and his hair stood on end!! My goodness, Jolly was quite the sight, he looked like he had quite the fright&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;and he certainly  must have ticked someone off - big time!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell us more&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For decades, Jolly JoJo had been an employee of Claus Enterprises and was in charge of toy design.  He began his fabulous career with the creation of &amp;quot;Mr. Zucchini Head&amp;quot; which proved to be incredibly popular with children all over the world. Jolly then went on to invent &amp;quot;Darbie&amp;quot;, the first doll ever designed with an hour-glass figure and an &amp;quot;out of this world&amp;quot; wardrobe.  After &amp;quot;Darbie&amp;quot; came &amp;quot;G.I. Jose&amp;quot; and an array of other action figures quickly followed.  He was there at the infancy of computerized video games and the rest is history. His genius and adaptability to the new venue of entertainment was astonishing&amp;hellip;.and his most amazing success, the creation of the action packed hand-held computer game series featuring &amp;quot;Volcano Vinnie&amp;quot;, won him universal fame&amp;hellip;..so, it's  no wonder, Santa adored him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what Happened?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was Christmas Eve and Santa had just left for his annual, around-the-world toy distribution trip.  As a long time North Pole tradition, all residents of Santa City gathered in the Town Square, waved goodbye to Santa and then headed off to the Candy Cane Cabaret to celebrate another successful season. Everyone was having a grand old time&amp;hellip;..when Ebba Sneezer Scrooge, toyshop foreman, noticed that Jolly JoJo was nowhere to be seen.  Scrooge decided to hightail it over to the toyshop and lo and behold, there he found Jolly&amp;hellip;..who wasn't looking very jolly at all, in fact he was quite dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some guests include Frostbite and Snowflake Snowmanelli (toy inventors), Holly Berry (greenhouse supervisor), Ebba Sneezer Scrooge (toyshop foreman), Don Blitzen (stable keeper), Noel Angelino (JoJo's guardian angel), Bob Humbug (Santa's navigational coordinator), Sweet Wings (sugar plum fairy), Kirby Marlow (Ghost of Christmas Past), Ginger Snap (cookie baker), Capt. Pistachio (nutcracker) and of course, the Clauses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
