							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ALONe: A Solo Game Engine</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Lonesome October Night (ALONe) is a single-player role playing game engine that focuses on narrative. ALONe&amp;rsquo;s system helps you maintain internal consistency even while taking advantage of the most important thing that a solo game offers: no feet to tread on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ALONe, all characters, abilities, and stories are equally valid. Whether you wish to play a street urchin in a steampunk nightmare or an immortal demi-god leading an army against the lords of Avalon, the same rules will apply. Without any other player characters of differing power levels, or any players who have different assumptions and desires, ALONe can easily handle any situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, to keep things interesting, ALONe allows you to impose randomness, challenge, and the risk of not only failure, but of qualified and costly success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game requires the use of The GameMaster's Apprentice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
