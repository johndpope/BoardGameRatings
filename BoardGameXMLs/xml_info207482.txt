			<description>Stevepunk is a mysterious character representing the farthest reaches. He tells wild stories of incredible flying machines and steam powered weapons. Everyone loves him, but no one really trusts him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fan made expansion for Council of Blackthorn. Copies of this were handed out at Gen Con 2016 by Stevepunk himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stevepunk claims: This expansion is banned in 7 states and 2 Canadian provinces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stevepunk adds 1 additional Council Member to choose from at the beginning of the game with unique actions and abilities.
