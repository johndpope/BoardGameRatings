			<description>Batter Up is a Baseball card game (using the rules of baseball) consisting of 36 cards and a fold out paper &amp;quot;field&amp;quot; depicting the Baseball diamond. The cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BALL (x11) &lt;br/&gt;FLY OUT (x2)&lt;br/&gt;STRIKE (x10)&lt;br/&gt;FOUL BALL (x2)&lt;br/&gt;STOLEN BASE (x1) &lt;br/&gt;OUT (x3)&lt;br/&gt;SINGLE (x3)&lt;br/&gt;DOUBLE (x2)&lt;br/&gt;TRIPLE (x1)&lt;br/&gt;HOME RUN (x1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player at bat shuffles the cards, turning over 1 card at a time, until he gets a hit or an out. If he gets a hit, he places the card on the indicated base. The play is carried on as in an actual baseball game. When 3 outs are made, the playing side is retired. The opposing team comes to bat and the cards are reshuffled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rules can be made. For example, it is optional to advance all base runners one extra base on a single and a double. This game may also be played as a party game where players take positions on bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A record of the balls, strikes and outs may be kept by a member of the opposing team calling out each card as it is turned over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
