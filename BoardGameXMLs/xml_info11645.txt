			<description>In 1982 two Italian journalists and historians, Indro Montanelli and Mario Cervi, published a 10-volumes encyclopedia about the history of the modern wars: from American Revolution to latest conflicts (Korea and Vietnam). The name of the work has been Due Secoli di Guerre: &amp;ldquo;Two Centuries of Wars&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emilio Ceretti, chief of the Editrice Giochi, asked to Alex Randolph to invent a boardgame inspired to the encyclopedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being impossible to simulate battles in a period of time from gunpowder to jet fighters, the result is a sort of an abstract wargame which tries to contain some fixed elements of war: strength vs. mobility, random factor, and bluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game components are:&lt;br/&gt;-a board with an irregular tessellation&lt;br/&gt;-60 grey pieces with 3 holes each&lt;br/&gt;-120 flags, 30 for every color (red, green, yellow, blue)&lt;br/&gt;-the &amp;ldquo;bluffing bell&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player gets 30 flags of his color, and places them on 15 grey pieces. A piece with 3 flags has strength 3 and can move one space. A piece with 2 flags has strength 2 and can move up to two spaces&amp;hellip; and I think the readers can guess the features of a piece with one flag on it&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player enters his units in the map from one side, and tries to win being the first to reach the opposite side with one of his units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat system is quite original, and uses the &amp;ldquo;bluffing bell&amp;rdquo;. This is a little device similar to an hand-bell, containing two little 6-sided dices. Shaking the device makes the dices roll, and pressing the device on the table causes the dices to be blocked on their result. After the pressing of the &amp;ldquo;bell&amp;rdquo;, the player who is using it can pull it up and see the result, without showing it to other players. The player can repeat the shaking a number of times equal to the number of his flags involved in the combat, until he is satisfied (or wants to feign to be satisfied) by the result: at this point he can declare a result (obviously he can declare a number different from the real one!)&lt;br/&gt;The opponent can now accept the declared result, and then try to get and declare an higher number; elsewhere he can try to see the bluff&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entering the central red square allows the player to aim an &amp;ldquo;artillery shot&amp;rdquo; to an enemy unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Alex Randolph&amp;rsquo;s ludography compiled by Philippe Evrard, &amp;ldquo;Due Secoli di Guerre&amp;rdquo; has been published only in Italy by Editrice Giochi, and there is no report about editions in other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
