			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are dwarves, you know what that means, right?  Do you?  Have you put any thoughts into them or are they just clones from that trilogy of movies?  And even if they are clones - how is their government working?  Better yet, how is their technology?  Their magic?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not just a high fantasy role-playing game, this is YOUR high fantasy role-playing game!  You don&amp;rsquo;t want to put weeks into writing up how your dwarven culture works, but you do want it to be your own.  That&amp;rsquo;s what Small Bites are all about - giving you ideas, outlines and that little spark to get you going so you can get your world into the shape you want as quickly as possible.  This edition is going to help all you GMs and world builders out there create that extra level of fun and make your games more enjoyable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Player and Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 15 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 38 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
