			<description>Subtitle: Guns, Mayhem &amp;amp; Sexy, Sexy Freaks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea for this game developed out of the current political climate. The vision of seeing military vehicles patrolling New York city a couple of years ago, and the sight of seeing military hardware banked up outside Heathrow Airport in London, set me thinking. The idea of democracy can quickly change &amp;ndash; this is a satire of those times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another inspiration was the A.D 2000 comic Judge Dread. I&amp;rsquo;m not a comic reader, but the idea of that particular one always appealed &amp;ndash; a comment on the nature of violence. I thought, why not ante up violence to preposterous levels? Legitimize blowing away entire city blocks, alien spaceships and large genetically modified monsters. As far as commenting upon the nature of violence, just what happens if you are given almost complete freedom to deliver your own brand of justice, Dirty Harry style?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between these proverbial twin-towers, I hope the material as presented hear allows room for some basic political satire, whilst giving the players copious opportunities for destructive mayhem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miami was chosen as a setting for particular reasons. The first one is that it&amp;rsquo;s full of immigrants (mainly from South America). These NPCs add a lot of cultural flavor (Little Havana and Little Haiti). Additionally, the immigrant community often ignores the dictates of the Federal Government &amp;ndash; cue the accession plot line. Miami is also famous for being the drug gateway to the United States; many local airstrips are used to import all-manner of illegal narcotics. There have been many local politicians implicated in drug scandals &amp;ndash; cocaine money has bought political influence throughout the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
