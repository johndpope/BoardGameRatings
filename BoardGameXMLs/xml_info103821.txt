							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jubilee Games Set</name>
									
			<description>In 1977, to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth's reign, ZZota Games published a small boxed set of two games.  Using the same board and tokens, Union Jack and The Great Quarter Century Race Game make up The Jubilee Games Set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Union Jack is a two-player abstract placement game where you are trying to force your opponent to complete a set of red, white and blue tokens in a single line.  Players alternate placing tokens on a 4 x 4 grid (with an extra space in the bottom left).  Tokens must be placed in a proscribed order (red then white then blue).  The player who is forced to complete a set of three colours anywhere in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line is the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Great Quarter Century Race Game, 2-3 players bluff and guess their way through the 25 spaces on the board.  One player will hide a token in a hand and present both hands to the active player, who will select one.  If the hand without the token is chosen, the active player advances on the track, otherwise it is the next player's turn.  Some spaces will cause the token to advance further, and landing on a space occupied by another token will send that token backward on the track.  The first to reach the middle square is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
