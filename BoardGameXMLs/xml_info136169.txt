							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shaman: A Dungeon World Compatible Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one certainty: one day, you will die.&lt;br/&gt;The greatest kings, the lowest criminals, all will one day die. They gather their money, their lands, their connections, in a desperate bid to fend off this truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, though. You embrace this fact. You walk with your ancestors and partake of their wisdom. You bridge the divide between the living and the dead. While others struggle against Death, you are forever one foot in its realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the Cleric and the Wizard have their gods and their magic - they are like children playing with their toys. You take a far older path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of blood, bone and sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shaman is a new class for use with Dungeon World. It also includes two new compendium classes, the potion-brewing Herbalist and the scourge of the undead, the Spirit-Slayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
