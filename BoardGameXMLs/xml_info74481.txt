			<description>&amp;quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan is a 1990 Game Boy game by Konami. The game is based around the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles television series. The Turtles' first Game Boy game is a fairly simple platforming-style game, where Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello must battle against Krang and Shredder and save their friend April O'Neil in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is the first in the VGG series: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controls&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the controls can be altered to suit the player, either jumping with the A button and attacking with the B button, or vice versa. Attacking while in a crouching position causes the player's character to throw a shuriken, while attacking in midair causes him to jump-kick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control one of the Turtles through a total of five stages, battling Krang and Shredder's minions along the way. Enemies include Foot Soldiers, Mousers and Roadkill Rodney among others. If a Turtle runs out of health, he is captured and the player must select another Turtle to pick up where he left off. If all four Turtles are captured, the game is over. One can recover a captured Turtle, as well as regain lost health, by winning the hidden mini-games scattered throughout each stage. The player can also recover health by finding pizza, which is located in certain locations or dropped by defeated enemies. There are a total of five stages, each with a unique end-boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 1 - City Streets and Sewers (Boss: Rocksteady) &lt;br/&gt;Stage 2 - Factory (Boss: Bebop) &lt;br/&gt;Stage 3 - Convoy (Boss: Baxter Stockman) &lt;br/&gt;Stage 4 - Mountain Caverns (Boss: Shredder) &lt;br/&gt;Stage 5 - Technodrome (Boss: Krang) &lt;br/&gt;The player can choose which stage to start the game on, but the game needs to be completed from Stage 1 to see the full ending.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Fall_of_the_Foot_Clan,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
