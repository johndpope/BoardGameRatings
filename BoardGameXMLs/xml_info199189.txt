							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coins &amp; Credit</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within Coins and Credit (our biggest Letter, yet!), we cover the topic of money and how to make it fit in your campaign (and your bag of holding).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of our 8th Letter is all about coins. We cover mundane and magical currency crafting, counterfeiting, coin size, exchange rates, and transportation of coins. Slaying the dragon is great and all, but how many coins can you fit in a leather bag? And is the party barbarian strong enough to carry the whole hoard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part two is on banks. Surely you don't want to lug around all that gold? Even if you got it converted to mithral pieces, tens of thousands of metal coins is a lot for our heroes! We cover the different types of banks, account types, loans, account tiers, the likelihood of finding banks in different settlements, and example banks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, part three covers credit. Don't worry if your head is still spinning from tax season. We make things simple for you and your adventuring party! We cover tabs, letters of credit, promissory notes, banknotes, and magic items to assist in the transfer of wealth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
