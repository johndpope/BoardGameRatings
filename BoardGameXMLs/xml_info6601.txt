							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murderless Mysteries: Arch Villains Anonymous</name>
									
			<description>This is a mystery party game, but NOT a murder mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First in a series called &amp;amp;quot;Murderless Mysteries&amp;amp;quot;, that claim the following difference from other mystery party games:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;There is no murder, the crime to be solved is non-violent.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;An unlimited number of party guests can participate.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;The same game can be played again with a different solution.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot;No one, including the host and even the culprit, can ever be sure of who dunnit, until it is revealed at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 main characters who are encouraged to dress in costume but not required, plus a game leader.  But other guests at the party can ask questions and vote on who they think did it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six main characters in this story are members of a club similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, but they&amp;amp;#039;ve sworn off evil-doings:&lt;br/&gt;Hagatha Grub&amp;mdash;The Activities Director is a wicked old witch who cackles often, sometimes for no apparent reason. Hunched shoulders under black clothing complete with pointy hat, she frequently pets her only friend, her cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Trixie Gimmick&amp;mdash;The Club&amp;amp;#039;s Technical Administrator who runs the club website is an ultimate techo-geek. She prefers machines over people and plays with gadgets all the time, getting a little annoyed when people interrupt her work to talk to her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vanessa Van Avarice&amp;mdash;The club Secretary is a beautiful vamp, vain, ruthless and very greedy. She flirts with all the men and is catty to all the women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Brutus LeCad&amp;mdash; Would you trust a former pirate as Club Treasurer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morley Krupt&amp;mdash;A former gangster makes a great Security Officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barnaby Underwood&amp;mdash;The club Vice President is a stereotypical villain from melodramas. He constantly twirls his large black mustache and has an evil laugh. He doesn&amp;amp;#039;t understand why everyone yells &amp;amp;quot;boo&amp;amp;quot; every time his name is spoken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
