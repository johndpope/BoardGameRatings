			<description>Cold War Battles 2: Pentomic Wurzburg &amp;amp; Kabul '79, (CWB2) presents a low-to-intermediate complexity  operational simulation of campaigns that were fought &amp;ndash; or that could have been fought &amp;ndash; during that long period of military history, 1946-1989. The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated, or could have participated, in those fights. The maps represent the terrain over which those units fought or could have fought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two games are included: Kabul &amp;rsquo;79 (K&amp;rsquo;79), covering the Soviet seizure of the Afghan capital in that year; and Wurzburg Pentomic (WP), the Soviets versus the US in Germany in the mid-to-late 1950s. There are two players in each game. In K&amp;rsquo;79 one player controls the Soviets and the other commands the Afghans plus optional &amp;lsquo;what-if&amp;rsquo; US reinforcements. In WP one player controls the Soviets, the other runs US and West German forces. Both games use a main body of shared rules, and each also has its own special instructions. Designed by Joseph Miranda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maneuver units include: infantry, elite infantry, air assault, airmobile infantry, mechanized Infantry, armor, armored cavalry, recon, special operations, security, military police, engineers, guerillas and headquarters. Ranged artillery types include: field artillery, self-propelled artillery, assault guns, rocket artillery and air defense artillery.&lt;br/&gt;Most units are battalions or regiments, but the entire counter-mix has units within it as large as divisions and as small as companies. Units are one-step, with their reverse sides used to show their &amp;ldquo;untried&amp;rdquo; status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules cover: random events, reinforcements, bombardment, suppression, air power, air mobility, atomic weapons, paratroops, recon, screening, special forces, guerrillas, fire control and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cold War Battles 2: Pentomic Wurzburg &amp;amp; Kabul '79 was published in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #263  Jul/Aug 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pentomic Wurzburg Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn : 12 hours&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company to Brigade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kabul '79 Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1 day&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 273 yards / 250 meters&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company to Brigade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; six color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 16-page Cold War Battles 2 rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium-Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 2-8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
