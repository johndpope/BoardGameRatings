			<description>Dodge Master is a high speed test of reflexes that will challenge your dodging ability throughout the experience. You play as a white block that you must guide through a series of levels that will really test your hand-eye coordination skills. Dodge Master features a lot of variety, you could be going through a maze one level while ducking into alcoves to avoid being crushed in the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dodge Master has very simple controls, you use the arrow keys to move your white block side to side while your block will automatically fall downwards. There are many things that augment the core gameplay of Dodge Master such as blocks that bounce you when you hit them and areas that change the direction in which you fall. Dodge Master will include over 50 handcrafted levels for you to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
