			<description>Explore the continent of South America, from the deepest parts of the Amazon Rain Forest, to the alpine peaks of the Andes, and the resource rich southern tip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the popular Crayon Rails system.  Players receive three demand cards which each have three possible deliveries.  To complete a delivery a player must connect the demanding city with the city that supplies the good it needs.  Building track costs money, and the payout for each load is always going to be slightly less than the cost to build the track to make the connection.  This pricing mechanism forces players to coordinate the deliveries on all three cards to maximize the use of their track in order to turn a profit.  Once one of the three deliveries on a card is made, a new card is drawn to take its place.  Play continues until a player reaches $250 million and has connected all but one of the major cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This print and play game is free to download.  It requires a copy of another crayon rails game for the money and trains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
