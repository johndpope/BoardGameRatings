			<description>This 1870 title is a simple but very early game from McLoughlin Brothers, printed on a single sheet of paper. It shows an image of a coastal battery of 10 guns in the foreground exchanging fire with a fleet of 10 ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the ships and guns is numbered from 3 to 12. Players take turns rolling 2D6, with snake-eyes a miss and any other number eliminating the ship or gun of that number. The first player to succeed in eliminating all of the opposing guns or ships wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most of the ships are still three-masted sailing vessels, the fleet includes one Monitor-style ironclad and what looks like a two-masted steamship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
