							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steading of the Nergalites</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the fall of man, the Ambergate dwarves ruled much of the area from what is now Kharg Island. The succession of kings was broken, however, and the split was exploited by a prophet of Nergal called Agol Umberstone, who predicted further calamity unless the great god of the winter sun was appeased. Many sages believed that it was mere coincidence that the moon was struck in twain and, the resulting devastation took the sun from the sky for long periods of the year. Umberstone&amp;rsquo;s followers were driven out of Ambergate, many believing that the prophet caused the cataclysm. The Nergalites traveled to the interior of the island, following Umberstone&amp;rsquo;s prophecies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st - 2nd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
