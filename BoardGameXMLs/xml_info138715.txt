							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Discs of Tron</name>
									
			<description>Discs of Tron is the second arcade game based on 1982 Disney film Tron. While the first Tron arcade game had several mini-games (I/O Tower, Light Cycles, MCP Cone and Battle Tanks), Discs of Tron is inspired by the Jai alai sequence in the original 1982 film in which Kevin Flynn is forced to play against Crom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Discs of Tron the player must beat Sark by throwing discs at him (a maximum of three at a time) and eventually derezz him or push him outside the platforms. Discs return to the player in boomerang fashion. The player can use a deflector to block discs. Sark has two more weapons (a chaser and a super chaser) that can only be destroyed by the player's discs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Discs of Tron&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
