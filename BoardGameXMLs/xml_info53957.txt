							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Houses of the Blooded: The Blood Opera Suite</name>
									
			<description>From the Designer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When scholars write about No More Roses&amp;ndash;one of Shivon Mwrr&amp;rsquo;s last operas&amp;ndash;they tend to call it one of his &amp;ldquo;mediocre masterpieces.&amp;rdquo; Mwrr wrote it in a time of mourning for his lover, the unnamed &amp;ldquo;Lady V.&amp;rdquo; of his journals. His heart broken by grief, Mwrr made three aborted attempts to compose the piece, finally completing it five years later. He wrote, &amp;ldquo;Finished. And rightly so.&amp;rdquo; It was one of his last pieces before his lost swan song, Shadows and Love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mwrr&amp;rsquo;s opera is a re-telling of the Avreda and Ylvayne tale: two young lovers caught up in a game greater than themselves. In the end, they are manipulated and seduced by powers playing a complicated game of one upsmanship. Their love destroyed, one murders the other in a duel. An ending drenched in blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item is a set of MP3 tracks written by John Wick.
