							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Red Riding Hood: Full Moon Rising</name>
									
			<description>In the village where little red riding hood lives, villagers were attacked and killed by a dreadful werewolf last night. Nearby hunter and rangers rush to the village to hunt the werewolf, avenging for their past friends and families who were killed by the werewolf a decade ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we are in the village where little red riding hood lives and our goal is to find werewolf and kill it before it brings another death upon the innocents. Is one of the villager a werewolf or one of these avengers posing for justice is the real werewolf. We'll soon find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living Player's Turn Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    ) In the beginning of a turn, draw a card and resolve the event on the card.&lt;br/&gt;    ) Active living player may take one action after his/her event is resolved.&lt;br/&gt;    ) When a turn ends, (1) check end game condition, (2) living players with less than 3 hand cards draw up to 5 cards, (3) ghost players draw up to their max and (4) players with more than 7 hand cards discard down to 7 cards.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human Ghost Player's Turn Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    ) When a human becomes a ghost, discard all hand cards then draw 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;    ) A ghost player can only participate in Council and Market events.&lt;br/&gt;    ) On a human ghost's turn: (1)Draw a card then resolve only Council and Market events. (2)Snoop 2 cards of any one living player. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game END: When all werewolves become ghosts, human team wins the game. Otherwise when there are more ghost then living player, werewolf team wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is Little Red Riding Hood: Full Moon Rising different then Werewolf/Mafia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Game does not require a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) It is a player turn base game, not played in day/night rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Players start with 5 cards in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) There are three werewolves in the game. In a 4-5 player game, only one werewolf is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) When player dies, player becomes a ghost and continue to play for human or werewolf team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
