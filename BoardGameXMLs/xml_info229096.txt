							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Skaven Team Booster</name>
									
			<description>Skaven society is highly stratified and bound up in complex rituals, but on the Blood Bowl pitch, all barriers drop away as every player gives their all for their team&amp;rsquo;s complete and utter victory. The game has become very popular in all fields of Skaven life &amp;ndash; the Skaven loving any opportunity for mindless violence. In fact, it has been very difficult to persuade them that there is any other purpose to the game once they are on the field, or even when they are just spectating in the stands! Some of the great all-time Player Death and Crowd Death records have occurred in games in which the Skaven have been on the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expand, enhance, fill out and indeed boost your Skaven team with this booster pack! It contains 4 resin miniatures &amp;ndash; 2 Gutter Runners, a Blitzer and a Thrower &amp;ndash; each covered in detail and posed dynamically, with all the billowing cloaks, sinister hoods, sharpened teeth and ghastly claws you&amp;rsquo;d expect. the Blitzer is a particular standout: not content with his own natural claws, he&amp;rsquo;s added pointy things to nearly every surface of his body and armour he can&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These 4 resin miniatures come as 14 components, and are supplied with 4 32mm Blood Bowl bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
