			<description>Vicky the Viking based boardgame in which the players try to obtain diamonds. There are several phases in which the players place one of their hand cards on a personal board, then all cards in that particular position are compared and the winner gets a diamond (bounty depends on the position of the card on the board, winning depends on different symbols on the cards). &lt;br/&gt;Defeated cards are always discarded, victorious cards stay on the board until defeated. When the first player has collected seven diamonds, he/she is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
