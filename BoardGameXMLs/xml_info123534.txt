			<description>In Master Trader players produce one or more unique resources and these are traded for the other players' in order to form a set  according to a specific privilege a player has and this combination gives them a specific reward in the shape of gold coins, advanced resources or Victory Points (VP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is a race to become the first player with a specific amount of VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many unique privileges arranged in three levels:&lt;br/&gt;In Level 1, players trade 3 different basic resources for 1 gold coin.&lt;br/&gt;In Level 2, players trade 2 different basic resources for 1 advanced resource.&lt;br/&gt;In Level 3, players trade specific combinations of advanced resources and/or gold coins for VP and/or gold coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All privileges must be purchased with gold coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays over an unlimited amount of rounds, each round consisting of 3 phases. Phases 1 (Free Trade) and 2 (Resource Conversion) are concurrent (no player turns). Phase 3 (Buy Privilege) occurs in a particular order that gives preference to the weaker players at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire game is based on a closed economy with limited resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
