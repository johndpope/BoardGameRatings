							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prince of Persia: The Fallen King</name>
									
			<description>Prince of Persia: The Fallen King is a third-person action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Casablanca. The game is a spin-off of the game Prince of Persia (2008.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot, taking place in ancient Persia, concerns the player character's role in a celestial battle between two gods; Ahriman and Ormazd. The player assumes the role of the Prince, and Zal, fighting Ahriman's forces with a variety of different physical and magical attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the events of Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia Epilogue, the story begins with the split of the Prince and Elika. While Elika stays with the Ahura, leading the resistance against Ahriman, the Prince departs in search of the king of The City of New Dawn, in the hope that he can summon Ormazd, due to his affinity for the remnants of Ormazd's power. But here, the Prince finds a new ally, Zal, who introduces himself as one of the king's Magi and teams up with Prince to save the City of New Dawn from corruption and ultimately stop Ahriman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the game is to collect four pieces to a magical seal which will banish the evil god Ahriman from the region. The Nintendo DS stylus is used to maneuver the Prince by touching the touchscreen. The stylus is used to move the Prince, to do acrobatic moves, in combat, and to use Zal's magic. As the Prince and Zal progress in their adventure, Zal becomes Corrupted at certain points, in which the Prince has to pursue and defeat him. Sometimes, after being defeated, Zal gains new powers. These powers allow him and the Prince to perform gradually more advanced platforming maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Platforming is done by using the Nintendo DS stylus, and tapping the touchscreen in the direction the player wants the Prince to move. For example, if the player wants to run up a wall, and jump back onto a rope, the player must first tap up the wall, then tap the rope. Sometimes, platforming implements combat as well. Combat is also done using the Nintendo DS stylus. There are three combat options; a sword strike, which causes the Prince to swing his sword to damage enemies; a block move, where the Prince defends himself against enemies; and a magic power triggered by Zal that does no damage, but causes the enemy to recoil, pushing them back should the duo be overwhelmed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Prince of Persia: The Fallen King,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
