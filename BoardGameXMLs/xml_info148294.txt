			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lands of Danger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wise women tell us of how, long ago, the Land was once home to a great Nation, stretching from the Dark Sea to mountains far beyond, commanded by mighty Sorcerer-Kings. They built grand halls and towers made of stone and iron, and lived like gods. But they were petty and corrupt, and their slaves rose up to topple them. The Land has since reclaimed what was the Land's, and the only things that remain of the Nation are ruins that shelter fell beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Way of Things&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The People are tied closely with the power of the five Spirits, or so say the wise women. The Spirits of the Wolf, Snake, Stag, Owl, and Boar manifests differently in each person. One may feel closer kinship to the Owl, being wise and observant. Another may hold affinity with the Wolf, being fearless and loyal. The strength of each Spirit combines to make each person an individual, their mood and manners unique, their way of doing things special. This is the way of things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rites of Passage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a young Warrior &amp;ndash; a Wildling &amp;ndash; not yet tested in the Rites of Passage. But you are no longer a Babe! Your heritage shows in every confident footstep, the pride in your voice when you speak, and the steadiness of your watchful eyes. Any of the People can strive to be a Warrior, boy or girl, weak or strong. The wise women say that during the fall of the Nation, even maidens fought mighty beasts, and cowards, though with prompting, protected their clansmen. You merely need to prove yourself, collecting Marks favored by the Spirits, that will show the Elders that you, too, can stand tall by their sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
