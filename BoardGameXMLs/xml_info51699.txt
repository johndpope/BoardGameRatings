							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road to Aster</name>
									
			<description>Road to Aster is an original HackMaster adventure module for characters level 5-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's the matter friend? Are you tired of the endless adventures fighting Orc after Orc only to be rewarded with a hot bath and hearty slap on the back from the local noble? One will find that Garweeze World is a far more dangerous and rewarding place than that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a valley few know about and even fewer have ever been to. Once, it was a place where the hermits and powerful magic-users went to be alone. It has been said to be a place of wonder and beauty beyond the imagination. Something has happened recently, and it has not been good. Dark armies are said to be on the move now from somewhere deep within the valley, perhaps from the citadel of Aster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only way to find out is to enter this desolate place and explore the town of Rumarok, which sits just at the head of the valley. Like the Valley itself, Rumarok was once a cheery place, though it too seems to have fallen into misfortune. What possible things lie in wait for the careless or the curious to come about? There is only one way, friend. Enter the Valley and walk the Road to Aster. First stop... Rumarok!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
