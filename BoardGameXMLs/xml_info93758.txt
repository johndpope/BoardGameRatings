							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jungle Temple</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Far from the lands of civilized men lies a chilling monument to ancient powers, the Jungle Temple. Throughout history this cursed edifice has been the site of profane rituals and the target of epic quest as adventurers seek answers to forbidden questions. This map shows a central temple bracketed by glyph-covered obelisks and strange serpent-men statues. A sacrificial altar stands at the center of the temple and beneath its crumbling walls, a hidden stairway leads to unspeakable horrors and treacherous catacombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Game Mats are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal battle grids for staging encounters during your adventures! The mats lie flat for ease of play and are sold in a sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mats may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. The Game Mats measure 20&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; and are marked with a 1&amp;rdquo; grid. All of GF9's Game Mats are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
