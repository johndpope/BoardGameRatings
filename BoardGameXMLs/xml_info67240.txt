It's packed with landmarks, scenery, and interesting personalities: including student &amp;quot;passport&amp;quot; profiles, illustrated gameboard, city map CLUE sheets, 9 miniature prop &amp;quot;weapons&amp;quot;, Rumor and Intrigue card decks, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narrow down you suspects, then make your accusation - uncover the mystery that everyone is whispering about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From back of box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version incorporates the additions from Clue: Discover the Secrets:&lt;br/&gt;Each person has been given a unique power which may be used only once per game.

The player who draws the eighth Clock card is eliminated from play. Any player who draws a Clock Card thereafter is also eliminated. The &amp;ldquo;one&amp;rdquo; on one of the dice has been replaced by &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo;. Any player who rolls &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo; must draw an Intrigue card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
