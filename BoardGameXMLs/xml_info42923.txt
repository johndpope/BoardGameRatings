			<description>Bambooga is a fun &amp;quot;twister-type&amp;quot; human puzzle game. It comes in a bag containing 24 stretchy bands, called &amp;quot;Booga-Bands&amp;quot;, and a bamboo dice shaker. Each player gets four Booga Bands in a single color, and places them on their arms and legs as desired. The dice shaker is a bamboo tube that has two chambers, one holding colored dice and one holding one black and one white die. When shaken, one dice from each chamber appears in a small window on the side of the tube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they shake the dice and get two dice in the window. The black die means feet, white means hands. The colored die shows the band color that must be connected. So, if a player rolls white and red, he must connect one his hands (the white die) to any red wristband. In short order, the players get connected and twisted up in all kinds of hilarious ways! A very fun game from Uncle Skunkle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
