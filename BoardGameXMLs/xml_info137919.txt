Pick up two Menu Item Cards&lt;br/&gt;2.    Pick up one Delivery card&lt;br/&gt;3.    Serve one Customer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliveries are worth more but the menu items are unknown to the player when they take the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round move the clock one space along the time track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the time token has been moved to 02.00 then all players have one more turn then the game ends.
