			<description>Indoor target game. Each player in turn will take the three plastic rings and try to throw them over the post. Most successes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is advertised as being two games in one because you can choose the post to be in a fixed base or you can choose the slightly harder game where the post is fitted into a base that rocks around as you hit it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
