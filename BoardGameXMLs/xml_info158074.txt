			<description>A word game in which you gain points for finding synonyms to complicated English words. The opponent draws and reads a word for you and you need to find simple alternatives that match the ones on the other side of that card. The person who gains the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a great game for those with extensive vocabularies... Use your knowledge of language semantics to simplify the meaning of &amp;lsquo;big&amp;rsquo; words into &amp;lsquo;small&amp;rsquo; ones. For example, if the &amp;lsquo;big&amp;rsquo; word on the card was countenance, the &amp;lsquo;small&amp;rsquo; word could be visage or expression.&lt;br/&gt;So let the battle of the minds commence and it will be clear who is the victor and has the greater understanding of the English Language.&lt;br/&gt;A great little game for airplanes, train or car journeys, or perhaps you could make it some sort of drinking game!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
