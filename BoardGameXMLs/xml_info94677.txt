							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Love and Angst In the Time of Acne</name>
									
			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A desperate, unrequited love for the girl next door - or the boy in the gated mansion. An unquenchable desire for freedom and rebellion. An unbreakable focus on the state championship game. An obsession with status, fashion, or musical theater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adolescence is a time of intense feeling and desire, in which every day provides a new world and a new set of possibilities. Events pile upon each other, moving impossibly fast, and the next goal is always just around the corner. The stories we experience growing up both open up infinite possibilities for the future and leave scars that can last a lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love and Angst In the Time of Acne is a role-playing game focusing on the intense desires and experiences of adolescence. The game plays out the struggles and aspirations, the joys and pains, of adolescence, heightening them for maximum drama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is designed for four or more players, one of whom takes the role of Narrator and the rest of whom take the roles of teenage freaks, cheerleaders, rebels, geeks, or Young Republicans. Over the course of just a few hours, they will play out the hopes and dreams of these characters, requiring no preparation from the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love and Angst requires a large set of six-sided dice (called d6 here) in at least three colors (assumed to be white, red, and black here, though the actual colors are not significant so long as they can be distinguished easily). Other than that and a few pieces of paper, it requires nothing other than imagination and a willingness by all participants to challenge each other's stories and invent new ones along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
