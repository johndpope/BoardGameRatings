			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the first book in the Loot 4 Less line, where we deal exclusively in items with a cost-to-consumer of 2,500 GP or less. That's right: no epic artifacts, rods of eleventy parts or even typical moderate magic items here. This is a forum for the cheapest of the cheap, and that's it. And just to up the level of difficulty, we also don't deal in one-shot (or even two- or three-shot) magic items. No scrolls, potions, talismans or fire-and-forget tattoo magics here. Everything in these pages is a legitimate permanent magic item, free of charges and able to be used in adventure after adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To kick things off, this first volume deals with weapons and armor, bread-and-butter items that everyone can use. Not only do we provide each magical enhancement with a full description and cost, we've scattered sidebars throughout the book to explain those costs. Each Behind the Counter sidebar explains how a price was arrived at, allowing GMs to apply the logic to other abilities (and be better able to change the pricing to match the needs of their campaign, with a firm knowledge of where the numbers come from).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
