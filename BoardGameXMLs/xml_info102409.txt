							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hybrid Front</name>
									
			<description>The Hybrid Front is a Sega Mega Drive war-based video game, released in Japan on July 22, 1994. It was re-released on May 29, 2007 for the Virtual Console. The introduction begins with someone logging into a computer. Then, it shows a revolution that occurred sometime in the 2080s leading into wars and conflicts that are further into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the actual game takes place in the 26th century. A hostile group of corporate war hawks called CoCoON (Cocoon: the National Coalition on Track Companies) have revolted against the peaceful coalition of the PETO (Pan-Global Coalition). In response, the player must fight a futuristic war using infantry, aircraft, tanks, and other surprises. Friendly units are given the blue color, allied units are orange, while enemy units are in red. Units can be placed either manually or automatically by pressing the Start button on the Sega Mega Drive. Mild violence is present in the game, although blood is absent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Hybrid Front&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
