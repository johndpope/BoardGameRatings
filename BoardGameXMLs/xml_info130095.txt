			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the DnD Community Council's Netbook of Magical Treasures. This netbook has been published as a community effort to increase the pool of magic items available to dungeon masters and player characters, and to offer a quality gaming product for free. We have worked very hard and have strived to keep the quality of this book in high regard and have gone to great lengths to make sure that the items in this book are strictly by the book. We have tried to avoid as many special or item specific rules as much as possible so that each item can be inserted into your campaign world seamlessly. We would like to mention that this netbook is part of a community effort and that all work contained in this netbook are from people who love the game and want to share their ideas with the rest of the gaming community. The authors of these works receive no money or compensation except for the satisfaction of having given to the gaming community to make sure this game can be a new and unique experience every time it is played. This netbook was designed in support of the SRD and the D20 System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
