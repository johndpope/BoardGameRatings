							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jim&#039;ll Fix It</name>
									
			<description>Game based on a popular television show where Jimmy Saville (an eccentric disc jockey) fulfils viewer's ambitions. If you were lucky and picked for the show, you not only fulfilled your ambition, you were also awarded a Jim Fixed It For Me badge. This became a much sought after item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are children, wanting to have an ambition accepted. A 'Jim' playing piece starts life on the board and is moved by a Jim spinner. The player moves by a normal die. The objective is to land exactly on the same square as Jim. If you do, you draw four cards. The cards say things like &amp;quot;I would like&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I wish&amp;quot; etc., and also the subject of a dream wish, something like water-skiing or flying. If you can make a legitimate statement out of the four cards, you win. But this is unlikely on the first attempt and you will need to meet Jim again. If you do, you add two cards to your original four and again try to form a legitimate statement. If you can't, you discard two cards and you will have to meet Jim again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to fulfil a request with their cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
