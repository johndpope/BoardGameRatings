			<description>Subtitled: The New Mechanical Race Game&lt;br/&gt;This is a children's version of the many mechanical horse racing games popular for the last 200 years.  This one was manufactured in England by Glevum Games.  The game involves pulling the horses in a jerky action to propel them forward. The horses are mounted on flat metal stand that are attached by metal clips to the table.  Instructions are printed in the lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because it's a children's version, it doesn't include the wagering common in most games of this type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
