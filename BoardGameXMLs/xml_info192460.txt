			<description>Life: Adult Years is the sequel/expansion to Life: School Years. Players build a deck during the game by acquiring cards from a shared pool. This time around, the stakes are higher as players can get married, divorced, have a crummy office job, retire and finally, death. As before, the goal of the game is to have the most success points at the end and be the most successful at Life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
