							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sir Reginald&#039;s Fabulous Country Estate</name>
									
			<description>A very clever block building game from the designer of Pocket Civ. Each of the players has a board depicting the same piece of property, on which they will build estates to satisfy Sir Reginald. The estates are built by selecting one of the available sets of blocks each turn and adding them to your property. The blocks have doors, windows, decorations, chimneys, stairways, etc, and a building code defines how these can be legally arranged. Scoring is determined by Sir Reginald's preferences for size, views, etc, and these are determined by cards the players play during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submitted to the Hippodice competition. All the art can be downloaded here &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.backglass.org/scotts/games/SirReginald/html/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.backglass.org/scotts/games/SirReginald/html/index...&lt;/a&gt; but you will need 100 3/4 inch wood blocks to construct a game set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
