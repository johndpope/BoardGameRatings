							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Search for El Dorado</name>
									
			<description>A card game for two or more players based on the Search for El Dorado, the legendary lost city of gold.&lt;br/&gt; The players form Expeditions by playing three card melds (one Leader, one Follower, and one Motivation). Each Expedition a player has in play attempts to make discoveries. Each Discovery Card gained by an Expedition is rated at one or two Discovery Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the deck has been gone through twice. The player with the most Discovery Points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
