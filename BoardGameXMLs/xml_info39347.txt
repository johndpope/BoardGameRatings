			<description>This game was created in the former Soviet Union.&lt;br/&gt;Needs 47 yellow disks for one side and 47 blue disks for the other. The traditional chess pieces are built up from these disks. A king needs 8, queen 7, bishop 5, knight 4, rook 3, pawn 1. If you move part of the disks from a piece, you change the piece to two weaker ones, or you can move disks onto a piece of your own and create one stronger piece. Pawns can only do this with their capturing move. There can be more than one of any pieces including king. A player can never be without a king. A king can be captured just like other pieces in normal chess as long as the player who just lost his last king can form a new one in his next move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
