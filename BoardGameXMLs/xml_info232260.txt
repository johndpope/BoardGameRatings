							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rails and Regulators</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main action in Rails and Regulators takes place during the Bounties, when the characters will pursue a Wanted. The Wanted are made up of just a few descriptions, whatever the group adds (name, history, character traits, etc.). Take your time discussing them and who wants the Wanted. Have they broken the law, and you are being sent to bring them back to the sheriff &amp;ldquo;dead or alive?&amp;rdquo; Are they &amp;ldquo;above the law,&amp;rdquo; and you are being sent after them by long-suffering townsfolk? Are they a victim of circumstance, and you're being sent to bring them to &amp;ldquo;justice?&amp;rdquo; The characters can and will be conflicted about their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
