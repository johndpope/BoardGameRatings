			<description>Help! Bathroom monsters are everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the party game Flitzekacke!, the players wear special monster-snapping headbands and try to catch all the monsters of their color with the attached magnets, after which they dump them in the loo! This sounds simpler than it is as the monsters whirl wildly, the toilet rotates on its own axis, and the other players are also on the hunt. Who will catch the most monsters before the flush starts to climb the porcelain throne to victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
