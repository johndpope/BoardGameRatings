			<description>This game is played on a 9x9 grid. A color die determines the color of the piece that has to be placed on the grid. However, pieces of the same color cannot be adjacent or in any direct line with out an &amp;quot;interfering&amp;quot; piece of a different color. Depending on the position, each piece counts 5 to 25 points. 5 points are deducted for placing a piece on one of the corner fields (a player doing this for the second time is eliminated). When 35 (out of 40) pieces are played, or all but one player is out, the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
