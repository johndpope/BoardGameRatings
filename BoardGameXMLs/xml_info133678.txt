			<description>Sengoku Basara 2 (戦国BASARA2) is a sequel to the video game Sengoku Basara (known in English as Devil Kings), released in Japan on July 27, 2006 for the PlayStation 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the familiar Unification Mode (similar to the first game's style of map-based Conquest, but now with treasure boxes that contain weapons and items) and Free Mode (whereby a player can play any field he/she wants) are the new Story and Arena Modes. Each character has his/her own individual Story Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playable characters are ranked (only the top ten are listed at any one time). There is also a ranking page for the Arena Mode, whereby ranking is determined by the total amount of XP gained and the number of stages completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chōsokabe Motochika and Mōri Motonari are playable as opposed to only being NPCs. Additionally, the issue of &amp;quot;character clones&amp;quot; is removed; in the first game, Uesugi Kenshin and Matsu shared the same moveset and weapon. The same could be said to Sarutobi Sasuke and Kasuga. In the second installment, Matsu wields a naginata and has the power to summon animals. Kasuga wields four kunai per hand connected to razor-sharp wires while having new skills connected to light energy. Kenshin and Sasuke's weapons and skills remain the same as the first installment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New enemies to deal with, including Oni soldiers, ice and fire ninjas, dragon tanks, and five elemental mercenaries parodying the Super Sentai series known as the &amp;quot;Gohon Yari&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The Five Spears&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing in the Unification Mode, a player may encounter and fight Miyamoto Musashi. Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes adds Matsunaga Hisahide as another interloper between the Unification Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basara Attack (Fury Drive in Devil Kings) gauge is filled by killing enemies and taking Basara-items, or when a taunt is performed uninterrupted in the presence of enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money can be earned throughout the game. Blue chests contain gold coins, as well as yellow boxes carried by enemy soldiers. With the coins earned, player can avail of the Basara Shop, where they can buy upgrades, accessories and weapons. Certain items will have to be unlocked in order to be bought and some items require a certain difficulty to be unlocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also unique items meant for one playable character's exclusive use, granting the characters varying degrees of usefulness at different handicaps. For example, when equipped with his unique item Date Masamune will have unlimited usage of all six of his swords at once at the cost of lowering his defense and being unable to guard or evade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sengoku Basara 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
