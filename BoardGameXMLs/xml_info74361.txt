							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic Underground II</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time is Running Out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arachnids are DEFINITELY coming!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, help has arrived! Now, the dreaded Gemini Space Druid has been unleashed on the universe, one ton of angry rock with tremendous special powers. Beware of the Andromeni, an energy sucking vampire creature that consumes your body. Play an Ashanti Warrior. Be a cute little cuddly Furbl. And if that doesn't suit your tastes, act out your wildly sordid childhood as a redneck killer rabbit with an attitude as big as his belt buckle and a gun as big as your head!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Galactic Underground brings to you six new player races, custom designed to fit your roleplaying needs. The GU2 is second in a series of books devoted to expanding the Battlelords of the 23rd Century roleplaying universe. This volume of the Galactic Underground offers an in depth look at the Phentari perspective, providing a cultural mosaic about squid life. Witness Jaquassarious Phentari at his baddest, as he takes on the entire 1st House of Eridine in a battle to the death! Study the Zen/Tza Zen controversy as Shrayalzzid Damadec adamantly defends the anti-healer position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you deranged, twisted types who want to roleplay first, then go to full automatic and spray the universe, the Galactic Underground II is a definite must. Without it, your character is just a body waiting for a place to happen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
