			<description>3 games innovatively using 1 deck of 54 custom cards, all set in the steampunk-themed Aether Captains game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players supply 5d6 to share and 24 eurocube sized markers per player. All the games are designed to share components and be able to be played quickly by 2 players in a compact space. Deck includes all cards to play each game, cards which are the game boards, and rules. Designed for print and play fans of Aether Captains (printable on standard 8.5&amp;quot; x 11' paper), also available as an Artscow order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intrigue (27 cards including rules): a 2 player game of area control across the city states of Arkady, using 24 eurocube style markers per player. Players take on the role of Grand Council members, vying for influence in the city states. Players use groups of matching cards to place 1-3 markers in each city state during their turns, trying for a majority, or can use cards to remove an opponent's influence. The game is played in 2 rounds, scoring each round, and takes 10-20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zeppelin Derby (12 cards including rules): a simple 2 player race game in the skies over Thoia. Players roll 5d6 and use cards as roll modifiers to race across a 3 card course. Cards include Dirty Tricks and Engineering bonuses. 5-10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Celinian Trader (14 cards including rules): a pick up and deliver style game of trade on the Celinian Sea for 1 or 2 players. Needed are 14 eurocube style markers per player and 5d6. Players fill their holds with different types of goods - copper, glass, coal and linen - as they sail from port to port buying and selling goods, amassing their fortunes. The game is played over 4 rounds whose length is determined by a series of events both players are subject to. Different values for buying and selling are set by a Trade Market that changes prices from round to round. Competing for victory points, players may also purchase upgrades to their ships. This game is also suitable for solitaire play and takes 20-30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All three games are designed  to be quickly learned, easy to play and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
