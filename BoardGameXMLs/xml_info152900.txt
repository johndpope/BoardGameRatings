			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A truly amazing game with superb graphics on 8 action packed screens. See if you can help Super Gran to crush that Evil Scunner Campbell and his boys Tub and Rent-A-Muscle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Gran was a 1980s kids TV show produced by Tyne Tees Television in the UK (with a theme tune sung by Billy Connolly no-less!). A little old Scottish pensioner is hit by a magic ray, giving her super-powers - turning her into Super Gran! The TV show revolved around her foiling the plans of the 'scunner' (rough translation - 'scumbag') Campbell. She was ably assisted by her Grandson Willard and Inventor Black, who created various weird and wonderful machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These machines play a key part in the Super Gran game. For example the first 'Sheet' (stage) of the game involves a flying bike above the streets of Chiselton battling against ... an identical flying bike (apparently this is an imposter Super Gran). The next screen has Super Gran equipped with an Anti-Gravity Belt, which she uses to pick up cats to stop them being run over by cars. While flying she must avoid hot air balloons and low-flying jet aircraft(!). For reasons not explained, she can only move left and right on the screen while airborne. Further screens are equally bizarre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Receiving hits resets the stage and Super Gran loses one point of her 'Superness' meter. When this is depleted the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
