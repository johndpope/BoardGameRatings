			<description>You are running a gang in New York in 1921 at the dawn of Prohibition competing to gain the most Prestige by 1926 to earn an invitation to shape the organization of crime in America at the Atlantic City Conference. You can gain Prestige by expanding your Turf, building a  bootlegging empire, earning Headlines, and completing devious Schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success will require balancing running your gang like a business and being a ruthless criminal. You can earn Gs with Buildings  that produce and sell Booze, or you can collect Extortion from the hapless denizens of your Turf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternately, you can generate Headlines by ordering your Goons to attack your competition, Steal their resources, Torch their operations, or take over their Turf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crushing your foes is going to require that you choose between focusing on completing complex Schemes, or getting a Tactical advantage during Conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, everything you do will generate Heat. As Public Outrage grows, the more often, and more severely, the Feds will disrupt your operations. You can reduce the pressure by generating goodwill, or when you get busted choose whether to pay a Bribe, Face the Consequences, or Do a Bit in jail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
