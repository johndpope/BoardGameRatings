			<description>A dexterity game in which players have to balance a tower of cards and wooden chips on a wooden seal figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Players have to stack cards and chips on the back of Robbi, a wooden seal figure. The colour of the ball depicted on the top card on Robbi's back determines which player is next. A joker card lets the current player decide who has to go next. The active player has to put one of his/her chips on the card, turn over the next card and place the card on the chip. If he/she successfully completes the turn, he/she gets the &amp;quot;Theo, the zookeeper&amp;quot; pawn. When the stack of cards and pawns collapses, the player who currently has the Theo pawn (i.e. the last player to have added a chip and card without collapsing the stack) gets a fish card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has collected three fish cards. That player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
