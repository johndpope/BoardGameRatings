							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kellogg&#039;s World&#039;s Champions Cereal League</name>
									
			<description>The Kellogg's World's Champions Cereal League was a game printed on the inside of a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The box had to be taken apart and laid out flat in order to play. The panels on the box included the play area, a score card, and the game rules. This is considered by experts to be the first sports-related promotion in cereal-box history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
