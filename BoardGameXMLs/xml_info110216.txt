			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Ruins &amp;amp; Riches is a very simple fantasy role-playing game. If you are brand new to such games, Ruins &amp;amp; Riches will be a great stepping stone to learning the feel of how to play a fantasy role-playing game. If you find other role-playing games too difficult, then the simplicity of this game may appeal to you. This game strictly focuses on dungeon type adventures with 5 classes, 10 races, and over 140 monsters. This 36 page rule book covers everything you need from combat to magical spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Ruins &amp;amp; Riches is a very simple fantasy role-playing game of &lt;br/&gt;dungeon exploration.  The rules are based off the board game I &lt;br/&gt;created back in October of 2006, called Djarhun.  Djarhun is a &lt;br/&gt;board game set in a fantasy world where you choose an &lt;br/&gt;adventurer and complete a grand quest.  The mechanics are &lt;br/&gt;simple and they work well.  &lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The game focuses on areas like &lt;br/&gt;dungeons, tombs, crypts, castles, and sewers.  There are no rules &lt;br/&gt;for wilderness, or high seas, adventurers.  This is fantasy role-playing in its most raw form&amp;hellip;even more simple than the 70&amp;rsquo;s versions of these types of games.  This system is designed to get people into such games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
