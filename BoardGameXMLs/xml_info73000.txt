							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Descent: Road to Legend Lieutenants â€“ Gata the White Death</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mighty Overlord treading the path of legend needs strong leaders to oversee his many minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your Road to Legend Lieutenant tokens alive with 3D minis!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gata the White Dead is as whisper-silent and deadly as a knife in the dark. He is the personal assassin of the Beastman Lord, a solitary figure moving through the night and ending the lives of all who dare oppose his master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cost: 13.&lt;br/&gt;Avatar: Beastman Lord only.&lt;br/&gt;Power: none.&lt;br/&gt;Minions: no minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He may only be played at the Silver level of the campaign or higher.  When he is encountered, roll one black die. On any result except a blank, the heroes are ambushed.  He has the Shadowcloak ability and if he deals at least 1 damage to a hero (after applying armor), roll a black power die. If you roll a blank, the hero is instantly killed, regardless of wounds or armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
