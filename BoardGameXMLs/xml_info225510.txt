							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Unicorn</name>
									
			<description>In the year 1240 Princess Ikio proclaimed all men must find her the Super Unicorn. In order to lure the Super Unicorn, players will roll dice and vie for the special stars needed to complete their search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In clockwise order, players take turns rolling all dice available, and must lock in dice on up to three different different stacks of cards available or on cards they have earned during the game. They may repeat this process until they want to pass. If they fail to roll a die or dice that can be used, their turn ends immediately. When the stack of cards on the highest rated card is is depleted, the player with the most stars on their face up cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
