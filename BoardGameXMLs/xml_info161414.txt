			<description>Vienga is a deck of cards that captures and simplifies the English language. Each depicts a letter, a number, and a clearly illustrated part of speech (noun, tense, adverb...) or sentence form. The back of the card has example sentences to show how each grammar point is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vienga cards can be used to play a variety of games. Simply use the cards to create equations, or words, or sentences. Vienga can be a challenging group game or a solo learning aid. The Vienga cards help you visualize sentence structures, recombine and replace words, and develop creative thinking. Challenging for native speakers and students with a good command of English wishing to improve their language skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
