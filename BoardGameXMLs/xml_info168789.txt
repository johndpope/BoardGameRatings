			<description>Wedge-It is played on a board of forty equilateral triangles arranged in a hexagonal grid. Each player has nine pieces which are equilateral triangles with handles (these are created by cutting and folding provided sheets).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The handle of each piece identifies its front. A piece may move into the space adjacent to its front by rotating around either adjacent vertex. A piece may also jump an opposing piece if its front is adjacent to one of the opposing piece's sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to make it impossible for the opponent to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of Kaylor and Humrichouser's &amp;quot;Games With Depth,&amp;quot; all of which had folded 3D paper pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
