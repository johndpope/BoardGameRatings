							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thief</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Concept: A primarily two player game. One player is the owner of the mansion, the other is the thief. The owner spends resources to set up the mansion, and the thief tries to steal the treasured item. The behaviour of the guards in the mansion are mostly automated responses. If more than two players - then the additional players are additional thieves.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Setting: The world of Thief is a steampunk setting. There are gas, coal, steam and some electrical powered machines. There is also some magic.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Inspired by the various Thief games from Looking Glass Studios that have been part of my favourite computer games of all time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
