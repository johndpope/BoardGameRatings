							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja All-Stars: Mochizuki</name>
									
			<description>Mochizuki is a mercenary ronin for Ninja All-Stars. Ronin bring potent new abilities to a player&amp;rsquo;s team that are entirely unique to them. As mercenaries, ronin may be used by any player, on any team. This makes ronin popular choices for every team, regardless of clan, since they may be used to supplement a team&amp;rsquo;s weaknesses in battle or further augment their strengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mochizuki is a potent ranged threat, able to lay down an uncommon amount of fire for a single model. Mochizuki provides excellent benefit to teams lacking long range firepower or as an answer to opponents with uncommonly fast, and difficult to pin down, ninja.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mochizuki eschews her school&amp;rsquo;s preference for subtle poisons or the concealed tanto in favor of the shock and power of paired pistols. Preternaturally swift and silent, Mochizuki is famed for appearing an instant before she turns her guns upon her target in a blaze of flame and thunder, and then vanishing again into the smoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
