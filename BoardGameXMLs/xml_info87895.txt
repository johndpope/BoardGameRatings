			<description>Manufacture is an economic simulation game where players compete in variant aspects of the manufacturing process. Their decisions concern the production cost (setup, materials purchases, wages, rents), the sales (volume and value), the cash flow, the research of new products and optimization of current production, the financing of their actions, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These tough economic decisions are being unfold over a factory layout where the positiong of the different modules is also important. The manufacturing process involves different stages of processing, routing and the efficient worker allocation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 different types of goods (raw materials, intermediate goods and final goods) which are traded between the players and the outer world (in all directions) via contracts or a free market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
