			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mastermind the solar systems defence against alien attach. All your powers of reasoning will be needed if you are to uncover the alien strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must plan your flight through the solar system, changing your course to respond to messages from your space stations - but can you trust them? - the aliens may have taken over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet Patrol illustrates the structure of the solar system. It gives a clear picture of the positions of the planets showing their relative size, mass and motion and showing how different gravitational pulls affect the weight of objects on planetary surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Planet Patrol will promote the skills of logical problem solving and strategic thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This software was devised by educationalists and has been tried and tested in school and homes. The program was written by Five Ways Software, creators of high quality educational software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 8 year olds and older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
