			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chakras Reimagined&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many exciting secrets and bits of obscure lore to find in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, and on the surface, it seems like the rules for chakras are among them. This mystical eastern tradition of unlocking the body and spirit&amp;rsquo;s hidden potential by channeling energy through our bodies in specific ways has captured imaginations for centuries, and finally they&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a spot in the limelight for Pathfinder. Best of all, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to take a feat or class or anything: if you have access to ki, you can start using chakra right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, these rules have some issues, including being extremely expensive in total ki point expenditure for what you actually get, requiring incredibly high saving throws each round at high levels, and being completely inaccessible to anyone without a ki pool. This book aims to fulfill the promise of fun and exciting chakra use made by Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, by providing a way for characters to specialize in chakra use and be rewarded with more useful chakra abilities by doing so. Included are two prestige classes centered on chakras. The chakra master gains improved benefits from each of the chakras, and can activate chakras more cheaply and more often. The kundalini acolyte, by contrast, doesn&amp;rsquo;t even use ki to access chakra, and instead opens chakras by performing specific ritual actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
