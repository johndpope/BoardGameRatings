							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galloping Ghost!</name>
									
			<description>Galloping Ghosts was made by Lakeside for 2 or more players Ages 8 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPLETE contents include: 1 revolving/spinning tray, 4 tablets, 4 colored pencils, and 4 ghost markers. &lt;br/&gt;Objective:  To not complete any words during the game. Players must drop out of the game when they form their 5th word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player writes the first letter of a word with his colored pencil on the tablet in his writing section.  When all players have written their letter, the tray that moves the tablets is turned left in the direction of the arrows so the tablets move to the next position around the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players add a letter to the new tablet in their writing section.  The letters in sequence should be part of a legal word.  Game play continues as players add a new letter each turn to each combination of letters on the tablets.  Players CANNOT &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; a turn at any time.  Each player uses a different colored pencil, so a missing color on any tablet can easily be spotted and quickly identified&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player is forced to complete a word he moves his ghost marker to the next letter on his &amp;quot;ghostboard&amp;quot;.  He then runs a line through the completed word on the tablet.  The tray is turned and the next player starts a new word on the tablet (the rest of the letter groups stay as they are).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players should always have a word in mind as they play because they may be challenged at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
