							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Experimental Technical Readout: Royal Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'Mechs and battle armor described in Experimental Technical Readout: Solaris Royal Fantasy Tournament provide players with a sampling of the custom designs that have arisen in the deadly gladiatorial arenas of Solaris VII's dueling circuit. In this case, the selection is focused entirely on the units and warriors taking part in a special mid-season exhibition games known as the 3146 Solaris VII Royal Fantasy Tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic rules for using 'Mechs and battle armor in BattleTech game play can be found in Total Warfare, while the rules for their construction can be found in TechManual. However, the experimental nature of these designs also draws upon the advanced and experimental rules presented in Tactical Operations and the upcoming Interstellar Operations. For the benefit of players who concern themselves which such things, the data for all of the featured units identifies their lowest acceptable rules level (Tournament Legal, Advanced, or Experimental), but only as it applies to the Dark Age period of BattleTech history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this is no simple Technical Readout, either! In addition to data and background on nineteen unique units, plus Record Sheets to go with them, digital copies of the ten most popular dueling venues on Solaris VII are also provided. To go with this, an extensive rules section&amp;mdash;covering not only the original arena rules as presented in 2004's Solaris VII Map Pack, but also updating each arena for the Dark Age setting! With additional special rules to cover the tactical abilities of all twelve competing teams taking part in this unprecedented event, and a guide to running the tournament itself from start to finish, this book offers players everything they need to finally answer the question that has spanned untold ages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Just who would win in a fight between Princess Jasmine and Snow White?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
