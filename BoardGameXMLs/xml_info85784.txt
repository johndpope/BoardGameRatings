			<description>A player will start with four balls. Once a game is started a ball is placed in the launcher. The ball is launched by pressing and holding the A button, with the time held determing the power of the launch. All left flippers are controlled by the D-pad, while all right flippers are controlled by the C button. Hitting B will nudge the table, and can be used in conjunction with the D-pad to nudge in a certain direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play Mode Menu allows you to play the 29 existing games, go to the blueprint plans, or play one of the ten user created games. It also allows you to change the Game theme, Parts theme, Board background, Skill level, ball action, and music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop Mode allows you to select a blank game where up to 256 parts can be placed anywhere on the board. These parts include Bumpers, Flippers, Walls, Kick Walls, Targets, Tracks, Specials, Launchers, Blasters, and Grabbers. All of these items are related to items found on a real table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Virtual Pinball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
