			<description>According to the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;As everyone knows, a slot machine is a mechanical device that consumes coins at a rapid rate. It's a game of pure chance...simply put in a coin, pull the lever and hope that the spinning symbols stop at the right combination. different combinations pay off at different odds. Charles Fey, a mechanic from San Francisco invented the slot machine. He made the first one (called &amp;quot;Liberty Bell&amp;quot;) in 1895 and rented it to a saloon for 50% of its profits. Mr Fey obviously understood the motivation that causes people to enjoy losing.&lt;br/&gt;Spot dice - the dice used in America's favorite game of chance, &amp;quot;Craps&amp;quot;, can be traced back as far as 1573 B.C., back to the crude sticks, bones and shells used by primitive man.&lt;br/&gt;Classic Games has taken these two basic gambling devices and combined them into a modern classic - &amp;quot; Slots n' Spots&amp;quot;. A game in wich the outrageous chances of the &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot; are paired with the predictable(?) roll of the dice.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box contain:&lt;br/&gt;- a dice cup&lt;br/&gt;- 3 special dice&lt;br/&gt;- 2 regular dice&lt;br/&gt;- score pad&lt;br/&gt;- Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
