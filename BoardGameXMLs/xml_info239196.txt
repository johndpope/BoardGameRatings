			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So what is luck, good or bad? Scientifically speaking, future chance events are by definition chance. They can turn out favorable or not. When a preponderance of chance events has occurred unfavorably, you've got bad luck. It's a fancy name for a lot of chance results that didn't go your way. But the gambler defines it differently. For him, luck refers to the future, and you've got bad luck when future chance events won't go your way.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs encounter a race of aliens who are smart, funny and easy to get along with, living in a strangely-confabulated city, constructed like a complicated joke with a never-ending punchline. But unbeknownst to the PCs these creatures have some uncanny mental powers, and a strange sense of humor.  This story begs to become a session of high improv and gonzo silliness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT is a DayTrippers Adventure from the GOLDEN AGE ADVENTURES anthology.  If you have that book, you don't need this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DayTrippers uses a descriptive scale which can easily be converted to other game systems.  Conversions are included for 2-12, 1-20, PbtA and percentage-based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
