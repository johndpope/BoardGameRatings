							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What Blind Ninjas?</name>
									
			<description>Each player has sent their ninjas into a room to hunt the enemy ninjas. Unfortunately the ninjas are blind and can only use their amazing sense of hearing to locate enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Blind Ninjas? is a battleship style game where the players send their blind ninjas out to hunt their opponents ninjas.  Players use deduction and the knowledge of their opponents previous attacks to try to deduce the best location for the next attack.  The last player with a living ninja is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One Icehouse stash per player.&lt;br/&gt;     For a two player game, each player needs a 4 x 8 grid (half a chess board).&lt;br/&gt;     For a three or four player game, each player needs a 8 x 8 grid (a full chess board).&lt;br/&gt;     A folder or other divider for each player to hide their grid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
