			<description>Card game that has nothing to do with teaching children safety first (as most similar titled games do) but the cards do make use of roadside imagery even if the theme is not followed through into the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VALUE OF CENTRE CARDS&lt;br/&gt;Beacon    (Highest card)    scores    5    Points&lt;br/&gt;Stop    (Second    card)    loses    4    Points&lt;br/&gt;Caution    (Third    card)    loses    3    Points&lt;br/&gt;Go    (Fourth    card)    scores    2    Points&lt;br/&gt;Bobbie    (Fifth    card)    scores    1    Point&lt;br/&gt;Each pack consists of 20 centre cards, and 36 other cards numbered 2 to 9 in orange, red, green and black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To commence playing, all the above centre cards must be placed face downwards in the centre of the table. Deal out nine to each player of the remainder of the cards. If more than four players, deal round until all the playing cards have been dealt. Dealer commences playing by leading his smallest card in any suit. Should he lead a red two and be holds the three in his own hand, he can follow immediately with it, and the four also, if he holds it. Should he lead the two, not holding the three, the next player on his left follows. He must either play the three of the same suit, or pick up a card from the centre of the table.&lt;br/&gt;Should a Beacon card be picked up, the player registers on the score card 5 points, and continues to play with his lowest card in any suit. Next player then either follows suit or picks up a centre card.&lt;br/&gt;Should a Stop card be picked up, the player deducts four points on his score card, and loses his turn to play. The next player then either following suit with the three or picking up a centre card. Should a Caution card be picked up, the player loses three points on his score card, but continues to play his lowest card (in any suit), the next player again following suit or picking up a centre card.&lt;br/&gt;Should a Go card be picked up, he scores two points and continues playing his lowest card in any suit.&lt;br/&gt;Should a Bobbie card be picked up, the player registers one point, and continues to play any low card.&lt;br/&gt;Any player playing the ten in any suit is allowed to go again with any low card.&lt;br/&gt;The player who chips first (i.e., uses all his cards up), adds 20 points to his score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player, who, after deducting his losses, scores 50 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should there be insufficient centre cards, all scores to be added or deducted, and the cards collected, shuffled, and replaced face downwards in the centre of the table. All centre cards must be kept separate in play, and it is in the interest of each player to keep all cards, except the last one played, covered up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
