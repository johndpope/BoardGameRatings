			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, Modular Spaceship map in 9, 10 inch by 16 inch Sections, with Hex, Square and No Overlays. The full map end on end is 12ft long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zip File includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Antares Ship Class is a Warship? Don&amp;rsquo;t make me laugh; they haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any military use since the war between the Terran Allegiance and the fringe worlds. Now what kind of options do you want on this glorified transport? &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;Used Spaceship Salesman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antares Modular Spaceship is a collection of nine 10 &amp;ldquo;x 16&amp;ldquo; sections. The sections included are a bridge section at the front of the ship, seven modular middle sections (cargo, crew, fuel storage, cryo storage, lab, containment/brig, and an empty section for GM modification as needed), and an engine section at the rear of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antares Modular Spaceship is intended for use in near or far-future Science Fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spaceship Repossession:  After the Colonial Civil War between the Terran Allegiance and the Colonial fringe worlds, the Terran Allegiance decommissioned all the Antares Class Warships. The Antares was a slow and powerful space battleship with modular center sections that could be changed based upon the mission needed. With the Terran Allegiance needing to cover more and more ground, space carriers with faster space fighters became more important for similar capital investment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decommissioned warships were stripped of all weapons and brought up for auction as merchant transports to pay for more carriers. Many made their way into the hands of scavengers and smugglers. These traders collectively fell in love with these ships as their armor could absorb a ton of punishment and last in a fight even with light weaponry lawfully allowed in the Terran Allegiance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player characters bought one of these ships from a used spaceship salesman with a low interest rate. When the interest rate skyrockets, the player characters have a choice to either pay up or dodge space repo men hell bent on recovering their ship for a finder&amp;rsquo;s fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
