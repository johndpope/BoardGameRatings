							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Endless Tunnels of Enlandin</name>
									
			<description>An old school adventure for 5-8 low-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does your group have the nerve to explore the endless tunnels of the mage Enlandin? Many have tried and all have failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Module Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally designed using the 1978 edition Dungeons and Dragons rules. Users are invited to convert and use the adventure with whatever rules systems they prefer. One of the problems with designing adventures for older editions of Dungeons and Dragons is that there is great variation in rule sets. For example, the statistics for monsters listed in the original 1974 edition are not necessarily always the same as the statistics for monsters listed in the 1978 edition. To alleviate this problem, I have simply stated what monsters are suggested for each location and given some hit points and treasure as well as a few suggestions for arms and tactics. Individual dungeon masters can use whatever rule set they like after having made appropriate adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few words of warning to adventure connoisseurs: This is a simple, open-ended dungeon that conforms to the basic D&amp;amp;D stereotype of what a &amp;quot;starter&amp;quot; dungeon should be. It does not involve complicated plot twists or deep character development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
