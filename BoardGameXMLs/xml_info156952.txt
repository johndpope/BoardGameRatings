							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Curses</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandon All Hope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In folklore and fantasy media, curses are powerful supernatural forces that are not to be trifled with, which can take on lives of their own, and respond to the actions of the poor wretches unfortunate enough to have been accursed. These curses are mysterious and terrifying, punishing transgressors for their misdeeds and reacting to the events that happen to their victims, sometimes even becoming adversaries in and of themselves. In Pathfinder and the 3.5 OGL however, curses are just a minor nuisance that is quickly resolved with remove curse or break enchantment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a new type of curse, the mythic curse, which uses the mythic rules presented in Mythic Adventures as a starting point to create dynamic curses, which respond (positively or negatively) to the actions of their victims, and which generally require a whole lot more than a simple spell to get rid of. In addition to rules and guidelines for creating and using your own mythic curses, the book includes 5 sample mythic curses, such as the curse of aging, the curse of babble, and much more, all of which are sure to have a memorable impact on your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
