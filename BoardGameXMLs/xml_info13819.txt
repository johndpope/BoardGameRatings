							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Devil to Pay</name>
									
			<description>This gambling game uses a large board depicting an outer circle of numbers and a center circle for the Devil's numbers. Each player receives a number card for scoring, and an equal amount of small and large chips. On your turn you roll 2 dice and multiply the numbers on them (1x1=1, 3x5=15, 5x6=30 etc.) If the resulting number appears on the outer circle, you cover it with a large chip and also place a small chip on the same number of your card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you throw numbers which when multiplied, equal the Devil's numbers (4, 6, or 12), you must pay a large chip into the center circle. A player cannot place a large chip on the outer circle if it is already covered with a chip. The first player to cover 3 numbers across their playing card wins the game and takes all the chips on the board. The winner begins the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
