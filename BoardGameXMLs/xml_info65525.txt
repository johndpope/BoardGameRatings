							<name  sortindex="1">Battle of Little Bighorn (1876)</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Counting Coup on Custer</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;During the Civil War George Custer was one of the rising stars of the Union army. After that war ended he headed west to take command of the 7th cavalry. His scouts reported finding a large Indian village. Ignoring their warnings, he split his force into three columns. Custer rode into the valley of the Little Big Horn with about 200 men. None of them made it out alive.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale miniature figures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Since this is a one-sided battle the goal isn't simply to win. Instead, each player is competing against his teammates. The Indians are competing to see which war band can win the most honors; the cavalry are competing to see who can last the longest. Indian bands can earn honor points for defeating an enemy in melee, capturing a guidon, or for a chief counting coup. The band that earns the most points is the Indian winner. The Cavalry company that keeps its guidon the longest is the Cavalry winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
