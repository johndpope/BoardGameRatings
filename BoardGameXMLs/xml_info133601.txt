			<description>IC Squared &amp;ndash; a.k.a., IC&amp;sup2; &amp;ndash; is a tile placement game for two to four players with an old-style computer theme. In the game, players score points by placing a tile on the grid that completes one or more square circuits. Watch closely because if a player creates a square circuit and doesn't notice it, another player can steal the point. Players can also score additional points by capturing bugs placed by other players in a circuit of any shape. If a player causes her own bug to be captured in a circuit, she will lose points. When players have played a set number of tiles, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
