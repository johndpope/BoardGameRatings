			<description>The past few weeks have brought more interesting news on arguments and accusations between Advanced Micromachines and Nakamura Inc. Disputes and lawsuits were followed by charges of attempted theft of fiscal reports and research results. Micromachines stock share price hit a slide after a leak of data stolen by a hacker, which in turn has sprouted conspiracy theories about competition involvement. Latest Nakamuras success streak in a few sizable bids for military equipment, traditional Micromachines domain, caused some nervous reactions from Micromachines management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few anonymous but reliable sources claim that the secret corporation struggle to win the best workers has escalated. Luring talents and project managers in with promises of higher wages is rife and mutual. Some even say about abductions and 'extractions' of key engineers from off-limits secret research labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to our sources Nakamura Inc. is leading in the conflict. Micromachines is increasingly mentioning 'adequate' response. It is starting to look more and more like threatening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
