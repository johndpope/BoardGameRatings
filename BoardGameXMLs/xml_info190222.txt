			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have seven Skills: Strength, Aim, Speed, Social, Education, Pilot, and Street Smarts.  Skills have Points, running from 1-8 at character creation, distributed from a pool.  Characters also have a Career and Hobby, both yield a bonus on checks in that area.  Opposed actions are resolved by the character rolling a D6 dice pool (the number of dice determined by the relevant Skill) and possibly modify them by Career or Hobby areas.  Results of 6 and above count as successes.  The opponent (or game master) then roll D6 dice pool which may cancel one or more successful results.  If any successes remain, the action is successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
