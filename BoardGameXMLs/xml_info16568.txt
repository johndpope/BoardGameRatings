							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pillage</name>
									
			<description>Pillage!  A game where you must pillage jewels from neighboring castles and make it back to your own before the other knights do.  You can be sent back to your castle without any jewels if you get caught or jousted with and lose.  &lt;br/&gt;There are many paths you can take but some could be blocked.  The cool thing is that you have 2 knights to control so if one is at a road block or staying back to defend your castle, the other knight can continue the pillaging.&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 dice involved: A specialty one and a regular 6 sided.  The closer to 4 players you have, the more interesting it gets with so many knight wandering around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
