			<description>A traditional style quiz game that features a Canadian theme and optional added elements of risk and wagering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 'basic' game, players earn points by either answering the trivia questions posed by their opponents, or by their own questions being incorrectly answered twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced version, players are allowed to wager on whether opponents will correctly or incorrectly answer the question being asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3rd 'classroom' variation allows for group play by eliminating all advanced elements and simply posing questions to each team, with incorrect answers allowing the other team to 'steal' the point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues over as many ~5 minute rounds as players pre-determine, with the player or team with the most points being the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly, this game was self-published sometime between 1980-1984 (based on question content) and includes no copyright date, publisher, or author information, other than a post-office box in Ottawa.  A unique piece of Canadiana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: A quiz game exclusively for Canadians.&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of Questions. Over 100 Categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encompassing an &amp;quot;all-Canadian&amp;quot; theme, the questions cover a wide variety of topics. From PRIME MINISTERS to LAKES, from HOCKEY to EARLY DAYS, from INVENTIONS to MOVIES, there are 101 topics touching on all aspects of Canadian life. The questions are presented at three levels of difficulty with a corresponding point system. Players will find some questions easy, some &amp;quot;memory-testers&amp;quot;, others educational.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Features of CANADA QUEST include:&lt;br/&gt;-three variations&lt;br/&gt;-second chance on each question&lt;br/&gt;-time control&lt;br/&gt;-wagering&lt;br/&gt;-classroom use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3-6 players / teams, Ages 12-adult. English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
