							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Fortress</name>
									
			<description>In Dragon Fortress you will build an Estate that consists of various crops, farms, barns, mills etc. Also, you must protect these valuable estate assets from approaching dragons, who wish to burn these structures down. Protecting your estate is accomplished by building Fortress Tower structures. A careful balance of Estate and Fortress cards are needed to be victorious in Dragon Fortress. You must have the largest Estate and defeat the dragons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you will draw a card and play a card from your hand to your Estate line. This line will build linearly from left to right. You may also draw from the gold supply to help you purchase valuable upgrades for your Estate cards. Drawing from the supply on your turn may introduce a dragon that will attack your estate. The dragon will enter your Estate on the front line and move through each card until it burns your crops or is defeated by your towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory points are scored for defeating dragons and building the most lucrative Estate. The player with the most victory points after the last dragon is defeated will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
