							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spellfire: Booster Pack, Set 13 â€“ Inquisition</name>
									
			<description>Spring 2001 - Titled both to put the magazine Inquest into its place (the magazine loved to mock out favorite game), and to show we survived Wizard's inquisition of old TSR properties, Inquisition made the game thrive once more.  It sought to fix the problems found in tournaments with current rules and cards.  Instead of adding new card types or worlds, it lets the fans speak as Mike &amp;quot;The Ogre&amp;quot; Huebbe create the set and made it official for all tournaments and play.  The cards can be downloaded and there is also an official on-line guide (Reviewing an Inquisition).  It had 99 cards with no chase so it would easily fit into page holders.  Landmark Cards: Castle Arborgate (#1), The Shadowlands (#2), Arena of Dori the Barbarian (#3), Castle Moovania (#12), Mij Retlub, the Spellfire Oracle (#14), Dragon Mountain Kobald (#20), The Grim Reaper (#26), Etarkine (#31), The Gathering (#43), The Apocalypse (#47), Guild of Adventurers (#52), Ogre's Horned Helm (#67), Slap! (#78), Dispel Illusion (#83), and Mimic (#88).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
