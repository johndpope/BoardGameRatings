							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game is Nirtz</name>
									
			<description>This abstract game consists of a plastic game board (9x9 matrix), ten red and ten yellow tokens (numbered 1-5; two tokens of each number), and a plastic storage tray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the onset of the game, players arrange their tokens in two straight rows at opposite ends of the board. The objective of the game is to move the tokens to form a straight unbroken line of 7 tokens across the board, extending at a right angle to the original arrangement. Players take turns, each moving one token at a time. Tokens are moved the number of spaces indicated (i.e., token five must move five spaces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes two variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
