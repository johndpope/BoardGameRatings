			<description>A Lawless Town is trick-taking game set in the Wild West where players must swing deals and spend their cash to pay one another off in order to come out ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over the course of three round in which each player will be dealt a hand of cards which are then then use to win tricks. Unlike other trick-taking games, in A Lawless Town each trick has at least two winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next players will bribe and haggle with one another in order to convince the trick winners to distribute their awards in ways that are favorable to the briber's plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
