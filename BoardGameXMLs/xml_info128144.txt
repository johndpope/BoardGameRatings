			<description>This is sort of a &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot; type of card game, but three cards, out of the 105 cards in the game, are needed to make a book. Sets are determined by the day of the week upon which the historical event took place. From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        4273&lt;br/&gt;           Home History Game&lt;br/&gt;           For Boys and Girls&lt;br/&gt;    Copyright 1909 By Milton Bradley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game consists of 105 cards, each bearing a historical event and date, including the day and week upon which such event took place. The dealer in the first game is chosen by lot, and thereafter the deal goes in turn to the left. Shuffle the cards and deal one at a time beginning at the left until ten have been dealt to each player. The remainder are placed in a pile face down on the table. The player at the left of the dealer commences the game by making as many &amp;quot;books&amp;quot; as he can from his hand. Three cards of the same day constitute a book. These books are laid aside to be counted at the end of the game. The player now calls upon any player he wishes for any card (any day of the week) he, the caller, may need to complete a book. If successful, he may continue to call for and receive the needed cards from any of the players, until he calls for a card from a person who has not that card; he then draws three cards from the pile and the next player plays.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;The players follow in turn at the left from the first player. At the end the player having secured the greatest number of books wins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
