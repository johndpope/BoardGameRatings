							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Globe Trotting</name>
									
			<description>A famous globetrotter has made a secret journey and the players try to find out which famous sites around the world it included.  This is done by removing some cards from a deck at the start and hiding them.  The rest are distributed, and as a player reaches one of their destination cards they reveal it, but also get to see one of an opponent's cards as well.  The idea being that once you have seen all the cards except those hidden you will know the secret destinations and win. Attractive large board showing available routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
