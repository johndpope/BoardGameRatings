							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Strange XP Deck</name>
									
			<description>Track and trade XP without wearing a hole in your character sheet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Strange, exploration and risk are everything. Players earn experience points not for killing monsters, but for making discoveries and facing unexpected challenges. You might rack up your XP between sessions, but most commonly you receive experience points during play, when events take an unexpected turn or you make a remarkable discovery. And XPs are a sort of currency, often changing hands between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Strange XP Deck gives you a set of tangible tokens to represent experience points. They&amp;rsquo;re great for granting, tracking, and trading XP, and the card format makes your tokens easy to slip into your book alongside your character sheet between sessions. This 30-card deck is a useful, elegant tool at the game table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
