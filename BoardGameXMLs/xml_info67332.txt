			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get into the swim with this exciting water game that's fun for the whole family! Players throw their fishing lines into the water and try to catch the colorful sea animals with their fishing rods. For added fun, sea animals also link to each other so you can catch a bunch in one try. The player who catches the most sea animals wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;2 fishing rods, 10 assorted sea animals (2 goldfish, 2 sharks, 2 octopus, 2 starfish and 2 lobsters). The animals float to allow for play in or out of water. The sea animals are placed in between the two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four ways to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For younger players - both players try to fish for the sea animals at the same time. They must hook an animal with the fishing rod and bring it out of the water in order to retrieve it. The player who collects the most animals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For older players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Links - players fish for the sea animals, trying to link as many of them as possible until all have been collected. The player with the most sea animals linked together wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect-A-Set - players fish, trying to catch one of every type of sea animal. The first player to collect a complete set wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Score - some sea animals are easier to catch than others because they have more arms, legs, tails and fins. Each animal has a different point value: starfish &amp;amp; octopus are worth 5 points; goldfish &amp;amp; shark are worth 10 points; lobster is worth 20 points. The player with the most points when all animals have been collected wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
