			<description>In Mutiny: A Pirate's Jolly Game of Dice and Backstabbing, players take on the roles of 2-6 pirates, trying to horde gold while attempting to escape a steadily sinking ship. In this case, the captain may not go down with the ship, but you can bet everyone else will!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutiny was introduced in concept during the 2014 rpggeek.com VirtuaCon digital convention event. At that time it was called &amp;quot;Pirates of the Sinking Ship&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for Mutiny are simple: Using five, or perhaps six, standard dice, players roll for values of 3-5, hoping to amass wealth, 6's to board the lifeboat on which the gold is stored, while attempting to avoid 1's and 2's, which sink the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the ship reaches a water level of 20 fathoms, the ship sinks, with all aboard except whichever clever pirate has snuck aboard the lifeboat and made away with the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game also includes Rum cards, which can be spent to gain initiative to roll dice. However, when a player's number is rolled, his rum card must be spent. Therefore, all players will receive an opportunity to roll the dice (and hopefully board the lifeboat) at least once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutiny is played over a course of 3 separate games. Player character abilities shift each game, and are related to numbers also used to initiate a player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) When this player is aboard the lifeboat, 1's rolled increase the water level by 2 fathoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) This player may reroll any 2's rolled during his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) This player may keep his Rum card until he chooses to spend it to take his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) This player adds 2 gold to the lifeboat whenever he rolls a 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) This player acquires 1 gold for his own personal pocket whenever anyone rolls his number during turn initiation. (The gold is added to his score at game end, provided he has won at least one of the three games.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) This player rolls six dice, instead of 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May the best backstabbing mutineer win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
