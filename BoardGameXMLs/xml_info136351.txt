			<description>from the Chessex website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamers have long preferred the special textured vinyl we use in manufacturing our mats. When our supplier discontinued its production years ago, we made special arrangements to keep this high quality vinyl available to us. Unfortunately, this arrangement for our single-sided mats required us to order large amounts of vinyl that would last us a long time. In 2007, the price increases on the single-sided vinyl made it more expensive than the vinyl for the reversible mats. This meant reversible mats would be only slightly more expensive than the single-sided mats. Our sales statistics echoed the consumer opinion that getting essentially a second product for a few dollars more was the better option. Due to these criteria we have decided to discontinue future production of single-sided mats - a decision that was not an easy one to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We still have some single-sided patterns in stock and will continue to sell those until we run out. Some of the remaining stock is on sale. These are mat patterns for game systems which have waned in popularity over the years, but still retain their usefulness. We recommend you check out what is available on the single-sided mat page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sizing: Battlemat&amp;trade;    = 26&amp;rdquo; x 23&amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; (66cm x 60cm) &lt;br/&gt;Sizing: Megamat&amp;trade;      = 34&amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; x 48&amp;rdquo; (88cm x 122cm)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96144 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 21mm Squares OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;97144 Megamat&amp;trade; with 21mm Squares OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96147 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;rdquo; Squares OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;97147 Megamat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;rdquo; Squares OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;97647 Megamat&amp;trade; (Light Blue vinyl): 1&amp;rdquo; Squares OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;97148 Megamat&amp;trade; with &amp;frac14;&amp;rdquo; Squares &amp;amp; 1&amp;rdquo; Marking Lines OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96151 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; Squares $13.95 OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;97151 Megamat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; Squares $29.98 OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96162 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 16mm Numbered Hexes &amp;amp; LOS Dots&lt;br/&gt;97162 Megamat&amp;trade; with 16mm Numbered Hexes &amp;amp; LOS Dots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96164 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 21mm Hexes&lt;br/&gt;97164 Megamat&amp;trade; with 21mm Hexes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96167 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;rdquo; Hexes OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;97167 Megamat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;rdquo; Hexes OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;97667 Megamat&amp;trade; (Light Blue Vinyl): 1&amp;rdquo; Hexes OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96168 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;rdquo; Numbered Hexes &amp;amp; LOS Dots OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;97168 Megamat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;rdquo; Numbered Hexes &amp;amp; LOS DotsOUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;97668 Megamat&amp;trade; (Light Blue Vinyl): 1&amp;rdquo; Numbered Hexes w/ LOS Dots OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96170 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 33mm Numbered Hexes&lt;br/&gt;97170 Megamat&amp;trade; with 33mm Numbered Hexes OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;96171 Battlemat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; (38mm) Hexes&lt;br/&gt;97171 Megamat&amp;trade; with 1&amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; (38mm) Hexes OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;97869 Megamat&amp;trade; (Black Vinyl): 30mm Numbered Hexes OUT OF PRINT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more or less direct precursor to this product was Megamat (Berkeley).&lt;br/&gt;See also Chessex Double-Sided Reversible Mats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
