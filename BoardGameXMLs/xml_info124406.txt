							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shank 2</name>
									
			<description>The fan-favorite 2D brawler is back as ex-mob hit man Shank returns to action in Shank 2. With those closest to him under attack, Shank is once again forced on the offensive. Now he must put his trusty arsenal of handguns, shotguns, automatic weapons, chainsaws, machetes, grenades, plus all-new weapons and moves to use in order to protect those close to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original game set a new standard for comic book style visuals, and Shank 2 raises the bar.  Shank 2 expands on the original game&amp;rsquo;s amazing combat system to redefine the 2D side-scrolling brawler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KILLER FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survival Mode: Team up with a friend online and locally to take down hordes of goons in this all-new and incredibly fun arcade-style multiplayer brawl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-weapon Combat System: With a brand new redesigned weapon system, take on smarter and greater variety of goons and bigger, badder bosses with new weapon combos and new counter moves that let you use enemies&amp;rsquo; weapons against them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richer Environments: Look for opportunities to bring down ceilings, explode barrels, hurl crates, and more, and explore around to find new in-game unlockables!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stunning Visuals: Directed by veteran cartoon director Jeff Agala, Shank 2 draws you into the action with a stunning visual style that sets a new benchmark in 2D brawlers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
