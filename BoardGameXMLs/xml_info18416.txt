			<description>&amp;quot;Players simulate the experience of one freshman for three weeks of college. Each of the three players [or teams] is given the assignment of attempting to allocate time for one aspect (academic, social or personal) of the simulate student's personality or motivations. They make their decisions independently and then share them on a common game board. The conflicts are worked out through a bargaining process.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials: Instructor's manual, players' manuals, game board, dice, playing sheets and student profile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
