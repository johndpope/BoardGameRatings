			<description>Inversion is played on a hexagonal board with five cells per side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of Inversion is to occupy more cells with your own stones than your opponent when there are no legal moves remaining. This occurs when all cells have been occupied. No draws are possible in Inversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move alternatingly, starting with White.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must first place a stone of his or her color in any empty cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hex is any set of seven cells consisting of one center cell and its six surrounding cells. The dominant color of a hex is the color occupying four or more of the seven cells. If the player&amp;rsquo;s stone occupies the last empty cell in a hex, the stones of the dominant color in that hex are replaced by stones of the non-dominant color. This is called an inversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The placement of a stone often completes multiple hexes simultaneously. In this case, the player may choose the order in which to invert the hexes. Each of the completed hexes must be inverted once and only once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
