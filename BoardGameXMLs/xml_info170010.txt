							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Staff of Cyrellus</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyrellus bore this staff throughout his career, wielding the weapon during his crusade against the undead. What became of Cyrellus and his staff is not known. Clerics, adventurers, and others seek the staff and there are many rumors regarding its location. Be warned, though. Forces of the undead would go to great lengths to see that the staff remains lost, or even destroyed. Are your characters brave enough to become involved in this struggle to recover The Staff of Cyrellus?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Staff of Cyrellus is the third in the Across the Realms: Artifacts and Items series from New Realms Publishing. Across the Realms: Artifacts and Items brings you new enchanted objects for your fantasy adventure games. Suitable for any fantasy roleplaying game and stated for Old School games, each edition of Artifacts and Items includes the description and history of the item, abilities, rumors and adventure hooks. Entice the characters with rumors and legends of new items, design new adventures and expand your campaigns with Across the Realms: Artifacts and Items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
