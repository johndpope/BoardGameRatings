							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pink Sweets: Ibara Sorekara</name>
									
			<description>Pink Sweets: Ibara Sorekara (ピンクスウィーツ ～鋳薔薇それから～?) is a manic shooter by Cave, with heavy Raizing influences. It was released in Japanese arcades during the second Quarter of 2006. Pink Sweets is the sequel to Ibara, and features the stage 1-5 bosses from Ibara as playable characters. Pink Sweets was released on Xbox 360 in a bundle pack with Muchi-Muchi Pork. The compilation disc is now out of print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pink Sweets, Mother Teresa, the sixth Guardian in Ibara, did not die. Neither did any of the Rose sisters. We know this because they&amp;rsquo;re back in Cave&amp;rsquo;s Pink Sweet&amp;rsquo;s where they&amp;rsquo;ve shifted from the dark side to the light. Players get to pilot the gals and use a barrier/shot system to defeat flitting enemies as well as end level bosses of the pastel-colored type. Enemies besides bosses are named after food. The first boss looks like a tinker toy version of Robby the Robot from the Forbidden Planet. During the game, the gals yelp and intonate various sayings to steel themselves for battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pink Sweets: Ibara Sorekara&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
