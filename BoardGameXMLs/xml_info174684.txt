			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt; Adapted from EMMANUELLE Arsan's famous novel, here is a game which will take your breath away, situated in the heart of Brazil which is both luxuriant and enchanting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Emmanuelle (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;The character Emmanuelle in the game is a wife of French business man whose job requires constant travelling, thus leaving his wife unfulfilled. Emmanuelle has taken a lover, Marc, but later suffers pangs of conscience, because she still loves her husband. Emmanuelle travels to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, to escape him, but is followed by Marc. The aim of the game is to augment Marc's erotic potential so he can seduce Emmanuelle again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's 'erotic potential' is increased by following the three laws of eroticism: law of numbers (seduce as much ladies as you can), law of asymmetry (try to seduce an odd number of ladies) and a law of surprise (seduce preferably concealed/masked ladies). Furthermore, the player should find three erotique statuettes. There's not any hardcore scenes present in the game, but Marc might catch Emmanuelle disrobing while looking through a certain keyhole, although more often he will see only an old gentleman washing his feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
