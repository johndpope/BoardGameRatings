			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Short Historical Simulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is written by Dr Bodley-Scott, the author of EMPEROR and HANNIBAL. Dr Scott has now moved on in history somewhat and his present program is concerned with the reign of King Arthur who probably lived in the late fifth or sixth century A.D. In addition to changing his period, Dr Scott has also written KING ARTHUR so that, unlike the previous programs it can be completed in a comparatively short sitting. Normally it will take between twenty minutes and half an hour to play a game. As with EMPEROR and HANNIBAL, a map is displayed on the screen. In this case, of course, it shows Britain as it was at the beginning of the sixth century A.D. Also on the screen and to the right of the map is a status report listing the provinces currently under British control, together with their strategic strengths. Spies can be sent out to scout enemy territory and each year the War-Host musters at a place of the High King's choice. Contingents are sent out from the British Kingdoms, but in the Winter the men of the War-Host disperse to their homes. There are two campaigning moves each year, Spring and Autumn, and battle takes place after each campaigning move, whenever Britons meet Anglo-Saxons in the same province. In early spring of each year Anglo-Saxon reinforcements arrive, but ravaging the Anglo-Saxon lands will discourage such reinforcements. The ultimate aim of the game is to prevent further encroachment on British Territory by the Anglo-Saxons. The game covers a period of 10 years and the players' performance is assessed at the end of that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
