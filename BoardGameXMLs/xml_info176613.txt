The die sides show the numbers 1-3, card symbol and star.&lt;br/&gt;Rolling a number allows the player to place this number of Stones.&lt;br/&gt;When rolling a card, the player takes a card and tries to fullfill it (e.g. build a special form with his stones)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     remove 1 Stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most cases placing stones is only allowed if they are neighboard to each other and to previous placed of the same Color.&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when no field is empty or if one Player has placed all his Stones.
