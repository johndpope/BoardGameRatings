							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spirit of Vengeance</name>
									
			<description>From Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By disturbing occult forces best left alone, you awoke an ancient spirit of vengeful retribution. Because of your past experiences, this powerful entity perceived within you potent feelings of hatred, fear, and revenge. Because of the strong emotions you have in common with it, the spirit you released was instantly attracted to you, and immediately perceived within you a potential that you have always denied in yourself. Unbeknown to you at the time, this intangible entity began to follow and study your every move, until the time was right&amp;hellip; One day, when these feelings of vengeance boiled to the surface, the wrathful spirit entered your corporeal form, its powerful essence merging perfectly with your own mortal soul. It is now an intricate and inseparable part of who you are. Within you simmers uncontrollable feelings of vengeance that others can never quite&lt;br/&gt;understand. You have become the living embodiment of wrathful revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
