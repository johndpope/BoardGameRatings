			<description>This is a simple matching game for very young kids. First, each player receives a blank card (called a &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; card) and draws a picture of themselves on it. Then each player is dealt one card from the deck. Both cards are player face up in front of the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you draw a card from the deck. If it is a Barney the Dinosaur card, you compare his pose to the cards you have played and if it matches one you place the two cards together to form a pair. If it doesn't match you play it face up in front of you hoping to pair it up later. If you draw a Baby Bop card it automatically forms a pair with your &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; card. If you draw a Give or Take card you either give or take a card from another player. When the draw pile is gone, the player with the most pairs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards can also be used to play a standard memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
