							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghastly Affair Player&#039;s Manual (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghastly Affair is...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gothic Game of Romantic Horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can live shocking stories of love and death, where the supernatural is always near, and the Devil himself may be your next paramour. Passions are writ large, and madness threatens at every turn. Some men transform into wolves at night, but not all monsters lose their human shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role-playing in the time of Marie-Antoinette, the Marquis de Sade, and Napoleon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience the fevered era when soldiers fought with muskets, and ladies battled with colorful hand fans. When courtesans in sumptuous silk gowns glided through filth-choked streets, and revolution brewed in the coffee houses. When poets and philosophers challenged a decaying society, and men dueled for the honor of their mistresses. When a continent exploded, and lovers held close in the growing darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple, easy-to-learn system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic rules of Ghastly Affair can be learned in a few minutes, using widely known terms and concepts. Game-play is fast and smooth, with mechanics designed to support a deeply immersive experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A world where the masquerade balls are as dangerous as the battlefields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Debate blasphemous books at the salon, dance at court, or evade a murderous husband to pursue a desperate affair. The hazardous world of High Society is filled with terrors as frightening as any ghost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your chance to be the villain, the heroine, or anything in-between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defy the law as a Bandit, or fight the darkness as a Demon Hunter. Grow rich off the dead as a Grave Robber, or command the spirits as a Magician. Indulge your vices as the Libertine, or be the True Innocent inspiring the virtuous. The choices are yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A true Gothic experience for adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full panoply of the Gothic is here for you, in all its decadent glory. Experience a world of desperate addicts, syphilitic aristocrats, and forbidden passions, where the innocent are victimized by monsters both supernatural and human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
