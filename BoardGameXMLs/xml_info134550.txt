			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gryce is a warm, tropical archipelago. It is composed of ten significant islands and many islands of smaller size. The islands tend towards the mountainous and there are many hidden valleys. The islands of Gryce have about them the feeling of the primordial&amp;mdash; the beaches, when you can find them between the many mangrove swamps, are welcoming and wide, but the interior lands are rugged&lt;br/&gt;and moody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many volcanic cones throughout Gryce. None are active except for three on the island of the Umpana, two on Kilawa and one on Otura. Most of the time a single volcano is erupting, but sometimes two erupt together. Such paired eruptions are of significantly less magnitude than when a single erupts and this suggests that all six of the volcanoes are somehow joined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique geologic feature of Gryce is The Steams. The Steams is a geologically active area stretching off the west coast of the islands known by the Greeoso (Tarthar, Koloroe, Kelmain, Toroe and Tiha). Below the shallow water (only 150 feet deep at the deepest) many small vents and fumaroles push above the seafloor, superheating the water to such a degree that the entire area is actually boiling. This creates a massive wall of steam over 100 miles wide at the widest. The area is impassable, for any voyager ship that enters is quickly shunted to the Forever Sea as it almost immediately loses sight of land amidst the steam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends speak of a strange and horrid island lost in The Steams...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gryce is a 3 page gazetteer detailing one of the islands in the Lyart Subsector in Worlds Apart. Gryce is wild, empty, and mostly unexplored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
