							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Angry Birds: Green Bird Add-On, 3-Pack</name>
									
			<description>It's an Angry Birds Expansion Pack and only playable with Mattel Angry Birds board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can continue the fun of building, launching and destroying with this Angry Birds Add-On pack! It comes with three figures and six special power cards to add new specific functions for each bird, increase difficulty and enhance gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set includes these figures: Green Bird, Blue Bird, and Construction Hat Pig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Angry Birds game will be set up as usual, except that the new power cards are shuffled in a different pile.&lt;br/&gt;Every player draws a power card at the start of the turn. Every power card is different. Some of them adds a bonus pig to the castle, some other just swaps the first bird to a new one, but even special attacks can be executed.&lt;br/&gt;With Green bird you can shoot again from the place it landed, with Blue bird you can shoot 3 times, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
