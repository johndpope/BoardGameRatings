			<description>Box description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2012 and tensions between the two superpoers are at their highest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Regional Air Defence Co-ordinator it is your duty to protect military bases in your area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each base consists of six domed billets and an Anti Missile complex. It is from here that you launch your anti missile missiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attack is on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must destroy all incoming enemy missiles, aircraft and smart bombs before they reach ground zero, but fire carefully as you have a limited number of A.B.M.s. Should a missile or smart bomb hit either a billet or control centre, it will be destroyed. Control centres are repaired after each attack wave, but billets are unrepairable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, one billet is repaired once you have scored 10,000 points. Once all billets have been destroyed, the game will end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to cope with the Aftermath of it all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
