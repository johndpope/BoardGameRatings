			<description>Baby Sit Baby Smurf and have the most disks on the board at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the spinner and move their pawn in either direction around the circular board. Players place a colored disk on any space they land on. If an opponent's disk is there, the active player replaces it with their own. If the active player already has a disk there, a second one is added and no player may land on that space for the remainder of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When at least one disk is placed on every space on the board all players count their disks. The player who placed the most disks is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
