			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overlay for the Fire and Ice Expansion of Terra Mystica! This expansion is made to provide compatibility with our previous version of Terra Mystica Overlays.  Due to changes in the player mats, design changes were necessary in the overlays. Because of the changes a new lock and key system was necessary.  There are three new boards and four new keys. This laser cut accessory fits precisely over the top of your faction player mat, providing spaces for each building, power disc bowl, ship and shovel level.  The keys are available separately for gamers who have purchased the new version of our Terra Mystica overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition there is the option to upgrade the Fire key to include cutouts for our Terrain Rings to mark the most expensive/least expensive terrain.  (7 Terrain Color rings included with upgrade) Patent Pending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        We have been made aware of thickness variability in the production process of Acrylic. Normally this would not be an issue as each overlay or tracker was it&amp;rsquo;s own independent entity. However, with this overlay implementing interchangeable parts it is conceivable that you might notice it. Even though we are attempting to cut each set from the same sheet, the variations still persist, so there really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything to be done except let you know about the potential cosmetic inconsistencies.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
