							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Swamp Dragon</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party of adventurers has wandered into a dark village called Thrasick, which has long been menaced by a black dragon who lives in the nearby swamp. The dragon and its wyrmlings feast on the townspeople just frequently enough to keep them deeply distressed. Week after dreadful week, a forlorn villager makes an attempt to escape, but it always ends in disaster. After consuming an escapee&amp;rsquo;s body, the swamp dragon regularly returns its victim&amp;rsquo;s head to the village. Thrasick's people have come to realize the terrible truth: they can never leave, and they only live at the pleasure of the dragon. Can the party save the town from its horrific fate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
