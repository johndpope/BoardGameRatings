			<description>Cartas Assombradas (Haunted Cards in English) is a game where the players are supernatural investigators in a journey inside an old haunted manor. In each round, the players try to explore more and more of the house to prove their courage and gain points. The bravest (or luckiest) player that was not catch by the house's ghosts and explored more of the house, win more points. When dawn came, the player with more points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a Push Your Luck mechanic, in your turn, each player take a card from the stack. If it is a house hallway, it means that the player explored that hallway and receives its points. If it is a ghost, he can lose some points, or even get out of the round. There are also equipments to help players in this adventure. Before he plays, a player can choose to leave the house in that round and gain the points he collect so far. If a ghost catches him, he loses all points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when dawn came, being dawn a card that is shuffled in the deck before the third round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
