			<description>Angels vs Devils is a party/social deduction cardgame for 3-6 players where players can pick which team they're on, try to detect who's not and score points depending on their choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round players secretly select the team they'll be on - Angel or Devil - or join the neutral team - but switching straight from Angel to Devil is not allowed, which should sow some doubt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then players decide to let &amp;quot;the mission&amp;quot; succeed or fail. Devil players can play blue &amp;quot;succeed&amp;quot; mission cards to avoid suspicion and Angel players can play red &amp;quot;fail&amp;quot; mission ones to draw suspicion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each then select who they think joined the Devil team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angels score if the mission succeeds, they managed to select a Devil or if they successfully drew suspicion upon themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devil players score if the mission failed and if they avoided suspicion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral players always score, but only 1 measly point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to an agreed number of points or most points after x rounds played wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
