			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes respond to a crisis at Quantum Mechanics and discover a threat far more powerful than they anticipated. For use with the Dawn of Legends setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble at Quantum Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes are either out on patrol and stumble upon- or receive a call from their NCB liaison, Special Agent Gerard Beaumont, concerning- an intense crisis at Quantum Mechanics in the Hydesville district.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum Mechanics is massive corporate campus. Occupying over 27 acres, it&amp;rsquo;s composed over a half-dozen buildings, walkways, and private parks. A large fence, 35 feet high, runs the perimeter, with armed security personnel at the gates and situated within guard towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Heroes arrive, total chaos as erupted. The grounds are torn asunder, as though an earthquake hit a majority of the campus. The high-rise corporate windows are mostly shattered, and a strange force field surrounds the campus as Quantum Mechanics&amp;rsquo; emergency defenses initiated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a dozen AAPD and NCB Troop Carriers are positioned outside the perimeter of the force field, and overhead several news helicopters are broadcasting live. Approximately a dozen NCB Ballista and Nullification Agents are standing ready.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless of why the Heroes arrive on the scene, Special Agent Beaumont has been assigned the case and immediately approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
