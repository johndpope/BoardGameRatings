							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pay The Cashier</name>
									
			<description>Money is given to each player. There is enough money for four players. For each game, one player is the Cashier and the other players are Customers. The spinner is used to decide who is the first Cashier. Each player chooses the name of a store and then the spinner tells which one is chosen. The Cashier shuffles the cards and deals them face down into six piles,one for each store.Cashier spins the spinner to tell the first player to his left which store he'll be going too. The player picks up the top card of that store pile, turns it over, and reads aloud what it says. He then pays the Cashier for his purchases as shown on the card. The Cashier must check the payment and also any change that is given. The Cashier spins the spinner to see which store the next player will go to, and so on. Play continues until some player cannot &amp;quot;Pay the Cashier&amp;quot; because he dose not have the money. Then the other players count their money and the winner is the player with the most money left.&lt;br/&gt;The game teaches the different coins and bills up to $10. The game teaches the adding bills and coins to make the amount of a purchase, just as a customer does in the store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
