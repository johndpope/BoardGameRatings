			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the sixth issue of Libram Novus. In this issue, we have decided to offer a few optional rules that could be used to enhance your game in various ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start off, we give you a section entitled, Casting Options, and in this section, we present you with several options for spell casting. First up is Spell Drain, which gives you a couple of options for having spell casting without using Spell Points. Then we present a rule for Overcasting, the casting of spells when you do not have enough Spell Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next up is an article on Commerce. In this option, we provide you with a table that the GM can use to determine how well your character was able to make a deal on buying or selling certain goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then to round things out, we present you with a few more options. The first is guidelines on how to play Novus without using Levels, and then we provide you some Alternative Resolution methods that can be used to enhance your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
