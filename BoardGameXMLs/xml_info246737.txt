							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aqualiens</name>
									
			<description>Aqualiens is a fun boardgame for kids, in which players use special transparent cards to complete the tasks, and help the adorable creatures collect as many seashells as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the aqualiens - creatures that live on the bottom of a deep blue ocean. They really like seashells and, as everyone knows, you can never have too many seashells! They have learned to grow new arms and tentacles, so they can always grab just one more shell. Help them transform correctly, and collect as may sea treasures as they can carry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Aqualiens board game each player receives one of the four cute aliens. Transparent cards and goal cards are placed in the center of the table, so everyone can reach them. Lay the transparent cards with arms and tentacles on top of your alien card to complete the task, but make sure to use as few cards as possible! The quickest player to grow and collect everything that's needed, according to the goal card, wins a victory crystal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the players are already good in playing with basic rules, they can try to make the game more complex, by adding some extra rules. In addition to arms and tentacles, the players have to collect a certain amount of seashells on the card of their alien. Note that if some player stops the round by saying &amp;quot;I'm ready!&amp;quot;, and it turns out that the task is made incorrectly, then the player loses one victory crystal! The first player who receives 5 victory crystals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
