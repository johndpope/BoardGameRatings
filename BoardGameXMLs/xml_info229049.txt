			<description>A One-Round Adventure for Living City&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been a week now since you were hired by the Merchants Guild of Ravens Bluff to escort a large caravan to Procampur. The mission sounded simple enough: guard the caravan until it arrives at its destination. Upon agreeing to help you were given the details of the recent disappearances along The High Trail. Of how patrols from Ravens Bluff found the scant remains of previous caravans heading for High Haspur and of the fact that even the Ministry of Art has no idea what was responsible. Ah, the devil is always in the details. Anyway you had already agreed and besides the mission could prove to be a very profitable venture. In fact before you left, the Lord Mayor himself notified you via messenger that a reward awaits you if you can halt the attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
