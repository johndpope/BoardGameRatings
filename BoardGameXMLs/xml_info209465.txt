							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Season Two Gimmicks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four New Gimmicks to add to your World Wide Wrestling promotion! Originally limited to Kickstarter and Patreon backers of the International Incident supplement, these Gimmicks allow you to you play wrestlers more established in their careers and with more power over the direction of the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for the World Wide Wrestling Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Iconoclast: You&amp;rsquo;re a gunslinger, a giant-killer, a career-ender. Your talents are wasted on jabronis; your prey are the greatest heroes and vilest villains that the wrestling universe has to offer. You will forge your own legend from the broken bodies and shattered egos of past greats&amp;hellip;until the day that you become the legend to be taken down.&lt;br/&gt;    The Time Bomb: The business has taken its toll on your body. Held together by steel, screws, and sheer will, you probably should have hung it up by now but the child support payments, money you owe to your &amp;ldquo;pharmacist&amp;rdquo;, or your own hubris keep you stepping back into the ring. When will you take your final 3 count?&lt;br/&gt;    The Foreigner: Yer not from here. Yer from SOMEWHERE ELSE! You&amp;rsquo;re not sure what it says about pro wrestling that &amp;ldquo;from another country&amp;rdquo; is still a valid character, but you keep getting paid to make it work. Who will tire of your retrograde act first, you or the crowd? &lt;br/&gt;    The Boss: You&amp;rsquo;re in charge. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve made your name in the ring, you&amp;rsquo;re the legit head of the corporation or you just play the boss on TV. Regardless, you have the power to make the rules, punish those who cross you and elevate those who you think are the real future of the business. Will you make the right decisions?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
