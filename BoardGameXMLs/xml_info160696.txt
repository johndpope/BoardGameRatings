							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super KGB: The KGB meets the CIA in 2 Spy Training Games</name>
									
			<description>Super KGB contains both Project CIA: The Secret Formula and Project KGB: The Double Agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Called &amp;quot;Spy Training Games&amp;quot;, they were originally issued in 1973 by House of Games Corporation Limited (Bramalea, Ontario, Canada). The two board games are distinct, different, and have different rules. The two board games can be united together and played following the instructions as &amp;quot;The Deluxe Game&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Super KGB&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Project CIA: the secret formula&amp;quot;, 17 envelopes are scattered in designated spots on the board game. One of the 17 envelopes has the secret formula. By rolling the dice, players move around the board game and as they pass over the positions where the envelopes are, they pick up the tile and see if it has the secret formula printed on the bottom of the tile. The winner of the game is the one that exits the board game from one of its four entrance/exit gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a clear moving piece representing a security guard that moves around from one room to another room. If a player finds himself inside a room with the security guard, he/she has one turn to exit the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Game 2, you're either an agent trying to identify the double agent, or you're the latter, sabotaging the training camp. Deception and deduction will keep you scrambling!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super KGB is what you get when you combine both games 1 and 2. Waddingtons included extra pieces in both sets so you could play a Deluxe version of either game using both boards. Super KGB can be played by up to six, whereas the component games are limited to four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the version from Waddington's with both games in one box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
