							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pocket Trivia: Gen-X 80s &amp; 90s</name>
									
			<description>Trivia game about Generation X consisting of 52 cards with 16 questions on each card.  Lots of 1980s and 1990s trivia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes the top card from the deck and reads a question aloud.  The person to the card reader's left gives an answer.  If incorrect, the next player (clockwise) guesses, and so on.  If correct, the person who guessed correctly keeps the card; this person becomes the reader; he reveals the next card from the deck and reads it aloud.  If nobody guesses correctly, the answer is revealed and nobody gets the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until no cards are left in the deck.  The winner is the person who has the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
