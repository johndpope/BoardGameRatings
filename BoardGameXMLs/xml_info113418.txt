			<description>A typical game for kids (speed, fun and animals). Two frogs must compete to arrive first at the middle of the pond in a beautiful water lily.&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls a die and moves his frog on a track to reach the water lily. There are several dangers (snakes, humans) and distractions (flies, dragonflies) and some others cases give bonus to you frog.&lt;br/&gt;This game looks like le &amp;quot;Jeu de l'Oie&amp;quot;, but it is easier. But more important, it's game played by all kids in the northern provinces of France (something cultural, I suppose).&lt;br/&gt;Material : 1 6-sided die, 2 tokens (frogs) and a board (the rules are printed on the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
