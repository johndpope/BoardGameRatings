							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Burning Goblins</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Burning Goblins is ideal as a first adventure for new GMs and players, and is designed for a group of 4-5 level 1 characters. The most recent raid by The Burning Ones goblin tribe has left the village of Greendale in a state of uproar. The miller's daughter has been kidnapped and the mayor has put out a call for adventurers to hunt down the goblins and find the missing girl. But is there more to these raids than meets the eye? Why are the goblins burnt and timid? Only a strong band of heroes will be able to find the answers and save the girl from a gruesome death. This is an adventure made primarily for use with the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons but can be used for other rule systems with some tweaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
