			<description>Publisher's blurb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dark Future is one of the most omnipresent themes in science fiction and fantasy literature, films, and games. From the grim futures postulated by H.G. Wells in The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, to the dystopian societies described by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World and George Orwell in 1984, to the post-apocalyptic worlds of The Walking Dead and Suzanne Collins in The Hunger Games, the predominant vision for the future is generally a dark one. And whether the cause is aliens, vampires, zombies, atomic holocaust, oppressive governments, megacorporations, or divine retribution, the net effects tend to be strikingly similar. It is to this theme that this volume of d-Infinity is dedicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d-Infinity Volume #4 Contents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Editorial: Dark Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CQB: Futuristic Skirmish Miniatures Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying Saucers &amp;amp; Rocket Ships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interview: Comicpalooza Founder John Simons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prop Room: Grimdark Costume Enhancers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fiction: Prologue to Swords of Kos: Hekaton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Builder/Swords of Kos: The Four Winds Bar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Dice: Remote Gaming&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Design: Biology for Fantasy Settings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic System: A Rainbow of Slimes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic System: Six Lizardfolk Spells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OGL System/Interplanetary: 62 Interplanetary Feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathfinder System: A Flawed Tomorrow (32 Science Fiction Character Defects)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathfinder System: The Mutant Race&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reader Survey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathfinder System/Lance &amp;amp; Laser: The Post-Apocalyptic Barbarian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pass in Review&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample Cardstock CharactersTM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d&amp;infin; (&amp;ldquo;d-Infinity&amp;rdquo;) is a multi-platform gaming supplement that covers a wide variety of rules systems and includes content that can be universally applied to many different sorts of table-top, live-action, and role-playing games.
