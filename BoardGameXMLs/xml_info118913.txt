							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jet Li: Rise to Honor</name>
									
			<description>Jet Li: Rise to Honor features the likeness, voice acting and motion capture work of martial arts actor Jet Li, and features martial arts choreography by Corey Yuen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise to Honor features a cinematic presentation designed to mimic an action film, with no loading screens and sections of the game split up into &amp;quot;scenes&amp;quot;. A DVD-like chapter selection menu allows the player to go back to any past scenes once they have been cleared previously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played from a third-person perspective, the majority of the game is a beat 'em up, with the player using the right analog stick to direct blows at enemies. The game also features a number of levels where the player uses firearms with unlimited ammunition. During levels, the player constantly builds up a store of adrenaline, which the player can unleash to perform powerful hand to hand combat strikes. An alternative is, when using firearms, the player initiates a temporary slow motion bullet time mode similar to the video game Max Payne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jet Li: Rise to Honor&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
