							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyrinth Life: The Maze of Being You</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Life is a maze&amp;mdash;an infinite maze&amp;mdash;that shifts with the will of its inhabitants. You are an explorer of this labyrinthine realm, trying on roles and pioneering foreign terrain, aiding friends and outsmarting rivals. To shape the world and find your place in it means drawing on powers you never knew you had in the hopes of one day reaching your goal, the one prize that can't be found around any of the labyrinth's dizzying twists and bends: the real you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An Awesome Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labyrinth Life is a tabletop strategy card game for 2-6 players, ages 12 and up. It's fast to learn, and fun to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Labyrinth Life, you play an explorer who braves an ever-changing maze in search of your future self. Will you be the first to reach bliss as perhaps the Richest Woman in New Mazonia or perhaps the Hallball Team Captain? It's all up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game, players build a maze of hexagonal cards and they move their maze explorers through it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round, you move more maze explorer forward 5 spaces, draw a card, and play a card. You play a card by placing it in the maze and using one of the two powers listed on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sixteen powers allow you to affect the maze and the explorers within it. It's possible to chain multiple powers and plan elaborate strategies over multiple turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategies center around moving your explorer into cards related to your goal card, and keeping other players from moving their explorers into cards related to theirs. You gain two points for moving your explorer into cards that share a power with your goal card and you lose one point for every card you move into that isn't related. Goals can change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game by reaching the target point total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Work of Art&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck of Labyrinth Life is different. The cast of characters, constellations of maze paths, and the solitaire maze that spans the back of your 120-card deck are absolutely unique, and offer an entirely different play experience from every other deck out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Ultimate Collaboration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early supporters of Labyrinth Life suggest and vote on the characters that will populate the maze. Each deck is a unique culture built from the the pool the fans create.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
