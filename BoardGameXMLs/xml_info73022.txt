			<description>In this battle game, each player is trying to end up last pig standing by forcing the other players to give up the five energy disks with which each began the game.  To do this, you roll a die, and your pig must travel forward around the board and land on the same space as or pass by another pig -- when this happens, that pig's player must toss one energy disk into the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main deviation from this pattern comes when a pig lands by exact count on one of the five sparkling starter spaces in the arena.  When this happens, the player has three choices at the beginning of the next turn.  To continue on, to reverse direction and move, or to roll the Die of Power; the Die of Power may cause you to lose your turn, reclaim an energy disk, move 5 spaces or teleport to any space, designate another player to lose a disk, or let you become the Turbo Cochon (Pig), who teleports, forces another player to lose an energy disk, and collects that disk all in one fell swoop.  One by one, players are knocked out of the game until the remaining player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
