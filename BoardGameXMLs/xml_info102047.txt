							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cardomino</name>
									
			<description>An interesting game, that looks like it is card dominoes but it is a game in its own right. Each player chooses a colour and places that card in front of them. It has no part in the game other than to remind players who has which colour. I don't know why but the rules say that &amp;quot;this colour is kept for the WHOLE EVENING&amp;quot;. (Their capital letters, not mine).&lt;br/&gt;The deck is shuffled and each player gets 10 cards. The remaining undealt cards form a face-down draw pile. A player may, in turn, play one card in the middle of the board as in dominoes. Then the player replenishes his hand by drawing a card from the pool. The winner is the player who has the colour of the last card played when the pool is exhausted. The rules give a strategy tip - do not play cards of your own colour until victory looms. This will give you a good chance to play for a win.&lt;br/&gt;Betting is suggested as an option, even onlookers are encouraged to bet on who will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
