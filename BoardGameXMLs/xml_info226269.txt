							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nights of Our Lives</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You finally got a good look at the Nosferatus, the new family that moved in next door. The teenage son is soooo cute (if a little pale)! Funny how you only seem to see their family after dark. You&amp;rsquo;ll just have to execute a ridiculously elaborate plan to get to know him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your parents definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t approve. &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t date mundies,&amp;rdquo; they would say. &amp;ldquo;If he finds out your secret, you&amp;rsquo;d have to kill him,&amp;rdquo; they would say. But they&amp;rsquo;ll never find out. As the alpha male of your werewolf pack, your father&amp;rsquo;s always so busy running the business and keeping the peace. And your mother spends half her time with her coven and the other half with her &amp;ldquo;physical trainer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You might have to blackmail your brother a little bit. That shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem once he knows that you know about the magical chalice he&amp;rsquo;s been hunting with his faerie girlfriend for the last month. (Wasn&amp;rsquo;t dad looking for that chalice too?) You&amp;rsquo;re going to need his help if you&amp;rsquo;re going to pull this off before the time of The Prophecy...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These... are the Nights of Our Lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
