			<description>Bang the Button!!! is an educational  and interactive game that has been developed for learners of English as a foreign language for beginner levels. (Starters, A1 and A2, according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a unique, very complete game that can (and should) be used as a complement to any method (digital or more traditional) that is used in the classroom. Playing the game at home is of course also great fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Especially the oral skills (speaking and listening) are trained in this game that is played in small groups (3 &amp;ndash; 6 players). The game allows a lot of interaction between the players, exactly what we want in foreign language teaching.&lt;br/&gt;The game is also very useful for getting rid of the usual shyness that many learners feel. The game is very challenging and educational.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Bang the Button is, as mentioned above, very complete and includes a variety of aspects, such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     vocabulary&lt;br/&gt;     grammar&lt;br/&gt;     communication&lt;br/&gt;     culture&lt;br/&gt;     movement&lt;br/&gt;     interaction&lt;br/&gt;     constant participation of all players&lt;br/&gt;     a healthy dose of competion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
