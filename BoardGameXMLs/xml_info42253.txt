							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pentacles</name>
									
			<description>Pentacles is a card game for three to five players that uses a traditional playing card deck with jokers and five glass beads or other tokens.  Play is divided into two phases.  In the first phase, players play cards to their own rows, then in the second phase the winner or winners place their rows to one of the five files surrounding a joker that make up the pentacle.  The cards from the winning hand first score for melds, then are placed face-down to the pentacle in a pattern determined by the joker that is currently in play in a manner reminiscent of the game Mancala, with the placing player skimming cards along the way that earn him points toward winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
