			<description>This is a game for children based on The Secret Life of Pets from Universal Studios. One player represents Max (the dog) trying to get home after spending a day in the city. The other player represents Snowball (a grumpy rabbit) trying to block any path chosen by Max. Players take turns laying pathway tiles around a 3-D board representing a park, city buildings, an apartment complex, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Max wins if he gets home before all of the pathway cards have &lt;br/&gt;been placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for two players age seven and older. Includes a plastic pet miniature depicting Max along with the 3-D display and 44 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
