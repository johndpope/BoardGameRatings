							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bubbly Burst</name>
									
			<description>Introducing Bubbly. He's cute. He's wet. He has a cold. Which would explain the bubbles coming out of his nose! Bubbly must navigate his way through many challenging oceans to reach his goal. Watch out! Many enemies will try to stop Bubbly. He must contest with nasty robots, killer bees, and strange springy things. Luckily, Bubbly has a sinus condition which will help him to blow bubbles and stop his foes cold in their watery tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
