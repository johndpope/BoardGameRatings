							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Living Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>Up to 9 players can take part in a battle of wits, luck and skulduggery. Survive this cursed place through combat, agility or dungeon manipulation. Only the strongest, fastest and smartest will emerge victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t your standard dungeon romp. The Living Dungeon has no ToHit rolls, no THACO, and no saving throws. Each player rolls their five chosen skill dice. They then have only 2 fretful minutes to decide what to do with those 5 actions. Panic will set in. The possibilities and threats will become overwhelming. Your mind will freeze up as your friends on different teams give you conflicting and misleading advice that you just can&amp;rsquo;t trust! Your time is running out, but there are just so many ways to die in The Living Dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another player could hack you down! A wretched or a hybrid could maul you. You could fall down a bottomless pit, be crushed by a piston, be incinerated by a sentinel&amp;rsquo;s ever watchful flame, be torn to pieces by an incorporeal shadow, or flayed and consumed by the darkness its self. Choose wisely, as each move could be your last. &lt;br/&gt;There really is nothing quite like The Living Dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
