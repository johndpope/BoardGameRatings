			<description>In Pantheon Ascension: Even Mythical Family Trees Need Pruning each player takes the role of a minor Norse deity backstabbing their way to the top of the family tree by stealing temples, brainwashing followers, and robbing their kin of prestige.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with three random dice and one Major Deity card. Each turn they choose two of four possible actions in an attempt to get sets of four temples, prestige, or followers, while avoiding three mockery icons. The four possible actions are: Reroll any or all dice, add a random dice to dice pool, play Deity card, and Duel another player. Players cannot perform any action twice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting and rolling dice is self explanatory, while playing a God card involves picking a target for the effect on the card, playing it and resolving the effect, and drawing a replacement card. Some cards have good effects while others have detrimental ones, but the only way to replace a God card is to play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dueling involves both players rolling all of their dice, which is a nice way to ruin someones plans if they're showing three of a kind. The winner is the player with the most non-mockery icons showing and they get 1/2 of all the dice rounded up, keeping all the rolled faces, while the loser gets the remainder. This is a great way to get more dice if you only have a few and Duel someone with many, and if you win you can even grab a set of scoring dice from those rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at any time your dice show three or more mockery icons, immediately throw away all of your dice, draw three new dice, roll them, and end your turn. This includes Duels: When one or more players shows at least three Mockery icons during a duel, the duel is immediately canceled, each player retains their dice, and the player(s) showing 3+ mockery need to follow the steps at the beginning of this paragraph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring sets of dice occurs automatically at the end of a players turn and awards a single victory token. Get three victory tokens and your Ascend to Major God status and win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each version of the game supports up to four players so feel free to combine two games to have up to eight players fight for supremacy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
