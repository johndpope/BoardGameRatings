			<description>From Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new mini-module by Skip and Penny Williams challenges PCs with a haunting adventure. What is the wild hunt? Will the PCs survive their visit to Friezford? Drop this free online adventure into your campaign in any wilderness setting that contains a former trading route. Suitable for four 14th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What haunts the woods surrounding the ghost town of Friezford? And what lurks in the shattered remains of its buildings? Are there really ghosts in Friezford? Or does the place hide more material dangers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mountain village of Friezford has been dead, but not entirely abandoned, for generations. Friezford is literally a ghost town, where spirits, both malevolent and benign, struggle to prevail. Outside the village, fearsome beasts and strange invaders from the depths of the earth stalk the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a century ago, Friezford was thriving and well on its way to becoming a small town. The economic heart of the village was Friezford Inn, a rambling stone edifice that served as a gathering place for local farmers and a much-appreciated rest stop for travelers, merchants, and adventurers crossing the mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well-kept farms ringed the village, keeping the inn supplied with simple, but high-quality fare, and the budding town had been gifted with a beautiful temple of Pelor, built by members of the local Friez family, who were successful merchants and landowners. The Friezes had lent their name to the settlement and founded the inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phalloides Friez, high priest of the temple, ministered to travelers, villagers, and farm folk alike. Friezford's quiet prosperity gave Phalloides free reign to leave the community from time to time and go adventuring, and his successes only enhanced Friezford's growing wealth and reputation. The Friezford area became so well known for its abundance and friendliness that it even attracted a rare colony of good-aligned, peace-loving drow, who settled in a secluded valley less than a day's walk from the village. The drow named their community Hidden Dell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alas, prosperity can be a fleeting thing, and a series of disasters proved Friezford's undoing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
