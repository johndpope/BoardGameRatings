							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moon Patrol (Avalon Hill)</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nimno Rusterk (ace pilot) put thrusters on full, dodged beneath the enemy missiles and fired another burst at the descending alien. This time it fails to avoid the explosion, just in time to come under fire from two more green alien landers. In a furious firefight he obliterates one on the way down and hits the second as it skims the ground, trying to land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another alien succeeded in landing under the cover of the dogfight, however, and it lies in wait behind one of the lunar ridges, protected from attacks. Nimno is going to have to dodge its ground fire as he fights the two new green aliens filtering down from orbit. Suddenly a red homing suicide ship appears. This turns the situation from bad to desperate. Nimno slows down, firing burst after burst, in a vain hope of destroying the ship before it rams him, but the wildly dodging ship avoids them all. One of the green landers slips too low, and gets hit by a burst meant for the suicide ship. This evens out the odds a bit, but then the grounded lander starts firing from below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a final desperation move, Nimno zooms up to avoid the ground fire, dodges the missiles of the descending lander, hits it with a lucky burst, and zooms down to skim the ground, barely being missed by the homing suicide ship. He is so busy thanking his lucky stars for this narrow escape that he fails to see the approaching lunar mountain in time to react...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crater left by the explosion as he crashes into the slope is his final monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moon Patrol is an exciting solitaire or two-player game of fast action and split-second decisions. You can play at four different levels of difficulty. Your mission is to destroy as many as possible of the alien ships without being destroyed yourself. You receive five patrol ships armed with photon torpedoes to help you achieve your mission. If your ship survives one wave of aliens, you must land it to refuel for the next wave, or your craft will run out of fuel and crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
