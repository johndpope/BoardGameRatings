			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second in the series of indispensable guidebooks produced by the legendary Wanderers Guild, this tome is an exciting anthology of essays and observations collected by Olin Drammerstad, famed treasure seeker and gentleman of the sea, and the late Vilg Kepnear, respected scholar and researcher of marine life. The knowledge and accounts of these partners, earned through nearly sixty combined years of exploration and adventure, provide fascinating and insightful reading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dozens of previously undocumented creatures are given generous space for detailed explanation and splendid artistic depiction. Additional entries examine equally important topics such as the expertise of the Sea Delvers, their specialized trappings, and the fantastic environments beneath the waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scribed for the Guild by eminent quillwielder Gunnar Hultgren and designed and illustrated by renowned illuminator Andy Hopp, this d20 monster manual continues the Wanderers Guild legacy in a volume designed to arm the traveler of the seas against the dangers and mysteries of the boundless blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of imaginative new aquatic creatures, all superbly illustrated&lt;br/&gt;     Beautiful graphic design&lt;br/&gt;     Unique presentation system with notations indicating each creature's diet, habitat, sleeping habits, and more&lt;br/&gt;     Interactive, community-based online support via the Wanderers Guild web site, complete with fan-submitted entries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
