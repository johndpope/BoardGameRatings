							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time for the Bus</name>
									
			<description>Time for the Bus is a spin-and-move game designed to teach young children shape an color recognition. It was included in the Get Ready for Kindergarten! book and game set by Sharon Hinchey. In the game, each player places a school bus marker on a separate track leading to school. Each track is marked with one particular color and shape on each of its spaces.  In turn, each player spins the spinner.  The player whose color/shape is spun moves forward one space. The first player to reach the school wins. Along the way, players will land on &amp;quot;bus stop&amp;quot; spaces. Each time this happens, all players must sing &amp;quot;The Wheels on the Bus.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
