							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb of the Seeress</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomb of the Seeress is the first of the Battle &amp;amp; Loot PDF series. It is built around the resting place of an ancient sphinx slain by mighty heroes in ages past. Tomb of the Seeress includes three new monsters, associated treasure tables, and new magic items and rewards. Perfect for your AGE fantasy campaign! AGE (Adventure Game Engine) products are fully compatible with the Dragon Age RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from the introductory text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, a powerful king relied on the foresight and wisdom of a famed and supposedly immortal sphinx to guide his&lt;br/&gt;decisions and keep his kingdom rich and victorious. The sphinx&lt;br/&gt;revealed her prophecies only to those who could solve her riddles.  Solve a riddle, get a glimpse at your future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day, on the eve of a battle with a neighboring land, the king sought the sphinx&amp;rsquo;s advice, but the riddle she gave him could not be solved&amp;mdash;not in time, at least. The king went to battle without her counsel&amp;hellip; and suffered a terrible defeat. Furious and humiliated, he dispatched heroes of the time to slay her. This they did&amp;mdash;they thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wracked with both remorse and anger, the king had the sphinx&lt;br/&gt;installed in a tomb hidden in the wilds. &amp;ldquo;If she should live again,&amp;rdquo; tales say he proclaimed, &amp;ldquo;let only the bravest and most foolhardy gain the treasures with which she has been buried. May they be more brave and less foolish than I was.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;The proclamation passed into legend. The location of the tomb&lt;br/&gt;passed into myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
