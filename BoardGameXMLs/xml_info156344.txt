			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Spaces: Shipwrecks offers a way to help generate cool descriptions of shipwrecks for your next campaign encounter&amp;hellip; Do you need a fresh wreck washed up on the shore? Or an ancient hulk of a ship now part of the landscape and slowly washing away with each tide?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipwrecks provides three tables to roll on to generate the seeds of your PC&amp;rsquo;s frightful destruction. Those three tables - Sense, Descriptive Element, and Sense Descriptor - mean you never end up with a boring ship description again. You just roll a few dice and see what your brain throws out at you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine your party comes upon the remains of a big sailing vessel washed up on shore. You can use the descriptive elements to see what&amp;rsquo;s there that&amp;rsquo;s interesting and come up with some text that describes it to offer some sensory feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if you end up with &amp;ldquo;Sight [Sense]: Forecastle [Descriptive Element]- Ringing [Sense Descriptor]&amp;rdquo; you might come up with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s left of the ship&amp;rsquo;s forecastle has washed up on shore here. Though there&amp;rsquo;s not much to indicate what happened to the boat and crew, there&amp;rsquo;s a tiny bell ringing intermittently ringing in the wind that survived whatever foul event destroyed her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
