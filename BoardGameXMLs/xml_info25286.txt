							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SNAFU</name>
									
			<description>The board for SNAFU (which here is supposedly &amp;quot;Situation Normal All Filled Up&amp;quot; - sure) consists of 100 squares in 5 colors - red, blue, green, and yellow, all of which are assigned to the players, plus pink. Each player or team (the 4-player game is for teams) takes a color of chips, white or black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player spins a spinner which produces a result from 0-5 in one of the board colors or white.  If the color is pink or a friendly color, the player places markers in the number of spaces shown.  If an opposing color, the player may choose to place the opposing markers on the board.  If white, the player takes opposing markers off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of four possible conditions are met - one team controls the main diagonal of the board, one team controls all squares of their colors, etc.  None of these conditions automatically win the game, but some add points to the team's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
