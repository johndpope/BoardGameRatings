							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sheep Happens: Lords of Corruption</name>
									
			<description>Blinded by greed and desire, the Sheperds of &amp;quot;Sheep-Happens Lords of Corruption&amp;quot; were corrupted by demonic arts. To protect their lives and ambitions, they sealed large part of their power within the herds, resulting in some sort of eternal life. The burning desire to claim for themselves the domination of the valley led them to break each other's seals, initiating the conflict that still rages. Only if you prove to be the most skilled and ruthless you can prevail upon your enemies. Remember Shepherd ... Thin is the line between victory and defeat. Win the game by destroying your opponents herds to remain the last sheperd on the field, but beware, the closer you are to Oblivion, and at the end of your kingdom, the greater the power at your disposal, and with it the devastation, that you will pour out on your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
