							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seadogs and Darlings</name>
									
			<description>Seadogs and Darlings is a social climbing game akin to En Garde! There is no duelling in the game and a greater emphasis on entertainments and events to try to gain a better position in life. You may start life as a lowly bakers boy or be the son of a count, you still will be of little consequence until you have made your mark as a socialite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diverse entertainments include, playwriting, cricket, bowling, carousing, joining the muster, joining the army and of course holding parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
