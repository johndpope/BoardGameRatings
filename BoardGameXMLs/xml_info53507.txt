							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Satsume&#039;s Tournament</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Emerald Champion, Doji Satsume, has announced a tournament to held at his castle. The finest young samurai are invited, with an opportunity to win Glory and, perhaps, appointment as an Emerald Magistrate. And adventure for low-rank characters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Repeated playings have shown that this event runs better if the PCs are compacted into two or three of the teams, rather than distributed across five. The GM is encouraged to adjust the event accordingly. Note, however, that PCs can never be members of Team #5. Also, we recommend that NPC non-combat skill levels be left unchanged when running this module under 2nd Edition rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
