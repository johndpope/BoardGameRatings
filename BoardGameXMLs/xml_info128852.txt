							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Torture the RPG</name>
									
			<description>Authors Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps your party captured the spy and need to get information out of him quickly, or maybe your Player Character has been caught by a serial killer, and now the story calls for a scene of torture and information extraction. This product gives you the ability to &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; this scene of pain, blood and horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torture the RPG is a game designed to allow you to play through the process of torturing a character in your story. Rather than fall back on a &amp;quot;Will vs Will&amp;quot; type resolution which many systems might suggest, this game allows for a number of scenes where the Torturer and the Victim can use their various resources to defeat their opponents goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The framework can also be used stand alone, or for a torture scene within any other game, so if Super Villains are trying to get the launch codes out of your Hero, or the Nazi's are putting the squeeze on your Airborne POW, you can use this product to play through that scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
