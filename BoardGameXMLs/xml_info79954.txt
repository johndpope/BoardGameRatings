							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oink! (1983)</name>
									
			<description>From the Winter/Spring 1983 Activision catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Mike Lorenzen, with three oinks and a growl.  Three portly porkers are worried about their houses.  No, they're not going condo, but the wolf is at the door and he's blowing like crazy.  First, there's a house of straw, then one of wood, and then one of brick.  They're all victims of the wolf's incredibly bad breath.  Unless, of course, the home-owning oinkers can repair the damage faster than the wolf can cause it.  Home remodeling has at last, become a ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conceived and designed by Mike Lorenzen.&lt;br/&gt;For one or two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time there were no video games.  People actually read fairy tales for kicks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, the biggest hit around was the one about three little piggies who were into building houses.  Unfortunately, an unsavory character named Bigelow B. Wolf was into blowing them down.  It was a real drag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because, lo and behold, today we've got Oink!.  A video game that lets you lend those little guys a hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's wacky.  It's wily.  It's one heck of a way to block that bully's every breath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why, it's so exciting, even if you hate oinkers, you'll still love Oink!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because, you see, in this game, you can also be (heh-heh) the Wolf!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instruction manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by helping the Pigs patch their houses, thereby protecting them from Bigelow B. Wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
