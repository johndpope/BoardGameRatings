			<description>A strategic card game of epic superpowers and divine kingdom building&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descending from heaven, divine angels find themselves fashioned in human bodies. Bound to who they truly are, these angels discover themselves called by God to build His magnificent kingdom. Chosen and blessed to be given special powers from heaven, these spiritual beings race amongst themselves to influence the realm of Earth. In an epic battle of extraordinary powers, faith and fellowship, these devout angelic bishops seek God for guidance and authority. Which faithful child will God use to build His holy kingdom? God knows, but only time will tell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race for the Kingdom (RFTK) is a strategy card game, where 2-4 players become powerful angels gifted with unique individual abilities. These angels race around the realm of earth building and seeking God&amp;rsquo;s kingdom. With heavenly favor and a divine influence to fellowship with mankind, your challenge is not with flesh nor blood, but against other principalities and their impressive powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In RFTK, the game is about racing to achieve 1 of 3 victory conditions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Kingdom Expansion (place all 12 kingdom churches in play)&lt;br/&gt;     Kingdom Development (stack 3 churches on a chosen number of territories)&lt;br/&gt;     Kingdom Rapture (hold in hand 3 out of the 4 God cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
