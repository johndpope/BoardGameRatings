			<description>This is a cooperative and combinatorial (perfect information, and no luck after the initial deal) climbing game for 2 players, that is also playable solitaire and has a competitive variant.  In the game, players alternate turns drafting cards from a 5 by 4 grid of cards regular playing cards face up, with players taking cards from the lower part of the grid first, revealing other cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has drafted 10 cards, play begins.  Players attempt to play a single card, or a set of cards, each one must succeed the prior one played with a higher value, or greater amount of cards.  Players then score points based upon how long of a run their last play was, with points lost for cards left in hands.  Players also have jokers that act as wild cards, used to complete the going out in a single run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solitaire version works like the 2 player version, but a player plays both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a competitive version that utilizes the same drafting mechanism, but tweaks how cards are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
