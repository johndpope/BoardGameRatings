							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Claims of Gold</name>
									
			<description>The race is on! Ole prospector Gus has kicked the bucket&amp;mdash;God rest his soul. His last will and testament states that the deed to his gold-rich land goes to the first miner to claim 30 ounces from the dirt. Payment is due in seven days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claims of Gold plays over seven rounds with mechanics that combine worker placement and press your luck. Each turn, players place miner meeples out on the board to take different actions like visiting the workshop, mining the land, or cleaning out dirt to find gold. Taking an action first gives the best benefit, so players are met with challenging decisions on how to efficiently collect gold while trying to foil the efforts of other miners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Press-your-luck comes into play as players clean out buckets of dirt from their operation to find gold. Bedrock is more rich with gold than regular Dirt, but watch out&amp;mdash;it also contains more rocks. If a player reveals two rocks when cleaning out, then a piece of equipment they have acquired from the shop breaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the miner that claims it all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
