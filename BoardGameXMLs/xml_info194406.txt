							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assault on Arnhem</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hex &amp;amp; counter wargame about Operation Market Garden. Has 4 scenarios. Although the game looks like a boardgame, it is not a digital implementation of an existing boardgame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the sequel of Arnhem: Airborne Assault&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the developer Assault on Arnhem is a significant improvement on top of the original game. The list of improvements includes: better AI, Allied AI, complete rebuild of the UI, new artwork, HexWar multiplayer, Mac and PC versions, a tutorial, tooltips, rewritten instructions, balancing, a rewrite of the pathfinding process and a number of other user improvements. To put it into perspective the additional work has taken a year to complete, which is as long as the original game took to write!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably most notable is that due to these changes, this new game is now platform independent, meaning you can play versus any other player owning this game, regardless which platform each player uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
