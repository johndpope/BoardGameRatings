			<description>Each player has ten tiles with different patterns of holes. In each turn, they place a tile on the opponent's tile (stack), then turn the board so their opponent's tile is in front of them again. The object is to cover as many holes of the opponent's last tile as possible. The player who manages that better gets the difference between the holes covered by both players in points for that round. Whoever has most points after ten tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;This game is the base of Treasure Quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
