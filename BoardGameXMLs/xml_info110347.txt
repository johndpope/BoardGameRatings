			<description>From the Intellivision manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;You control a World War II attacker bomber in a special, death-defying mission...where EVERYTHING you destroy counts. Your targets are combat ships, aircraft carriers, tanks, trucks, trains and the like, and you must fight DAY and NIGHT to succeed! You can fly your plane up, down, left, right, or at an angle, and both drop BOMBS and shoot BULLETS. WATCH OUT for the ENEMY! They always fire at you from the ground and chase you in the air!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runways appear at the beginning and between battle cycles. Your score appears between battle cycles and when you are hit. There are 4 skill levels and 12 types of targets. Both single and multiple hits are possible. Scoring gets tougher by the minute! This is prime-time WAR ACTION! If you fail the first time, you are given 3 more chances! So BLOW them to PIECES, score HIGH and get your mission RIGHT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
