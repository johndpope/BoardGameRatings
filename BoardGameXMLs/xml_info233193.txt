							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Masters of the Universe Role Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very stench of treachery hangs over the horrid halls of Snake Mountain, stronghold of the evil Skeletor and his minions... all pieces are assembled in this deadly game... the all-seeing eyes above the planet Eternia see that Evil-lyn holds the blast jewel...  ...Skeletor himself holds the shrink/enlarge crystal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the commercial success of various board games based on the Masters of the Universe media franchise, an initial roleplaying game was attempted.  The game's appearance is more like a board game than an RPG, with a gridded map, paper miniatures, and other tokens.  The rules are presented as a mix of comic-book style illustrated pages and text.  Replay value of the single included scenario is low.  An &amp;quot;advanced rules&amp;quot; expansion was planned for 1986 but not published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box set includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        two cardstock character sheets&lt;br/&gt;        five cardstock token sheets&lt;br/&gt;        Folding game board&lt;br/&gt;        24-page rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;        errata slip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
