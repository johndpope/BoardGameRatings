							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clyde&#039;s Revenge</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clyde&amp;rsquo;s Revenge is a puzzle-platform game for DOS. It directly follows Clyde&amp;rsquo;s Adventure, and offers four more episodes to play, with the first one being shareware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clyde&amp;rsquo;s goal is the same as in the previous game &amp;ndash; find all the gems and the artefact, and then escape the castle he is exploring before his energy runs out. Clyde&amp;rsquo;s Revenge offers 4 difficulty settings that make it much more accessible to players. The easiest setting is an exploration mode where players are invincible and do not lose energy by doing anything. The other difficulty settings will inflict energy loss from traps and hazards, but not from walking and jumping. This modification eliminates the need to plan levels out beforehand and travel through maps in the most efficient route possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New types of terrain have been added to the series, including magnets, and keys have been included that must be used to unlock obstructive doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
