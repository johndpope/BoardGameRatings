							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Annwyvvn: A Celtic Heresy</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting for this campaign is mostly northern European, especially the Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse lands. There is also a possibility of reaching the magical Elven lands of Annwyvvn (Welsh), Tir Na Og (Irish), or even Alfheim/Elfeheim (Nordic/Germanic). The campaign theme is the promotion of the Celtic heresy and the discovery of the Elven lands, which have been lost since the paths to those lands were suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. There is also a problematic, and somewhat unspecified rise of evil forces, led by one only known as 'The Bright Star'. Theologians can work out form themselves the relationship between this is with the comments in Revelations or the Finno-Ugarian god Jumala, and their association with the Pole Star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
