			<description>WhizORD  deck has 108 cards, each having a letter of the alphabet, and a value from 1-10, rarer letters being worth more.  Rules for several games are included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poker-WhizORD: Like draw poker with 7 cards and one draw per hand.  The player with the highest-scoring words adds it to his total.  Alternate rules add chips and betting typical to poker, with up to 3 rounds of betting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soli-WhizORD: A solitaire game.  Player deals himself 10 hands as if in Poker-WhizORD -- including one draw -- and scores their best word.  The goal is 300 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rummy-WhizORD: Players have 7-card hands, and in each turn they play and score a word or pass and discard any number of cards; then they draw back up to 7.  Winner is the first to an agreed total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty-WhizORD: Players start with 7-card hands, and in their turn draw 1 and discard 1.  The first player with a 30-point word in hand calls &amp;quot;Thirty!&amp;quot;, lays it down and wins the hand.  Play to an agreed number of hands or wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangman-WhizORD: Players each think of a word with the same number of letters, and pick their letters out of the deck, laying them out face down in the opponent's reading order.  Take turns guessing letters, correct guesses being revealed, incorrect guesses being noted to avoid repeats.  You may guess the word but if guessed wrong you lose; otherwise the first one to expose all the opponent's letters wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Match'Em-WhizORD: 12 or more matching pairs of letters are pulled from the deck, suffled and laid out on the table.  Players reveal 2 cards in their turn, keeping matches, as in Concentration/Pelmanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precitd-WhizORD: One card is revealed.  Each player reveals another card in turn, but first predicts whether their card will precede or follow the first card.  The player who predicted correctly, and has the letter closest to the first letter, captures all the cards; no one wins if a tie or a card matches the first one.  At the end of the deck, the most cards captured wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
