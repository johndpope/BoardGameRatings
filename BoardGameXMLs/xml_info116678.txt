			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sol-Deace was a stylish space shooter where the player collected various weapons to supplement his firepower and blasted through hordes bizarre enemies.  While the game was known as Sol-Deace on Genesis, the Sega CD release, which occurred at the same time, was known as Sol-Feace.  The primary difference is that Sol-Feace, being on the Sega CD, had better sound effects and music and was one of the earliest titles on the console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
