							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gunship: Mk II</name>
									
			<description>As the war continues endlessly, many new weapons roll off the factory floors of the Warship Guild!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gunship Mk II doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the classic lines of her predecessor, but she packs a powerful punch!  Dual Torpedo Launchers and two Multi-Purpose Weapon Pods give the Mk II a wide variety of explosive ordnance to crack open an enemy Assault Carrier or mercilessly hammer their positions on the ground below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This accessory for Gunship: First Strike! gives Players access to a new Gunship option.  The Mk II looks, customizes, and fights in ways that are different from the standard Gunship included in the core game.  When you&amp;rsquo;re ready for a new experience, the Gunship Mk II makes a great addition to your fleet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
