							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jarin Ethnic Group</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jarin people were the first human inhabitants of H&amp;acirc;rn. Many of the barbarian tribes of H&amp;acirc;rn are of Jarin blood and small pockets of civilized Jarin can be found in Evael (kingdom of the elves) and Azadmere (land of the dwarves). Most civilized Jarin, however, live in the Kingdom of Orbaal, where they struggle under the rule of the Ivinian vikings who invaded northern H&amp;acirc;rn during the last century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jarin article describes the history of this ethnic group as well as their religion, law, art, folkore, and many other aspects of their culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classic article and most of its content was originally published in 1985 in Encyclopedia Hârnica 15 and in 1987 as part of the Orbaal Kingdom Module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
