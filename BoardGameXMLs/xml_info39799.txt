			<description>Players use dice to move clock-wise on the outer rim of the board. They keep moving in circles until they have picked up 4 items and completed 4 tasks. Basically this involves landing on special squares or gaining said items or tasks through event cards. The items include a private jet, a huge house, etc. The tasks include getting a severence package, protesting outside parliament, etc. The game is won when a player has collected all 4 items and all 4 tasks, made his way to the big square in the middle - which is the press conference, where the player promptly resigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is found in the action cards. There are three types. &amp;quot;Recession&amp;quot; cards, &amp;quot;Booming Economy&amp;quot; cards and &amp;quot;Uncertain Times&amp;quot; cards. Each card has a heading, some text (event) and a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
