			<description>The object of the game is to collect matching cards that tell familiar Bible stories, including Noah's Ark, David &amp;amp; Goliath, Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors, Jesus in the Temple, and others.  The player completing the most stories is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of each picture are used for younger children, four of each picture for younger children.  The only distinguishing feature from Go Fish is an optional rule where the set collector must tell the Bible Story pictured before counting the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features &amp;quot;Precious Moments&amp;quot; artwork on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
