			<description>Plith is a fresh indie puzzle game for Windows, OSX and Linux. It puts gamers in a spatial setting, where they have to manage several puzzle elements (mostly gears) and must make quick decisions which can simplify or complicate their path to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plith is a fast paced game which contains a lot of levels &amp;ndash; more than 100 &amp;ndash; to be solved. The player moves some gears and can place them on the level; some gears rotate, and transmit their rotation to the adjacent ones: the objective of each level is to activate the target gears. These levels constitute five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections. Each section introduces new gameplay elements; for example, several kinds of gears and obstacles come out along the game. The game is presented using mostly 3D graphics, with a few handmade drawings as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fresh puzzle game&lt;br/&gt;     Fast paced&lt;br/&gt;     More than 100 levels&lt;br/&gt;     Five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections&lt;br/&gt;     Several gameplay elements (e.g. several kinds of gears and obstacles)&lt;br/&gt;     3D Graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
