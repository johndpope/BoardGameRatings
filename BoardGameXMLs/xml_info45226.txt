							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Temple Complex</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring more than 150 rooms at ground level the High Temple is closer to a citadel than a temple. The massive complex features a large ziggurat and a detached chapel. Inside the temple there are large inner gardens and many shrines and chapels. A wall surrounds the whole complex, with many stairs reaching its top. The wall is not intended as a defense (there are no gates). There are three levels (ground, first and roof level) and a dungeon level. Some hints to use the complex follow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An evil cult stronghold, home of the high priest and his evil clergy who perform obscene rituals and human sacrifices .&lt;br/&gt;    A forgotten temple citadel, lost in a deep jungle, now inhabited by lizardfolks and other reptiles races.&lt;br/&gt;    A ruined temple complex dedicated to a forgotten evil deity. During the night, evil sacrifices are performed.&lt;br/&gt;    The home of a good priest-king. The complex houses the noble families and their slaves.&lt;br/&gt;    Temple of the Dragon God: a powerful schemer dragon hides in the dungeon of the complex. His minions roam the countryside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
