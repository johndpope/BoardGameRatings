			<description>The Glorious South is designed around a famous painting of Taiwan from the 1930s called &amp;quot;Festival on South Street&amp;quot;. In the game, players describe different details in the painting, guiding their teammates to the answers and collecting different products in order to earn ingots and score. The products are all import and export goods for which Taiwan was famous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kuo Hsueh-Hu (1908-2012), one of the most well-known and respected artists of the Taiwanese art history, painted this painting in the 1930s. It was about &amp;quot;DaDaoCheng&amp;quot;, an area in Taiwan which was not only the business center of Taipei in the 1920s and 1930s, but is also now one of the most cultural tourist site with beautifully renovated architectures and shops, cafes and galleries. The painting is now one of the most important art pieces of Taiwan and in the collection of Taipei Fine Arts Museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
