			<description>Sanasokkelo (which means word labyrinth) is Finnish word game. Game consist of circular board, which has four rings of letter spaces and one letter space in the middle. Nearby letter spaces are connected with lines. There is 73 of these rounded holes in the board. At the start of every game you will randomize cardboard letter tiles to these holes. Now you decide how long you will play and turn around the board. Then everybody tries to make words with letters, that are connected with lines. When you find a word (at least four letters long), you shout it and collect the points. You get one point for every letter in the word you found. You get special points, if you can use the letter in the middle or letters in the third (red) circle. When time runs out, the player with most points is the winner. The game can be played in any language, which have approximately same letter distribution in words as in Finnish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
