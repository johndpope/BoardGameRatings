			<description>Space aliens captured and cloned a janitor named Herb to play a new game...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herbs is a fun and simple strategy game where players make their moves simultaneously. It's like a simulated arcade game, which makes players rely more on good thinking than quick reflexes. Success in the game will depend on carefully devising your plans while leaving plenty of room for the unexpected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;Each player will control two Herbs attempting to simply score the most points using 200 Action Points. Points will be scored by eliminating stones or by forming certain scoring patterns with the stones. Destroying an opponent's Herb also scores points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
