							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dance of the Vampires</name>
									
			<description>Dance of the Vampires is a compilation of the writeups from wargames used in the development of Tom Clancy's novel Red Storm Rising.  It includes not only the writeups, but also the Dance of the Vampires scenario that appeared in The Naval SITREP Issue #34 (October 2008), along with fully updated statistics for the ships, aircraft and systems used. It also includes two additional SITREP articles, one on Russian antiship&lt;br/&gt;missile guidance in detail, and another describing an improved method of managing air-to-air refueling.&lt;br/&gt;It also includes an incomplete writeup of the Keflavik&lt;br/&gt;Turkey Shoot, the scenario that convinced Larry Bond that Tom Clancy's idea of having the Soviets invade Iceland in Red Storm&lt;br/&gt;Rising, however improbable, was necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
