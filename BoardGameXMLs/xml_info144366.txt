			<description>User Summary: Third edition of the Super Crusaders system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Game World&lt;br/&gt;This game is set in a world of Superheroes who do things normal people can only dream about, like picking up cars, flying, dodging bullet's or turning invisible; and things that ordinary people just wouldn't do, like wear tights, fight super villains &amp;amp; bring children along with them on dangerous missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a world where people who have near death experiences often walk away with special powers or a sense of purpose that sets them apart from normal humanity and begins a life of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a world on the edge, threatened by monsters and super villains. where superheroes are the only thing keeping civilization together. In this world the battle between good and evil is much more out in the open than in the real world, but the warriors who fight the battle are mysterious figures who's identities remain secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a rich universe with a past and a future, with many planets, and dimensions, but the primary focus of the game is the here and now. Despite all the incredible things going on, the world outside is familiar and close to the hearts of the players and the heroes they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
