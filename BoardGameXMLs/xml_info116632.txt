			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In K3 Prinsessen you have to choose one of the three K3 band members and fly with her between the clouds.  Watch out that you don't touch the clouds or it's game over.  You have to get as far as possible in the game.  There are also enemies along the way, don't bump into them or you will be dead.  Every princess has it's own special magical ability that you can use in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
