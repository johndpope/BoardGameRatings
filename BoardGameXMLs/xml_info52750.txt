			<description>A collection of pregenerated statistics for Intelligent Glorthan races.  It includes over 1200 individuals with individualised weapons, spells and equipment including familiars and mounts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;The world portrayed in the role-playing game RuneQuest is filled with dangerous and exotic life forms.  Some are legendary, such as the manticore, griffin, or minotaur.  Some are unique to Glorantha such as the Dragonewt, morokanth, or broos.  Some are traditional, such as the troll, elf, or dwarf.  Some are from myths, such as the awesom dragon, the wyrm, or the terrifying wyvern.  Many are human, including varous types of barbarians, peasants, mercenaries, and adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book, FOES, contains the statistical profiles of over 1200 such characters prepared for instant use by referees in hundreds of situations.  Normal calculation of this many non-player-character statistics would take the average person more than 200 hours of work - yet FOES presents them at once, with variety, thought, and wit for less than 1 cent each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
