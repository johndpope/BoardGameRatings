			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Night of Blood&lt;br/&gt; The debate over the future of the Ork Underground is heating up. Proposition 23, which will decide whether or not the Underground becomes an official district of the city of Seattle, is coming up for a vote, and people on all sides are getting desperate. There are those, though, who understand that desperation can breed opportunity, and they are hatching plots that can help them take advantage of the chaos that is sure to rain down on the city. And there are others for who chaos is an end in and of itself.&lt;br/&gt; Assassin Nation is the latest in the Shadowrun Missions series of adventures, designed for play in conventions, in stores, or in the comfort of your own home. Whether you've played the entire current series of Missions or are jumping in here, Assassin Nation will plunge you into the double-crosses and bloodletting that are part of the way things get done in the Sixth World, and it will all culminate in a night of audacious violence.&lt;br/&gt; Shadowrun Mission 04-09: Assassin Nation is for use with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buried Underground, Part 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Election season is closing in, and Project Freedom is at the center of the 2073 political scene. Both sides are slinging more than mud though, and members of both the O.R.C. and the Seattle Government are turning up dead. Can the runners stop the bloodshed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
