			<description>From the New World Games website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A speedy game for 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's not really any strategy involved in this quick game.  I was just trying to make up something fun and simple that required fast thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will race to make scoring sets of five cards by combining pictures and colors in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a deck and shuffles it thoroughly.  Decks are then passed to the left, so that each player uses a different deck than he shuffled.  One player calls Vamanos and the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw one card at a time and place each in one of three rows on the table in front of themselves.  There are no turns and each player only plays in his own three rows as fast as he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has five cards in one of his rows, he quickly gathers them in a small stack and pushes them to the side for later scoring.  New cards may placed in the now empty row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player finishes, the game stops.  Rows that don&amp;rsquo;t score and unused cards will penalize players.  The first player to 500 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/mapetty/vamanos.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.geocities.com/mapetty/vamanos.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
