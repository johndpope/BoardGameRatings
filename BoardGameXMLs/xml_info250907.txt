							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape The Lair</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for 4-6 PCs between levels 3-4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the party willing to plunder a supposedly abandoned Lich&amp;rsquo;s lair?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Holy Order of Athagos has come to you to undertake a quest that even the heartiest of souls would flee from. The party is asked to destroy a Lich&amp;rsquo;s tomb and death cache, and everything in it, in exchange for what bizarre treasures lie deep within. Rumors from years ago still persist in the bizarre and outlandish tricks and traps that this Lich delights in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seers from The Order of Athagos have confirmed that the Lich is currently far away from this hideout, yet the problem resurfaces in the PCs minds: How long can the Holy Order&amp;rsquo;s wizards maintain their shielding spells long enough to allow their party to execute their deadly mission?Better still, does this particular party have what it takes to accomplish this task and escape with their lives AND sanity intact? (no, a LICH is NOT in this adventure!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHO IS IT FOR? - GM&amp;rsquo;s running the Pathfinder system looking for a great darker-themed adventure to throw at unsuspecting PCs. It has easy moments and very challenging moments. There are 18 FULL-PAGE PLAYER HANDOUTS specifically designed and created just for this adventure. 5 FULL PAGE MAPS for the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
