							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of Entropy: On Treacherous Ground</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribal warfare and intrigue in the brink of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is spring on the lands of Kainu, a hunter-gatherer tribe located in the vast northern forests. Ruled by their women chiefs and shamans they never stay too long in one place, but rather wander their lands in loose groups, hunting, gathering and fishing. Their lands are harsh, hill after hill covered by the primeval forest flanked by dark swamplands and marshes. There are no roads and no buildings, just nature, and hardened people extracting their living from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
