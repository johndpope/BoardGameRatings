			<description>Subtitle: An Arcane Supplement for Dime Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic &amp;amp; Mysticism is the second &amp;quot;sourcebooklet&amp;quot; for Dime Heroes. It provides ways for referees to incorporate magical and supernatural elements into their pulp games if they so desire. Magic &amp;amp; Mysticism is designed to accommodate the exploits of such heroes as The Shadow, Mandrake the Magician and Blackstone the Magic Detective. However, this sourcebooklet is also easily expandable to add magic and mystical aspects to any setting in which you'd care to run 1PGs, such as swords &amp;amp; sorcery, gothic horror or superheroes with some appropriate tweaking depending on the &amp;quot;flavor&amp;quot; of your setting and game style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the referee, you are encouraged to use all or selected parts of this information in your game. Remember that you are the referee and have final say in all matters. If an arcanist doesn't fit in with your game, you are quite within your rights to not allow such a character. Game balance is accomplished by good judgment by the referee and not arbitrary game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
