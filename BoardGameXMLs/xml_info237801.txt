							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">When Our Journey Ends - A Visual Novel</name>
									
			<description>The story follows Mariko, a seventeen year old who is on the cusp of graduating high school. She is the lone passenger of a slowly dying train station. As a practical young adult, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t see why her family couldn&amp;rsquo;t have just moved closer to the high school she is attending. She is rather embarrassed by the whole situation and the attention it garners her. She just wants to graduate and go to a university in the big city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, life in the sticks isn&amp;rsquo;t all that it seems. While riding the train home, Mariko ends up at an unexpected stop, which changes her life forever.&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
