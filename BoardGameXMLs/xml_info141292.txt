			<description>Insurgence is an assymetric PnP two-player game that pits brave rebels against an evil empire in a futuristic capital. Or maybe it's a benevolent empire against cruel terrorists - the victor will decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 3x3 grid of tiles that make up the districts of the capital. Both players use action cards to move pawns around the districts, but they each have very different goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rebels use hidden rebel cells and their rebel leader to fulfil plots by doing sabotage, making assasinations, and spreading propaganda throughout the districts. If the rebel player fulfils two out of three plots, he/she wins the game. But the rebels also work on causing uprising in the districts. This allows riots to spread from the slums towards the imperial palace. If that happens, the rebels also win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The empire player, meanwhile, try to either uncover the plots by sorrounding cells with armies and revealing them, or to capture the rebel leader by clever use of both armies and the secret police. If the empire player uncovers all three plots or captures the leader, he/she wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win you have to plan carefully while still being able to adapt to an unlucky draw of action cards. But most of all you'll have to both outwit and outbluff your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
