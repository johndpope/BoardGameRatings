			<description>It is a game designed for three or more players (special rules for two players) and the more the merrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are topics for everyone: children, husbands &amp;amp; wives, general (for everyone), and master-mind (for the deep thinkers and serious minded.)  It is a good way to communicate with each other and learn how to think about oneself and life using over a thousand provocative, unique, stimulating and sometimes humorous questions.  Because these questions don't always come up in everyday conversations, it is a chance to gain insights about each other in a pleasant, relaxed, and enjoyable atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
