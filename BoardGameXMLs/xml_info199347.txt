			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about telling the story together [and does not use] a traditional game master.  A scene is like a part of a movie - sometimes they are long, sometimes they are short. Setting up and cutting scenes keeps [the game focused], and allows the players to skip parts that they find boring to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All setup for the game is performed collaboratively.  After setup, play rotates through the players with each player gaining narrative focus when they are the &amp;quot;scene owner&amp;quot;.  The game does not provide any rules for determining outcomes should a narrative impasse develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
