							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasures of the Ancients</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ancients are a race of mysterious humans that once revelled in the glories of technology.  Suddenly, inexplicably, they were wiped out.  Their tools, their vehicles, their weapons, and other devices of interest can be found in the ruins of their former cities, buried in radioactive slag, or submerged under rerouted rivers and lakes.  Treasures of the Ancients, a supplement for the GAMMA WORLD game, details a plethora of these complex and valuable items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This accessory includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Weapons, bombs, grenades, and other military systems, including the lethal Mark XII Blaster.&lt;br/&gt;- Vehicles, civilian and military, occupational and recreational, including the fun but dangerous Pogo Platform.&lt;br/&gt;- Medical products to aid characters in their adventures, including the rare and wonderful Life Chamber.&lt;br/&gt;- Dozens of robots, including the Exterminator and the Devastator - two robotic devices that will make the most powerful mutants cringe in fear.&lt;br/&gt;- An additional suit of powered armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Front cover incorrectly says &amp;quot;Adventure&amp;quot; but should be an &amp;quot;Accessory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
