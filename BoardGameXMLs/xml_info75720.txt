			<description>This is a small demonstrationgame for Buzz It!.  You can also expand Buzz It! with it.  There are 10 cards with extra questions and a rulebook in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Buzz It! and in this demogame you get 10 cards wich each hold 2 questions.  You divide the cards equally between the players and each at a turn asks one of the two questions on a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the other players now has to answer the question at their turn.  Each player has 5 to 8 seconds to give an answer that the quizmaster has to accept.  (In a normal Buzz It! game you can use the timer for this).  The players have to keep giving answers until one player runs out off time.  If this happens that player gets the card with the question as a negative point.  The next player can now ask a question, this goes on until all players used all off their cards.  The player with the less negative points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
