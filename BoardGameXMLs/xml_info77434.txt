			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a teenager, what you want more than anything is to be truly independent. What you have yet to learn is that no-one really has the kind of independence you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That wouldn't be a problem, except that something very strange is happening to you when you sleep. You're not sure you can trust your closest friends enough to tell them, let alone any adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to do something, though, because the situation is getting steadily worse. You can't face it on your own. You're going to have to sacrifice a little of your independence so your friends can help you, if they can. After all, the same thing is happening to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
