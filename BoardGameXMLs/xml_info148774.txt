			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;In DROP, you and your friends will write a story. To keep this story from devolving into silliness too quickly, its plot is carefully structured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will write a story in five parts: a preparation phase where you discuss the basic parameters of the story, and four story acts. Each player will control one crewmember on a starship that&amp;rsquo;s been summoned to a planet. The crew will descend to the planet&amp;rsquo;s surface, explore a mysterious landmark, then run for their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also play this game yourself, by taking on all the characters&amp;rsquo; roles. The game assumes that the players are friends, and that they will freely discuss the ongoing story among themselves. This is not a competitive game, though you can screw over the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;Drop is a semi-freeform story game in which the players take on the roles of explorers descending to the surface of a planet and encountering a nameless horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
