			<description>Originally available as part of Free RPG Day 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This promotional item is essentially two books in one, with the Immortal Heroes handbook on one side, and the Hearts of Chaos adventure on the flipside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the interior of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero's Handbook - Immortal Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epic heroes travel roads that spiral through the cosmos like the spokes of a wheel; where the journey begins is often unique and far-flung, but the destiny of great heroes has but one unavoidable conclusion &amp;mdash; immortality. Some reach the journey&amp;rsquo;s end by slaying mighty enemies, others by fulfilling epic quests or discovering long lost secrets and ancient treasures. Still others turn the tide of history by leading great armies or nations, and some even walk a darker path, reveling in infamy rather than heroic fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book details nine epic destinies that lead down nine paths to immortality; they are individually as unique as snowflakes, yet identical in their ultimate conclusions. These paths may lead a hero to the radiant glory of the celestial realms or to the very depths of Hell itself. Some unlock the lost or hidden potential of a hero&amp;rsquo;s race, while others reveal the brutal and everlasting truths of martial superiority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hearts of Chaos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming to stores in September from Goodman Games, Amethyst is an RPG that postulates what would occur if a true-to-book fantasy setting was forced upon our real world. How would humanity truly respond? This is not some stylized, fanciful view of Earth seen in books and on TV. It is a world with all the problems, both social and political, intact. Would we welcome the world of fantasy into our lives or would we fear its very presence?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are a small cell of a large international mercenary company, the Iron Sons. They have been handed a critical mission: A former Iron Sons colonel, Montgomery Cross, has gone rogue and vanished in the deep wilderness. He has information on cell locations and strengths, but -- more importantly -- the face of the Iron Sons highest ranking officer, General Chauk -- a man with bounties for his arrest. Chauk believes this colonel to be a severe security risk, regardless of the state of his sanity. The characters are tasked with venturing into a no-man&amp;rsquo;s land where few humans have been, finding this colonel, and killing him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
