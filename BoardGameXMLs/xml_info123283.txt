			<description>Potty Painter was developed by J.F.Cain with a maze format and bonus games between levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a monkey character, joining dotted lines around a grid of squares, each different in size and points, all the while avoiding being captured by tribesmen. The player starts with 5 lives and 3 ten-second freezes of computer-controlled characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completing a round enables the player to play a bonus game guiding a teddy bear to a banana for an extra 1000 points.  Level 2 involves playing as a roller brush with a limited supply of paint. When the paint ran out the value of the squares decreased. Meanwhile the player had to avoid teddy bears.  Level 3 was the same as level 1 but with an extra tribesman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Potty Painter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
