			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wanted: Experienced Nurse for Quiet Job at Frankenstein Manor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The request was for a nurse to assist with the care of a homebound patient for one night only, and Nurse June was more than happy to take the job. Too bad she didn't know that nothing is ever easy--or safe--when Dr. Frankenstein and one of his Monsters is involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Temp of Frankenstein is a ROLF! combat scenario inspired by Z-grade horror movies. It features four pre-generated characters fighting it out in a plot that might well have come from the mind of Jess Franco, or Charles Band. (But since we couldn't afford to hire even one of those guys, we had to settle for ROLF! co-creator Steve Miller.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
