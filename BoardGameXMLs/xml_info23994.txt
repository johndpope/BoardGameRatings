			<description>MB #4028. For the budding astronomer of 1960. Ages 8 to 12. This game has two game boards, &amp;quot;Know the Stars&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Know the Planets&amp;quot;. Each comes with a deck of 24 card printed with some astronomy trivia. The mechanics are similar to Trivial Pursuit. One player draws a card and asks the opponent a trivia question from it. A correct answer allows the player to put a mark in a tic-tac-toe box on the game board.  For each completed row or column on the game board the player scores its point value. As each of the 9 squares on the tic-tac-toe board has a different value, there is some strategy here. Correct answers to 6 of the 24 cards enable a choice to mark a tic-tac-toe square or to erase an opponents mark. A simple plastic cover allows write-on/wipe off. &lt;br/&gt;The gameboard and card can also be used for a much simpler form of tic-tac-toe for the younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
