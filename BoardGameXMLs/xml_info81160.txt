			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world we live in is called Banther. On Banther, bugs are the largest form of life. This, in no way, means they are large. They are pretty much the same size as they are here on Earth, as is the plant-life and landscape. So bugs live a life free of the fears of predators other than themselves. On this planet, the Manna level is extremely high, giving some the ability to tune themselves to it and use it. This also gives bugs a very high intelligence (relatively speaking). In Buggz, you play the role of one of these tiny life forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
