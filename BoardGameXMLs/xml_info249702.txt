			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good friends are hard to come by. They are even harder to avenge after they had been murdered by the Russian Mob. It didn't matter that Silvio and his friend were on the wrong side of the law, too.  They had to pay for taking his friend. As those responsible fell under a hail of arrows, Silvio realized that his skill as an archer could get him paid better than any petty crime ever could. He would serve the underworld as an elit assassin... Arco Negro - The Black Bow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
