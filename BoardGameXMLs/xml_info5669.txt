			<description>This is a simulation of battleship combat, which abstracts each ship to four numeric attributes: attack, defense, speed and range.&lt;br/&gt;What you get is a thick paper map (22&amp;quot; x 16&amp;quot;) showing some coast outlines in different colors, 200 &amp;frac12;&amp;quot; cardboard counters, a 12-page rule-book and two dice. The counters represent WW2 battleships, cruisers and destroyers of various nationalities, plus markers to show ship speed and direction, targets, and damage inflicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[From the back of the box]&lt;br/&gt;Salvo is a fast paced, exciting simulation of surface Battleship actions of the Second World War. Practically every class of battleship that fought is represented, such as the Bismark, Iowa, Yamato and King George V. Cruisers and destroyers are represented by screening units. Scenarios include destruction of the French fleet at Mers-ek-Kebir, Suriago Strait, Second Guadalcanal, Calabria, North Cape and the Bismarck encounters. Hypothetical scenarios include such things as what might have happened if Halsey had deployed Lee's battleships to San Bernardino Strait during Leyte Gulf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the essentials of naval warfare are recreated, including gunnery, torpedoes, damage control and maneuvers. Also included are special rules depicting friendly fire, mines, command control, crew quality and shore batteries. Your playing skill will determine leadership quality! The map illustrates islands and land masses used in certain scenarios. Each hex equals 2000 yards and each game turn represents 10 minutes of real time. The game mechanics require no &amp;quot;paperwork&amp;quot; on the part of the players, for the resolution of combat or the execution of movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
