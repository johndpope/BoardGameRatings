			<description>Strategy game that includes die rolling, resource management, and order fulfillment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get the most points.  Players do this by collecting &amp;lsquo;dot cards&amp;rsquo;.  To collect the &amp;lsquo;dot cards&amp;rsquo; players need to hand in the correct number of matching coloured dots Players get chips by rolling a die to collect chips of different colour or trading chips to acquire different colours (trade values are determined on a track).  Three piles of five dot cards are available for acquisition by players during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The endgame value of the &amp;lsquo;dot cards&amp;rsquo; depends on two factors:&lt;br/&gt;The number of stars on cards (0-3) and the number chips a player has left over at the end of the game (points diminish with each left over chip, but maxing out at &amp;lsquo;3 or more chip&amp;rsquo; penalty).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the first &amp;lsquo;dot card&amp;rsquo; stack runs out, the other cards all increase in one &amp;lsquo;star value.&amp;rsquo;  Once the last &amp;lsquo;dot card&amp;rsquo; is taken, players calculate final scores and the highest score wins.  In the case of a tie, the player with the fewest &amp;lsquo;dot cards&amp;rsquo; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
