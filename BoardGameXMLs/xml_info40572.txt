			<description>Centrifuge is a trick-taking game for 2 to 4 players, and was originally developed for the Decktet.  Centrifuge makes unusual use of the dual-suitedness of the Decktet cards (Each card valued 2-9 has an &amp;quot;upper&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;lower&amp;quot; suit depicted on it.), in that the led card's upper suit will be positive, and its lower suit will be negative.  Subsequent cards may follow either suit, but those with the positive suit will be positive; those in the negative, negative.  Cards sporting both suits (such as the card that was led) cancel themselves, due to having both the positive and negative suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the total value of the cards in the trick is positive, then the highest card wins the trick - even if it's an off-suit card.  If the total value of the cards in the trick is negative, then the lowest card wins the trick - even if it's an off-suit card.  The ability of an off-suit card to win is the equivalent of a trump mechanism in Centrifuge.  Another unusual feature is that it's possible for no one to win the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is playing to collect symbols of her own secret suit, indicated by an ace she was dealt at the beginning of the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also supports partnership play (additionally offering a Cancellation variant).  The two-player game also offers a Playing for Both Teams variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
