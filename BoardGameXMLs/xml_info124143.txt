			<description>A pseudo-psychology game, intending to reveal how much you know about your friends and, in return, what they think of you. This is not how to win the game though. The winner is the player with the most points at the end. You earn points by lying, choosing good moves for your playing piece or by drawing cards (100% luck).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is by the roll of two dice. You have two playing pieces (your 'ego' and your 'id'. At ther start, just the ego is used. But once the hex 'Inferiority Complex' has been passed, you bring your id on to the board. Thereafter, you can move one piece the total of the dice rolled or you can move both your playing pieces by allocating one die to the ego and one die to the id. There are lots of cards, five types and when you land on certain hexes you have to take a card and obey the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
