			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card Game. Simulates a Coup in a Developing Country. One player is the Government. The other is the Rebels.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a deck of 140 cards. There are three types of cards in the deck &amp;ndash; Unit, Dummy, and Modifier. Each card has a Force value, from zero (Dummy) to twelve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players draw hands of ten cards and fight a series of battles between units. This process repeats each turn. The game ends when one player has no units remaining, in which case the other player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
