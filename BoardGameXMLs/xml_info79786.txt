			<description>Jurassic Park is a video game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis published by Sega and developed by BlueSky Software. It was released as part of the tie-in merchandise to the movie of same name from Universal Pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While all of the five video games released named 'Jurassic Park' were released to tie into Steven Spielberg's motion picture nearly all of them borrow elements from the Jurassic Park novel by Michael Crichton on which the film was based. In the case of the Sega Mega Drive's Jurassic Park the use of Procompsognathus and the Jungle River attraction and its pump house, as well as the abundance of park staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team, which included Earthworm Jim creator Doug TenNapel, spent over 15 months making the title, a long time for a game in 1993. The 3D models for the dinosaurs were created using Stop Motion Photography while a team member was filmed acting out Grant's movements and was then digitized. Sega claimed the game features ADI (Artificial Dinosaur Intelligence) causing the dinosaur enemies to react differently every time a player plays the level making no two games the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Jurassic Park (Sega game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
