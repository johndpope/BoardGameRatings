			<description>C.A.R.D.S. Core Rules presents everything needed for impromptu or simple roleplaying except for a standard deck of cards.  The deck is divided into suits and distributed among the GM and one to three players.  If more than three players are participating, a second deck is used.  The GM and each player receives all the cards of one suit.  The GM also retains the Jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play proceeds along a narrative-only fashion until a conflict situation arises (e.g., combat, as there is no skills system).  Combat is then resolved by playing cards.  Cards are discarded when played, or discarded when &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; to a higher card.  Winning cards return to the winners' hand.  The core rules deal almost exclusively with this mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
