			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the last issue of GMPubs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURE SCENARIO:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rod of Serraillian: A complete 40-page adventure for 6-9 characters of levels 6-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travelling long distances is the constant lot of the adventurer. This time, their quest will take them across the sea, and deep into the interior of a country they know little about, to retrieve an artifact stolen by one bunch of clerics from another.  Now, we all know that meddling in the affairs of the Gods can be a hazardous affair, but this time the Gods haven't been worshipped for hundreds of years, and their clerics slaughtered each other in a great battle back in the distant past. Maybe this is that adventure we've all been waiting for, where the treasure is just sort of sitting there, and all we have to do is go and get it...&lt;br/&gt;Background information for the Pelinore campaign is presented on page 55.&lt;br/&gt;Inside front and back covers have maps for this adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OTHER FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaching A Certain Level: It's a long way to the top&lt;br/&gt; Pelinore Campaign World &lt;br/&gt;- The City League: Questions &amp;amp; Answers&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;News, and Reviews&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
