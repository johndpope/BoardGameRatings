							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribes of Prax</name>
									
			<description>Players take on the role of a tribal khan from one of the five Great tribes of Prax: Sable, Impala, High Llama, Bison and Morocanth. The aim of the game is to accumulate status for your tribe. The tribe with the highest status at the end of the game is the winner. Players need to shepherd all their precious resources carefully in order to guide their tribe to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribes of Prax is played in turns each representing a Gloranthan year. A game will consist of between 8 and 12 turns. Each year is divided into several seasons and phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribes of Prax consists of a game board depicting the are of Prax, Glorantha, Spirit Plane board, tokens for each player and couple of decks for allied spirits and random events. The game board is divided into irregular areas. A type of terrain or unique location defines each area. Players' tokens are their herds, clans, khan, heroes, warriors and shaman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players also have power that acts as a currency in the game. New power for each round is gained from various positions. During the game players move their tokens to different areas in the map and do various acts using power. At the same time players try to balance with invading Lunar forces (not a player role). Their acts and herd size will determine how much status they gain among the other tribes. The player with most status after predefined amount of rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
