			<description>Hybrid is a gladiator game that uses 60 mm miniatures. Each player create a warrior by determining it's stats and equipping it. The miniatures are made out of plastic and use a system of magnets and hooks to make it possible to change armor and equipment between battles. This is also used to keep track of potions used during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game each player starts with a pool of six d6 called Action Dice, these are then used to perform actions. To succeed with an action the player has to roll higher or equivalent to a roll requirement specified by either the nature of the action or by the equipment used in the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
