			<description>Everyone makes mistakes, even A-Cell. However, when A-Cell makes mistakes, there's a lot on the line. James Fitzhugh is a decorated FBI agent, and a member of H-Cell, codename Horatio. A-Cell is convinced that Horatio has become a liability and is need of a retirement plan. Exactly why Delta-Green is after one of its own is up to the Keeper, but the underpinning facts should be wrong.
