							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Am√©lie Minuit</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Am&amp;eacute;lie is just about to leave her workplace whe she finds out she has forgotten an important file. It's 11 PM, the building closes at midnight, but she can't go home without the precious file. She has one hour (real time) to explore the 224 offices (spread across 9 floors), find the items she needs (her glasses, keys...), find the file and get out of the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Am&amp;eacute;lie Minuit is an exploration game. Players lead Am&amp;eacute;lie from room to room, searching offices, desks and file cabinets looking for the necessary items. It was Patrick Dublanchet's first game design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
