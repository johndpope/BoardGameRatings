							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creating New Class Options</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes a campaign will have special needs for archetypes or character options not found in the existing official material. If you&amp;rsquo;re in this situation, you might want to modify one or more of the classes in the game in order to provide options for players looking for a unique twist on their characters&amp;rsquo; abilities. However, modifying a class is not something that should be undertaken lightly, and the job requires some serious effort, playtesting, and revision to get it right. The two best ways to modify a class are to swap out some class features for different ones, and to add new to an existing class. These methods allow you to use existing mechanics as a model, while drawing upon features of other classes for inspiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
