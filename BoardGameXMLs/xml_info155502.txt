			<description>There's a lie in the believe.&lt;br/&gt;You may heard of this before, but can you really guess are the players telling the truth or it's a lie?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Believe!? is a bluffing game for 2-7 players, while each cards will show 2 dice and every player will receive 3 cards.&lt;br/&gt;Like the normal dice bluffing, you need to bluff more in terms of number of dice or a higher number.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the normal dice bluffing, every &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; in the game represent &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; and every &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; represent &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; in the game unless they are called. In addtion, if you think the other player is bluffing, you can call out &amp;quot; You Liar&amp;quot;. All the other player must then decide to either think the call is correct or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The losing team will take negative points. When a player reach a certain number of points, the game ends. That player loses and the rest win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will be themed in the same world as the game Gold Rush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
