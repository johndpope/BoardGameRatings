			<description>Spandrel is derived from Spaiji, and is a three-player game designed for play with a Shibumi set.  It uses a 4&amp;times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: The 4&amp;times;4 board starts empty. The players, White, Black, and Red, take turns placing one ball of each color (yes, all three colors) in a contiguous, touching chain on the growing pyramid. The balls can be placed on board holes and/or on top of 2&amp;times;2 platforms. The three balls can go on the growing pyramid in any orientation, as long as one of the three balls touches the two others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim: The player with the largest group of connected balls of her color when the pyramid is full wins. In case of a tie, the last player in turn order wins (i.e. Red beats Black beats White in a tie).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
