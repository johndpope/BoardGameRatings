			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Age of the Empire, the iron grip of Emperor Palpatine's new order has brought peace and order to a Galaxy reeling from the Clone Wars. That it has done so by oppression, control and increasingly brutal enforcement of its ideals has caused a growing number of people, initially in isolated pockets of resistance, to fight back. Some call them terrorists. We call them Rebels...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step onto the planet Lothal with Star Wars Rebels: Spark Of Rebellion, an unofficial fan-created sourcebook for the Star Wars Rebels TV show. This book contains background on the setting of the show, as well as its heroes, its villains, the equipment they use and the places they visit. Have a drink at Old Jho's Pitstop, or compete in violent illegal gladiatorial events. But whatever you do, wherever you go, watch out for the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A detailed section describing several locales on Lothal &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Two new player species options &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Weapons, armor, gear, and starships &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Five ready to play modular encounters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
