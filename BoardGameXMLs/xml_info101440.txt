							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spy Fox: Cheese Chase</name>
									
			<description>Something sure smells funny... the Limburger Cheese has been kidnapped! Spy Corps operatives have evidence that spy Russian Blue has stolen the prized cheese. SPY Fox is the only agent slick enough to stay on Russian Blue's tail as she speeds away from heisting the prized Limburger.&lt;br/&gt;In this Junior Arcade game, SPY Fox races after Blue and must deal with her henchmen and their weapons while he continues the chase through streets and snow, through air and water. That pretty Blue kitty's goons are in the thick of the chase as Quack provides motorcycles, snowmobiles, jet-skis, ultralights and an assortment of SPY gadgets to help return the cherished cheese. You control the intrepid Fox's movement in this vertical side-scroller as he chases his quarry on SPY scooters, jet-skis, and ultralights.&lt;br/&gt;When the going gets rough, a variety of Spy Gadgets will appear on the path in crates....but so will nasty surprises that Fox will want to dodge around. As with all Humongous titles, no one dies - a pie in the face or the &amp;quot;banana shooter&amp;quot; is about as violent as the action gets. Just be sure to watch out for potholes and streetlight poles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;100 game levels.&lt;br/&gt;Kid Editor allows you to make your own crazy levels.&lt;br/&gt;Helps to develop concentration, hand-eye coordination, decision-making abilities, setting and reaching goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
