							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tinker: Master of Modular Mechanical Mayhem</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BECOME THE SQUAD COMMANDER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some, the smell of oil is akin to that of a fine perfume, the rush of invention is the only motivation one needs, and the eternal battle against corrosion is a constant annoyance. These individuals, the tinkers, are exemplars of the unfettered creative spirit. It is this creative spirit, the constant thirst for new ideas, that propels them to seek the unknown, whether it be found in a library or in the dark depths of an ancient tomb.  Supported by a vast array of custom automatons, an experienced tinker, while not a fierce combatant on his own, commands an exceptionally versatile squadron that more than makes up for his own deficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tinker: Master of Modular Mechanical Mayhem is the end result of months of playtesting and development. Presented herein is the Tinker base class, an individual who can be described as a &amp;quot;non-spellcaster spellcaster&amp;quot;. The domain of the tinker is the mundane. While others dominate the battlefield with arms and arcane might, the tinker does so through mechanical means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tinker's greatest asset is the variety of machines he can bring to bear in a fight. Small, mindless automatons make up the bulk of this power, but experienced tinkers are capable of building autonomous Alphas that act as the tinker's #2. Sentient, the alpha can eventually learn to order around the automatons so the tinker doesn't have to. Further, truly skilled tinkers are followed around by a swarm of nanobots. This swarm is capable of rending most any material into its constituent pieces and then rebuilding it into something useful. Many of the dragonscale breastplates that exist in the world today were crafted from a dragon in six seconds flat by a tinker swarm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To allow for maximum modularity, the tinker has a brand new magic-like system: inventions! Tinkers can learn inventions, place them into blueprints, and then deploy automatons based on those blueprints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Tinker base class&lt;br/&gt;     Progression tables for the tinker, his automatons, and his alpha&lt;br/&gt;     4 feats&lt;br/&gt;     21 innovations (talents)&lt;br/&gt;     12 greater innovations (greater talents)&lt;br/&gt;     121 inventions with full summary invention list&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of pregenerated automaton configurations to get the creative juices flowing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
