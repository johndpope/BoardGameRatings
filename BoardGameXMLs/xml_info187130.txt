							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Powergame (6th Edition)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powergame has been in constant development since 1994 and the core rules have passed through six major editions.  The game enjoys a wide base of support and is available in numerous formats and several languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, all characters start as a &amp;quot;normal human being&amp;quot;, and is generated as such.  In a second step of generation, the character's super powers may be added.  Characters in the game have eight Attributes:  Strength, Toughness, Agility, Speed, Charisma, Intelligence, Will, and Alertness.  Each Attribute has an associated Power Level and all humans have a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; in each Power Level.  All characters then have Skills, which are areas the character is proficient in (sample Skills are provided).  Characters may also have a &amp;quot;Good Thing&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Bad Thing&amp;quot; (e.g., Advantages or Disadvantages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters may then have Super-Attributes (Power Levels much higher than &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;), Superskills, or Supernatural Powers, depending upon their creation and &amp;quot;Hero Origin&amp;quot;.  A super-hero's &amp;quot;Bad Thing&amp;quot; may be a Vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are resolved with a d6 dice pool, the player rolling one dice for each of the character's Power Levels in the relevant Attribute or Skill.  These are summed and compared against a target difficulty to determine success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters sheets are available as separate PDF downloads in English, Hebrew, French, and Portuguese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
