			<description>This is a twist on the basic Tiddlywinks game. The winks come in four sets, red, green, yellow and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target is 7 shallow cups arranged into a hexagon. One in the center, and six on the outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play is in rounds. Each player plays his winks, then scoring is done for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twist is that the scoring points for each cup are on the bottom of the cup. The cups are supposed to be mixed up so that the players won't be able to identify an individual cup. First player to 100 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
