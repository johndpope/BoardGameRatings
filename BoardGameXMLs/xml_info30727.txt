			<description>How well do you know your US History?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, one player reads from a list of numbered clues on the back of a card while others try to guess the correct answer. You score five points for guessing after one clue and it declines to one point if all five clues are read. The last clue is a picture of the place, event or person in question. Players continue taking turns until all cards have been read. Score is kept on included scorekeeper. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
