							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gun Opera</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companion to the Big Bang series, Gun Opera is a high speed alternative damage system that can be dropped into any existing game with minimal work or difficulty. Based in real world physics, ballistics, and medicine, it provides a lightning fast and extremely simple alteration that drastically speeds up the combat system of your favorite game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, it functions as a powerful tool for game designers by looking at not only the way guns do damage, but also the way melee weapons do damage as well, presenting them with stable numbers with which to compare the ways they cause injury. The complex and detailed presentation on how melee weapons work cobbles together data from dozens of studies into a single cohesive work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
