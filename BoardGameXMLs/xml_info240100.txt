			<description>In Match Me!: What color is this?, all players co-operate, trying to put down cards of the same color in the same order. When the lead player says a word from a subject card, what color do you think matches that? Everyone has their own ideas, so things might get confused &amp;mdash; and the color cards are placed face-down, so who knows what to think? When all the players have placed five of their cards face-down, the cards are turned up and checked. If the cards all have the same color in the same order, all players win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played at different skill levels, and as you play, the game gets harder. But for variation, you could choose to play an easy game, or a very hard game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
