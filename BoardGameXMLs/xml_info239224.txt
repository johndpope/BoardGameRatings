			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game that I built for my gaming crew and myself to play. It is very much a work in progress and has plenty of kinks that still need to be worked out. More than anything I want a system that is simple and easy to grasp. I know my system looks swarthy at first, but I assure you there is actually very little to get. If you've played any Star Wars d20, Saga, or FFG this will be a very smooth transition from tip to full pen. In my own gaming group I have a first time gamer who picked it up first day: You say what you want to do, you roll dice, high numbers are good. If you are smart enough to still be following up until now you pretty much have it covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules document is presented with an enthusiastic, irreverent attitude and much profanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
