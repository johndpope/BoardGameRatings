			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Guardian Heroes is an arcade fantasy beat'em-up with some RPG elements, made by Treasure for the Sega Saturn. The player(s) take the role(s) of a group of heroes who have found a strange sword, and are suddenly attacked by the King's soldiers. As the game progresses, they are drawn into the secrets of the kingdom and take part in a battle between the forces of Earth and those of Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays like an advanced beat'em-up with special attacks similar to those of fighting games like Street Fighter II. The players must defeat all the attacking forces, all the while advancing. After most stages, there is a story sequence in which the player(s) can choose how to comment upon the situation, this choice effectively being a choice for the next stage, and the game features several endings depending on what route the player(s) take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays like a 2D beat'em-up, with the players able to move &amp;quot;into the screen&amp;quot; on three &amp;quot;layers of depth&amp;quot;, effectively creating three parallel 2D layers that the players and foes could jump inbetween. Characters on different layers can't hit each other, but some area spells span over the layers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the arcade game, the game features a &amp;quot;VS mode&amp;quot; in which six players (with a multitap) can battle on an arena. In this mode, players can use any character they have encountered in the arcade game, even the final bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back:&lt;br/&gt;The revived sword of legend will once more bring light to a world tainted with darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose between the story mode made up by a multi scenario, or the versus mode where six players can play all characters in the game. Rich options and full of variation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
