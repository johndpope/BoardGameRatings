			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This exciting, positive game offers lots of fun as it takes you through the ups and downs of marriage and money-making.  There's the opportunity to win it all or lose it all on the draw of a single card...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game that is as modern as today, yet as old as marriage itself...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
