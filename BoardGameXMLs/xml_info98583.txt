							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Walibi The Battle Game</name>
									
			<description>A CCG of Walibi released for the super market company Carrefour in Belgium. Each package includes 3 cards with the entire collection existing out of 101 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for the game are simple: Every player takes at least 3 cards face down. Now the first player takes the first card from his deck and chooses one of the four characteristics (courage, creativity, coolness, musicality) which all have a specific score. After choosing the category all players turn the card and place it on the gameboard so that everybody can see it. Now the players compare the score of the chosen characteristic. The player with the highest score on that characteristic wins the round. If there's a tie, then the cards remain on the board till the next round. The winner of the next round also gets those cards. The game goes on until one person has won all the cards in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For collecting purposes people have made their own interpretation of the game or let the winner choose a card from one of the losers decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
