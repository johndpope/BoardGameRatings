			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pony Tales is a role-playing game for ages twelve and older, written in a straightforward conversational style and streamlined for ease of play. The game is available as a free PDF file for download in two sizes, US letter and A4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chief feature of the game is its differentiation between &amp;quot;literal&amp;quot; games, which take the show's anachronisms and inconsistencies at face value, and &amp;quot;figurative&amp;quot; games, which assume those elements are exaggerations or simplifications for effect. Where possible the rules make allowances for both kinds of games, offering suggestions and alternatives to suit the different styles of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is split into parts. Part one covers the basic rules of the game. Part two adds information and extra rules that are helpful but not absolutely or constantly necessary. Part three discusses the setting of the television program, both as the show&amp;rsquo;s creator originally imagined it and as it&amp;rsquo;s ended up in actual episodes. Part four offers suggestions and ideas for playing a fun and exciting game. At the end of the book is a quick reference of tables to look up things during a game session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
