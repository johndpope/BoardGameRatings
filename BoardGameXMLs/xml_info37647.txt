			<description>Clipper Race is a sailing game published around 1935.  Players (2,3,4) use a spinner to determine movement along predefined naval routes. The objective is to sail from: Boston, New York, Philadelphia or New Orleans to Shanghai and then return to one of the USA ports.  The player must land exactly on Shanghai and the USA port.  Along the way there are spaces that direct the player to go back spaces or sail to a different port before resuming course.  Landing on an opponent sends him back 10 spaces.  The shorter routes have more penalty spaces. The game comes with 6 beautifully crafted clippers (2 extra) in low relief that are painted in semi reflective paints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
