			<description>&amp;quot;International Cricket is a cricket game for the Nintendo Entertainment System that was only released in Australia in 1992. Developed by Melbourne House (as Beam Software) and published by Mattel, it was the only cricket game released for the NES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naming parodies&lt;br/&gt;The game featured all the major Test cricket playing nations but no official team and player licensing in place. This meant that player names within the game, particularly for the Australian team, were humurous parodies on the actual names of cricket players at the time. Following is a list player names from the game and their respective actual names from Test-playing teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. Boulder - Allan Border &lt;br/&gt;M. Sailor - Mark Taylor &lt;br/&gt;D. Boost - David Boon &lt;br/&gt;G. Swamp - Geoff Marsh &lt;br/&gt;J. Dean - Dean Jones &lt;br/&gt;S. Mars - Steve Waugh &lt;br/&gt;I. Hilly - Ian Healy &lt;br/&gt;R. Bruce - Bruce Reid &lt;br/&gt;M. Ewes - Merv Hughes &lt;br/&gt;C. McDirt - Craig McDermott &lt;br/&gt;H. Mervyn - Merv Hughes &lt;br/&gt;P. Tail - Peter Taylor &lt;br/&gt;It is unknown why Merv Hughes' name was parodied twice, however this could probably be attributed to his cult status of the time. Merv Hughes comes from Victoria, the same state as the company that developed this game. This article makes no assertion as to the causal relationship between these two pieces of information, but still, one has to wonder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations of player names for other countries do not appear to be as obvious, however there is a player in the West Indies team called &amp;quot;R. Marley&amp;quot;, an obvious reference to Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley. Some critics found this disappointing as the West Inidies were still a dominant force in world cricket at the time the game was release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequels&lt;br/&gt;International Cricket was followed by an updated sequel for the Super NES, Super International Cricket, in 1994. Melbourne House would also develop Cricket 96 and Cricket 97 for EA Sports. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;International_Cricket,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
