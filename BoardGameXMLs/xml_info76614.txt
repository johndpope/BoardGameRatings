			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Step Beyond is a platform puzzle game developed by Red Rat Software in 1993 as a sequel to Pushover. As with the previous title, the game was sponsored by Smiths' British snack Quavers. The game stars 'Colin Curly', who while playing Pushover is accidentally sucked into a computer and becomes a hero of his own game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing field consist of a number of platform, all of which must be visited before leaving a level. Since most of the platforms hide after the first visit, and some of them have other special functions the aim of the game is to work out the correct route through the levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
