			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic Like You&amp;rsquo;ve Never Experienced It Before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel like you&amp;rsquo;ve unlocked all the secrets of magic when you can simply flip through the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook and see every spell it has. The very nature of the game means that spells, and spellcasting, work a certain way. While there are plenty of spells to choose from, eventually you reach a point where just casting the same old things over and over again gets boring. And that&amp;rsquo;s where the books in the Advanced Arcana series come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Arcana Volume IV is more than just a collection of over 100 brand new, never-before-seen spells. It, like its critically-acclaimed predecessors, was specifically designed to challenge the status quo of the way that magic works in your game. Previous installments of Advanced Arcana have questioned the concept of spell slots, and created spells that modify other spells, or which can be cast at different spell levels for different effects. This installment turns its eyes to the boundaries between the schools of magic themselves, creating versatile alternate-school spells, which have different effects depending on which school they are cast as, and powerful dual-school spells, whose effects are so potent that they cannot be contained by a single school of magic. This book also contains the return of the popular fountain spells, which allow you to restore a used spell slot to your mind after casting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even above and beyond Advanced Arcana Volume IVs numerous groundbreaking new spells that will have you rethinking what you thought you knew about magic, the book contains a number of expansive appendices on such topics as&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;hellip;creating a place of power from which a spellcaster can draw additional magical might.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;hellip;training to master specific spells in order to be able to get more from casting them.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;hellip;a brand new base class, the elite arcanist, that gains access to spells from all spell lists.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;hellip;and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve already experienced one of the previous installments of Advanced Arcana, you know that this book is not to be missed. Pick up your copy of Advanced Arcana Volume IV, and change the way that you think about magic today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
