							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Angler</name>
									
			<description>Angler is a British computer game that was developed by Dirk Olivier for the ZX Spectrum home computer.  The player controls a boat along the top of the screen and has 100 casts to catch as many fish as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from the game's instructions:&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;quot; You are a fisherman out on the sea in your trusty trawler. Beneath you the sea is teeming with different layers of fish. By using your skill and judgement can you position your boat and drop your line to make the catch of a life-time?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cassette inlay contained a membership form to join the Virgin games club and a profile of the games writer, Dirk Olivier, born in 1945 in Porthcawl.  You could print off the Hall of Fame and a certificate of merit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Angler (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
