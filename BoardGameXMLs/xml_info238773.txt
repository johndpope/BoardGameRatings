			<description>Marbowling is a completely new twist on an old sport. In this game, a Shooter must navigate a Pro Ball marble down the 32&amp;quot; Lane, between the gutters and through the stationary pins to the scoring area.&lt;br/&gt;    Step 1: Roll the 6 dice to determine the placement of pins (ex. 1-1-2-4-4-5 = a 1 pin, 2 pin, 4 pin, and 5 pin)&lt;br/&gt;    Step 2: Place the pins in the pin holes according to the outcome of the dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;    Step 3: Shoot - aim the Shooter Ramp and send your Pro Ball down the Lane (Trick Shots and Hook Shots are encouraged)&lt;br/&gt;    Step 4: Score - The scoring area consist of 10, 20, 30, and 50 point pockets. A Shooter is allowed two attempts per frame or turn (1st ball = full points / 2nd ball = 1/2 points.) The highest score after 10 frames is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
