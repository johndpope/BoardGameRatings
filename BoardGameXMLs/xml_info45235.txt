							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great City, Army Ward</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the Army Ward belongs to the Great City army. A great military structure rises on the northernmost part of the city, featuring barracks, training camps, commander&amp;rsquo;s headquarters and more; it&amp;rsquo;s where the major detachment of the armed forces stay all the time (except in times of war). The rest of the ward is military-oriented too; the Circus Maximus, the city arena, draws many fighters and champions in the area, so the inns and taverns are always filled with grim-looking fighters and wealthy patrons looking for a good place to bet their money.&lt;br/&gt;The number of the building refers to the map available in the Great City blueprint. A description of the buildings follows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 - Circus Maximus: The great city arena features two levels. The ground level is open to the public and it&amp;rsquo;s utterly crowded during the games. Here, in this maze of pillars and walls, peddlers, bookmakers, gladiators, vendors, and shady individuals run their business. On the upper floor the Circus is divided in two rings of seats, the common seats and the honor seats. Occasionally, a great wooden structure is built to host very important people. On the arena ground (which is floodable to allow naval battles simulations) there are four lifts leading in the coenoby (not mapped) where the gladiators stay during the games.&lt;br/&gt;     2 - City Gate: This is the typical city gate. The gate features great wooden doors bounded in steel and a portcullis. Guard posts are placed near the gate at first floor and ground floor and some arrow slits are set in strategic places.&lt;br/&gt;     4 - Barracks: the barracks are featureless buildings standing in rows within the military camp. Even if the barracks seem all the same, each one has a different destination: Refectory, bedrooms and armory.&lt;br/&gt;     7 - Headquarters: This is by far the most luxurious building in the Army Camp. It houses generals, commanders and high officers. It is a two-story building with a beautiful open court inside. A great balcony on the first floor allows the officers to overlook the grand hall below. The ground floor contains meeting rooms, cartography rooms and offices. The upper floor houses bedrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
