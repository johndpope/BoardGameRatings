			<description>Too many sheriffs have arrived in Rhymetown and there's only one way to find out who rhymes the best in the wild wild west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn over a card and take it in turns saying words that rhyme with the one on the card. Can't think of a word? Play a sheriff card to put somebody else in the hot seat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don't have a sheriff card left to play and can't think of a word, you're out. The last player standing becomes the sheriff of Rhymetown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
