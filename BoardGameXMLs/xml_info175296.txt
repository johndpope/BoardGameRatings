			<description>A simple kids' CCG based off War. Starter sets are expandable with booster packs with over 200+ cards in the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws 3 cards and each turn plays cards simultaneously. Powers are resolved and each player rolls a die to add to the cards power. Highest number wins. Players place their winning cards into the Winner pile, and the defeated cards in their dungeon. First player to get all the other player's cards in the dungeon wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
