							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World Record Paper Airplane Game</name>
									
			<description>As it's name implies, this is a Paper Airplane game! The contents include: 28 FULL color Printed Sheets (front &amp;amp; back) of the following 4 designs-Clouds, Vampire, Airplane, Pizza Slice; a DIE; 4 Plane templates; 4 Plastic Planes markers; Rules/Folding Instructions; and a colorful mounted 8 inches by 22 inches mapboard. &lt;br/&gt; Players roll a DIE and move their marker along their track and along the way, they have to make paper planes and compete in various tasks, such as LOOPS, Time Aloft, Target, and Distance. There are 4 separate tracks with the name of one of the paper plane designs and a player has to use the type of plane whose track they are on. Some planes are better at a certain Task but depending on the one landed on, each plane has to attempt to perform it.  Object of the game is to reach Finish first(and retain your sanity is a BONUS!) It can be played inside or outdoors, but NOT recommended during High Winds events or adverse Weather conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
