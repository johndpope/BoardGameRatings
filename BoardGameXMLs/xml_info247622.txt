							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skyline 54</name>
									
			<description>Cities in America at the turn of the century are racing to be the biggest and the best cities across the country!  Their skylines are growing with buildings so tall they appear to touch the sky - skyscrapers!  Players act as building companies in these different cities, trying to build up their own city's skyline to be the best and most diverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is building a skyline of skyscrapers using cards from a standard 54-card deck.  On their turn, players have three options: Draft cards into their hands; Play cards to their tableau (their &amp;quot;skyline&amp;quot;), or Pass (for the rest of the game).  Cards played must follow certain rules, and only optimal placement will net players the most points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends once all players have passed (usually after the draw deck has run out and player have no more cards in-hand to play).  Players then earn points for tallest towers, widest skyline, most towers, and any mid-game bonuses they achieved, but lose points for any cards left in hand, or face-down &amp;quot;City Street&amp;quot; cards they played.  After totalling up all scores, most points is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
