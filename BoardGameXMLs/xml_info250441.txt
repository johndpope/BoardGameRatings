			<description>In this game, players will have to go through the Modular Tray with their Marker, in search of the 5 elements (Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood) to achieve Balance and exchange these elements with the Yin-yang Symbol, but for this, be with your Marker on one of the Yin-yang spaces of the Board. Whenever you leave a place in the Board, you must take the Card corresponding to it. With this, there will be holes opened by the drawn chips, which will prevent the movement of the Markers. However, when you exchange the 5 elements and get the Yin-yang symbol, you can return with the 5 elements on the board and in any position, giving you another option. It will win the match who first get 3 Yin-yang symbols. You can also make exchanges, since the balance requires detachment, thus getting some element you need to complete the 5 required. You can change your placeholder, always respecting the Cycle of generation and dominance used in The Theory of 5 elements. Generation allows your player to change positions on the board. Dominance allows the player to move his Marker and pick up elements in the game. Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood must be balanced. That was the only way Yin-yang had been able to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
