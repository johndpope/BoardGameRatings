							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What Remains of Edith Finch</name>
									
			<description>What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of short stories about a cursed family in Washington State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each story offers a chance to experience the life of a different family member with stories ranging from the early 1900s to the present day. The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the family members themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death. It's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
