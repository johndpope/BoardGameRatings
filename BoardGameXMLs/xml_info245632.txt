			<description>in the jungles of Madagascar, the animals are competing to see who's the best. The small Madagascar frog it falls obviously difficult to prevail against flying fox, Chameleon and fossa - these are just bigger and have on the cards according to higher values. Alternately, players send the jungle-dwellers in the middle, always anxious to have more points than the other and thus to decide the round itself. Those who use their cards at the smartest, will make his troupe of animal rule, most bites and win the game at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
