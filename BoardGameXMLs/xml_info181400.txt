							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Age of Steam: Long Island</name>
									
			<description>With a census-estimated population of 7.8M in 2014, Long Island is the most populated island in any U.S. state or territory. It is also the longest and largest island in the contiguous United States extending 118 miles from New York Harbor to Montauk Point. However, it's maximum north-south distance is only 23 miles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) is the busiest commuter railroad system in North America, carrying an average of 338K passengers each weekday. Chartered in 1834, it is also the oldest railroad still operating under its original name. It is also the only railroad that operates 24/7 with significant off peak, weekend and holiday service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Age of Steam: Long Island, players will be climbing all over each other as they struggle to be the first to get passengers to their destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant differences:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Designed for 2-3 players, w/ few cubes and a lot of opportunities for blocking.&lt;br/&gt;    Each round, each player can deliver at most one passenger East and one passenger West.&lt;br/&gt;    Once-around auction for player order.  &lt;br/&gt;    Locomotive/Urbanization alternate being available with only 1 (two-player) or 2 (three-player) other actions being available at all.&lt;br/&gt;    The Early Riser action (three-player only) bundles First Build, First Move, and Locomotive into one but restricts the player to one delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
