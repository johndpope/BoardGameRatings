							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ninja-To Go: A Ninja Burger Bored Game</name>
									
			<description>Ninja-To Go is a simple little board game designed to be played between other, more fun games while you're waiting for other people to show up or get out of the bathroom or whatnot. From 2 to 8 players pick a ninja, then race to make deliveries and kill one another. The winner is the last surviving ninja, or the first to accrue enough points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes four printable sheets with cut-out game tiles, ninja figures, and dice cards - in Japanese Kanji of course. Two of the tile cards contain all the rules for setup and gameplay. Each game is designed to be played in 5-10 minutes. The only things not included are six random coins (or tokens of some sort), three six-sided dice, and your imagination. OK, that's a lie. Your imagination is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
