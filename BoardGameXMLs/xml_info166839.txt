			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factory tour is an RPG about people who are invited to visit a factory or other dangerous environment. They travel through the environment seeing the sites and trying to resist the temptation to get a closer look at things. The game is best with a gamemaster (GM) and 3 - 5 players. The gamemaster defines the tour and the attractions and plays the role of anyone the characters might encounter (tour guides, factory workers, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended to be a fun one-shot, not a campaign and players and the GM are encouraged to play for dark and sadistic laughs. By the end of a session, most of the characters should have died a grisly yet entertaining death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
