			<description>Extrapolated from &amp;quot;Play the Game&amp;quot; by Brian Love;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays a dispatch runner trying to break through a cordon of Boy Scout opponents. He begins at the top of the board and tries to get to the bottom.  If he succeeds in avoiding being hemmed in by the enemy patrol the game is re-started by the dispatch runner setting off for home from the bottom of the board with the Scout Patrol once more trying to stop him. The game ends when either the Dispatch Runner has completed his double journey or when the scouts have captured him by hemming him in so he cannot move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
