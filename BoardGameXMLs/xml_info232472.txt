			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fists of Fire and Ice, spells of Power and Grace- the Gestrati!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;And so then did the lineages of those monkish sorcerers calling themselves the &amp;lsquo;gestrati&amp;rsquo; go up into the Heights of Aish to lament the conflicts of God and Elemental.  Thus did a God and a Lord come down to parlay with the host- and both were dry-beaten for their pains&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Legends of the Calling, Volume VII, author unknown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Aaron Hollingsworth&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Class: Gestrati from Purple Duck Games.  This new 20-level class contains everything you need to play a fascinating new mixture of Unchained Monk and Sorcerer, who can fight opponents with fists of elemental energy, cast spells at higher levels, and gain abilities based on their lineages of dire history and inheritance.  They are practitioners of arcane posturings of the body to achieve both physical and metaphysical effects, such as protective mudras, silent magic and ranged blasts.  Fiery-fisted aberrants, icy celestials, or yogic pacifist, beware whether they support good or evil!  Also included are several feats and two gestrati archetypes for even more variety of play!  The gestrati will be a welcome addition to any intrepid adventuring party daring to explore your campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
