			<description>There is no date on this but judging from the name and graphics, you can assume late 1960's to early 1970's. In this two player game, each player has either a red or blue card 3 1/2 in by 4 1/2 in. Each player in turn chooses one of 9 op-art puzzle pieces and places it on his/her card. The object is to find 3 pieces and only 3 pieces that will cover his card. If a player has 3 pieces on his card that don't completely cover it, he must return a piece to the &amp;quot;Pot&amp;quot; before taking another. Interestingly, it is not important to establish any relationship between the wild patterns on the pieces. Comes in a plastic case with an attached hang card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
