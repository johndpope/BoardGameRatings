			<description>Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo​ (ファミコン探偵倶楽部PartII うしろに立つ少女,? &amp;quot;Famicom Detective Club Part II: The Girl who Stands Behind&amp;quot;) is a text-based adventure game released by Nintendo in 1989 for the Family Computer Disk System. The original version was released in two discs in 1989, and the game was ported to the Super Famicom and the Game Boy Advance several years later. The Super Famicom version was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on April 30, 2008 and the Famicom version for the Virtual Console on December 22, 2009. Neither version of the game was ever released outside of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo is the successor of and a prequel to Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kōkeisha, and is the second game of the Famicom Tantei Club series. Its scenario was written by Nagihiro Asama, based on the concept by Yoshio Sakamoto.[1] Kenji Yamamoto composed the game music. The popularity of Part I: Kieta Kōkeisha prompted the release of this sequel, which employed the similar graphic-adventure gameplay. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Power cartridge rewriting service in 1998 with improved graphics and sound, and the Disk System version was released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of the Famicom Mini series. The murder and smoking scenes resulted in a CERO (ages 15+) rating for the GBA release, making it the first Nintendo title to receive a parental advisory rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Disk System version was released in two separate Disk Cards, released separately from each other. Its music was composed by Kenji Yamamoto, who composed sound and music for Super Metroid[54] and for Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.[55] It utilizes the FDS's extra sound channel for the music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Famicom Detective Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shōjo&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
