			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure! Everybody likes getting it, but randomly rolling dice on tables to tell a player that their character found a 25 gp garnet lacks panache and deflates the excitement faster than you can say percentile. But what if you could hand them the gem they just found? Well, unless you are willing to fork over several hundred dollars for a pack of real gems, the next best thing is Gem Cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two gem card sets contained over 190 semi-precious and precious gemstones, complete with descriptions, base prices, and best of all &amp;ndash; a picture of the gem! Now, we present Gem Cards Set Three; 96 new and unique semi-precious gemstones to hand out to your players. Within this set you will find unique examples of alabaster, malachite, quartz, and more. In addition, for the third set we&amp;rsquo;ve included 16 new cards with natural gold, silver and other native elements, and some less common mineral samples we&amp;rsquo;ve featured in other products. You&amp;rsquo;ll love the convenience and your players will love getting a gem they can see (and feel, in a way). They can now hoard them, trade them, or pass them around without having to constantly refer to scribbles on a character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
