							<name  sortindex="1">大建築時代　拡張＃１ ~設計と来訪~</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for Age of Craft introduces two new sets of cards, Blueprints and Visitors, along with new rules for their use. It also includes two new random cards that can be used with the base game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blueprints begin in a face down stack. Each player is dealt two random Blueprints at the beginning of the game and can choose to purchase more during the building phase. Blueprints can either be events, which are discarded after use, or they can be buildings that are constructed in the same manner as the buildings on offer in the common supply. There is no limit to the number of Bluprints that a player may purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visitor cards are goals that offer points to the player who meets their requirements. Two Visitor cards are drawn randomly at the beginning of the game. Once a player has obtained a Visitor card, an opponent may take it by surpassing the requirements met by the owner of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
