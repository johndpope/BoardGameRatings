							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SciFi Outpost</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 48 inch by 30 inch, floor plan of a SciFi Outpost, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If we let you in here, the raiders will be angered and sure to attack. Why should we trust you? How do we know you aren't working with the raiders?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sci-fi outpost is a single large map of a colony or settlement in a desert environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sci-fi outpost can be used in near or far future science fiction settings as a colony. It also makes an excellent wasteland settlement for an apocalyptic game. This settlement could also be used in modern games, for example as an archaeologist settlement being used as a living area for a long-term archaeological dig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raiders have hounded the Player Characters throughout the desert. They find a sci-fi outpost in the wasteland and seek sanctuary there. The sci-fi outpost could be friendly to the raiders. If so, the Player Characters will need to take them out, possibly taking over the settlement and preparing it for a final stand versus the raiders that have been chasing them. The settlers could be afraid of the raiders and refuse the Player Characters entry instead. In this case, the Player Characters need to assuage their fears and get them to let them into the outpost so they can defend it against the raiders. The settlers could also be immediately friendly to the Player Characters and let them in. The Player Characters and the settlers make plans on how to defend the settlement from the raiders for a coordinated strategy in the final showdown versus the raiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
