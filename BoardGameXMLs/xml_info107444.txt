							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die große Ratz Fatz-Spielewelt</name>
									
			<description>Similar to Ratz-Fatz, this is a collection of game ideas and materials. The box contains 50 wooden figures (mostly animals, but also a train, truck, pirate etc.), 4 little metal suitcases, a die, a game book and a CD with stories and a song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic idea: The wooden figures are placed on the table. While a story, poem or riddle is being read (or played from the CD), the players have to listen closely. When an object from the table is mentioned or the solution to a riddle, the players have to grab it. The player who has collected the most figures at the end of the text wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants include just putting the figures into the box after they were mentioned (non-competitive play) and a memory variant in which objects that were put away before the game have to be called out when mentioned in the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
