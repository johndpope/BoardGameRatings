							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Potato Man</name>
									
			<description>Potato Man is a trick-taking game with the largely unused theme of potatoes in which you can sometimes achieve the highest scores with the smallest potatoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After dealing the cards out, players each play one card to the center of the table to form the &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; but each of the four colors can be played only once. (The exception: In a five-player game, one color can be played twice.) Whoever plays the highest card wins the trick &amp;ndash; except that the three least valuable cards in the game (1, 2, 3 of yellow) win the trick if one of the three most valuable cards in the game (16, 17, 18 of red) is present. Whoever wins a trick leads to the next trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each color has its own small deck of scoring cards, and when a player wins a trick, he takes a scoring card of the corresponding color. The red color, for example, has highest playing cards on average (cards 5-18, compared to yellow 1-13), but least valued scoring cards for a trick. However, once three tricks are taken with the same color, the scoring cards of that color are depleted and players take golden &amp;quot;joker&amp;quot; scoring cards, worth the most points. Therefore you might want to keep high cards of a frequently winning color in your hand in order to maximize your points &amp;ndash; but the round ends as soon as a player cannot play a card due to the restrictions on which cards can be played in a given trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players tally their points, then begin a new round, with the game lasting as many rounds as the number of players. In the end, whoever tallies the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
