			<description>Volumes of Blood: Body Count is a card game for 2-8 players set in the Volumes of Blood horror anthology movie franchise.  In VoB:Body Count players take on the role of directors and try to make their own vignette scenes using Scene cards featuring characters, weapons, and locations from the movies!  Each Scene card type has a Fear value that is used to determine how many Victims a director may claim in a scene and how many bonus cards a director may draw when a scene is successfully wrapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To create a scene, a director must collect a Killer Scene card, a Weapon Scene card, and a Location Scene card.  Once each of these cards are in play in front of the director, a Victim card may be played into the scene as well.  Gore and Effect cards can increase or decrease the Fear value of a scene.  Scene, Gore and Effect cards may be played in any scene on the table by any director during that director's turn.  Mess up the other directors scenes with Wild cards.  Wrap a scene quickly and don't get stuck with low Fear value cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first director to claim three Victims in their Body Count is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
