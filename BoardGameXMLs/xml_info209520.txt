							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yeti Mountain: The Three-Dimensional, Adventure Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Yeti Mountain is a board game for 2-4 players, inspired by the classic game, Fireball Island from the 1980's. Yeti Mountain is played on a unique 3D game board where players race against each other to be the first to capture the Idol and escape the mountain. At any time, players can use cards to hinder opponents and help themselves. But watch out! An evil Yeti controls the mountain and tries to stop the players from stealing his Idol. He rolls snowballs at players sending them back into snow pits, slowing them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of rolling the die and moving that number of spaces. If a player rolls a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; on the die, they get to roll one of the many snowballs(marbles) and try to knock over the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to steal the Idol from the Yeti and escape the mountain wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
