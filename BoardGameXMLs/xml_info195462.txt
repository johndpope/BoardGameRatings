			<description>Play as greedy sorcerers attempting to gain the most treasure. Summon monster from the nether and cast forbidden spell to fight for your rightful treasure. Gather and play your cards to gain supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by drawing from two decks, The Nether deck and the town deck. The Nether contains spells which can be played during a player's turn against other players and Monsters that claim treasure for their master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the town deck has been drained the game ends and the player with the most treasure wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
