			<description>A dice and cards tennis 'simulation'. Although it seems to only have been published in 2009, the copyright on the rules is 1985, and the approach of the tennis game (a good serve is always followed by the server going to the net for a volley, for example) dates from that era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'basic' game is a D6 dice game, with no skill involved. The throw for the serve decides whether it is an ace, a fault, or in play resulting in either a groundstroke rally or the server at the net. Subsequent shots in the rally can be winners or faults, change the positions of the players (at the net or baseline) or keep them as is. There are slightly differing shot results for each die roll, depending on the positioning of the players, and what sort of shot is played (passing shot or lob when the opponent is at the net, smash or volley when you are at the net).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'advanced' game follows the same format as the dice game, but allows players to have cards that can be used instead of a throw of the dice. The number of these cards is limited, so there is some player judgement as to when best to play them, or roll the die. 3 Cards are given when serving (presumably so the server usually has more cards than the receiver, and thus an advantage) and 1 card for the winner of each game. The cards either are the equivalent of throwing a &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; (e.g. Service ace, passing shot winner, or the &amp;quot;hit glorious and impossible winning shot&amp;quot; (which can be beaten by another one!) ) or introduce another event such as a let or foot fault on the opponent's serve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;2 D6&lt;br/&gt;2 die shakers&lt;br/&gt;pack of 52 cards &lt;br/&gt;drawstring bag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
