			<description>Based on the BBC Television Series of the same name, Can't Cook, Won't Cook is a lighthearted family game for 2 to 6 players Ages 10 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;They say &amp;quot;If you can't stand the heat then get out of the kitchen!&amp;quot; the same is true of this exciting, fast paced family action packed board game.&lt;br/&gt;It's a race to get your ingredients for a perfect meal traveling up and down the board a few times to collect them. sounds simple...well it would hardly be based on the hit TV show, if it were that easy!!&lt;br/&gt;Firstly, it's against the clock, then it's against another player, then you have to answer some &amp;quot;Can't Cook&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Won't Cook&amp;quot; questions, oh and did we mention you could be rolling the pastry, tossing the pancake, chopping the herbs, stirring the pans....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to move around the board in order to collect points. Points are collected as you collect ingredient tokens. The game ends when the first player has collected all 5 ingredients. Movement is determined by dice roll with each player taking turns to have one minute (a sand timer is provided) to move and accomplish as much as they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spaces on the board dictate the activities to be undertaken on them. These include:&lt;br/&gt;- collecting an ingredient, &lt;br/&gt;- pausing for a cup of tea (rolling until you get a 2),&lt;br/&gt;- answering questions (cookery related - involving choosing your answer from a choice of four) or &lt;br/&gt;- performing an action - stir the pan, roll the pastry, chop the herbs or toss the pancake (the equipment for which is all included with the game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
