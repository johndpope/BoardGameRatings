			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Festival of Magic is a short introductory adventure for a group of of 1st-characters, compatible with the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition game system. It is designed to be used at any time, and can be inserted in to any campaign set in a large city (simply change the city's name - Galena - for your city of choice) if you want something to entertain the party or serve as a means of gaining more information by helping the local government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For almost a century, the city of Galena has hosted a grand convention of magic every ten years, inviting everyone from apprentices to the most powerful of wizards of the region to attend and share their knowledge and experiences amongst other practitioners of the arcane arts. It also hosts organized conferences (including a much-anticipated keynote by a local legend) and training sessions to teach inexperienced wizards how to control more powerful magics, as well as exhibitions for those who fear magic to educate them that magic can be used for good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years ago, there was an unfortunate series of incidents at the festival, a chain of events that caused so much chaos during the convention that the organizers were unwilling to host it ever again. But after the insistence of some members of the city council, the organizers agreed to host the convention within the city limits again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If only there were a group of people that would be willing to volunteer and maintain order during the festival...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
