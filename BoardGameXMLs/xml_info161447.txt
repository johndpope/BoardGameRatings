							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Wars</name>
									
			<description>Happy Wars is a multiplayer online game, defined as a role-playing strategy game, although it also has a short story-driven single player campaign mode. The multiplayer mode consists of two teams of up to 15 players attempting to destroy the other team's castle while also defending their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players choose from one of three classes: the warrior, the mage, and the cleric. There are also subclasses, although the only ones implemented at the moment is the Warrior-type Berserker as well as the Mage-type Zephyr and the Cleric-type Engineer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Happy Wars&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
