			<description>From its front cover art for this: &lt;br/&gt;SOCCO: The Soccer Skills Game! Helps kids become better Soccer Players! Fun for the whole family! Endorsed by Professional Soccer Coaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw a card from one of the 3 types and correctly answer for that, or perhaps spin from this with the appropriate spinner, and may even &amp;quot;Lose a Turn&amp;quot;, in order to advance the ball down the field of spots and eventually score! This continues for as long that the game had been agreed upon beforehand in total goals, until one side has scored enough goals to meet the amount for this, and thereby is declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
