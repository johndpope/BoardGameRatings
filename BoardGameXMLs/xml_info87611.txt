			<description>Wargames Rules for Entire Battles. From Earliest History to 1400 AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures game for ancient and medieval warfare. The rules use interesting game mechanics, such as random movement rates, to represent the variable nature of warfare in the era it addresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are rated by a Unit Cohesion Value (UCV) that takes into account the armor, leadership, and training of the unit. For example, Roman legionaries would have a high UCV due to their better equipment, good leadership, and regular training while barbarian tribesmen would have a lower UCV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is divided into shooting, impact, and melee. Unit's abilities are divided into strengths and weaknesses in these areas. For example, a barbarian unit may have a high impact value, meaning that they have a formidable first charge, but their value in an ensuing melee is less imposing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The figure scales used for the game is 1:50 (one model figure representing 50 actual men) and the time scale is one turn equals approximately 60 minutes. The game attempts to allow entire ancient battles to be fought out in miniature on the tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time it was published, Milgamex' &amp;quot;Ancient Warfare&amp;quot; emerged as a potential rival to the popularity of WRG's &amp;quot;Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles.&amp;quot; However, they could not push WRG's rules out of the place they had gained in international competition play. The rules went through two printings, but by 1980, they were difficult to find in stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
