			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bugs is a cooperative card game designed for kids that adults will also enjoy. We have created several ways to play that will help the youngest discover the game while learning (3+). Later, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to enjoy the game even more by including new cards and more challenging rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While they play and cooperate, they will also learn the fundamentals of programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bugs are small robots living on a little planet. They live in harmony with their environment and they have created an energy network around their planet. Sometimes, some of the robots have problems and they don&amp;rsquo;t work as expected. These are Buggy robots. They need you to repair them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play up to 4 players in a cooperative mode. You have to catch the Buggy robot (the red one) as a team. For this, you have to create an energy network around it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
