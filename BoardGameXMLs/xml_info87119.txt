			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Free RPG - Weird 1970's Espionage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind the velour wallpaper, under the bean bag, crouching in the grimy recesses of the shag pile carpet there is strangeness. A deep, messed up kind of strangeness that goes beyond the mind altering effects of macram&amp;eacute;? or the strange popularity of the Bay City Rollers. You may live your grim 9 to 5 life, worry about the energy crisis, worry about the bomb, worry about freaks and punks next door but what you really should be worried about are the things you don't even know exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am talking about aliens without fashion, big crime, 18 degree angels, funk sucking ghosts, discotheque gods, Agents of D.I.R.T., demonic swinger parasites. All these and more. The worst thing is they are organized, they call themselves ASTROLABUS and their plans for the future do not involve you. If they had their way, you won t be here to see the eighties in. That nice new suburb of yours? Just a death camp with lawn ornaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, what do you know, we are organized too. Since the late fifties we have come to know about them (all the different thems). At first we were castigated, called nuts, the men in white coats came like seagulls on a sandwich. But slowly and surely we made connections, found out there were others who had seen what we had seen. Most of us came from the espionage scene, it was our business to go poking around where no one was meant to be. But we made other allies too, occultists, mad, er fringe scientists, ecologists, hustlers and funk cosmonauts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We knew the world was in trouble. We knew no one else was going to do anything. Steve McQueen is dead. We formed ZODIAC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
