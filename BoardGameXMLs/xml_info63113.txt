			<description>This is a kind of magnetic memory game. 24 magnetic pieces are put face-down on the table. The active player picks up a piece, looks at the picture on it, then tries to put it onto another piece. If the two stick together, the player can look at the second piece. If it has the same picture as the first, the player can keep it. If not, both are put back. If the first piece doesn't stick to the second one, it is put back immediately. The goal is to be the player with most pairs at the end.&lt;br/&gt;A second variant is included in the game. In this, the active player takes an own magnetic piece and checks it with another free one on the table. If it doesn't stick, the player loses his/her own piece, if it does, he/she gets to keep both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
