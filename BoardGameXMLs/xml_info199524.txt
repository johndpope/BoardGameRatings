							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Avernum 2: Crystal Souls</name>
									
			<description>Spiderweb Software returns once again to its epic creation, to tell a story of imprisonment, war, and a desperate fight for survival. Avernum 2: Crystal Souls is the second chapter in this classic indie fantasy role-playing saga, the tale of desperate exiles and their fight to keep their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Lots of new dialogue, locations, quests, special encounters, and stuff to explore.&lt;br/&gt;     The interface is completely redone in the style of Avernum 6, but with many interface improvements brought over from Avadon: The Black Fortress.&lt;br/&gt;     The game system has been heavily revised. It's a mix of Avernum 6 and Avadon: The Black Fortress. It is still entirely skill-based and most of the skills are the same. However, the way you train has changed. Instead of saving up skill points, each level you get to increase two skills.&lt;br/&gt;     The Traits system has been massively reworked. Instead of picking two traits at the beginning of the game, you can select one new beneficial trait every two levels.&lt;br/&gt;     A new, large town with a pile of quests.&lt;br/&gt;     New hidden dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;     New hidden characters with lots of backstory and things you can do for them.&lt;br/&gt;     A completely new starter dungeon/tutorial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
