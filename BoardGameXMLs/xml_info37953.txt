			<description>&amp;quot;The player controls a combat team of 5 Finnish Army Recon (Kaukopartio in Finnish) men in a mission far behind Soviet lines. The mission is to destroy a Rail Road Bridge 60 miles behind the enemy lines. It&amp;acute;s January 1943 and it's cold and dark in the Karelian woods.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each party consists of 5 members: Sergeant V.Korpi, Corpral J.Lahtinen, Jaeger M.Koskinen, Jaeger S.Berg, Jaeger S.Stenstrom. The Sergeant has 3 skills,  Corpral has 2 skills and Jaegers have 1 skill. The combat team is armed with 5 Suomi SMG's, 1 Sniper Rifle, Satchel Charges (AT weapon), mines, knives (the puukko's) and hand grenades. The team is carrying a radio. The team is skiing 60 miles to the target and 60 miles back to the Finnish lines.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get your team safely to the bridge so that you can destroy it and then return. &amp;quot;When the combat team reaches home, they take a good 3 hour sauna bath, sleep a little and start another mission.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Played using the WarpQuest game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
