			<description>Blood of Rome is a board game of gothic horror in ancient Rome. Rome will burn, Rome will bleed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Blood of Rome, supernatural factions fight a secret war in the streets and catacombs of Rome. Vampires, Werewolves, Gargoyles, Witches, and Slayers form alliances and vendettas in their conflict over the soul of the empire. Each player secretly belongs to one of the five Factions, with the goals of dominating the most locations on the City Board, and slaying the agents of factions with which they have a Vendetta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing cards from their hands onto the limited slots at the various board locations. Each card belongs to a different faction, and has special abilities which can: add new agents to a location, transform agents from one faction into another, trigger a combat vote, make an accusation against another player, and more. Any player can play a card from any faction on their turn, thereby manipulating their enemies into doing their dirty work for them. A Calendar of Auguries tracks the cycles of the sun and moon, triggering a location's bonus ability when the proper faction card is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
