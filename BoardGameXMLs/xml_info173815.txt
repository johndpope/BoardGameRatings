			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Unexplained Journey is the fifth book (of seven) in The Uncommon Commoners campaign series. In this semi-epic campaign, the uncommon commoners will fulfill their destiny. Or die trying. Or both&amp;mdash;if their destiny is to die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, the pornography loving dragon Smut descended on the Sticky Mountains and laid waste to the humans of the lake and the dwarves under the mountain. Since then, people have trembled in the shadows of the Sticky Mountain. But, there is hope&amp;mdash;a prophecy says that someday the dragon will be slain and that the King Under the Dirt will return to shower the people with gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long after the dragon took up residence in the stickiest of the Sticky Mountains, Nimblee&amp;rsquo;s family was slaughtered after being expelled from their home city. On that day, Nimblee vowed revenge. This pledge of vengeance will place the uncommon commoners on a collision course with Smut. To reach the dirty dragon and exact revenge will require an unexplained journey that will pit the heroes against such foes as Joe Bitey, cave crickets, and talkative trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Uncommon Commoners #5: An Unexplained Journey is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure. It is intended for a party of 5th-8th level uncommon commoner characters. While the adventure is written to be humorous and fairly light, it is also designed to be suitable for serious game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some of the features of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed color maps.&lt;br/&gt;    Fully developed NPCs, complete with detailed descriptions, backstories and motivations. And loot.&lt;br/&gt;    Full statistics are included for all encounters&amp;mdash;no need to look up monsters.&lt;br/&gt;    New Magic Items (Dwarven Cooler, Ring of Visibility, Burglar Book, Burglar Mask, and Sneaky Pants).&lt;br/&gt;    Hero Lab Portfolio (free download).&lt;br/&gt;    66 pages of adventure (includes maps)!&lt;br/&gt;    Joe Bitey!&lt;br/&gt;    Ted talking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
