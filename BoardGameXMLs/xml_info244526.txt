							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill Merlin!</name>
									
			<description>Merlin is the most powerful wizard in the land, the &amp;quot;Master Wizard&amp;quot;. He's also a bit of a jerk. Sometimes he's kind and benevolent, but other times, he'll cast dark magic your way just for fun. You know that the only answer to end his egotistical reign as Master Wizard is&amp;hellip; to kill him. As a wizard yourself, you have discovered a secret formula for killing Merlin. However, you've heard that other wizards have also figured out their own ways to deal with him. Kill Merlin before the other wizards do and become the most powerful wizard in the land, so all may revere your glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Kill Merlin!, a magic-themed strategy board game for 2-4 people, players assume the role of wizards conspiring to overthrow Merlin and become the new Master Wizard. Each player is dealt a secret formula card, detailing which spells his/her wizard needs to learn in order to defeat Merlin. Each turn, players roll to earn mana tokens with which spells can be learned and cast. Players spend mana tokens on ingredients, which they can use to learn spells and navigate the spell board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 24 spells in the game, 6 per elemental (fire, wind, earth, water). The spells get dealt randomly into their elemental quadrants, so every game is guaranteed to be unique. Players can cast spells either to get closer to the ultimate goal of defeating Merlin, or to set back one or more of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, Merlin gets a turn, too! There is a stack of 30 Merlin cards, some of which are good for the players, and some of which are very bad. Merlin cards are capable of turning the tide of the game in an instant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to learn the spells on his/her secret formula card and have 20 mana tokens at the end of a turn casts the powerful &amp;quot;Kill Merlin!&amp;quot; spell and wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
