							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gruff Goats</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;    In Goats Gruff you are a fairy in charge of guiding your goats (big, medium, and little) to the Island of Good Grass. There are four bridges from the Outside Land to the Island. Two trolls move among these four bridges. Play cards to take and use the magic wands: if you have the proper magic wand you can move a certain-sized goat or a troll. Also, if you have just the right combinations of cards you can stir the dragon, who will swoop down to eat one of your rival's goats. Who will be the first to help three goats get to the Island?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a children's game because strategy can be neglected for straightforward play and the way in which players compete for the magic wands is childishly simple (I'm taking it... No you're not... Yes I am... No you're not...). Adults would probably enjoy this game as much as children only when tired or inebriated. For a more mature, intellectual, similar game based on the same game mechanic please see my Walls and Stairways. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://davidvs.net/boardgames/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://davidvs.net/boardgames/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
