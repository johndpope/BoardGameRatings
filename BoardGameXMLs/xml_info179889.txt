			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the Breach is a series of crunch-focused books intended to expand the options available to the base classes (the alchemist, cavalier, gunslinger, inquisitor, magus, oracle, summoner, and witch).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the seventh book in our Into the Breach line we are focusing on the Alchemist. The class that answers the question what if a mad scientist had magic. We've expanded the content in a variety of wonderful ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 9 new archetypes, 2 prestige classes, new discoveries, and (thanks to the botanist) a bunch of new plant companions. Here is a sampling of what you'll find...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Archetypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Academician- knowledge is power, in this case that knowledge is literally explosive. Make your bombs into traps and drink potions that grant new insights and discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Botanist- and you though Poison Ivy was a druid! Plant companion and home grown thorn bombs along with lots of other plant based goodies (this one alone is worth the price of entry.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Humoralist- brave souls that intentionally alter their body chemistry to create and harness a connection to the elemental planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Kiln Crafter- you'll never loot at the potter's wheel the same way again! From shattering disposable ceramic blades into a foe to creating a terracotta golem to protect you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Natural Transmuter- The hook for this is crating traps for an enemies spells to alter and use against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Pyrotechnician- Katy Perry eat your heart out! If you ever wanted to make things go boom in a pretty way this is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Supplimentum- alchemy combines with even more alchemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Venom Bomber- a poison based character for the bold in your face poisoner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Viscous Arcanist- these guys are oozing with coolness, and by that I mean they delivery their formulae via ooze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Prestige Classes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Banechemist- takes knowing your foe to a new level, marrying ranger elements with alchemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Exochemist- An alchemist mixed with summoner, nuff said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus new discoveries and plant companions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
