							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Character Sheets</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When robot assassins and goblin thugs come knocking at your door, you'll need more than your sword; you'll need your wits about you, a complete inventory of your weapons, and, of course, everything in order. In short, you'll need Wizards character sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all how can you fight the Nazi mutants when you're rummaging through your backpack looking for the scrap of paper with the secret map? And how will you overcome the vile plots of the malevolent Wizard Blackwolf when you don't even have a good handle on your own personality?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book gives you two dozen character sheets, each printed front and back, with plenty of room for you to detail your character's traits, skills, contacts, and possessions. The sheets are customized for practitioners of magic and warriors, as well as for those who have wings. In addition, there's a handy space on each sheet for you to list your character's mount, be it a ross or a dragonfly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this booklet are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     twelve Warrior character sheets, for non-magical elves, dwarves, etc.,&lt;br/&gt;     six Magus character sheets for practitioners of magic,&lt;br/&gt;     four Flyer character sheets for fairies who prefer spears to spells, and&lt;br/&gt;     two Fairy character sheets for those who both fly and use magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More room for more detail. Now when those robots and reptilions come a-calling, you'll be ready for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
