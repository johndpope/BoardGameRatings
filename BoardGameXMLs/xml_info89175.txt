			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete Characters #8 - Seldr the Starseer, Astrologer and Soothsayer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunes, ruins, fates, and doom are all written in the stars. Learn about the legendary wise man, Seldr the Starseer, and his pursuit of the knowledge that is to be had by studying the stars. His uncanny accuracy has made him the favored counsel of princes and scoundrels and fortune seekers, alike. He plays no games and has no allegiances, except to the truth as written on the night sky. A great resource for the player characters in any fantasy campaign, and suitable for quick adaptation to any game system. This edition of Complete Characters is so full of adventure ideas and optional Tweaks that it extends to an unprecedented FIVE pages. As a special bonus, this character includes quick-and-dirty dice-rolling mechanics for soothsaying, usable with any system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
