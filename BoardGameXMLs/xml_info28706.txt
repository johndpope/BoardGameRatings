			<description>This game was created by a couple of ubergeeks (of the software development variety) for other geeks. You can (as of this typing Feb 16 2007) read more about it at&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://oopsla.acm.org/OOPSLA02/ap/files/tut-32.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://oopsla.acm.org/OOPSLA02/ap/files/tut-32.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: one dice, two map sheets, a guide for the GM, and room descriptions/pictures for the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's sort of a cross between zendo and a ridiculously light RPG. One person is the GM (or &amp;quot;Pattern Master&amp;quot;) and describes what the other players in the room see. Everyone else in the room cooperates as the group explores a dungeon and earns keys by solving riddles together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The riddles are usually of the form &amp;quot;You enter the next room and see these few objects.&amp;quot; Players then suggest things to do to investigate the objects and their interactions. The GM tells them what happens as they explore. Eventualy the players regonize the software development pattern for which these objects are a metaphor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created for a conference attended by software developers and presumably has limited appeal outside that group, as few others would ever be able to identify the metaphor, having never read about software development patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
