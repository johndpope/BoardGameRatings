			<description>Players move around a Monopoly-like board in which each space represents a state, fund raising and spending the money to open campaign offices.  Each office on a state increases the chances of collecting votes during primaries which are held on a fixed calendar at certain turns of the game.  Movement is 0-5 squares at player's choice, but an end-of-turn die role introduces random events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy consists primarily of shrewd choice of states in which to compete -- you can spread over many small states, concentrate on a few large ones, or make some attempt at a hybrid.  Player vs. player interaction is limited; the end-of-turn event roll gives you a 1/6th chance of being able to send an opponent to the Federal Election Commission space (which is, effectively, jail).&lt;br/&gt; Components, unusually, include a cork board and colored pins. The game otherwise has poor production values by modern standards (it appears to have been a self-published one-shot and is more than 25 years old), but is redeemed by a simple and effective design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a quick-playing, light-weight, clever game that exploits its topic well and is worth two or three plays in the unlikely event that you can find a copy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is regrettable that the game does not credit its designer, and the name of the publisher is an obvious joke punning on &amp;quot;gerrymander&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is long out of print and rare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
