							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mummy&#039;s Tune</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mummy's Tune: It's Sure to Knock Them Dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shock-pop princess Lady GooGoo's latest outrageous stunt will see her performing a 4000-year-old song in the shadows of the Great Pyramids while wearing nothing but a few strips of bacon. The fact the song is reputed to level a deadly curse against anyone who isn't Pricess Ho-Baq, the original pop princess, makes this performance even more exciting for her and her fans. But there are deadly forces arrayed against her--the Muslim Brotherhood, Mummy Cultists, and even Ho-Baq herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mummy's Tune features four linked Battle Scenarios that combine to trace a bone-chilling storyline fit for a mummy movie from Hammer Films or, perhaps, The Asylum. It includes brand new Traits (Demure and Like An Egyptian), the most complex Spelling that has yet to be fatured in a ROLF! product, and an assortment of Combat Maneuvers not included in the core rulebook. Also included are stats for 13 pre-generated characters, including Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood Thugs, the legendary Prncess Ho-Baq, Egyptologist Lord Charles Wiffleton, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
