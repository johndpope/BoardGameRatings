			<description>Confederate Rails is a game that allows the players to operate the historical railways of the Confederate States of America (CSA) during the American Civil War. Not only do they have to deliver goods, supplies and military loads during difficult time, but they have to adjust to a dwindling rail network.&amp;quot;  This is a great pick-up and deliver game, the 24 railroads are assigned during the game to the players and many Contracts (load from/to) have to be selected and satisfied. Event cards (passive and active), particular flexible Contracts add interest to the system&lt;br/&gt;to limit its repetitive attitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trains have fixed movement allowance to be spent over a network of friendly and expansive rivals' tracks, congestion and rail conditions affect the movement. The key point of the game is the Union force invasion, they are simulated by weighted tables and dice roll to gradually shrink the network from north to south. After the Union victory the player with the most money is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
