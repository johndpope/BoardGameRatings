							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Verdun: The Game of Attrition</name>
									
			<description>Verdun: The Game of Attrition by acclaimed designer John Hill is the first limited edition DTP title from Cool Stuff, and represents a true upgrade to this classic Conflict Games release. Verdun is limited to 100 hand-numbered copies only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a plastic bag with a full graphic makeover highlights this release, including a new map and two new player aid cards. The more-than-full-color map has been enlarged from its previous 16x20&amp;quot; size to a full 22x34&amp;quot; (in four sections). Four sheets of mount-them-yourself counters (totals 2 double-sided sheets; mounting boards included) and a six page rulebook round out the package. Numerous tracks and markers lacking in the first edition have been included and the counters have been made double-sided at last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
