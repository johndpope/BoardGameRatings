			<description>From the Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many criminal and terrorist groups known to be operating in our solar system: The Multifaceted Ringworts of Scrim, Jabba MeGutt with his alien syndicate 'DENIZEN' and of course Crax Bloodfinger and his evil followers. However, all of these despicable characters fade into obscurity when compared to General Ironside and his Metal Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question: What do you do when a horde of Ironsides heavy metal henchmen storm Slough nuclear power station, threatening to blow it up?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Answer: You send in Joe Blade. However, when you find out that Joe is busy evicting an evil dictator from an unspecified latin american country, you have to do the next best thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mayor of Slough was forced to take the only course of action left open to him, call in Harry Chainsaw, freelance bounty-hunter, ex marine and part-time window cleaner from Oslo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
