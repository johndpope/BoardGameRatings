			<description>&amp;quot;Speed!&amp;quot; is a card game designed to teach children to multiply and how to multiply faster. There are eight decks of cards that come in a rainbow of colors. Each deck focuses on skip-counting by a different number (2-9). Once familiar with the numbers in a game, multiplication becomes simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two people play against each other to see who can get rid of all their cards first. There is no taking turns and is someone shouts &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot; when the played cards are the same their opponent must add the played cards to his/her stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
