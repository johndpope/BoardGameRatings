							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game Of Footer</name>
									
			<description>The Chad Valley catalogue from 1910 stated that this is &amp;quot;The best indoor football game invented - highly popular with followers of the game.&amp;quot; -----from the book &amp;quot;PLAYING THE GAME&amp;quot; by Brian Love, 1978.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game was to be the one to score a predetermined number of goals first. Players throw a die and then move foward that number of spaces. Certain spots on the board resulted in fouls, throw in, penalty, and offsides resulted in your marker being moved to different places on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring a goal was done if you were close enough to the goal (spot # 25) and rolled a number high enough to get past that #25. If you sinmply reached #25 with your roll the golie made the save and punted the ball back to number 4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
