							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Era of Battles</name>
									
			<description>Era of Battles is a head-to-head strategy card game. The game's kingdoms from different box sets are meticulously balanced to be played against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game is played by just 2 people, so with each box set up to 3 pairs can be playing at a time. It has three difficulty levels: novice, standard, and expert. This gives the game a high replay value and allows players to get deeper into the strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each kingdom has a different profile, which in turn determines the strengths and weaknesses of its deck. For example, a kingdom with high Strength has higher damage attacks, whereas a kingdom with high Intelligence has more card draws. A kingdom&amp;rsquo;s deck has a total of 33 established cards of 3 types: attack, defense, and spell. Further, each player chooses 1 Power card and 1 Avatar card from their pool of available cards. What&amp;rsquo;s great about this is that each player can make several choices to customize their play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To setup the game, each player chooses a kingdom, then gathers their deck, roster and tokens, and is ready to begin the game. The player with the kingdom with the higher Initiative goes first, then the other player takes their turn, and so on. The objective of the game is to deal enough damage to the opponent to destroy them before they do the same to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player&amp;rsquo;s turn is broken up into 4 sequential phases: draw, attack, spell, and discard. A card typically has more than one effect, and each effect targets the attacking player or defending player. For example, an attack card first deals damage to the defender, then it draws 1 card for the attacker. When an attack card is played, it deals Physical Damage (PD) to the defender which allows them to respond with a defense card. A spell card can have different effects, such as healing the attacking player, or dealing Magic Damage (MD) to the defending player (MD can&amp;rsquo;t be defended).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack cards also often deal damage to the attacking player, which is actually alright since they can still heal during their spell phase. This creates an attrition dynamic, and the player that has the best strategy to break the stalemate will win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
