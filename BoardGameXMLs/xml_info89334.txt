			<description>From Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How should you use this resource? You will find a few delve type encounters here. There is no real connecting story to them. They were written in such a manner so they can be dropped into any 4e campaign. You can add them to your ongoing campaign as you please or run them as special one-shot encounters. They range from a toy workshop encounter, to fighting a creature which steals dreams. There is even one to save Santa himself. Feel free to reskin these to suit your needs. We are putting them here for your amusement and enjoyment. We are also adding some feats and other items for the players to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The encounters are rather deliberately spread out in their level ranges. Feel free to modify them to fit your campaign. The feats are deliberately heroic tier feats so the most people can use them. The items are also kept in a level range for most people to be able to use them. The big theme here is&lt;br/&gt;enjoy. Add or remove items as you see fit. It is a bit of game based holiday cheer for you to share. Have fun! Spread the joy to all your gaming pals and have a fun holiday season. As the creators of this little adventure, it is our hope you will enjoy the work we put into this. If you have any questions, suggestions, commentary or the like, feel free to contact us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product was released via a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike License&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
