			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old classic game from Soviet Estonia. It is roll and move game with small twists.&lt;br/&gt;Each player is a child trying to get home from school and the goal is to reach home first, but it is not that easy as it sounds.&lt;br/&gt;On the way there are a lot of distractions, like planes flying over head and ice cream being given away for free. All these things take time and you might not reach home first.&lt;br/&gt;Smarter will use trains or bus, some will try and run for it.&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to reach finish and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
