			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Salt Route is the main trail between western and eastern H&amp;acirc;rn. The dangerous route crosses the territories of four barbarian nations and countless rivers and streams as it covers the 170 leagues between Coranan in the Thardic Republic and Tashal in the Kingdom of Kaldor. Merchants use the trail throughout the year but most are reluctant to risk its dangers in small groups. Large, well-protected caravans carry salt and other goods from western H&amp;acirc;rn to Tashal each spring, returning in early autumn with goods from eastern H&amp;acirc;rn and Lythia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Salt Route article covers the history and economic importance of the route, describes a typical caravan's daily routine and what travelers can expect on each segment of the trip, and provides descriptions of some interesting people your PCs may encounter. Also includes a color map and description of a typical caravan campsite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
