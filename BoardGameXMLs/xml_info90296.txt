			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cellscape is an Alternity &amp;ldquo;Convention&amp;rdquo; adventure designed for 4 to 6 pregenerated characters of 1st &amp;ndash; 3rd level, who must try to escape from a prison planet. While there is an interesting mix of combat, negotiation, and problem solving, the adventure has more combat scenes than your average adventure; after all it&amp;rsquo;s a prison break; but that&amp;rsquo;s not always the way to defeat your foes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the flavor of this &amp;lsquo;dark&amp;rsquo; scenario is in the different PC&amp;rsquo;s enclosed, each with their own information and their own secret. The adventure is presented as a &amp;ldquo;Spontaneous Adventure&amp;rdquo; not a &amp;ldquo;Planned Adventure&amp;rdquo; (see page 209 in the Alternity GMG). In other words, it gives you all the tools to judge the PC&amp;rsquo;s escape attempts but does not lead them neatly from one encounter to another. In fact as the PC&amp;rsquo;s discuss their main plan before the game starts, they will surely think of a few things not covered here. Stay on your toes. This may not be a good scenario for beginning GM&amp;rsquo;s! If used in an ongoing campaign, the adventure is still useful, your home PC&amp;rsquo;s could be the prisoners wrongfully accused or they could try to break IN to get someone OUT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was written to include everything needed to fully play the game, including PC and GM worksheets and handouts. Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
