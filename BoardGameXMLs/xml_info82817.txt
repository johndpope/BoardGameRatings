							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Proletariat: The Uprising</name>
									
			<description>Extract from the Game's Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your circle, comrade, has one major goal: incite the proletarians of the city first to unrest, then rioting, then successful insurrection. You have many methods to choose from: bribery. blackmail, speechmaking, poisoning, intimidation, writing of manifestos - the list could go on for pages. You will probably use many of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, the Bourgeois Pig holds almost all of the several types of token: money, political power, and proletariat (30 each of Money and Power, and 50 Proletariat). Your circle has four Money tokens (a fifth being consumed by immediate needs such as room and board) and one Power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the agents (and the Bourgeois Pig) may wander around the city as they please to explore, find contacts, and other such activities, only one action intended to further their respective goals may be taken per day - one for every agent, one for the Bourgeois Pig. These actions may or may not have an effect. If they are well-used and appropriate, the circle or Bourgeois Pig may gain tokens above and beyond those it must spend to carry out the action; if not, it may lose them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
