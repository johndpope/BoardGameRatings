			<description>While on the surface it may look Talisman-like, it's really more of a mix between that an Monopoly, and it's a bit closer to Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can be a priest, fighter, or magician, but the main difference is just that each monster has numbers that must be rolled to defeat it, different for each character class. You move around the outer board, with some control over your direction at times. There are 3 sets of 3 monsters on each side. Each time you defeat a monster, you place a marker next to it and get some gold as a reward. The first player to defeat all 3 monsters in a group gets a substantial reward for doing so. Gold can be used to buy swords to increase your die rolls. When all the monster groups are defeated, the final group of monsters can be attacked. While the player who defeats the final set of monsters gets a very large bonus, the winner is the player with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
