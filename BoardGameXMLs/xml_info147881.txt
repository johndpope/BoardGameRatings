							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Max: A Two-Player Game</name>
									
			<description>Max is played on an 8x8 grid filled with positive and negative integers, except for one space marked with a star. One player starts by crossing out any number in the row with the star and adding to his or her total. The other player then crosses out any number in the column where the first player's number is. The players continue choosing numbers based on the row or column where the previous play was until one of them cannot move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of two rounds; in the second round players switch so that the player who played rows now plays columns and vice-versa. The high score after both rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the April 1994 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game appears to be nothing more than a pencil-and-paper version of Mattix, which was not designed by the &amp;quot;designer&amp;quot; of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
