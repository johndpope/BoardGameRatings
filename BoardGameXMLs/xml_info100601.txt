							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ides of March</name>
									
			<description>The Ides of March is a small game about the assassination of Julius Caesar. The premise is that Mark Anthony appears on the scene armed with a sword, albeit some distance from the scene. He has to either kill all the conspirators or get Caesar off the map before he is killed. Since he has a sword, he does considerably more damage with his attacks than the conspirators (armed with daggers) can manage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains rules, combat results table, map, and 10 counters, all printed on a single sheet of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
