			<description>Module Foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moonless Night is an adventure module composed of short adventures which are compatible with both the first and second editions of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons game. The adventures are designed with novice players and dungeon masters (DMs) in mind; more experienced gamers may find the action too scripted, the dangers too forgiving, and the plot too linear for their tastes. In such a case, the DM is encouraged to expand, revise, and delete as necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the author&amp;rsquo;s intent that this module be easily integrated into an ongoing campaign. Background information, such as a history of the area and the names and personalities of non-player characters (NPCs), are provided for DMs that are relatively inexperienced or pressed for preparation time, but the best use of these scenarios involves the DM changing the names of locales and NPCs, then dropping the whole setting into an area of her campaign world; any frontier area near mountains with wooded foothills would be suitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the five adventures was designed to be played within a six-to-eight-hour time frame. The town should be explored thoroughly enough to meet the major NPCs, and scenarios should be played in the order presented; these suggestions are made because the actions of the player characters (PCs) and events they witness will have an impact on the playability or believability of the later adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
