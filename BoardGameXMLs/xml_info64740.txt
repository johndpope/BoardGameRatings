							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Athena Strain</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to GalacTravel's service Seventeen Alpha to Earth. I am Captain Morrison, commander of the Athena, and I am pleased to receive you on board for this trip. Our journey is expected to last four days.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sadly, Captain Morrison has no idea what is about to be unleashed on his crew and passengers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Athena Strain plunges the players into dire straits aboard the spaceliner Athena, as catastrophic events unfold and put the lives of all onboard into jeopardy. The crisis needs someone capable of keeping a cool head in dangerous situations and someone capable of handling delicate negotiations as the fate of the Athena hangs in the balance. They will have to face threats from within and without the ship that might well become their tomb, not to mention needing to survive the Athena strain itself. Time is running out...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than a linear progression of scenarios, this book presents a toolkit to run the events of the Athena strain and covers how events may diverge from the 'scripted' timeline. This book begins with a number of timeline-derived scenes, followed by events that may occur through the actions of the players, and how these might affect how the disaster unfolds. Finally, details on the space liner Athena, its crew and passengers, and some of the other factions involved in the scenario are presented, explaining the forces at work and how they influence the forthcoming events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
