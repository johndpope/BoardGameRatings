			<description>CarmaBoard is a Print-n-Play game featuring 3D papercraft cars and a modular board. The race track can be adjusted every game to include any number of tiles that join to make any shape the players choose. Each game will also feature a different number of pedestrians that the players can run over for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 50 credits at the start of the game. Credits are used to repair damage to a race car at the cost of 100 credits per 1 damage repaired. More credits can be earned by ending a turn on a square that provides credits. Cars are completely destroyed if they ever have 5 damage, so repairs are critical to stay in the race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other squares on the race track include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pedestrians (must be hit to win the game)&lt;br/&gt;     Explosives (cause damage to race cars&lt;br/&gt;     Bonus squares (provide free repairs, extra turns, damage immunity, etc)&lt;br/&gt;     And many more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can attack other racers directly or indirectly.  Ramming is always an option to damage other racers, but cars can also drop mines behind their car that explode when a car lands in that space or release a pool of oil that will cause a player to spin out and miss a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends and the winner is determined when one of the following conditions is reached:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A player finished the race by completing 3 laps&lt;br/&gt;     All pedestrians have been killed (the player with the most kills wins)&lt;br/&gt;     All other racers are damaged beyond repair&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
