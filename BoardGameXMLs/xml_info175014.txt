							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noonka Bored 4D game board</name>
									
			<description>This game board is a 4D HYPERCUBE or TESSERACT with four inch sides, projected onto 2D space. On this game board all coordinates are in units and chess pieces (zees) are used as game pieces. The first number in each coordinate is how far from the game board Origin (0000) in the X direction (right/left), the 2nd number is how far from 0000 in the Y direction (diagonally upward); the 3rd is how far in the Z direction (up/down); the 4th how far in the T direction (diagonally downward). Point 4204, for example, is 4 units in the X direction, 2 units in the Y direction, 0 units in the Z direction, and 4 units in the T direction (from 0000). There is every 4 digit combination of 0, 1, and 2 making an 81 coordinate grid (3^4 = 81). Other &amp;ldquo;Noonka Boreds&amp;rdquo; are 4&amp;quot;, 6&amp;rdquo; and 8&amp;rdquo; sided Tesseracts where coordinates are 4 digit combinations of 0,2 &amp;amp; 4, 0, 3 &amp;amp; 6, and 1, 4 &amp;amp; 8 respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zees are arranged on the grid of this game board to play variant forms of games such as Checkers, Chess, and Solitaire with up to 8 players; however the board is very versatile in that many games can be played with modifications and enough different styles of zees. Role playing games can be played in 3D space with 3 different time periods. There are enough zees with each basic game board to play 8 player 4D Checkers (or 4 player 4D Chess). JetEyes are caps placed onto the zees to indicate an increased status including moving forward and backwards rather than just forwards around the 4D grid board. A jetEyed Pawn is a King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games can take between 15 minutes and 3 hours depending on the game, number of players, and their experience levels. There are many ways to modify the games so that it takes more or less time, or to accommodate different experience levels. Note: the game has an abstract feel to it that appeals more to the math-geek. The beauty in the board is that it helps you visualize four dimensional space-time. Think of the grid as a 3D cube on a time-line, with 3D cubes at T=0, T=2 (red cube), and T=4. There are also 3D cubes where Y=0, Y=2 (green cube) and Y=4, Z=0, Z=2 (blue cube) and Z=4, and X=0, X=2 (brown, light blue, or yellow cube on website and poster sized boards), and X=4. In fact, because there are midpoints on each of the cubes, there are also 96 smaller 3D cubes on this board. You get so caught up in the geometry and numbers that time passes and you are &amp;ldquo;Never Bored&amp;rdquo; (Noonka is Spanish for &amp;ldquo;Never&amp;rdquo; (misspelled from &amp;ldquo;nunca&amp;rdquo;))!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
