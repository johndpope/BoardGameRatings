			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; The quick fire quiz game where you cover numbers until you need ... ONE TO WIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's your chance to test your general knowledge to the limit and play the hit TV quiz just like a real game show contestant.&lt;br/&gt;The questions come hard and fast so there's never a dull moment - just a whole lot of fun for friends and family!&lt;br/&gt;Finish the proverb &amp;quot;Absence makes the heart ...&amp;quot;  Decide whether the tomato is a fruit or a vegetable, whether tortoises have teeth and whether or not a maharajah is an Indian prince.&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the first to cover your score board completely and attempt the Word Challenge?&lt;br/&gt;Lose the challenge and you'll lose half your hard earned-points.  But as they say, its tough at the top if you really want to be 'The One to Win'!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
