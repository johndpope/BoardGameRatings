			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is like folded cloth overflowing with patterns. Patterns hiding other patterns, patterns on top of other patterns, patterns within patterns and they all can be seen if you pay attention. You will see them in the flight of birds, in the lines on someone else&amp;rsquo;s hands, in the entrails of animals, or in the unique patterns of your very soul. I was born with this gift, but you, you have been chosen by the spirits. With time and their guidance you will learn to see what is and what was, and as your powers grow stronger, you will also see what will be. Pick up the cloth called life and in the patterns below, you will see the spirits that once dwelled there and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to call them forth, inhibiting your body to provide answers, you will be able to give courage to young heroes by showing them the outcome of their good deeds or instill fear in your enemies by plaguing their minds with the horrible future that awaits them if they dare oppose you and your companions. Seer, medium, psychic, augur, diviner, channeller, soothsayer, oracle&amp;hellip; people will call you by many names and they will love and hate you for your gifts but you must always remember one thing: In order to grow, you must understand everything around you, even those who seek to do you harm. To understand is to divine patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 16 page playbook containing 21 moves, some gear and magic items.&lt;br/&gt;    The Catari, a new race with custom moves for you to use.&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
