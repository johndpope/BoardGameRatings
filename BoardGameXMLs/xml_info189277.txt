							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jackbox Party Pack 2</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s the sequel to the party game phenomenon The Jackbox Party Pack, featuring FIVE fresh, rib-tickling party games! Games include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fibbage 2 (2-8 players)&lt;br/&gt;The runaway hit bluffing game with over 500 brand-new questions, more than 2x the original! Plus new features, like the deFIBrillator!&lt;br/&gt;Earwax (3-8 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hear-larious sound-effects game that will leave you up to your ears in laughter! Cow moo? Huge explosion? Or tiny fart? Which to choose?&lt;br/&gt;Bidiots (3-6 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The absurd art auction game where you draw right there on your phone or tablet. Outbid your opponents for weird art pieces &amp;ndash; drawn by players themselves &amp;ndash; and win this strangely competitive auction game! Don&amp;rsquo;t be a bidiot!&lt;br/&gt;Quiplash XL (3-8 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The say-anything, gut-busting Quiplash XL (3-8 players), which includes everything in Quiplash, Quip Pack 1, AND over 100 brand-new prompts!&lt;br/&gt;Bomb Corp. (1-4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bomb-defusing nailbiter of a party game! As interns at Bomb Corp., you must defuse random bombs in the office in order to keep your jobs. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably die, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be good work experience!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play using their phones, tablets, or even computers as controllers &amp;ndash; making it the perfect easy-to-join party starter. No extra controllers needed! And, up to 10,000 spectators can join and affect some games by playing as Audience members!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
