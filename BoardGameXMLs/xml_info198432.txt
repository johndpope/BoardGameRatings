							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wait Up, Grandpa!</name>
									
			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grandpa is visiting, and you and a sibling are going out with him. Your delicious destination: the ice cream stand in the park. Your walk will take you through eight friendly neighborhoods, and there are plenty of interesting objects to explore and collect along the way: stones, insects, bottlecaps and such&amp;mdash;pretty much anything you can stuff into your pockets. Stay out of the mud puddles, though, or your mom won&amp;rsquo;t be happy with you when you get home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each round, one player rolls all the dice. Grandpa moves along the path automatically, then each player will have a choice of moves. It's good to maneuver yourself into going first, since that player will have first crack at snapping up objects, but he will also have to deduce what his opponent might do. Other considerations for both players include getting more different objects than their opponent, when to re-roll their dice, and the need to stay close to Grandpa. If you lag too far behind you'll have to entreat Grandpa to &amp;quot;wait up!&amp;quot;-- which will yield negative victory points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light fun for kids and semi-serious gamers, Wait Up, Grandpa! provides 30 minutes of game time well-spent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;  1 Game Board&lt;br/&gt;  5 Dice in three colors (2 blue, 2 red, 1 gray)&lt;br/&gt; 24 Object cubes in eight colors&lt;br/&gt; 10 &amp;ldquo;Wait Up/Hurry Up, Grandpa!&amp;rdquo; markers, double-sided&lt;br/&gt;  3 Mud puddle markers&lt;br/&gt;  2 Player tokens (1 blue, 1 red)&lt;br/&gt;  1 Grandpa token (gray)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
