							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Odysseus: Role Play for the Homeric Age</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Odysseus is a game of adventure in ancient Greece. It combines the fast-moving combat of Greek hand-to-hand warfare with the incredible mythology of Homer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient Greeks are well known as the most advanced of philosophers. From the abstract to the concrete, they theorized, postulated, and experimented. From algebra to calculus, from creation to ethics, they were the best of thinkers. And yet, in this environment of intellectual enlightenment, they worshiped deities as diverse as they were complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a young Greek warrior leaving home for adventure, fame, and fortune, seeking a place of honor among heroes such as Achilles, Heracles, and Agammemnon. Could he survive and reach his goal, or would he die in the trying? Only his skill, courage, luck, and the favor of the gods will lead to success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Odysseus uses a role-playing format to simulate the epic adventure of mythic Greece. The rules are composed of six sections, each describing an aspect of play, mechanics, or genre in the game, such as combat between individuals and armies, sieges, and naval engagements, as well as the people, cultures, gods, and monsters of the Hellenic world. Together they form the backbone of a role-playing game that attempts to be &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; in nature, while remaining enjoyable to all the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May the gods favor your conquest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
