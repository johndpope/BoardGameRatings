			<description>Perryville: The battle for Kentucky, 7-9th October 1862, One of the more obscure of all major Civil War actions, Perryville was the culmination of Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky in 1862.  The game recreates the events of October 7-9th, 1862, both what actually happened and what might have been...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the fall of 1862, the young Rebel nation launched two invasions into border state territory. One ended in the bloody Battle of Antietam. The other&amp;mdash;lesser known&amp;mdash;effort culminated in the Battle of Perryville. Bragg&amp;rsquo;s campaign to seize Kentucky from the North was of critical importance. A crippling blow dealt here would have transferred the war from Tennessee (and further south) to the Ohio River. U.S. Grant&amp;rsquo;s efforts at Fort Donelson and Shiloh would have been voided. The war in the west would be fundamentally altered in the South&amp;rsquo;s favor. As it was, Bragg was unable to bring in the available Confederate forces and fight a decisive battle against Buell. In this game, however, the player can take an active hand in drawing on all the Southern forces to bring on the battle that might have been.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With one map and 280 counters, Perryville makes an excellent starter game for players new to the successful Civil War, Brigade game series. With both the latest edition of the rules and a smaller battle to work with, new players will be able to quickly garner the skills needed to compete successfully in the other (larger) series games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perryville is game number 6 in the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series by The Gamers (now Multi-Man Publishing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Turn: 30 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 200 yards&lt;br/&gt;Unit: Infantry/Cavalry Brigades &amp;amp; Artillery Battalions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22&amp;quot; X 34&amp;quot; full-color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 32 page CWBS 2nd edition revised Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One 8 page Perryville Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;Two six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 (suitable for solitaire play)&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-16 Hours (varies with scenario played)&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: Moderate&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: High&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
