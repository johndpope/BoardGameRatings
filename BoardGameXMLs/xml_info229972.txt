							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mere of Shattered Souls</name>
									
			<description>An Adventure for 4th Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cosmology of Eberron is a mysterious panoply of planar lore and unique celestial bodies. The many planes intersect and diverge, bringing about fields of power and strange new magic all over the world. In this adventure, a triad of dimensional energies threatens the very life force of the Xen&amp;rsquo;drik jungle. If the PCs cannot defeat the soul-bound villains of this adventure, the soil of Xen&amp;rsquo;drik will become forever tainted, slowly spreading pestilence and death through the verdant land until everything is as barren and toxic as the Mere of Shattered Souls itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of the mere begins two years before the start of play. A ship named the Twilight Lady left port in Sharn bound for Stormreach. Its hold contained a number of treasures intended for Radiant Hold, the stronghold of the Covenant of Light. On its way to Xen&amp;rsquo;drik, the fabled and deadly storms that tear through the pass between the jungle continent and Khorvaire blew the caravel off course and sent it around Xen&amp;rsquo;drik&amp;rsquo;s western coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the ship could recover its bearings, a massive wave lifted the craft and sent it hurling inland to crash in a wetland valley. Everyone aboard was killed on impact and the remains of the ship half-sank into the murky earth. Because the ship was so drastically off course before coming to ground, it could not be located and was written off as lost at sea with all hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As tragic as this was, it would have quietly joined the long list of vessels sunk by the temperamental waters of the Straits of Shargon had it not been for the Twilight Lady&amp;rsquo;s unusual cargo. While many of the goods in the ship&amp;rsquo;s hold were valuable or rare, the Covenant of Light was only concerned with a single iron-banded chest. Sealed with the paired symbols of the Sovereign Host and the Church of the Silver Flame, the chest contained two unholy relics dedicated to the powers of the Dark Six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
