			<description>BACKGROUND: A CROWINING MERCY is semi-historical simulation of the English Civil War. The game begins just after King Charles I dissolved Parliament. The Player represents the Commander of the Parliament Forces with the goal to overthrow King Charles.

The Player&amp;rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 16 Cities and 14 Towns before the last Campaign Card is Played. If the Royalist Army controls 16 Cities and 14 Towns at the end of their Turn, the Royalists win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: Game includes many colorful, graphic Counters, a period flavored map, and Campaign Cards. Counters include Pike and Musket, Musketeers, Cavalry, Cuirassier, Cannons and Leaders. The Game is Card Driven where the Player draws a number of Campaign Cards that may be Forces, Actions or Events. The Player then takes his turn carrying out actions with his Leaders and Forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME MECHANICS: The Player moves his Leader Counters on the Map along with their Troop Points. If a Battle occurs, Troop Points are exchanged for Tactical Units and combat is carried out in a Tactical manner on a Battle Mat.
