			<description>You and your companions are cosmic spirits in an alien, infant universe. Seeking more, you opened breaches to other realms, setting lose a pandora's box of chaos, knowledge and wonder across your reality. These new experiences confer upon each of you new emotions and varying abilities, blessing you with individualism&amp;hellip; while cursing you with differences. Before long, you all turn on each other, descending into a battle royale that will not stop until one finally ascends to godhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endogenesis is a competitive arena-styled card game. Collect Skills from the Realm of Knowledge to customize your character with different powers, and upgrade them with Shards that you can earn by defeating your enemies. Also joining the fray are vicious Monsters from the Realm of Chaos. The most powerful of these are called Legendaries; killing them will reward its slayer with a Prism. Be the first to collect 3 Prisms and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
