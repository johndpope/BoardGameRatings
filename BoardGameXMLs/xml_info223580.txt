							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carrotia: Carroting</name>
									
			<description>Carroting is the first expansion of Carrotia and comes along with the base game. In Carroting the Master Rabbit is trying to avoid the river's currents and find the exit on time but at the same time he must face the fishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;River's Currents: When the Master Rabbit is moving along with the river's currents nothing happens, the game continues as you know. However, if the Master Rabbit is moving against the river's currents, then for each move you make, you count 2 moves on the Rabbit-Meter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Rabbit Characters: In &amp;quot;Carroting&amp;quot; expansion you will discover three new characters. The Steam Rabbit, the Wizard and Ms. Lovely. Each of these characters has a new ability. Example: Ms. Lovely ignores the river's currents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated Quest Cards: The updated Quest cards indicate where you will place the fish tokens as well as the fishing spots. The fishing spots are hidden and you don't know what they hide unless you move the Master Rabbit there and you claim such a token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
