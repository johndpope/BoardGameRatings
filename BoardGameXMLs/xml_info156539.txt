			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Ararat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ararat is a world almost completely covered in water.  The local population, however, is terrified of The Deep and live in fear of the ocean.  Visit a world where the people are huddled on 7% of the world's surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come to Ararat!  Avoid the storms!  Dodge a landslide!  See the Grand Hall of the Triumvirate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And get an additional world, the frozen water world of Durupinar.  Located in the same system as Ararat, it is ruled by a corporation dedicated to exploiting its bounty.  See the ice structures!  Fish for the elusive and oily Three Eye!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Worlds 23: Ararat has been designed with the busy Referee in mind.  Both Ararat and Durupinar are meant to be interesting and exciting places that can be easily added into any existing Traveller campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And short of ideas?  We've added several adventure hooks to get your creative juices flowing and allow you to make a visit to the Ararat system one your characters will remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with a printer-friendly black and white system map as well as a full-color chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
