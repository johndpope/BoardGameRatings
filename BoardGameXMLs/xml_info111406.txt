							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ethics on the Job</name>
									
			<description>Ethics on the Job is a board game specifically designed to help students learn important information and concepts about ethical behavior in the workplace. Players learn standards for ethical behavior and how to discriminate ethical from unethical behavior. Ethical situations covered include relations with employers, co-workers, customers, and suppliers. Playing the game demonstrates to the students that unethical behavior can hurt other employees, the company, and themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players are in the role of company presidents. They are responsible for the success of the company. Throughout the game problems are brought to them that involve the behavior of their employees. Players must decide (1) whether the fictitious employee's behavior was ethical or unethical, and (2) what punishment to give (if the behavior was unethical). The situations are designed so that they are not easy to decide. Players see that unethical employees prevent them from winning the game, and they take steps to move these employees out of their companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
