			<description>Childrens card game. 22 cards feature Baron M&amp;uuml;nchhausen going hunting. The cards also have a little text at the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal all the cards out. The player with card number 1, lays it on the table, and then reads out the text (or Mum or Dad does). After that, the player with card number 2 places it next to card 1 and reads out the text. This is repeated with card no. 3, then 4. etc., and the first player to use all their cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I must say this is a game in the poorest taste. It is a young children's game because there is no skill whatsoever. When all 22 cards have been read out, that would be the same as telling a short story. But, for a children's game, why pick on the subject of animal killing? Look at the card examples. They are virtually all as bizarre as you could imagine. My children would not be able to touch it with a barge-pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
