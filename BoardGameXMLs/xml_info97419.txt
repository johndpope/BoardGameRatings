			<description>The Joy of Conversation Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn over a &amp;ldquo;Topic Card&amp;rdquo; and then everyone has 45 seconds to write down whatever they can think of about in relation to the topic; topics range from New York City to Jay Leno to Google to Las Vegas.  When time is up, players move their coffee beans up their respective containers (boards) based on the number of original ideas they had.  To change a topic:  &amp;ldquo;Cream it&amp;rdquo; and move on.  To have the other players to accept your offbeat answers:  Sweeten them up with a &amp;ldquo;Sugar Packet&amp;rdquo;... and you score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:  300 topics, 10 Instant Coffee Cards, 12 Sugar Packets, 12 Creamer Packets, 6 Coffee Beans, 6 Individual  Coffee Cup Scoring Boards, 6 Score Pads and a 45 second Sand Timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
