			<description>&amp;quot;Mario Party 10 (Japanese: マリオパーティ10 Hepburn: Mario Pāti Ten) is an upcoming party video game developed and published by Nintendo for Wii U. It is the tenth main game in the Mario Party series, the fourteenth overall, and the first game in the series for Wii U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Party 10 continues the tradition of the Mario Party series, in which four players, controlled by either human or CPU, compete against each other on a game board by participating in various minigames. At least one board will feature the same play style introduced in Mario Party 9, in which all four players travel across the board together. Along with the standard competitive modes, Mario Party 10 introduces a new mode called Bowser Party, in which a fifth player controls Bowser using the Wii U GamePad. In this mode, the four main players are tasked with reaching the end of the board without losing all of their hearts whilst avoiding being caught by Bowser, who is trying to stop them. If Bowser catches up to the other players, a minigame takes place in which Bowser uses the GamePad's features to activate various devices, such as tilt controlled fire rods, pinball flippers, and a spinning wheel, whilst the other players attempt to take as little damage as possible. The players win if at least one player makes it to the end of the board with their hearts intact, but if all players are defeated, Bowser wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mario Party 10&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
