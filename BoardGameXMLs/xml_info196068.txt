			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on standard Blackjack rules and uses one or more stripped packs of French playing cards shuffled into a single deck.  Players take turns being the Mainframe (game master) and performing the deal (e.g., performing as the House).  After each Exchange (round) the points of play are distributed to the players (but not the Mainframe).  Play then passes to the exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The points distributed are valued by suit and influence the humanity of the characters in the game.  Players seek to balance points to retain their humanity, though they must trade off humanity to gain &amp;quot;Mechanism&amp;quot; which &amp;quot;transmogrifies&amp;quot; them into cyborgs.  This involves a (brief) narrative development.  Like the card game upon which it is based, this game is intended to be played in short periods of time and with rapid narrative development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
