			<description>This set of rules are printed on an 8.5&amp;quot; by 17&amp;quot; piece of heavy paper.  The game simulates tactical combat for future armor and infantry units.  Designed to be played tabletop or using a hex board, the game has simple mechanics allowing for easy introduction to new players.  Though the game seems simple since it comes on a single piece of paper, there is enough detail to make this an interesting game for both beginners and experienced gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not credit an author or publisher, nor does it have a publishing date, the game does state that the rules are meant for use with Stan Johansen Miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
