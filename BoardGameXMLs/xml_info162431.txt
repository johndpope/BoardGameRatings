			<description>The game is about traveling around to different cities in the world and answer questions about the locations. In order to get the money needed for traveling, the player have to take different jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be several different goals in the game. Either that travel around the world in the shortest time, to visit as many cities as possible or to get certificates in as many jobs as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backpacker was released in 1995 on one CD-ROM. The game was developed by Stefan Gadnell and Jens Thorsen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Backpacker (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
