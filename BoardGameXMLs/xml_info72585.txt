			<description>Free set of World War II skirmish rules focused on squad vs squad level combat designed by Nick Eyre.  The game is aimed primarily at 25/28mm, but 15mm works fine. Each soldier can perform a variety of different actions which are listed in his profile.  Actions include Move, Move Fast, Move and Fire, Sneak, Fire, Hide, Assault, Covering Fire, Weapon Work and Rally.  The rules are simple yet realistic. The game is divided into turns with players taking alternate turns with all of their units. The latest set of rules include many optional rules that have been added by the Landser Yahoo Group including basic armor rules and additional army lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
