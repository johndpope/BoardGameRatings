							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Double Check</name>
									
			<description>Double Check is a game of Checkers adapted for four players in teams of two.  It is played on a 14 x 14 square grid with nine squares of each corner removed, resulting in a cross-shaped checkered board.  The game is played on the dark squares only, and each wing of the board has twelve dark squares to host twelve pieces in their starting positions.  There are pieces of four colors: black, white, red, and green.  Each player chooses a partner and their own color, and sets up their pieces in starting positions opposite the board from each other.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their pieces and capture other players the same as in Checkers, moving only towards the opposite side of the board until their pieces can be crowned in their partner's home row, and moving in any direction after.  Only opponent's pieces may be jumped or captured.  Pieces cannot be crowned in opponent's home rows.  Movements are not otherwise restricted on any part of the board.  The team who eliminates their opponents' pieces, or prevents them from moving, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one variant provided for in the game's rules, in which players are allowed to jump their partner's pieces without capturing them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
