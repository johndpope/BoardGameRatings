			<description>Fast-Break Basketball is a dice-rolling game that emulates a three-a-side basketball match&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses three dice to represent their players: forward, center, and guard.  Each die has a custom face with its special symbol.  The game's main mechanic is that an attacker (the one in possession of the ball) succeeds in his or her action by rolling a number higher than or equal to the defender's; special symbols tend to trump numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice are placed on the board such that the centers face off against each other, while the forwards go against the guards.  The game starts with a roll-off between the centers.  The winner gains the ball (represented by the offensive marker), which grants a bonus to the attacker's dice rolls.  Only forwards and centers can take shots to score points; the guards steal the ball.  All positions can pass among each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach an agreed-on score wins and ends the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
