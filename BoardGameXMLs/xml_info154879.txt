							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dear Leader</name>
									
			<description>The Supreme Glorious Leader needs to be pleasured and players, as managers of Leader's pleasure teams, must provide Dear Leader with the entertainment he requires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear Leader is a quick tile game in which players score points by providing Dear Leader with the entertainers he desires, but if Leader is not in the mood for the entertainers you provide, there will be executions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin each turn by taking turns drafting entertainer tiles  from a central market. Using these entertainer tiles, each player creates a team of entertainers and 'sends it off' to Dear Leader. At the end of each turn, Dear Leader selects one of the 5 types of entertainers (Parades, Cinema, Dancers, Clowns, Libation). The entertainers of the type that Leader selected are scored (placed in a score pile) and the entertainers of the incorrect types are executed. Each of the 5 different entertainer types has a special ability and players can sacrifice them to affect scoring or Dear Leader's decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when there are no more entertainers. Players score a point for each tile in their score pile and bonus points for having many of the same tile type in the score pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
