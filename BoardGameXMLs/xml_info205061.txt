			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rise and fall of Atlantis is the stuff of legend. Plato described Atlantis as a perfect society but it was never without issues and challenges. Built on what is now known as the continent of Antarctica, Atlantis &amp;mdash; or, as they call themselves, Aztlan &amp;mdash; was a vast land divided into seven kingdoms around a central mountain upon which stood a shining city. While the civilization had attained great power and miraculous technology, its people fought and bickered and politicked like any other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest war was fought over the energy web. The southern kingdoms stood to benefit the most from this invention but the northern kingdoms believed that the energy web could disrupt the structure of the world. In the end, they settled the issue in a terrible war that lasted eight years and the southern kingdoms won. It took a decade to realize how the energy web was sapping the power of the earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic fields. It took longer to realize how grave it would be. When the sun god opened up with all his wrath, the world was unprotected. Without warning, everything changed in a moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The night swallowed the sun. The ground shook. Ice rained from the sky. Tidal waves crashed over the land. The few thousand who survived were tossed to distant lands on makeshift boats. Hundreds of millions died. Aztlan was gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
