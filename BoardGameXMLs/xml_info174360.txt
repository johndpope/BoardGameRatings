			<description>Party game, &amp;quot;A jolly game for any party&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 9 Names' List Cards provided. Place these at suitable distances apart about the room (attach to walls, !f convenient).&lt;br/&gt;Look at the Key Sheet and you will note that a girl's Name heads each list. Now the idea of the game is that the girl is friendly in turn with each of the boys whose names follow and finally marries the young man whose full name is made up of the first letters of the Christian names reading from top to bottom of the list and the wedding date is that at the foot of the list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By filling in his recording card as instructed below a player is able to make a list exactly the same as that on the key sheet corresponding to a particular girl's name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suppose we take the name Barbara. Write Barbara in the first space of a recording card; then look for Barbara in the left columns of the Names Lists and on finding it write in the second space the boy's name opposite in the right column, i.e. Roland. Next find Roland in the left column of a Names List and write in the third space the name opposite, For example - lan. Continue in this way until the date June I2th is found opposite Stuart and entered in the last space alongside the word WHEN.&lt;br/&gt;Now enter the first letters of each name recorded in the column headed &amp;quot;FIRST LETTER&amp;quot; and it should then be fairly easy to divide them into two groups giving a Christian name and surname. Write them in the space alongside the word WHO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give each player a recording card and see that he has a pencil.&lt;br/&gt;To begin the game call out one of the girls' names on the Key Sheet and the player who is first to present a correctly completed recording card is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternative way of playing is to write in the first space of each recording card to be used, before the game starts, the name of a girl and at the word &amp;quot; GO &amp;quot; each player completes his card in respect of the girl whose name appears on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
