							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of the Ilu</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gods Have Returned...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface it is no different than the world you and I live in. Most people go on about their lives never realizing the terrors that walk among them.&lt;br/&gt;Despite humanity&amp;rsquo;s vast ignorance, the horrors are there. Angels and demons make war in the shadows. Hellspawn serve their demonic masters. Ancient gods, once imprisoned in a dark realm called Oblitus, now walk the Earth, seeking followers to help regain their former glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a war in the shadows....but for how much longer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise of the Ilu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise of the Ilu is a 192-page supplement for the Contagion Second Edition Role-Playing Game published by Aegis Studios. This full-color supplement includes rules for playing members of the Ilu race, or as humans call them: gods. Whether a Gamemaster wishes to introduce the Ilu as a shadowy threat in the background, or run a campaign in which players assume the roles of these ancient deities, Rise of the Ilu includes everything you need to take your Contagion Second Edition campaign to a celestial level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise of the Ilu includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Two new playable races: The godly Ilu and their demi-god children, the Ikkibu&lt;br/&gt;    13 new Feats&lt;br/&gt;    51 new Spells with effects up to Magnitude 9&lt;br/&gt;    New systems including means to ascend to godhood, methods for celestials to become mortal and the secrets of truly killing celestials.&lt;br/&gt;    Details on the Factions of the Ilu&lt;br/&gt;    9 new Realms for use in your Contagion Second Edition campaign, including the first look at the secrets of Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;    30 pregenerated Ilu characters, ready for use in your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed information on the metaplot of Contagion Second Edition.&lt;br/&gt;    Gamemaster tips for running celestial campaigns&lt;br/&gt;    10 player handouts including various prophecies of things to come in the world of Contagion Second Edition.&lt;br/&gt;    New creatures, including Dinosaurs and Heavenspawn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
