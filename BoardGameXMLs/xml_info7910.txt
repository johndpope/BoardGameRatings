			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help everyone from Mom &amp;amp; Dad to Granny &amp;amp; Grandpa have a Great Day and not get caught by The Blues. Pass on a hug. Make others laugh with goofy faces. Tell someone what you like about him or her, dance, sing together, and share a joke... Feel-Good Cards have lots of things to do to chase away The Blues. But watch out for those old Blues; they can sneak up on you very quickly. You can personalize this game's supplies by adding various books &amp;amp; music of your own. Some suggestions are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
