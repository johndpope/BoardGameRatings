			<description>From The Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Goal: To find and slay the cult of witches responsible for spreading the black plague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Villain: Bartolomeo di Cambio, a Florentine witch living near the river Arno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villain&amp;rsquo;s Allies: Cult of nine witches. Types of magick: Black Magick, Enchantment, Sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;Alessandro, the (now wealthy) captain of the guard in Pisa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre, Time, Setting &amp;amp; Mood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Mystery/Thriller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Period: 1348 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Pisa, Italy. During the Black Death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mood: Grim, dark. Full of despair. The dead and dying are everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backstory&lt;br/&gt;The port city of Pisa has been in decline ever since the naval Battle of Meloria in 1284 A.D., where a&lt;br/&gt;Genoese fleet defeated the navy of Pisa, ending their trade dominance in the region. Today, there is a&lt;br/&gt;war brewing with the neighboring city of Florence, and darker creatures lurk in the night outside the city&lt;br/&gt;walls. Tensions between Florence and Pisa over trade issues came to the breaking point in 1315 and the&lt;br/&gt;fierce battle of Monticatini was fought. Although Pisa destroyed the Florentine army, some of the&lt;br/&gt;survivors grew evermore hateful. Bartolomeo di Cambio was one of these, obsessed with hatred for the&lt;br/&gt;residents of Pisa. From a prominent family of bankers, he used his wealth to explore the forbidden arts&lt;br/&gt;in search of a way to exact his revenge. Together, with his co-conspirators, his coven of witches strive to&lt;br/&gt;destroy the city of Pisa. They have taken up residence in the dark alleyways and shadowy areas of the city.&lt;br/&gt;These nine witches have finally succeeded in bringing a great plague to the city with their hexes and curses:&lt;br/&gt;The Black Death. Now they wage a silent war against the city, and watch it die.&lt;br/&gt;These are the names of the cultists, and they are all from prominent banker families of Florence:&lt;br/&gt;Desiderio di Mozzi; Ernesto Peruzzi; Fabio Bardi; Gavino di Falconieri; Gino Cerci, and the&lt;br/&gt;Alfani brothers: Luca, Nicolo, and Pietro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
