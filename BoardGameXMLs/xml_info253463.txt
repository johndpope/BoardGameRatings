							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Islands of the Known Lands: Leatherback Island (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The southern seas of the Known Lands are home to a great many islands, some of which appear on no map. Given the treacherous nature of the seas, few of these islands are home to more than a handful of inhabitants, and most hold secrets that those on the mainland cannot even guess. Leatherback Island is just such a place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turtles and tortoises of all sorts are mysteriously drawn to the island that takes its name from their presence. Protected by an enigmatic elven druids and her slurgithian allies, Leatherback Island is home to a small number of castaways and natives who have found balance in nature, but the tireless quest of a greedy alchemist threatens the island's peaceful nature. And what dark secret lies at its heart?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
