			<description>In Challenge Football players are taking the role of coaches in an &amp;quot;American&amp;quot; Football game. As coaches, each is deciding what plays to run in order to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plays commences with the selection of a play card by the defensive player. He/she installs a cover over this card such that the offensive player can only see the players on the line of scrimmage. A &amp;quot;shift&amp;quot; card must also be selected that gives the option of shifting the defensive line to either side for the play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The offensive player receives the play card and cover and must draw the offensive play on top of the clear holder. This could be a combination of runs, handoffs and passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the plays determined, the cover is removed, the shift card revealed and the path of the play is compared to the defensive positions. Where the path crosses a triangle is where the ball is downed. A touchdown is scored when a play is not downed on the field. Players are also attempting to make ten yards in four downs, as in football, to earn a first down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random events include a roll every play to see if there is a penalty, and dice-rolling punting, kick off and field goal rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After four quarters of fifteen plays each, the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3M Bookshelf Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
