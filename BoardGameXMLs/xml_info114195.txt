			<description>Crisis Dice is a cold war dice game with complexity more akin to 'Zombie dice' than 'Twilight Struggle'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crisis Dice is a very light, quick-playing, low-complexity game for 1-2 players aged 8 and up.It lasts between 15 to 20 minutes and emulates a tiny portion of the tension and political unrest between the former Soviet Union and the United States of America during the month of October in 1962.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game players will try to infiltrate the heart of their opponent&amp;rsquo;s government and in doing so gain military intelligence that will help prevent political tension, misunderstanding and ultimately a nuclear war. A peaceful victory with propaganda bonuses is the preferred outcome for either side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first super power to place their Event Marker onto the Victory space at the end of the Event Track before the opposition and before the DEFCON level reaches one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules summary.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Roll for initiative. Both sides roll a single 6 sided dice the highest score wins initiative for that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Place Agency Focus Marker. The winner of the initiative roll chooses one of the four Agency Focus Actions at the top of his side of the game board and moves his Agency Focus Marker from its agency home space to the chosen action space. These bonuses are added to the Spy Dice rolls in the next part of the turn where a score of 5 or 6 is deemed successful. The player that lost initiative then chooses his action (he may not duplicate the action chosen by the winner of initiative for that turn) and places his marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Roll Spy Dice. Both sides roll all of their available coloured Spy Dice. Dice that have been placed within the Kremlin or The White House during previous turns may not be rolled again and remain where they are until the end of that round. On turn one both players will have 3 dice to roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Agency Focus bonuses are applied. The chosen Agency Focus Bonus is applied to any one of the rolled Spy Dice, starting with the player who won initiative in step one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Spies infiltrate places of power. Successful spies (those dice that scored a roll of 5 or 6 with any bonuses applied) are deemed to have successfully infiltrated their chosen place of power i.e. Kremlin for U.S. spies or The White House for soviet spies and are placed into the appropriate area on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Repeat steps 1 to 5. These steps are repeated 3 times or until either player has placed all 3 of his spies into the appropriate spy placement area. The first player to do this is deemed the winner of that round and moves his Event Marker one place closer to the Victory space. Players must raise DEFCON level by 1 if indicated by text above event track. If both players fail to place all 3 of their spies into their appropriate spy placement areas then an intelligence stalemate is declared and the DEFCON Marker is raised one level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Return Spies and Agency Focus Markers. All 3 Spy Dice are returned to each player and the Agency Focus Markers are returned to their Agency Home Space ready for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. Repeat steps 1 to 7 until one side places their Event Marker onto the Victory space and reads the printed outcome or until the DEFCON level reaches one indicating the start of a worldwide thermo nuclear war and both sides lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
