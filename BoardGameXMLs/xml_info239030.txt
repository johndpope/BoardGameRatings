			<description>88. Basic Tactical Procedure for Quick Combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;DragonQuest 1st Edition and 2nd Edition both ended with rule 87.  The play-tested, yet unpublished, supplement Arcane Wisdom began with rule 89.  Rule 88 was missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one page supplement published by SPI in 1980 and included as an insert to the later shipments of DragonQuest Boxed Set (First Edition), and in some mailings of SPI's Ares #4, is that missing rule 88.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
