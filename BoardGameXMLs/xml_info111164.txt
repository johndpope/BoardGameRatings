			<description>The Bear family is having a few surprises, things are disappearing from their surroundings, leaving only white spots behind. Of course the bears try to remedy matters and to bring things back. The game consists of 12 picture cards with motives from the bear family life, on each card a simple geometric shape has been left unprinted. 24 forms, 12 red and 12 yellow, are sorted by color and put into a bag each. Cards are tourned over one by one and the players reach into their bags and try to find the necessary shape by touch alone. The player who is faster and produces the correct shape, gets the card, when all cards are turned over, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
