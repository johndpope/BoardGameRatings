							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Green and Grubby: Goblin Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mean Green Killing Machines!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite wacky, zany, loveable little villains, goblins are practically the mascots of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and have been since the beginning. Even before Paizo&amp;rsquo;s whimsical new take on the small, green menaces, they&amp;rsquo;ve been a staple of the fantasy genre since Tolkien. But as much as players may love goblins and secretly root for them even as they cut them down, and even though there&amp;rsquo;s a handful of archetypes, feats, and abilities specifically for goblin PCs, the fact of the matter is that goblins just aren&amp;rsquo;t a common PC race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book aims to give players who want the fact that their character is a goblin to be more mechanically relevant a way to make that happen, while also providing support for goblin characters of a variety of classes that don&amp;rsquo;t typically make much mechanical sense for goblins. Included are the goblin rider, a cavalier archetype that grants a goblin dog or wolf as a mount, and which allows mount and rider to fight with deadly unity, the goblin horde battler, a fighter archetype that excels in attacking with overwhelming numbers, the goblin skitterknife, a rogue archetype focused on hit and run tactics, skittering across the battlefield to strike a foe, and then scrambling back into hiding before a counterattack can be mounted, the goblin battle shaman, a warpriest archetype devoted to attacking with vicious and self-sacrificing zeal, and the goblin wizard, a wizard archetype able to provide support for an entire horde of goblins, and creating great big magical explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
