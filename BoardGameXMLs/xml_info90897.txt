			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ruin at the End of the World presents an iconic campaign setting for Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World, the sprawling ruins of an Ancient-era metropolis that is now teeming with life - and danger. Page 216 of Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World 2nd Edition offers some brief suggestions (&amp;ldquo;Adventure Hook 3&amp;rdquo;) for running a campaign solely in the Necropolis, in which PCs are feral natives who live on the fringes of the city&amp;rsquo;s bestial factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While some campaigns can take place in the deserts and wilderness of the Twisted Earth, with characters traveling hundreds of miles and visiting dozens of communities during their lifetimes, a campaign set entirely in the Necropolis (while limited to a relatively smaller area, a single city) can be just as entertaining. The fight for survival here can be just as brutal, if not moreso. While the wilderness is desolate and offers few natural resources for a survivor to live on, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the same sense of &amp;ldquo;danger-around-every-corner&amp;rdquo; that a campaign set in the city does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This chapter offers some suggestions for making characters who are natives of the Necropolis, and who spend their days trying to survive, finding food, water, and shelter, while also avoiding (or dealing with) the powers of the old city. Consider it Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World&amp;rsquo;s version of the &amp;ldquo;Iron Man&amp;rdquo; game, ramped up in danger but also rich in rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
