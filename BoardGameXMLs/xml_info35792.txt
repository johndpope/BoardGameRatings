			<description>This one is my first game design and was a finalist in the Hippodice competition.  For those having the desire, time and energy to put it all together, the files are here for print and play.  You will need to supply money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A summary of the idea:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;You have been hired to go to the island of Valencia and acquire crystals before your opponents.  You will meet the various personalities that make up the island and must bribe, steal or buy to accomplish your mission.  However, others will be attempting to do the same.  So, be smart.  First you must try to earn the ear of the council person to tell you where the best deal in town can be found.  Only the highest bidder will get the location known only to them.  Being a smart treasure seeker, you may follow quietly and search the area around where the high bidder goes.  Unfortunately for everyone, people only have a limited number of crystals.  Once a site has been visited, no one may visit again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
