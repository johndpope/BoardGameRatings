							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aussie Rules Super Earthling Abductor</name>
									
			<description>This game is based upon the players drawing a mission card, and attempting to complete this mission.  Players do not reveal their missions to the other players.  There are 3 different classes of ships to choose from.  Players can see what their opponents ships are, and narrow down the potential mission of their opponent.  As the game progresses, players attempt to block their opponents from reaching their goals.  The goal may be to abduct different types of earthlings, or destroying cities (to name a few).  On each city, there is a marker that the player flips to determine how many cards to pull, or perhaps damage to the ship.  An additional angle is not all of the cards drawn are not necessarily good, so, it may not always be advantageous to be on a city that is giving a lot of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
