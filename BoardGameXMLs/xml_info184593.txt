			<description>Mythic Tribal Robot Fantasy in the Year 200,000,000 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gears &amp;amp; Spears, players will create characters known as Onics--sentient robots that live in the far-flung future long after humanity has ceased to exist.  Much of the rules establish the sense of setting, where these sentient robots live in a fantasy world of low technology, not realizing their nature is peculiarly anachronistic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are created with entirely narrative tags.  The most important tags are six lines of character Mythology that define the sort of role the character will play within the tribe.  Next, three significant Traits are identified.  The character then selects three Traits from their Tribe that are most interesting to them.  The character then identifies three Passions--those ideals that separate the character from the mass of the populace.  Characters also begin with two dots of Shine (that which makes them special) and 10 dots of Juice--these latter two stats are bookkeeping elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All characters belong to the same Tribe and generate their Mythology together.  One player will act as the Fates (GM) and participates in the Tribe but not as a character.  If conflict occurs it is resolved with narrative.  If it cannot be resolved with narrative the Fates may call for a die roll to determine which narrative vision prevails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
