			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic action resolution roll involves using 2d6 plus modifiers compared to a Difficulty Value (-5 to 15).  For opposed actions (including Combat), the Difficulty Value will be the opponents modified 2d6.  The system supposes win, lose, or tie.  Double 1s always indicate failure and double 6s always indicate success, regardless of Difficulty Value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control a Ghost as a character.  Ghosts begin with a narrative concept.  Ghosts have a limited number of Emotions (they have no body and no mind--only memories and emotions).  Emotions may be actual emotions (rage), states of mind (agitated), ways of thinking (analytical), philosophies (Stoicism), or worldviews (bigoted).  The player and GM must agree on these Emotions.  Players distribute 12 Emotion Points among their Emotions to purchase Ranks.  Ghosts also have four derived abilities--Intensity, Will, Vitality, and Integrity.  Ghost have one or more Drives and one or more Stimuli--these motivate the Ghost.  Finally, a Ghost will have an Ego and an Id, both narrative elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is mechanically simple it is conceptually quite complex and subtle.  Ghosts have memories but no mind, and Emotions but no motivations.  They are driven by Stimuli and Drives but these are invariant personality components.  Ghosts will interact with the world (or attempt to) in ways that they remember as being familiar, even if these attempts are not particularly successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
