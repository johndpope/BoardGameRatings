			<description>Stay on track at home or away with the Fit Meter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Wii Fit U lifestyle doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop at the front door. Now you can track all your activity&amp;mdash;wherever you are. Just clip on the Fit Meter on your way out and sync it with a touch of a button when you get home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fit Meter does a lot more than count your steps. It also has an acceleration sensor (to measure intensity) and an atmospheric pressure sensor (to measure altitude changes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means the Fit Meter can more accurately calculate how many calories you burn, based on what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. Running up stairs, for example, will torch more calories than taking the elevator&amp;mdash;even though the distance is the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See how much you&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished by syncing the Fit Meter to your Wii Fit U profile at the touch of a button. You&amp;rsquo;ll get detailed graphs of all your activity, including how many calories you've burned and how many steps you've walked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
