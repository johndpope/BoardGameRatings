			<description>Op Naar de Top / Fol escalade is based on the Spider Wars. But this version is focused more on luck and risk taking.  This is a game about mountain climbing. The game is mainly aimed at a very young target group. Each player has a mountain climber, the objective is to reach the top first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players climb on the different sides of mountain and try to reach on top first while pushing down opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wheel indicates which hole you can fill with hand or foot of Your climber. Its smart to cling to the rock by at least three supports, but you can take risks if you are foolish. During that time, your opponent climbs the other side. It can use one of your shots, which is not dramatic ... unless it was your last shot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who reach first top of the moauntain is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
