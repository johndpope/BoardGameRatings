			<description>Since 2012, the Society book is now included in the core rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This book details the background and day-to-day details of like in the 93rd millenium Icar universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Icar, it would seem, is set in a Universe which is notoriously difficult to explain. The main cause for the difficulty is that it is filled with cliches and yet not quite like anything else. It would be difficult to draw any comparisons between popular science fiction such as Star Wars and Star Trek as there are fundamental differences. So the reader should begin with a completely blank slate. Please do not seek to draw connections with other Science Fiction settings because that will lead to misconceptions that will be difficult to overturn later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
