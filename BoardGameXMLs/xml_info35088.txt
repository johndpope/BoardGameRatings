			<description>Wonder Checkers is a teaching implementation of Checkers. In addition to the regular checker board, the individual pieces are shaped like small cannisters, which open to reveal messages and prizes. The kit comes with stickers, customizable inserts, prize-tracking score sheets and game rules in quite a readable, logical sequence for new learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the prizes supplied with the game are mere stickers and tokens, the designer suggests using jelly beans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wonder Checkers is part of a series which includes Wonder Chess, Wonder Go, and Wonder Letters, all of which are designed to teach standard rules and strategy of these classic abstract games by inserting intermediate rewards and tracking tools to motivate young learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the  reverse side of the board, an implementation of 3-d tic-tac-toe is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommended for Ages 4 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
