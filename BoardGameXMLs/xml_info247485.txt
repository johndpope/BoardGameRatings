			<description>Kumppani is a 400-card game of abductive reasoning,intuition, and logic. The game begins by one pair drawing a card and following the instructions successfully to keep the card. The first pair to collect 5 cards wins the game. The cards focus on interaction and teamwork and players can win certain cards by matching answers, regardless of whether they are both factually correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content is wide-ranging, and players could be: deciding if hang gliding or scuba diving is more dangerous, naming hangover symptoms, guessing who believes in aliens, or deciding if wolves are monogamous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kumppani also includes: 6 paddles and markers, which players write on; 2 sand timers, 20 and 45 seconds; and 150 blue cards, which every pair can compete to win. These hard-to-win cards are very strategic and can be used to skip challenges or steal opponents&amp;rsquo; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
