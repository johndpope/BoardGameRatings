			<description>The evil Dr. Faryan and his army of bio-engineered monsters has taken over the colony known as Red Earth. One warrior though has gained the powers of a werewolf and challenges Dr. Faryan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game in human form, but by finding a Red W icon, the human is able to transform into a werewolf creature. The werewolf form offers higher jumps, quicker speed, greater strength, a shockwave attack, and the ability to climb walls. Also by collecting orbs you can became a super werewolf, increasing your strength, speed, and defense. Accidentally grabbing a blue W icon or losing too much energy will change you back into a human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only 5 stages, but the game is infamous for its difficulty. it also came with a comic book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;:_The_Last_Warrior,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
