			<description>GamBOOLee is a game for 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player tries to capture the royal families of the other players and to win all the ransom money. To determine the winner, the players have tournaments between their knights (similar to the &amp;quot;jousting&amp;quot; bouts of the knights of old) and the loser must pay ransom for the pieces he has at stake in the tournament or lose his pieces to the winner. The game continues in this manner until one player has won all the ransom money and all the pieces, or until the remaining players concede defeat with the player to the highest total -- the total of the ransom prices of all the pieces he holds and all of his ransom money.  The magnets in the knight bases decide the winner of each tournament in a completely random and unpredictable manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
