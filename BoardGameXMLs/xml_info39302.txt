			<description>&amp;quot;It's What They Want For Christmas!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Santa has only five houses left to deliver gifts to this Christmas Eve. Unfortunately, the town is rife with hunters who only want one thing for Christmas&amp;mdash;venison! Will Santa be able to deliver all the toys to the good little boys and girls before the hunters shoot all of his reindeer down?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venison is a flicking game with one player assuming the role of the hunter and the other of the reindeer. The reindeer player's goal is to deliver gifts to all five houses by flicking his reindeer pieces into them. The hunter's goal is to kill all of the reindeer using pieces representing claw traps and bullets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
