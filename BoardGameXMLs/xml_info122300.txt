			<description>A game for two or for two teams of two.  In the four-player version each player controls three cops or three robbers; in the two-player version each player controls six.  The object of the cops is to kill all the robbers, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 13&amp;times;13 grid which is divided by impenetrable hedges into a maze.  Three cops start at each of two opposite corners; three robbers start at each of the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player on his/her turn moves one of his/her men up to five spaces.  If the man lands adjacent to an enemy man, that man is killed and removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is from the book The KnowHow Book of Action Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
