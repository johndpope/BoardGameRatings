							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Digit Dick&#039;s walkabout on the Barrier Reef</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A game based on the story by Leslie Rees&amp;quot; - box cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published between 1945 and 1954, and based on the best-selling Australian children's book &amp;quot;Digit Dick on the Barrier Reef&amp;quot; by Leslie Rees (1905-2000) illustrated by Walter Cunningham, published by John Sands, Melbourne, in 1942. Set in Queensland, the book details the adventures of Digit Dick , a &amp;quot;little boy only as big as his mother's big toe&amp;quot;, who smuggles himself on holiday with his parents in his father's coat pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a simple roll-and-move race game using marbles as pawns on a board mounted in the game box. The track is a connected sequence of 45 holes. Most holes are small enough to hold the marble in place, but 9 of the holes are large enough to swallow the marble (and represent the adventures Dick has in the book).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must throw 1 or 6 on a six-sided die to being, then get to roll again for a proper move. If the player's marble lands on a big hole, it rolls down the box and he must start again. If he lands on an already-occupied small hole, he places hi own marble one space behind (which might be a big hole). He must throw an exact number to finish, otherwise he moves backwards the excess amount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second version &amp;quot;for older children and grown-ups&amp;quot;. In this version, a big hole causes you marble to move backwards 5 spaces (instead of starting again). If the countback takes you past the start space, you must start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules sheet summarizes the story of Digit Dick on the back, and advertises two other Digit Dick book titles; Digit Dick and the Tasmanian Devil (set in Tasmania), and Digit Dick in Black Swanland (set in Western Australia).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
