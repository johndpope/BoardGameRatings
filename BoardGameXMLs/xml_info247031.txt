			<description>You know how, when you're sitting around with friends, you inevitably start telling old stories and unofficially trying to one up each other? This game takes that typical night and turns it into a competitive event. Players tell their best true life stories on the card topic and try to one up each other. Players vote on the best story - the person with the most votes wins the round. The person who wins the most rounds is crowned the One Upper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
