							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nexuiz (2012)</name>
									
			<description>A remake of the original multi-player FPS Nexuis from Alien Trap using Crytek&amp;rsquo;s CryENGINE3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries the Kavussari and the Forsellians have waged war. They have a fragile truce but due to their seething disgust of each other they still pit their warriors against each other in arenas rather than on the fields of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those episodes of lethal combat are now broadcast throughout the galaxy, as entertainment... a spectacle known as&amp;hellip; The Nexuiz Competition: An arena based first person shooter where you can alter the rules of the match and laws of physics while you dominate opponents in ever-changing hostile environments bleeding with hatred.&lt;br/&gt;KEY FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
