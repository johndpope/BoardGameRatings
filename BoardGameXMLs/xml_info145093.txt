			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Intelligence Gathering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: The Drink Bar &amp;amp; Grill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Drink Bar &amp;amp; Grill is a small sized restaurant by day and nightclub by night. Due to its location (about two blocks from the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods in the city) it has been known to be unsuccessful and change owners frequently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paulo Putanesca (Mid 40s) is the current owner of the establishment and the one who contacted ORPHEUS GROUP about a series of 'disturbances'. He claims that a ghost is haunting the establishment and that the reason behind the bar's unsuccessfulness is because it has been cursed by some sort of malevolent being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Putanesca claims that a ghost has been leaving behind roses around the building. Unconvinced of the mysterious nature of the roses he ignored it for a few months thinking it was some sort of practical joke. Two weeks ago he witnessed a series of red glowing lights that led him out back to the alleyway where he discovered a bouquet of red roses sitting in a puddle of blood. He claims that the roses themselves were bleeding. He preceded to call the police who accused Mr. Putanesca of calling a false alarm when they discovered no pool of blood or roses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since then Mr. Putanesca has contacted ORPHEUS group to investigate and deal with the alleged haunting. He is a religious man and believes that this spirit deserves to be put to rest and pass on to its intended course. He is paying extra to have this service performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
