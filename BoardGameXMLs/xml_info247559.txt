			<description>A tongue-in-cheek card game that has you racing against your opponents to reach 50 years of marriage first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think you've got what it takes to make it all the way to 50 years of marriage? In this card game players compete to see who's marriage can withstand the challenges many couples face- such as naughty children, money trouble, pesky in-laws and even the much feared sex drought! But don't worry, for each challenge there is a solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is pretty simple. The game can be played with up to 4 individuals or 3 pairs(6 players total). Each turn involves drawing one card and playing one card. To win you must play year cards(1 year, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 years)to reach the total of 50 years before your opponents do. Before you can play any year cards you must play a married card. Once you're officially married you can start accumulating years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you draw a card: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     from the top of the discard pile or &lt;br/&gt;     the top of the deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you choose ONE of the following as your play a card action: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Playing a card on yourself such as a Year card, Solution card or Immunity card(which protects you from specific Setback cards).&lt;br/&gt;     Playing a card on an opponent such as a Setback card or Divorce card to slow down their progress. &lt;br/&gt;     Or if you're unable to do either of those, simply discard a card. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have either a divorce card or setback card played on you, you can not play any new year cards till those cards have been resolved. Marriage cards resolve Divorce cards, Solution cards resolve Setback cards of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
