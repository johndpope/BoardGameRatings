							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forstal&#039;s Final Rest</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades ago a group of adventurers saved the town of Logan&amp;rsquo;s Bluff from a humanoid incursion. While the battle ended in a victory, the cost was high when the party lost a valued member of their group. In his honor his comrades and grateful citizens built a tomb over his final resting spot. In the decades since the battle peace has reigned but has recently waned with the advent of more humanoid sightings. Some have wondered if Forstal&amp;rsquo;s tomb is drawing the humanoids back for revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a low level group of adventurers.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign! Written in the early 90&amp;rsquo;s this isn&amp;rsquo;t as polished as current work but still an excellent &amp;lsquo;filler&amp;rsquo; adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
