			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Moon Chronicles is a heroic fantasy strategy game, mixing turn-based army movement on a strategic map, and pausable real-time battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the French comic book series &amp;quot;Chroniques de la Lune Noire&amp;quot;. The player, as the half elf Wismerhill, has to gather armies and fight or ally himself with four different factions (the Imperial Legions, the Order of Justice, the Knights of Light and the Army of the Black Moon) in order to fulfill his destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the turn-based strategic game, armies are moved around the map, reinforcements and improvements (such as better stables to improve cavalry units, or a magical library to research new spells) are bought. Battles are resolved in real-time on a battle map, where the player give orders to units of soldiers or individual characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story elements of the game change according to which of the four factions the player choose to ally himself to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
