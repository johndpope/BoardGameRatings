			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Wreck Age depicts humanity&amp;rsquo;s desperate struggle after betrayal and disaster have decimated Earth as we know it. Your introduction to Wreck Age begins in the 26th century, during the re-setting of the calendars, or Year Zero, the first year in the re-emergence of civilization we call The Resurgence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flash in the sky illuminates the night, as a mysterious celestial object comes careening down from the heavens. The Tribal Elders see this as an Omen, of a return to the Tribe&amp;rsquo;s glory days. You are members of War Spur, nomadic Drifters whose power in the region has been on the decline for the the last generation. You are seen as the last, best hope for the resurgence of the Tribe. By tracking down the Omen, you can restore honor and notoriety and help set War Spur back on it&amp;rsquo;s rightful path, the path to glory for your ancestors. Do not let the ghosts of your foreparents down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Omen is a Wreck Age adventure for 3-5 players, who may each control up to two characters each. This adventure is designed for green level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Omen is set in the rugged eastern end of the Merikan continent, but can easily be modified to fit any Wreck Age setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
