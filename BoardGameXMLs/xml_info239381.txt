			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the Peshwah, to say a thing, is to do a thing. To break one's word is to become less than whole. To bear false witness is a mortal sin. But the Cult of Calelrin worships the Peshwah god of lies and wields deception and deceit with the same grace and skill the finest swordsman uses with good steel. Who is their next target? Who are they? What schemes have they made? What do they plan for the Chosen of Hadeen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dave Arneson&amp;rsquo;s Blackmoor two-round adventure for Player&lt;br/&gt;Characters levels 2-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is recommended that player characters has participated in a previous Epic of Hadeen prior to play. At least on player at the table MUST have played a previous episode in the epic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Three of The Epic of Hadeen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
