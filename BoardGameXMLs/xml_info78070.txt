			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take to the skies with the second expansion to EverQuest II: Kingdom of Sky!  This expansions opens the Overrealm, remnants of the Plane of Sky high above the land of Norrath, for adventuring.  Kingdom of Sky increases the maximum level cap on adventuring and tradeskilling to 70, and it also raises the guild level cap to 50.  This expansion contains content for characters between levels 55 and 70.  Plenty of solo, group, and raid content can be found in Kingdom of Sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 3 expansive overworld zones to explore, 2 shared dungeons, and many instanced dungeons, there are many new items and monsters to encounter.  Along with the introduction of dozens of new quests and the Alternate Achievement system, this expansion adds a whole new face to the game.  The Alternate Achievement system is available to any character level 10 or higher.  Completing quests, defeating certain powerful enemies, or continuing to adventure after your character has reached the maximum level will grant you experience for Alternate Achievement points.  Once you have earned these points, you can spend them to increase your attributes and gain access to powerful abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New spells and abilities have been added for each class, including a new spell for each class gained at level 65 that is unique to any other ability in the game thus far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn about the residents of the Kingdom of Sky, the Droags, Aviaks, and Dragons, and discover the tenuous relationship between them.  If you make the right friends, you might even leave your mark on Norrath.  Just be careful not to fall off the Overrealm, or you'll leave your mark on the face of Norrath instead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purchasing this expansion will unlock an Aviak Hatchling for you to put in your in-game house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
