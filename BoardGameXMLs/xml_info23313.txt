			<description>El Tablero de Jesus (pronounced 'Heh-soose') is a simple gambling game played on a 7&amp;times;7 board with a pair of standard dice.  Originally presented to the SCA (recreational medievalist) as a historic game from the 15th century, further research has found this to be a hoax.   No evidence shows the game to have existed before 1971.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each roll one die, with the high roller going first.  The first player places two coins in the two right most columns of his back row, while the losing player places five coins in the remaining columns on his home row.  The first player then rolls both dice and moves any two coins up or down a column the exact number rolled.  When a player gets two or more coins in adjacent columns on the same row (other then either home row) he may choose to take those coins and end his turn or continue rolling.  If he takes the coins, then his opponent fills in the now empty columns with new coins on his home row and starts his turn.  At any point if a player rolls 7, 11 or 12 their turn is over and the dice pass to their opponent.  Also if you roll a pair of numbers that can not be moved (roll a 6 and none of the coins are in a home row) your turn is over.  If at the start of your turn there are adjacent coins on the board, you may take them and pass the dice back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player is out of money (or is no longer willing to lose more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is most often played with alcohol instead of coins (if it ever was played with coins) -- filling shotglasses with beer or wine and moving those about instead. This can shorten the game, since the &amp;quot;currency&amp;quot; being exchanged is consumed as it is won. It can also balance the game, since the better one plays, the drunker he/she gets from drinking his opponent's brew, self-imposing a handicap. Many SCA-events run Tablero tournaments, in which there is usually a table limit of 2 beers (or 24-oz) set to keep the tournament moving (and the participants capable of competing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all versions of the game, house rules are as rampant and as varied as can be, as no &amp;quot;definitive&amp;quot; rule set exists for the game. When playing, make sure to agree to a rule set with your opponent beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
