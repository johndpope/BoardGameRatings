			<description>&amp;quot;An exciting game of chase&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a boardgame version of an old children's outdoor game. The game board is a circular track running around a boiling &amp;quot;pot of tar&amp;quot; (Tervapata). Each player has their own starting area with 4 playing pieces, which are moved by throwing 2 dice; players can choose whether to move two pieces, or to combine the results to move just one piece. Landing on an opponent's piece means that that piece immediately goes to the pot of tar, to be retrieved with a roll of 6 and then placed back to the owning player's starting area. This gives scope for some simple tactics: Should I try to concentrate on moving my own pieces as fast as possible, or to land on an opponent's pieces? And if so, whose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all 4 playing pieces to their goal area wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paletti game no. 4047&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
