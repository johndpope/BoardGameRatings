			<description>Big League Sports is about putting players right into the action in the most thrilling situations in their favorite sports. There are multiple disciplines to master within tennis, basketball, football, soccer, lacrosse and hockey. But unlike other games the focus is not on the team &amp;ndash; it's on whether or not you can deliver in specific, adrenaline-pumping moments. Whether it's acing an opponent in tennis, hitting a basketball shot at the buzzer, or bending free kicks around a goalie in soccer, Big League Sports offers a fresh interpretation of what a sports game can be on Wii. Big League Sports features a total of 22 events. The game supports up to 4-player local multiplayer. A character creation feature allows players to craft a character to their liking with dozens of customization options. Players can view their statistics and overall progress, as well as the trophies they have won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Big League Sports&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
