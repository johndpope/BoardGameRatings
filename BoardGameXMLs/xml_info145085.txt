			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Removal&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: Annapolis Sewage Treatment Plant&lt;br/&gt;EMPLOYER: Charles Wooldridge&lt;br/&gt;TARGET NAME: Anthony Carter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthony Carter committed suicide with a 12 gauge shotgun on July 8th of this year, after coming home from work (see LOCATION). The Annapolis Sewage Treatment plant is outdated, and in need of renovation. It still uses large open vats (nicknamed &amp;quot;The Planes&amp;quot;) where yeast is added to provide the necessary bacterial reactions to break the matter down. Anthony worked at the plant for 4 years prior to his death at the age of 29. He reportedly had few close friends, save one: Johnathan Arbor. Arbor told authorities that Anthony complained of being continuously mistreated at the plant by 5 employees: Walter Dargon 31, Chuck Levins 29, Jesse Zinc 25, James Zerfoss 35, and Daniel Page 32. Walter was found dead last Monday in one of the vats of &amp;quot;the Planes&amp;quot;. It was ruled an accident. Two days ago, however, both Chuck and Jesse were found drowned in one of the pure water tanks. The plant has been closed since then, and Charles Wooldridge (the Foreman), who is highly superstitious, believes Anthony Carter's ghost haunts the plant, and is seeking revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
