			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently whilst working in the remote Antarctic (on the Halley VI base), Ticket to Ride has proved to be a very popular game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At some point it seemed like a good idea to create our own map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are the same as TTR-Europe, but with no stations. &lt;br/&gt;It's tough to get around Antarctica and not all journeys are successful. When playing it is cramped and there is a lot of competition for few routes so uncompleted destination tickets are commonplace. With 5 players it can be very tough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has little red aeroplanes (twin otters) instead of locomotives for 'ferry' routes and it has crevasses instead of tunnels but these are played the same way as tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amundsen Award (10 points) is given to the player with the longest route that includes the South Pole&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally I include an alternative set of carriage cards made to represent the different vehicles we have here around site - obviously not necessary but fun for us here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
