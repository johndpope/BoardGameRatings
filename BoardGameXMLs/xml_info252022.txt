			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sub hunter is a side-scrolling shoot'em up, where the player controls a submarine than must hunt the other submarines. It was first released for the Commodore 64 in 2008, and then ported to the Amstrad CPC in 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;A scientific experiment to increase the size and number of fish in the sea has gone terribly wrong and now the oceans have been taken over by mutant fish. You must destroy the fish and save the swimmers who have become stranded in their midst. Watch out for agent subs that will do anything to keep this a secret ... You are the SUB HUNTER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Richard Bayliss: programming (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Frask Gasking: Graphics + loader screen artwork (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Maniacs of Noise: Music (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul Kooistra: Programming (CPC)&lt;br/&gt;Herve Monchatre: Music (CPC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
