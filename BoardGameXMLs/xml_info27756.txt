							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stratiotika</name>
									
			<description>A FREE full campaign game for use with Hoplomachia (although it is perfectly good as a stand alone boardgame) Right out of the pages of Thucydides! Two full scenarios included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Stratiotika, you will now be able to make war at the city-state level; you can enrage city dwellers by trampling their crops, organize markets to feed your troops, build counter-walls to blockade rebellious cities, or infiltrate troops within their walls with the help of traitors and take the town on the sly. Not only can you openly call on their assemblies to vote to join your cause, but you can actually debate with your political opponents using historic speeches to sway those who are&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;on the fence&amp;rdquo;. You can lose allies to the harvest, ships to dangerous waters, walls to earthquakes, and cities to a more cunning and silver-tongued foe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
