			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays through a series of Lessons in life, and has a clear end. Game play can be broken over more than one session of play, but after characters have been created, the game should take no more than a couple of sessions to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are not used to having competitive aspects in roleplaying games, or co-operative aspects in board games, you should prepare for the fact that this game expects the players to do a bit of both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a children&amp;rsquo;s game. Depending on where the players take it, the game-play can be rather light-hearted and innocent, or it can result in some rather heavy stuff being introduced to the story, stuff like sex and violence. Some of the rules and images in this book might even seem to encourage the latter. Hell, some of them are too disturbing for me. Thus, before the game, you must discuss what you are comfortable seeing in the game, what you can accept as long as it is left &amp;quot;off camera&amp;quot;, and where you draw some absolute lines in terms of content. Do not assume that you know these things already, even if you think you know the people you play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
