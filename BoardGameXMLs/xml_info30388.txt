							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Xephyr</name>
									
			<description>Xephyr is ideally designed for three players, but can be played with any number between 2 and 6.  Balance and co-operation are the ways to win in Xephyr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xephyr uses a dice; the latter is unusual for Fleur Designs games but it doesn't mean the element of skill is missing. The whole game is based on your skill of balance; can you get your first piece to its goal whilst keeping your second under control? If you can't then you can lose badly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
