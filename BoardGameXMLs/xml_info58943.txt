							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bits of the Wilderness: Into the Swamp</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;185 descriptions bring the mystery and peril of swamps to your game! Make swamps come alive in your players&amp;rsquo; minds. This product provides short &amp;quot;bits&amp;quot; of description and colorful details that could be used to describe nearly any fantasy swamp, regardless of the system. This is created to be an &amp;quot;on the go&amp;quot; product, which means you don&amp;rsquo;t need to read the entire work before you can use it. The descriptions are designed so that they can be randomly generated as you play or placed carefully ahead of time. It is written to be of use to both experienced and inexperienced Game Masters, particularly those who (for whatever reason) find themselves short on time or creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes 100 Bits of description, small pieces that can be stuck in anywhere a little description is needed, and numbered so they can be used randomly. Each Bit is also provided in index card format for ease of use by Game Masters. In addition, there are 85 other descriptions that may depict a particular place (island, dock) or describe the seasons or weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material is indexed a number of ways to allow a GM to easily find a description to fit a particular circumstance. Several descriptions are graphically depicted in the excellent interior art by Gillian Pearce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a swamp setting with a mini-adventure, written especially for this book by Darren &amp;quot;Wolf&amp;quot; Pearce. It provides detailed narration for use by the GM, and advice on how to use a swamp in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the book features an article that looks at how to make swamps in your game realistic and utilize all their fascinating complexities on your players. Written by Professor of Biology K. H. Keeler, the article includes &amp;quot;Swamp Kits,&amp;quot; quick and easy sets of information on the plants and animals common to various types of swamps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
