			<description>A box of three party games known as the Easy Chair Series of games.&lt;br/&gt;In game 1 you have to try to follow a word square of 4 by 4 letters and so arranged they form the names of rivers. This type of game is similar in mechanic to Boggle.&lt;br/&gt;Game 2 is Rhyming Pairs. You are given ten examples of question. The first information given is a word os short phrase. This is followed by a blank, then another blank and then a phrase again. You have to think of a word that goes into the first blank, thus forming two words 'with a close relationship'. Then you need to complete the second blank and make another word that links to the last phrase in your question. The trick is, the two blank words must rhyme. An example; A pool is the first word so the correct word to go with that is Lagoon. The last phrase is Very Light Ball and the correct answer is Balloon. Lagoon/Balloon is correct and rhymes.&lt;br/&gt;Game 3 is a quick trivia game. You are given a grid of five by six boxes. Down the left hand side is a subject for each row, Countries, Professions, Flowers, Prominent People, Motor Cars and Boy's Names. You are given a letter and you must fill in as many boxes as you can with answers that begin with that letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
