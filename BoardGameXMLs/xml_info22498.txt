			<description>The players race for conquering Mt. Everest. The game features a 3d mountain with the East, Southwest and North faces of Everest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players may choose to begin either in Kathmandu or Lhasa. Players advance by rolling a die. The approach march takes place on the flat part of the board and once you have reached your base camp you may again choose between longer and shorter, but more risky, routes to the summit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three kinds of event cards, for approach march, camp and climbing events. A card is drawn when a player lands on a marked space or a camp. There are both good and bad events to advance or delay the conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When climbing players must set up 4 camps and go back and forth between them to &amp;quot;acclimatize&amp;quot;. Aluminum ladders and safety ropes may be set up by successful die roll to get over chasms and evil spots. Once the player enters the Death Zone (over 8000 m) oxygen tanks are needed. In case all oxygen is consumed without the player being able to reach the summit, she must return to previous camp to get more. The first player back at base camp after summiting Everest is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
