							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Executioner&#039;s Square</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The executioner&amp;rsquo;s mask is black and looks like flame. There&amp;rsquo;s not even an eye hole, so you&amp;rsquo;ll never glimpse the guy behind it. Attendance at executions is compulsory and more ominous still? You&amp;rsquo;ll feel whatever the condemned feels &amp;ndash; the bite of the ax, the fear, the helplessness. Now it&amp;rsquo;s Meldonia&amp;rsquo;s turn to die. She got ripped into slavery very young &amp;ndash; though not as young as she looked. Powered up with adolescent defiance, she transformed herself into a rebel leader. Now her head is on the block. But wait &amp;ndash; looks like you&amp;rsquo;ll have to grab her from under the ax itself. So this is the plan: get some walk-away stones, teleport the whole party to a predestined destination that will be a mystery until you get there. But what&amp;rsquo;s to lose? No place is worse than Executioner&amp;rsquo;s Square, so rescue the green-eyed rebel. Iron Wall? That&amp;rsquo;s her destination of choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
