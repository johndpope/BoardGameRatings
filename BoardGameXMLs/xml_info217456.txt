			<description>1+ Co-Op survival horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control survivors who wake up in the nightmarish town of Foghorn. Filled with various monsters, you must collect supplies and weapons to fight your way through the night. Can you survive until dawn? Can you escape the horrors of the town? Fight through asylums, schools, the meat factory and other horrific places as monsters hunt you. Build barricades, help other survivors for supplies. Kick doors down and fight for survival. Will you be the hunted, or the hunter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the 1980's and like a classic horror movie there are dozens of survival horror weapons to choose from but are you lucky and brave enough to find them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your survivors, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each with their own unique skills and starting weapon. Work alone or fight together and try to resist the madness that is slowly turning your survivor into another monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a D12 (12 sided dice).  Standard melee attacks are 5+ to hit but some survivors have better melee skills. Shooting is standard 5+ too. There is no shooting distance negative. Each survivor gets 5 actions for things like movement, shooting, building barricades etc.  There are dozens of weapons but only 1 and some 2 of each scattered around found in crates and given by in game story survivor's on successful missions. Plus most melee weapons breaks after an 10 uses and most monsters require 3-4 hits each so stocking up is Essential. There is also limited ammo supplies to be found. You can build special weapons too like a spear if you have tape, knife and a pole cue.  Most weapons and supplies are found in crates around the map. Break them open and take the said amount from the equipment card pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helping in game survivors can gain you more weapons. Read the story card objective the survivor has task you with and complete in a certain amount of turns. Failing will result in the in game survivor turning mad. You then have the fight him. Killing him you can then take his supplies found on him but you will not get the crate of good stuff as he never told your where it was located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard game is 10 missions. Your survivors have a certain amount of wounds each, some have 18 other 23-28. Having a tougher survivor does not mean the are better, instead sacrificing wounds for better accuracy or agility to avoid taking hits.  The Paratrooper is excellent at shooting and tough as nails but he is not as fast at running but someone like the Actress has few wounds but is very agile meaning its easy for her to avoid taking hits plus she can hide easier is sneaking around avoiding those horrid beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some monsters require light to die so carrying a torch is ideal. Other are messed up real bad by fire and others have longer reach meaning they can attack your from further away and also ignore barricades by simple walking along the wall or roof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement is played in inches. Some can move 4 inch per action or 5. You can not run past enemies if they are within 1 inch and others have long arms so even more difficult to run past.  The monsters are played by the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting the game you have 1 survivor and as time goes on you unlock more playable survivors as the story goes on and you can trade weapons etc with them if next to them.  Each player starts with 1 survivor and same goes, unlock more throughout the missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each survivor has their standard attack without weapons but they can attack like head butt or kick etc for a more powerful or multiple target attack but have to roll higher on the D12.  They also have a sanity attack which is a special powerful attack. To get a sanity attack you must kill the enemy. Some require 12 kills other 16 etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madness is a thing that slowly affect your survivor throughout the game. Collect Essene by killing monsters to slow your madness or find essence statues through the map.  Going mad puts your character in the mad room were you have to fight your own demons. In the mad room you don't use the weapons you have collected instead you take new cards for this 1 mission. Completing the mad room puts you back in the game with your prevous weapons, supplies. To lose to the madness means you characters becomes a monster and hunts your other survivors. He is now controlled by the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over all the co-op or 1 player experience is a story game were after completing each small mission you have a few turns to roam and find supplies etc. Then you take another story card and your next objective begins to completing your over all mission of escaping and surviving until sunrise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various difficulty modes. Easy mode grants you a shop which you can buy new weapons and weapon mods like a silencer, scope plus supplies. Money is spent via sanity and madness points. Spending madness increases your madness and sanity spends sanity points meaning you have to kill more monsters to get your sanity attack back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normal mode does not have the shop and Nightmare mode has more monsters and less weapons / supplies. There is also the serial killer mode which you play a killer. The problem is his madness degrades faster but you can choose to kill other survivors for a big halt or kill monsters for a small halt to the madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
