			<description>In this Rummy-style card game, you and your opponents will be competing to build nonsense sentences out of the cards in your hands, with each card featuring a single word. Every turn, you draw, and then may meld a complete sentence if you're able. You also may add words to other players' sentences, but only if the end result is still a complete sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more cards you're able to play, the lower your score will be. The round ends as soon as one player empties his or her hand. After a number of rounds, the lowest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 99 word cards, the combinations are effectively endless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
