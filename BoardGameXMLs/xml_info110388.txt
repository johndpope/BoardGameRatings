							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raiders Guild Players Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations, adventurer! After months of toil and trial, you, and the other members of your adventuring band, have been chosen to join the Raiders Guild. You have every right to be proud of this great honor. The strength, bravery, and magical prowess the competitors you overcame for this coveted spot were considerable. Your sparring partners, all honored members of the guild fought ferociously. Certain of the strikes you sustained still echo in your bones. Yet here you are, about to step onto a rude wooden platform erected in the middle of the guild compound. Assembled about you is a motley band of heroes and explorers, among whose company you are proud to stand. Garvius himself will lead you in the raider's oath and then present you with your guild medallion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raiders Guild Player Guide shows off the guild that brings parties together and gives them a real reason to descend into the deepest dungeons. Designed for use with 4th edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, the guide not only gives you background material about the guild and their arch foes the intensely secretive Archivist but a new playable race, the Skreek bat-folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
