			<description>Sryth is a single-player, story-driven fantasy RPG you play right in your web browser. 'Sryth' is also the name of the world in which your adventures take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word 'Sryth' is pronounced in one fell syllable, with the 's' and the 'r' blending together and the 'y' producing a short sound, as in the word 'myth'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Sryth YOU are the hero!&lt;br/&gt;You'll assume the role of a brave adventurer (a character you will create and customize) and will then set out in search of fame, fortune, and of course...adventure! However, you're not just any ordinary adventurer...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sryth, the game's storyline revolves around you. You're the main character -- perhaps the greatest adventurer since the glory days of Tallys -- and your actions and decisions will not only shape your destiny, but perhaps alter the course of history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
