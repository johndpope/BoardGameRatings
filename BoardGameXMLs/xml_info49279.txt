							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return to White Plume Mountain</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immortality at any price breeds a menace beyond measure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, a sorcerer named Keraptis searched for eternal life. Within the magma domes and steam vents of an active volcano, he conducted his arcane experiments. Eventually he faded into legend, and the world heard no more of Keraptis for more than a millennium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two decades ago, however, Keraptis reappeared in White Plume. The mountain and its insane lord proved too much for most, but eventually courage and justice triumphed. Keraptis was finally dead . . . or so the world thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now. twenty years later, a face has appeared in the volcano's smoke&amp;mdash;the face of Keraptis himself, say those who should know. Is the vile wizard immortal after all? Or is there an even greater threat building beneath White Plume Mountain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original S2: White Plume Mountain by Lawrence Schick, released in 1979, was one of the first scripted scenarios to appear for the AD&amp;DÂ® game. If you have your own fond memories of experiences within the volcano, you will find this adventure just as fascinating, and just as deadly, as its predecessor. If you are about to tackle White Plume Mountain for the first time, it will be an experience you'll never forget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For four to ten characters of 7th to 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
