			<description>From the Mythic Eras website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters have received a special reward for their hard work cleaning up a park, and repainting all the benches and picnic tables in the park. For their efforts they&amp;rsquo;ve been given passes to the grand opening of a new movie: MIND-SUCKING ROBOTS FROM OUTERSPACE, in MIND-BLASTING-O-VISION!&lt;br/&gt;The word on the street is that the movie is in 3-D, and has actors actually come out of the screen! The Wilderness Kids are being accompanied by their Pack Master, Robert Bree, who is a good friend, mentor, and father figure to the kids. Robert picked up all the kids, and told their parents he&amp;rsquo;d have them back right after the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;this is a fan-made publication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
