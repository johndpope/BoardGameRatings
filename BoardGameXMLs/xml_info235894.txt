			<description>Each player commands a different team of acrobats. All teams work together in the great artistic performance of human columns. In this performance, acrobats climb over each other to form columns with up to 10 artists &amp;quot;performers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can built simultaneously up to five of these human columns. Although the columns are built together, teams compete with each other for the public recognition that comes in the form of applause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An act (one game round) ends when at least two columns are completed. At this point the audience applauds enthusiastically.&lt;br/&gt;Obviously these applauses are directed to the teams whose acrobats have participated the most on the completed columns. Then these artists leave the scene to get some rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acrobats that participate in the incomplete columns remain on the scene and also receive applause for their teams; after all supporting artists also have their importance in the show.&lt;br/&gt;The whole show lasts for three acts. In the end of the third act the &amp;quot;grand finale&amp;quot; takes place. Each player scores its last applause points and some bonus points are awarded too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player, whose team has most impressed the audience during tonight&amp;rsquo;s presentation (gathered the most applause points) will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
