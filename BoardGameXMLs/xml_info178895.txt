							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squadron 42 - Episode 1</name>
									
			<description>Squadron 42 is a story-based single-player campaign set in the Star Citizen fictional universe described by the developers as a &amp;quot;spiritual successor to Wing Commander&amp;quot;. It is being developed by the Foundry 42 UK studio under the supervision of Chris Roberts' brother Erin, who had already worked with him on the Wing Commander series and led the production and development of titles like Privateer 2: The Darkening and Starlancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interactive storyline centers on an elite military unit and involves the player character enlisting in the United Empire of Earth Navy, taking part in a campaign that starts with a large space battle. The players' actions will allow them to optionally achieve citizenship in the UEE and affect their status in the Star Citizen persistent universe, but neither of the two games has to be played in order to access the other. In addition to space combat simulation and first-person shooter elements, reported features include a conversation system that affects relationships with non-player pilots and an optional cooperative multiplayer mode. The game is planned to be released in multiple chapters, the first of which is expected to be available to eligible backers of the project in the second half of 2015, offering an estimated of 20 hours of gameplay for SQ42 Episode 1 with about 70 missions worth of game play, &amp;ldquo;Squadron 42 Episode Two: Behind Enemy Lines&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Episode 3,&amp;rdquo; will launch in 2016 and 2017, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star Citizen,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
