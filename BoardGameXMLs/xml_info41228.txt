			<description>Three Inspectors have come to Chicago, and your gang wants to make sure they don't get any information about the family. The same thought has occurred to your nemesis, and you've both gathered your family and those loyal to you, ready for a fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flickago is a flicking game where each player is trying to keep their gang members in the other gang's turf in order to keep the inspectors -out- of their home turf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's more strategy than just flicking hard, and plenty of decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
