			<description>Variant on Pachisi, with some extra stuff, including partnership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From intro at start of rules:&lt;br/&gt;Ollie, Wally, Carlie and Holly are four contractors desperate for work for their squads.  There's a big contract up for grabs and it goes to the first team on site.  The contract is too big for one squad and so Ollie has tams up with Wally and Carlie has teamed up with Holly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Times are hard and Ollie, Wally, Carlie and Holly will stoop to any kind of underhand skulduggery, obstructing and back stabbing to get the job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
