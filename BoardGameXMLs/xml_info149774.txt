							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heavy Gear Badlands Rally</name>
									
			<description>Rally racing with Gears! This expandable board game features fast paced, full contact racing set on the desert world of Terra Nova. Race around the track, burn rubber to pull ahead, jump over terrain, shoot your opponent if he gets a bit to far ahead, take a swipe at him with your vibro blade or push him in the wall. All this along with spin-outs, skids and rattled pilots bring the exciting world of Gear Rally racing to your table top. Includes a new fast and easy to learn ruleset with lots of rule and game play examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Badlands Rally uses D6 dice to resolve both opposed and unopposed actions. Each model, called a Gear, has a number of Attributes that distinguish its own special characteristics and advantages in the game. Players must choose what combination of attack, special movement or other actions will lead them to victory. Dice mechanics allow for quick resolution of these actions through simple rolls of varying numbers of dice depending on the modifiers that apply. All modifiers either add dice to a roll or subtract them. There are two kinds of roll: A Roll and a Check.  A Roll is an unopposed test which uses a simple comparison of dice to an Attribute for a number of successes.  A Check is an opposed test between players that uses the high dice in a roll and adds a bonus based on the other dice compared to an Attribute. In each lap of a game a Gear may resolve between four and six actions depending on player choices. A standard match is 2-3 laps.  Variable Gear upgrades, Gear choices, and Scenarios allow for an almost infinite variety of game conditions. Additional Gear data cards are provided that allow player to use almost the entire Heavy Gear line of miniatures from Dream Pod 9 to add even more variety to their games. Up to Eight Gears can race at once with two to four players being the norm.&lt;br/&gt; The box set includes rules booklet, full color hex map, 4 easy to assemble racing gear miniatures of the Rally Viper, Rally Pitbull, Rally Jerboa and Rally Ferret cast in pewter with plastic hex bases, 8 double-sided datacards (Rally Viper/Viper II, Rally Pitbull/Pitbull II, Rally Jerboa/Jerboa II, Rally Ferret/Ferret II, Rally Grizzly/Mamba, Rally Cobra/Chasseur MkII, Rally Sapeur/Iguana, and Rally Hunter/Dart Jager), assorted counters (rattled tracker gears, rattled, rally, damage, and upgrades) , 2 double-sided quick reference cards (rules and weapons/upgrades), and 6 dice. The double-sided Rally Grizzly/Mamba, Rally Cobra/Chasseur MkII, Rally Sapeur/Iguana, and Rally Hunter/Dart Jager datacards can also be used to proxy in other similar size gears from the Heavy Gear Blitz and Arena miniature lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
