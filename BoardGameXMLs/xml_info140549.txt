							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquest! Medieval Realms</name>
									
			<description>Conquest! Medieval Realms is a turn-based game that combines the pure strategic gameplay of Chess and the key principles of military strategy in a historical setting.  The objective is to conquer up to 7 opposing AI or human players by defeating their armies and capturing their lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To gain supremacy, players will need to unite their spread out lands, build a roaring economy, and raise powerful armies to divide and conquer their enemies.  Boost your income via markets and mines, upgrade your armies with stables and archery fields, or amass a large force, but sound strategy and careful thought will help you more than brute force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rows of castles and towers can help to stave off attacks while flanking maneuvers around mountains and terrain can surround and destroy foes. Tactics and long term strategy are essential to success as each battle will play out differently across an endless random map generator.  For players looking to create their own tactical teasers, an easy-to-use map editor is also available for the creation of custom scenarios and campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
