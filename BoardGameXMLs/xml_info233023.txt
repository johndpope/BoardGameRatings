							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classes of the Soul</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classes presented in here each tap into the magic energy flowing through their soul and coursing through their veins rather than the arcane magic that is commonly studied and practiced throughout the world. Soul Magic is powerful, yet comes at a hefty cost: a user of Soul Magic is constantly tearing their spirit apart in order to use their powers and thus needs to take extreme care when he is using his spells and abilities due to the limited energy a soul carries within it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three classes that specialize in these abilities, though any spellcaster can learn the art of Soul Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
