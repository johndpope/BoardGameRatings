							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mercy Square</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located within the heart of a devastated city, Mercy Square is an over-populated, rubble walled settlement of urban dwelling, post apocalyptic survivors. Founded by Mayor John Greenburg (Area 4) and Sheriff Logan Bolton (Area 4), this community was based on the aspects of hope, safety, and restoration of civilization. Since the community&amp;rsquo;s humble beginnings of a mere sixty some citizens, the secured urban area now houses over a thousand survivors. Although the buildings within the complex are perfectly capable of providing the needs of shelter for at least another five hundred or more, the overall feeling of this urban safe-hold is that the community is bursting at the seams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In essence, Mercy Square is suffering from something that is a hard found blessing in the ruins of the apocalypse.  That combination of a blessing and a curse is overpopulation. While the community offers the perfect model for the rebirth of civilization as it was once known, the ruins of the surrounding metropolitan city is quickly running dry in regards to needed resources. The community has a constant need for food, fresh water, and gasoline. While the community&amp;rsquo;s scouts, scavengers, and drivers make a constant effort to supply the community&amp;rsquo;s needs in recovered goods, such ventures are starting to fall short of need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
