							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Project: Snowblind</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project: Snowblind is a first-person shooter video game released for the Xbox, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 on February 22, 2005. It was originally conceived as a multiplayer-focused third game in the Deus Ex series, Deus Ex: Clan Wars. But after the less than expected commercial performance of Deus Ex: Invisible War, it was decided to set the game in its own universe.[1] Nevertheless, it remains a spiritual sequel to Deus Ex and retains many visible and conceptual links to its progenitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Project: Snowblind, the player assumes the identity of Nathan Frost, a soldier in an international peacekeeping force known as the Liberty Coalition. After being critically injured during an enemy attack, Frost is implanted with experimental nano-technological augmentations and enhancements, turning him into &amp;quot;the soldier of the future&amp;quot;. Frost must use his new powers to help lead the Coalition to victory against overwhelming odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to the Deus Ex series, the focus of Project: Snowblind's gameplay is giving the player a variety of choices on how to approach any given situation. Although the game is generally linear, most levels feature multiple paths through any given area, allowing players to either rush in guns blazing or attempt to find a more stealthy side-path. Unlike Deus Ex, the game is entirely centered around pure combat, but nonetheless provides the player with multiple options regarding every battle. Every weapon in the game has a secondary fire mode, several of which create exotic effects such as a swarm of drones that will actively seek out and attack enemies. The player can also throw a variety of grenades with different effects, including a riot shield that creates a temporary stationary energy wall for the player to take cover behind. The player can also use a special &amp;quot;Icepick&amp;quot; device to hack enemy cameras, turrets, and robots and use them against enemy forces. The game also features several driveable vehicles. Finally, the player's character possesses a variety of nano-technology augmentations that can be used to grant them various powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
