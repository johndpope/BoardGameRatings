			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega Man II is the second in a series of handheld ports of the successful NES games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is mostly the same as other entries in the franchise.  Players attempt to destroy 8 robot masters, then defeat Dr. Wily himself.  As each boss is destroyed, its special attack is gained for use against future enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version includes 4 bosses from the NES Mega Man 2 and 4 from Mega Man 3.  It continues the tradition in the Gameboy series of giving the player only 4 stages to choose from at the start, followed by an intermediate stage, then the next 4, and finally Dr. Wily's fortress stages.  It is still a slightly scaled-down version, but these are new stage designs, not copies of the NES version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the slide move is incorporated, along with 3 Rush adaptors gained along with weapons when defeating specific bosses.  Like the previous game, a new special boss rival, Quint, has to be overcome during the final stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
