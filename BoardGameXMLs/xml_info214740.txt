							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curious Effects</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pixel Loot - Curious Effects features 30 unique cards, each with a different effect that can be applied to any item. As a dungeon master, you can use Curious Effects on pretty much anything your players find in a dungeon or chest. The effects range from magical to mundane, from magical properties to annoying odors. Some effects are readily apparent, and you can hand the player the card as a reminder of the effect. Some are more subtle, and you might want to keep them a secret until the player discovers it. Many effects will offer up questions or plot hooks that drive your players to explore the world in greater depth. Most importantly, Curious Effects gives you a series of ideas to trigger your own inspiration, keeping your stories fresh and your players engaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
