			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A horizontal shoot em up that has elements of a beat em up, RPG, and rougelike. You are able to shoot, use spells, and perform close range attacks that can be made into combos. There are three characters, each one getting a unique combo and spell, and each starting on a different stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Playstation and Saturn versions of the game included a new mode that had you go through a 17 floor dungeons gaining experience from defeating enemies and finding new items along the way. If you die you taken all the way back to the start, you lose your level and your increased stats are cut in half but you keep any items that you have gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Playstation version of the game was not fully translated, removed scenes, what was translated was poorly done, and it removed the ability to save the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A PS2 version was released in Europe that left the scenes intact but removed the 17 floor dungeon mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
