			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you know my daddy died somewhere near here in 45? Raced the Soviets to Berlin and lost. And now we&amp;rsquo;re in this mess. I just don&amp;rsquo;t know what he would have thought of all this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Russians damn well know everything about that idol and what it means, but they&amp;rsquo;re refusing to cooperate with even the most basic back-channel sharing. Figure they want us kept busy finding it while they do God knows what. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What we do know is that in &amp;lsquo;67 they grabbed some K1 guy and put him in Hohensch&amp;ouml;nhausen for running his mouth during the protest against the Shah. A lot more came to Berlin that year than just the Shah, and that guy knew all about it, or so he claimed at the time. So we&amp;rsquo;re going to need to get him out. We have assets in the prison, but they&amp;rsquo;re not reliable, and there&amp;rsquo;ll be no new resources made available until Hersh is dealt with. And that&amp;rsquo;s where you come in...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our American Cousins details the various intelligence services of the United States and their actions both at home and abroad. The 1970s were a tumultuous time for the US, filled with proxy wars, foreign revolutions and terrorism. The last days of the Vietnam War, the rise in domestic extremism, covert operations in trouble spots around the globe and increased scrutiny from Congress made this a tense and dangerous time for the American intelligence community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Section 46 and its agents, there was another front to this already labyrinthine war: Our American Cousins provides information about Mythos threats within the borders of the USA and in areas of strategic interest to the American government around the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our American Cousins includes sections on:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creating American Investigators&lt;br/&gt;     Adapting other World War Cthulhu scenarios for American Investigators&lt;br/&gt;     American intelligence agencies in the 1970s&lt;br/&gt;     Domestic briefings and missions&lt;br/&gt;     Foreign intelligence theatres from an American Perspective&lt;br/&gt;     A series of inspirational 1970s vignettes with characters, plot hooks and setting info&lt;br/&gt;     Mythos threats and Fortean events in 1970s America&lt;br/&gt;     A complete adventure for American agents in Cold War Europe, &amp;ldquo;Brocken Spectre&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     An appendix of useful NPCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
