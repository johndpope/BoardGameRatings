							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Girlfriends&#039; Intuition</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of Girlfriends&amp;rsquo; Intuition was inspired by the fact that women love to get together to relax,  play games, chat about what is going on in their lives, and share their past experiences. The search for a truly fun game to play at such gatherings was unsuccessful and the creation of Girlfriends&amp;rsquo; Intuition began....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Girlfriends&amp;rsquo; Intuition is a question and answer game that is played on a casual but mildly competitive basis.  It is designed to spark conversation and learn fun facts about the women in the group.  The questions and responses will definitely stress your laughing muscles and everyone will have a fabulous time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play The Game. . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Girlfriends&amp;rsquo; Intuition is designed for team play - two players to a team.  Use your intuition to correctly guess the answers that your teammate or opponents have given to hilarious, intimate, and everyday questions that are drawn from two decks of question cards.  The Girls Just Wanna Know questions will have you rolling on the floor with laughter, as will the Whisper Bonus questions, but shhh.....we can&amp;rsquo;t tell you what they are about!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
