							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Expulsion: Jewish Life in Spain from the Golden Age to 1492</name>
									
			<description>With each roll of the dice, move your piece through spaces outlining the major Jewish events in medieval Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pull Explusion or Daily Life cards, as directed by the space you land on. These cards might cause you to be reincarnated (Gilgul space) as a different historical person (Nefesh/Soul cards) or put you in danger of excommunication (Herem space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, those cards might also earn you tokens for: Torah (learning), Avodah (service), Gemilut Hasadim (showing kindness), and Emunah (faithfulness).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have collected 18 tokens (the same number as the Hebrew word for life), go to the 7th Heaven (Aravot) and pick a judgement (Din) card. Sometimes the King of Demons has tricked you into a lower heaven. But often your deeds are judged as Holy...and you WIN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
