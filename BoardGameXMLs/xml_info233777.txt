							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Samurai Dice</name>
									
			<description>A fast-paced, easy-to-learn but strategic game of honor and vengeance. Samurai Dice lets you play as heroic bushi, charismatic courtiers, wise ascetics and stealthy ninja.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab your four Hero character cards, one for each of the four elements of Earth, Fire, Water and Wind, line them up against the Enemy cards and get rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nominate one Hero to attack one Enemy, and roll the five dice. Three dice are white, one is blue and one is red. The Blue Die represents your hero; each White Die that rolls below or equal to the Blue Die does one damage to the Enemy. The White Dice that roll above the Blue Die do damage to your hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Red Die rolls over the Blue Die then the Enemy you're attacking gets to activate their ability. This can be anything from an energy shield that protects the Enemy to a devastating counterattack or more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you defeat an Enemy the Hero that you used gets to level up and heal, get stronger or gain powerful loot. Each Hero has two abilities that they can use to increase the chances of success. The only thing is that you have to choose which ability you want to activate, and you can only activate it once per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to take out all of the Enemies before your opponent takes out all of theirs. You can play solo, too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
