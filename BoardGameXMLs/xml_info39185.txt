			<description>Capitalist Canasta is a game that simulates big business with mechanics from canasta thrown in. You build canasta-like melds from your hand at a cost and hold on to them for as long as you can to make a profit. Other players can steal your melds. Payoff for melds is determined by a chart included in the magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game is featured in the December, 2008 issue of GAMES magazine on page 88 and is part of the series &amp;quot;new card games according to Doyle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
