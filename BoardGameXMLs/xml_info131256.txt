							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gnomes of Hawthorn Hall</name>
									
			<description>The hardworking gnomes at Hawthorn Hall have decided to plant a lovely new garden, but they only have three days to do it! Lead your team of gnomes in planting new beds of roses, laying new lawns, digging new ponds, and planting five new hawthorn trees. On the third day, when the last tree is planted, the gnomes will be will able to rest, but only the most successful gardener will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gnomes of Hawthorn Hall is a family tile-laying game in which the players compete to build and claim new areas of roses, lawns and ponds. In each turn players can play cards to claim a tile, add it to the layout to grow the garden, and then optionally play another card to move one of their gnomes onto the tile to claim an area. The novel card play combines with simple tile-laying rules to create a fast, colourful game that looks polite &amp;mdash; but can often be anything but!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, players score points for all the garden areas that contain their gnomes. The rose-beds are worth 1 points per plot; the ponds 2 points; lawns are worth a number points equal to their width multiplied by their height. In addition the five hawthorn tress add 1 bonus point to each adjacent garden area. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
