			<description>The latest game in the award-winning Avernum series. Travel into the strange underworld of Avernum, a land full of misfits, bandits, and barely civilized monsters. Hunt the villain who tried to kill your Empress, and keep him from assassinating you first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you wander the gigantic world of Avernum, you will experience:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-An enormous world. Hundreds of quests, dozens of dungeons and enemy fortresses, and multitudes of characters.&lt;br/&gt;-Epic storyline. Hunt the assassin Dorikas, while his agents try to trick and waylay you at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;-Many unique encounters. Not just mindless hack and slash. Many unusual enemies that will require clever tactics to defeat.&lt;br/&gt;-Rich game system with over 50 spells and battle disciplines, many character building options, and powerful secret skills to unlock.&lt;br/&gt;-Unique game world. Not just the same old elves and hobbits.&lt;br/&gt;-Experience with previous Avernum games is completely unnecessary to enjoy Avernum 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
