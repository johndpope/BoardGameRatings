			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCAA GameBreaker 2004 is the seventh and final installment of the PlayStation/PlayStation 2 exclusive college football series from 989 Studios.  Like almost every other 989 Sports franchise, NCAA GameBreaker was discontinued after the 2003-2004 sports season due to lukewarm reviews and poor sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCAA GameBreaker 2004 was different from its predecessors in that it featured 25 statistical categories tracking the leaders in various aspects of the game of football.  Also new were 50 new mascots and cheerleaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
