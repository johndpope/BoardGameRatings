			<description>Two friends are riding their horses to a tree and back, trying to collect berries on the way. Essentially, this is a roll and move game for young kids. However, the player first place a hidden bet on the winner, and they can move either of the two riders as far as their die roll commands. When a rider reaches the farm again, anyone who had placed the right bet receives points; additional points are gained through picking up berries. The player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
