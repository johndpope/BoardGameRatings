			<description>The premise behind the game is matching one boxer and his Action Cards versus the other boxer and his Action Cards. Within each round of boxing each player will FLIP over 8 cards, one at a time, at the same time. Upon flipping each card both players should state the boxing move and the point total out loud. The higher number indicates which boxer wins the exchange. Each time a boxer wins an Exchange he gets closer to gaining a knockdown and closer to winning the round. To signify the winner of an exchange, advance the pawn one notch along the championship belt towards your opponent's KO area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
