							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Galactic Frontier</name>
									
			<description>From the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2382 and the Milky Way Galaxy is teeming with life.  The petty intra-planetary squabbles of the last millennium have given way to the hustle and bustle of interstellar commerce and entrepreneurship.  Can you compete in the 24th Century?  Play Galactic Frontier and see if you have what it takes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players select unique races (variable player powers) and set out to be the most successful entrepreneurs in the Milky Way.  Players use influence markers to stake claim to resources and to keep their opponents at bay.  By carefully managing their research efforts in 8 unique fields, players gain access to more advanced technology.  The player who earns the most victory points by delivering rare minerals, advancing up the technology ladders, and avoiding the pesky space pirates will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
