							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unicorns &amp; Zombies</name>
									
			<description>In the bleak, war-torn landscape of the not-too-distant future, a battle rages on. On one side, an army of the undead: former friends and family members who have succumbed to the zombie virus &amp;mdash; decaying flesh and an insatiable appetite for destruction are all that remain. On the other side, a magic squad of unicorns: pixie dust and rainbow farts, their mythical horns as deadly as their enchanting glare. Which side will you fight for? Which will fight against you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unicorns &amp;amp; Zombies is a turn-based card game for 2-4 players which pits &amp;mdash; you guessed it &amp;mdash;unicorns against zombies. Players draw a trio of cards &amp;mdash; weapons, gear, or action &amp;mdash; and equip their fighter in the hopes of taking out the opposing teammate(s). Some cards can make your fighter nearly invincible. Others can make you want to flip the table over and rage-quit. You won&amp;rsquo;t though, because winning is more important than keeping friends. In groups of 3 or more, the fighter you pull is completely random, so your love of unicorns could be totally useless when you&amp;rsquo;re forced to fight as a zombie. And sometimes, you&amp;rsquo;re the only fighter of your kind on the table, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be strategic AF to win the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
