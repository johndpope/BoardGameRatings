							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Golden Sentinel</name>
									
			<description>The Golden Sentinels are the bodyguards of the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s clan, guarding the family on their travels, in their homes and in court. They also serve as escorts to his Teishin as they journey his Empire spreading his holy word. If the Teishin of the Imperial court are the Emperors voice in distant more barbaric lands, then the Golden Sentinels serve as his shield, all proven warriors, sworn to protect their charges with their lives if needed. However, such is the size of the Golden Empire that Imperial missions and postings can often take many seasons to complete not taking into account the travel across the great empire and so often the Sentinels can sometimes take on the local customs and in rare circumstances become embroiled in the affairs of locals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one miniature, one 30mm base and three full colour profile cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
