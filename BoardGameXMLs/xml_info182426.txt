			<description>A game requiring a sharp eye and a quick hand !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where you need to be the first to find the card with all of the elements appearing on the dice. Be careful and be quick because although the cards may look alike, they're all different! Keep your eyes open, and beware of the traps !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, the dice are rolled, and players search for a card that has all the elements that are on the rolled dice. The first player that finds the correct card may advance his score marker. When a player reaches the last space on the score track, he wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
