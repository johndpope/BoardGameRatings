			<description>Did it ever happen to you that you stopped speaking in mid-sentence, because you could not remember what exactly you wanted to say? The same might happen to you quite often in SENTENCEd to speed! It is plain simple to start talking, as you will know the beginning of the phrase, and you will also know what to explain &amp;ndash; but you're absolutely left to your own devices to connect these two goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In SENTENCEd to speed! each of two teams has one minute to guess as many items as possible. One player of the team is the source, who has to complete the first half of a    phrase in a logical way to explain a given item. The more items the source explains which are guessed correctly by his or her team members, the more points are scored. The team with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
