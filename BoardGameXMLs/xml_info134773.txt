							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Put Things Right</name>
									
			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Put Things Right is not a traditional roleplaying game, but rather a playable story. It is a story about mistakes of the past, and the last chance to make them right. It is a story about future, about and most of all, a story about love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by two to four players. One player takes the role of the Doctor, a young man who has been given the opportunity to change what is about to happen. The rest of the players are called Fates, and their responsibility is to handle the mechanical parts of the story, maintain secrecy and act as directors, cutting scenes and starting new ones as the game requires. The Fates also control the three other main characters of the story: Hope, Mimic and Coyote. As with Doctor, these names are just placeholder names, and the players are encouraged to change the names to fit their setting better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
