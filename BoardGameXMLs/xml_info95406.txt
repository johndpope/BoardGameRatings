							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghostbusters II</name>
									
			<description>All home computer editions were published by Activision. Each home computer game edition of the game is essentially similar, with changes in the quality of graphics and sound. The PC version is the most different one, having been developed by a different company, Dynamix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features several arcade sequences based on the film: Van Horne: the player controls Ray Stantz as he is lowered into an air shaft of the disused Van Horne subway system to collect a sample of slime. He is armed with his proton pack and other weaponry with which to defend himself against the myriad of ghosts that attack: some will collide or grab him and cause damage, while others will attempt to cut his rope. The player must collect the three segments of the slime scoop, as well as ammo and health, during the descent. Journey to the Museum: the Statue of Liberty has been brought to life by &amp;quot;mood slime&amp;quot; and is marching toward the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the player controls a floating fireball (generated from the Statue's torch) which fires horizontal shots and must be used to protect the Statue from swarms of ghosts. Impacts from ghosts (or regeneration of the fireball) uses up precious slime, though it can be replenished from destroyed ghosts. Showdown in the Museum: the player controls the four Ghostbusters individually, armed variously with proton packs and slime dispensers, in an isometric 3D level. The four heroes must rappel into the Museum and fight Janosz, Vigo the Carpathian, and finally a possessed Ray, in order to save the world. Some versions also feature a sequence based on the courtroom fight against the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;List of Ghostbusters video games&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game box back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're back! - and the bustin' business is bigger than ever. Take on a pack of paranormal pests, as you go underground to sample the slime in Van Horne Station. Boo-galoo down Broadway with the Statue of Liberty. And go up against Vigo at the Museum of Art, to save the soul of New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bustin' makes you feel good. With proton-Pack'd arcade-style action.. devilish strategy challenges... and gret laughs. Ghostbusters II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
