			<description>A Ludo style roll the dice and move game, with 3 different variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take Off&lt;br/&gt;Each player has four planes, 1 at the airfield and 3 in the terminal. Roll the dice and move your plane from the airfield or along the flight path, if you land on another plane they go back to the nearest empty space. Rolling a six allows you to bring a plane from your terminal to the airfield and gives you another go. When one of your planes reaches 32,000ft (this does not have to be an exact throw) you remove it to your '32' spaces next to your terminal. The first to get all four planes to 32,000ft is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land&lt;br/&gt;Play works as above, but you start at 32,000ft and work your way down to the airfield, landing has to be an exact throw or you overshoot the runway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take Off &amp;amp; Land&lt;br/&gt;Choose which players are going to 'Take Off' and which players are going to 'Land' and place planes accordingly. Enter the flight path either way by the amount you throw with the dice. If you settle into airspace that is occupied by another player then your opponents plane must leave the flight path altogether and return to its starting position.&lt;br/&gt;Roll a six to get another plane on the flight path, after rolling a six place the plane six airspaces in. You do not need to throw the exact number when finishing. Then put your plane either at 23,000ft or in your terminal and airfield depending on whether you were Taking Off or Landing. The first person to successfully complete their flight with all their aircraft is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
