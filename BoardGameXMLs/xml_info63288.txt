							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stalker Jack</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Headlamp of Doom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend speaks of a grotesque, monstrous miner stalking the frozen wastes of Alaska, seeking the precious gold which slowly drove him insane. Most people just chuckle and shake their heads. But when the grand opening of the mining museum in White Landing, Alaska is crashed by a hulking figure in a glowing headlamp, folks quickly change their tune. As the bodies start to pile up and fear settles in upon the small, remote hunting town, the truth becomes unavoidable - Stalker Jack is back, and he's after something. If the characters can't unravel the mystery of the Caribou Mining Company, the strange yellow powder and the rapidly expiring mine heirs, they'll wish for more than just a pocket handwarmer and a hot chocolate. This &amp;quot;legend&amp;quot; has a pick-axe to grind and he won't rest until he's done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stalker Jack is a complete adventure for Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible RPG, a horror comedy game of ridiculous proportions. This 34pg supplement is packed with everything you need to play, including Bad Guys, Cast, backstory, artwork, maps, Plot Pushers and enough Sequel Suggestions and Plot Twists to turn it into five adventures instead of one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
