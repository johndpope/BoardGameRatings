							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The CORE Codex</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Codex contains a set of rules and guidelines called the Character Oriented Role-playing Engine (C.O.R.E). The bulk of the rules have been curated from almost twenty years of role-playing experience and built around a d20 System base. Over the last few years these rules have been modified, prodded, twisted, kept in a vat for genetic experimentation and finally boiled in a magical cauldron to be delivered to you the reader. The Core rules is an &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo; intended to power any kind of role-playing game (&amp;lsquo;RPG&amp;rsquo;). While the system is written as a balanced set of rules, they should be viewed more as a set of building blocks and guidelines allowing players to create their own role-playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
