			<description>Box Text&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plunge into a medieval word where the battle between Order and Chaos has wreaked havoc on the inhabitants. Using magic, might, and cunning, guide the brothers Julian, Kevin and Phillip through Wildevarr to eliminate your opponents and find the keys that will restore peace to the broken land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Box Flap Photo captions:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each land lies a key to winning the great battle between Sariloth and Thorolis. First, however, the brothers must get past the fierce guards....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woe to the brothers if they are not prepared when they reach the Halls of the Dead. They must buy, loot, or find the best armor and magical weapons if they are to stand a chance against the lord of the underworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The brothers' destiny is not clear. The choices they make may not reconcile Order and Chaos, but instead lead to a hellish world where all will suffer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The minions of Chaos are plentiful, especially in the frozen wastelands of Mons. The brothers best be prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Back cover photo captions:]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In true RPG style, control the brothers' destiny as you build-up strengths, upgrade armor, and train in fighting, weapons, and magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each brother has different talents; it is up to you to discover and leverage their strengths and abilities as they battle over 70 different abominations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast Over 80 Magic Spells! Magic plays an important role in this adventure, but the most powerful spells cannot be immediately cast. Locate magic scrolls and build up the brothers' mana reserves in order to defeat evil sorcerers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With beautiful 3D modeled characters and gorgeously detailed landscapes, Halls of the Dead boasts over 60 hours of gameplay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
