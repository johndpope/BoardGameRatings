			<description>Out of this world is a wargame where 6 different races battle it out on an uncharted planet to gather the necessary resources to be able to get back home. The board is realm based and not squared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of their turn, players place action cards hidden from their adversaries. Each action is then shown simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;Actions range from: Invading, Scouting, Gathering (resources), Portal (to open a new entry point on the board), Learning (magic cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat are diceless, where tactics rely on unit placement and spell cards used by mages. Tactic cards can be used for combat where each different unit in your army gets a kill on the other army. Combats are ruthless and can sometime have no winners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
