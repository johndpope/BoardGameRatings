			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love - defined as the fantasy about true love - is impossible. It is giving something you don&amp;rsquo;t possess, an absence in yourself. If you try to force love into existence, you end up destroying the thing you wanted to enrich. Your gift is something the other does not want, something that is not lacking in yourself. Something which cannot exist is being forced upon the world. Such an act is fundamentalism at its purest. Let the World Burn is a story about what happens when fundamentalists burning with the fire of love refuse to accept the impossible nature of love, while the world crumbles around them. It is a game that emphasizes the experience of love and destruction and focuses on the interaction between the characters within a lingering, poetic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters in the game are abstract concepts personified for play; the setting also is deliberately abstract.  Play is intended to proceed rapidly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The English-language version is provided as a single PDF document.  The Danish-language version is provided as a ZIP archive containing six separate PDF documents.  Aside from formatting and language, however, the games are identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
