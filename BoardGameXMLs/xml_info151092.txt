							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shinobi</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A covert agent or mercenary who specializes in commando-style operations, a shinobi is a professional spy, thief, saboteur, and assassin. Using a variety of unconventional weapons and her rigorous training in Ninjutsu, a shinobi can handle a large variety of tasks capably. While the shinobi and their techniques began among peasants forming a covert resistance to the oppressive warrior caste, in time those same skills were soon available for hire to the very same warlords. Demand for the covert operatives&amp;rsquo; services grew, with the peasants using the wealth acquired to build their own family clans to pass on their secretive training and work together on larger missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is impossible to say how many shinobi there are - a common saying is that &amp;ldquo;the best shinobi is the one that you never knew was even there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: Even among a group of fellow adventurers, a shinobi will tend to be secretive and will stay close to her cover identity as often as possible. She may even tend to act in more of a supporting capacity unless forced to direct action. Those who come to earn a shinobi&amp;rsquo;s trust, however, will rarely find a more formidable ally. By the same token, those who betray her will rarely see a more deadly enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 20-level base class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
