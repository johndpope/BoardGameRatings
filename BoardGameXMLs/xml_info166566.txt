							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asterix Mission Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a regular deck of cards but on each card also has 4 symbols on it with values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One card is put face down in the middle of the table.&lt;br/&gt;The rest of the cards are dealed.&lt;br/&gt;Cards are put face down in front of each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player chooses one symbol category from his top card. The other players also play their top card. The person with the highest value in the chosen category wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;Cards won are put on the bottom of your pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you win a Asterix, Obelix or Idifix card you can use the special red looking glass card to look at the hidden code on the back of the card in the middle of the table. Finding the card with those exact symbol values among the Asterix Obelix and Idefix cards  is the mission. When you win that card in a round or find it on your turn on your pile you have won a mission.&lt;br/&gt;The found mission card will have the new mission on it's back.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete 2 missions is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another variant that comes with the game is just play until you won all cards and not bother about the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
