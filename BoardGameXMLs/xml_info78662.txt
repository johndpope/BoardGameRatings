			<description>Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad (お姉チャンバラvorteX ~忌血を継ぐ者たち~ Oneechanbara VorteX ~The Descendants of The Cursed Blood~) is a horror themed hack and slash video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control Aya, Saki and Anna as they cut and shoot through waves of undead enemies, in either single-player or cooperative multi-player mode. In single-player mode the characters can be switched during play. The game features alternative modes of play; free play, quest and survival, as well as a dress-up option which allows players to alter the player characters' clothes. As the player defeats enemies two on-screen meters begin to fill. The first indicates the current character's splatter gauge, which increases as the character is covered in blood. Once filled, the character automatically goes into rampage mode, dealing more damage but also taking more damage from enemies whilst gradually and constantly losing health. The second indicates how much gore is on her weapon, uncleaned swords become dulled, and if the meter is filled the character's weapon will begin to lodge in enemies, forcing the player to manually remove it in order to continue fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
