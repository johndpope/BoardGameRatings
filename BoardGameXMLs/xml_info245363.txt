			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In gardens and allotments across the land, the humble garden shed stands. Typically made of quite thin wood, and often protected by nothing stronger than a cheap padlock, these buildings contain a whole host of improvised weapons and lethal chemicals useful following a zombie apocalypse. Or at many other times, for that matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list has 100 items, with some variations, that could be found in the typical wooden, or otherwise, shed; or, for that matter, in other outbuildings, tool stores and garages. Some are useful, some are not, and many are dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example results are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;45. Lawnraker (Manual, electric or petrol/gasoline lawnraker, or scarifier, for removing moss from a lawn)&lt;br/&gt;46. Leaf Blower (Electric, or petrol/gasoline, powered leaf blower)&lt;br/&gt;47. Log Splitter (Manual, or powered, device for splitting small logs)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
