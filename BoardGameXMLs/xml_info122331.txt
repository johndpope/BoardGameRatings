			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action game in which the player controls a bulldozer ship. The goal is to destroy enemy fighters and motherships by ramming them while dodging fire. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Across the immeasurable void of space, an incredible fleet approaches the peaceful island planet of New Stratford. Just a speck on the civil radar system, a simple spacedozer ship was sent to survey the conundrum. With horror, the pilot of the asteroid demolition craft saw the radar speck become a huge invasion fleet. Then like a storm of meteors they were on him. Android fighters peppering his collision armour with a shower of missiles. Automatically he ploughed into them, crushing their super-structures like insect's thin shells. He cried out in fury and plummeted into a mothership, which ruptured into a blaze of dazzling plasma. &amp;quot;Death or Glory&amp;quot; he screamed triumphantly as his craft tore into the fleet.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
