							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vimana</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bhima flew with his Vimana on an enormous ray which was as brilliant as the sun and made a noise like a storm of thunder.&amp;quot; - The Veda Texts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Sanskrit documents tell of mysterious, advanced vehicles called Vimanas that seem remarkably similar to modern aircraft and UFOs. According to the archaic Veda texts, Vimanas possessed &amp;quot;all the power of the universe&amp;quot; and could fly to other planets. They were armed with powerful weapons and they could become invisible at the will of the pilot. Surprisingly, the Hindu scholars wrote extensively about how to construct and pilot a Vimana, including details on the machine's mercury engine, effective combat maneuvers, and how to survive a crash-landing. Hundreds of pages of information about these machines can also be found in many writings from other ancient cultures as well, providing an astounding amount of information on Vimanas. Unfortunately, many of the raw materials necessary to build one of these fantastic machines have been lost in translation... until now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read about how characters in your game can hunt down the clues to these ancient machines, decipher the instructions, find the rare materials, and actually build one of their own--before the Nazis do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, if your heroes are not mechanically inclined, it is also possible to find one of these ancient war machines already constructed. There might be one hidden somewhere in Egypt, protected by Atlantian curses and a dungeon full of deadly traps. There might also be some Vimanas in Tibet. Unless they've already been stolen by Nagas who are planning to sell them to the Nazis!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     5 Photos of Vimanas&lt;br/&gt;     d20 stats for 4 different Vimanas&lt;br/&gt;     d20 stats for 3 different death rays&lt;br/&gt;     How to fly a Vimana&lt;br/&gt;     How to build a Vimana&lt;br/&gt;     Where to find a Vimana&lt;br/&gt;     Secret history of the Vimanas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
