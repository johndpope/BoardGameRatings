							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Hiking We Will Go!</name>
									
			<description>A Team Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today is July 10, 1610 ZR. That means Zambaric Reckoning. Your adventuring party has been on the Zambar-Maploc trail for three days now. Three days ago the Midsummer Festival ended and your party started to walk home. This is the sixteenth annual hike back to Maploc, where your homes are. The tradition of hiking back from Zambar at this time happened by accident. The first time you hiked you had no other way home. Each of the past trips has been peaceful.  During the past fifteen trips nothing ever attacked your party. In fact, none of you have had to draw a weapon on any of these trips. The trip this time has been peaceful and relaxing. It is about 10:00 a.m. The sun is shining. It is about eighty-five degrees and dry outside. It is a beautiful day. Your party has been hiking at a steady pace for two hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
