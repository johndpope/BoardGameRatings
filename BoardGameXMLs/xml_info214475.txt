			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The game that sends the message with the mail&amp;quot;, this roll-and-move affair was produced as a propaganda vehicle by the American Postal Workers Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move wooden mailbox-shaped pieces along a track from their home to the post office, and each space is marked with a message such as &amp;quot;Postal Workers Call for Legislation to Save the Postal Service (An extra throw for a good idea.)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, players also land on mailbox spaces, where they read a card from a deck of letters. Example: &amp;quot;Dear Mr. Sucquor, We found your package in Poughkeepsie. Should be here in a couple of weeks! Fly-By-Night Private Delivery Inc. (Go back 1 space to learn your lesson).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
