			<description>Horsin' Around is a children's game of dexterity from the 1960s.  Horse tokens are placed on a carousel which is spun around.  Pressing a button launches one of the tokens in the air and players attempt to catch it.  There are three tokens in each of four colours and a 13th black horse.  If a player catches a coloured horse they keep it but if a player catches the black horse they are allowed to steal a token from another player.  If a player collects all three horses of a colour these cannot be stolen.  The black horse is not kept but is replaced on the carousel.  When all the coloured horses have been won and the black horse is the only one remaining, the game is over and the player with the most horses wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: &amp;quot;Spin &amp;amp; win - how many horses can you catch?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
