							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Battles: Pantheon â€“ Judges of the Underworld</name>
									
			<description>The Hell Judges box is the models of the 3 Judges, plus all the dashboards and cards you need to play them. But who are these Judges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Hades left the Underworld to fight alongside his fellow Gods, he left his wife, Persephone, in charge. She, in turn, enlisted the aid of Aeacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus, who had all been famous lawgivers in life. They would help her to decide the correct treatment for each soul. That, at least, was the plan, and it worked for a while. Unfortunately the gates of the Underworld were open, and the dead began to escape back up to the realm of the living. Eventually the Judges followed suit, and now fight alongside the Gods, among the ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
