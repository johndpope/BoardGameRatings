							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jungle Speed: Ã‰dition Luxe</name>
									
			<description>A deluxe edition in a wooden box containing the base game, the expansion (L'Extension) and some previously unreleased cards (extension &amp;quot;Expert&amp;quot;, also included in the &amp;quot;la Totale / deluxe&amp;quot; edition). Only 3000 boxes of this limited edition were released, each contains a certificate of authenticity signed by both authors. It seems that this version was only released in France in december 2005. According to the French wikipedia page it was sold out in a month (no source cited). However some boxes were given as tournament prizes during the parisian GenCon in May 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
