			<description>Theme: FAME BY FRAME is a board game tucked in by the very veil of the seventh art, in which the players enjoy both the comfort and the privileges of being in the director's chair. Hiding behind pseudonyms inspired by the finest names of the director branch, their goal is to make the best movie possible, overshadowing the competition and ensuring their place on the boulevard of the famous. In their quest for forming the best movie crew possible, they are assisted by a group of agents which, using their own unique ways, collect actors and introduce their employer with various cinematic equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: Every player has the same goal, which is having the most valuable movie crew at the end of the 5th round. The team's value is measured through calculation of the points noted on both actor and cinematic equipment cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play: Players use their agents cards, with different values,in order to get best actors and equipments for their movies. Actor and equipment cards have victory points value which is used to determine winner of the game and special traits which can be used to help your agent to get even more actors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
