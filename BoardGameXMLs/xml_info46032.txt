			<description>What Is Minimus?&lt;br/&gt;Minimus is a game of interactive storytelling(sometimes called a roleplaying game) that relies on a player known as a game master to&lt;br/&gt;adjudicate some disputes, and players, who take on fictional personalities called characters. All the rules for making characters are on this page; all the rules for playing the game are on the next page.&lt;br/&gt;The game master, with input from the players, sets the theme of the game (star spanning traders, Vikings, the fall of Rome...nearly anything can be a theme). The game master uses the goals and relationships of characters to structure sequences of events called plots.&lt;br/&gt;Minimus rewards describing actions, both successes and failures, and incorporating details into your description. Minimus uses a deck of playing cards for task sequencing, and 20 sided dice (called d20s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimus Core rules are only two pages long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
