			<description>This undated but mid-20th century Canadian game uses a regular deck of cards and poker chips as playing pieces. It has French and English instructions printed on the inside of the box lid. The board is a large fabric mat, 30&amp;quot; square, with a big circle and the game name in the center. Each side has a space for one playing card and a series of circles numbered 1 through 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the dealer deals one card face up to each player. The player then uses chips to cover up any combination of circles that add up to the value of the card (1 for Ace through 13 for King).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rounds continue until one player manages to cover all nine of his circles. Any player unable to cover circles equal to his card must put a chip in the pot. When the Joker turns up, the dealer reshuffles the full deck and starts a new turn beginning with the player dealt the Joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to cover all nine circles wins the pot. In addition, each other player must pay him the value of their remaining uncovered circles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
