							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jackpot</name>
									
			<description>A pick-6 lottery game in boardgame form. Players choose ten of 49 Lotto numbers at the start of the game. They have the opportunity to purchase more numbers as they land on the numbered spaces of the game board, which also correspond to several mini-games and the opportunity to win or lose money. Players try to purchase possessions with their winnings, for the object is to have the highest total value in possessions at the end of the game. (Cash does not count.) The game ends when a player matches all six Lotto numbers drawn, plus a Super Number consisting of two rolls of a special die. That player wins the Jackpot and may then spend his winnings on as many possessions as he likes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 10 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
