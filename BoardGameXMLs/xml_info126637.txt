			<description>This game is a game with the motif of the boy liar Grimm's Fairy Tales. The aim is to shout a lie well, and to eliminate the other sheep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a player parent, shouted, &amp;quot;Wolf!&amp;quot; (This cry is referred to as the &amp;quot;Boys Shout!&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The parent player, chooses which card to place on the table. Select whether you want a lie and cry, or really call a wolf. Both the wolf and the lie cards have the same back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the other players must decide whether the wolf really came. Villagers must choose whether they think the wolf-call is a lie, or if they will take up arms to fight off the wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the wolf is called, and the villagers have chosen correctly, the calling player will lose sheep.  If the lie, and choose the villagers get angry, you will lose as opposed to sheep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
