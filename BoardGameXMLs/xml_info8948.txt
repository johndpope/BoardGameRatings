							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beachhead Invasion Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a single 3/16 inch thick slab of dense cardboard with a Spinner included.  It is 11 inches by 17 inches overall with the Instructions printed on one side, and 7-steps equal to about 2 paragraphs, very concise.&lt;br/&gt;  On the reverse side is the playing AREA, which is a rendering of a &amp;quot;Beachhead&amp;quot;, on the left side of the Board, which also includes the spinner, and 9 &amp;quot;Invasion&amp;quot; Lanes of varying colors and length, leading from the &amp;quot;Beachhead&amp;quot; to the right side of the board.  The length of the Lanes varies from 4, 5, &amp;amp; 6 then jumps up to 11, 12, 13, 14, &amp;amp; 15. The colors of the Lanes are RED 2-4 spaces, Lt. GRAY 1-5 spaces, YELLOW 2-6 &amp;amp; 12 spaces, VIOLET 1-13 spaces, TAN 1-14 spaces, and GREEN 2-11 &amp;amp; 15 spaces.   &lt;br/&gt;  The playing pieces consist of 9 printed cardboard cut-out LANDING craft and 3 WARSHIPS, all of which can be placed within the GAME board for storage.  The SPINNER has numbers and a RETREAT 2 PLACES section and the DEFENDER always spins it.  To begin the game, place all 9 Landing Craft at the high number end of each Invasion Lane.  Then the Defending player spins the Spinner and if a number is spun/picked, then any Landing Craft on that same number is &amp;quot;SUNK&amp;quot;/removed, otherwise the Landing Craft are advanced one space after each spin.  There are 3 &amp;quot;Special&amp;quot; numbers which when spun will &amp;quot;SINK&amp;quot;/remove the Warships and if ALL of them are &amp;quot;SUNK&amp;quot; then the Defender gets to spin TWICE each time.  The OBJECT of the game is for the Defender to sink 5-LC or the Invader to LAND 5-LC.  NO designer/developer credits or DATE on the GAME but a number-#950-50 &amp;amp; Made in U.S.A. are printed below the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
