			<description>A party game where players use combinations of cards to create headlines along certain topics as demanded by The Editor. Each round sees a new Editor ask for a headline based on a certain subject which can be decided upon either at random or by flipping one of the included Topic cards. By using Actions, Descriptions and Things cards, players submit a headline to the editor and hope it will catch their interest. The Editor then chooses two headlines and asks the players to summarise the stories behind them. The Editor then chooses their favourite of the two and the headline is added to a Running Order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Running Order acts as a scoreboard of sorts. Players will recieve points for each card they use in their headlines but also get bonuses for the positions the stories end up in at the end of the game. Every time a new headline is added to the Running Order, the Editor for that turn decides where it will be placed, bumping all other stories lower than it further down the order. If there are more than ten stories, the lowest ranked one is removed from the game scoring that player no points. At the end of the game, the lead story recieves a bonus 10 points, the second 9, the third 8, etc., all the way down to 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
