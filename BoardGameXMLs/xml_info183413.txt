			<description>Fight to awaken from the maze that is your consciousness as you battle against your darkest fears.&lt;br/&gt;But, beware, there is always a player trying to stop you! Yes, The Sandman will manipulate traps, conjure fears and even shifts the maze itself to confuse, deter and eventually kill you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose from 4 Wanderers, each with a special ability, and embark on this dream-bending adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One will wake or all will die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays as The Sandman. They initially set up the layout of the maze, choose player spawn points, chest locations and where the Mind Fragments are. Throughout the game the player draws cards to spawn monsters, set traps and even re-arrange the maze itself. This player also controls any monsters in the maze and can attack the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each other player is a Wanderer. They must move around the maze, controlled by The Sandman to collect chests and Mind Fragments. The loot from chests, or from killing the other Wanderers, is used to strengthen the player, such that they can collect all four mind fragments for themselves and win. If all Wanderers die in the maze, The Sandman wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
