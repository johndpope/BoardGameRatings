							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piet Piraat: Piratengevaar</name>
									
			<description>Pirate danger is a running and gathering game.&lt;br/&gt;The players each leave in a corner and try to reach the central island as many times as possible. They charge one gold coin each time they move to their home base. They are all hindered by one joint opponent who takes on the role of Captain One Eye. He too tries to collect as many gold pieces as possible, but only obtains them by taking them from some pirate. Dolphins must make it possible for the pirates to reach their goal faster, while sharks support the Captain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
