							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Shogi</name>
									
			<description>A small shogi variant on a 4x6 grid. Each player has exactly one of each type of piece from standard shogi (one pawn, one knight, one lance, one silver, one gold, one bishop, one rook, one king), conveniently for beginners learning the moves of shogi pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces that reach the back two ranks of the board promote as in shogi, and captured pieces can be dropped back onto the board as one's own. The object of the game is to either get the king to the promotion zone, or capture the opponent's king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
