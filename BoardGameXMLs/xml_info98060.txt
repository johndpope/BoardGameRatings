							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thundercloud Galaxy</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thundercloud Galaxy is a place for action and adventure. It is where the Dominators still tread and where the last of the Elder Races are said to hide. Ancient ruins of the Elders and other advanced people litter the worlds of the Thundercloud Galaxy. Some hold the secrets to riches, others threaten to unleash forgotten technology and ancient menaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonization efforts in the Thundercloud sponsored by the civilizations in the rest of the Three Galaxies offer the promise of a new beginning and a glorious future. Colonists flock to the Thundercloud filled with dreams. Space Pirates and an array of cutthroats also flock to the galaxies, guns in hand, ready to rob and fleece the colonists. Lawmen and heroes are in great demand, and the opportunities for clever adventurers are said to be without limit. Strange beings like the feline Shing, insectoid CheDive, and Whetu, who defy description, and monsters like the devouring Yboor are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg when it comes to life in this galaxy. It is also home to the Bushi Federation and the Splugorth Kingdom of Desslyth, and is a playground for space pirates, raiders, the mysterious Exiles and the dark forces of the Minion War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the civilizations of the Anvil and Corkscrew Galaxies scramble to colonize the Thundercloud Galaxy in a mad rush to grab as much as they can, they are beginning to realize the galaxy holds more riches, beauty, horrors and secrets than anyone has ever imagined, making it a place of discovery, adventure and treachery like no other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thundercloud Galaxy is a perfect companion to the rest of the Phase World/Three Galaxies based Dimension Books as well as the Minion War series. Players can be pirates, raiders, brigands or hired guns, or they may be explorers, adventurers, Spacers, or any number of heroes trying to protect the colonists or the indigenous peoples of countless worlds and colonies. The possibilities are truly limited only by your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 new alien R.C.C.s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysteries of the Elder Races, complete with stats for them as NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes on the Dominators and Gene-Tech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable Dominator weapons, gear and salvage available to players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable monsters and strange creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Creation Tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colony Creation Tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indigenous People Tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;101 Ruins and Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guidelines for making Magic Weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable weapons, colony ships and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trensik Mercenaries, Elder Races, Dominators and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Exiles, Splugorth Kingdom of Desslyth and other mysterious people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An overview of the Thundercloud Galaxy, bits of history, new insights and many avenues of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any type of space opera and science fiction scenario you can imagine can be played out in the Thundercloud Galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
