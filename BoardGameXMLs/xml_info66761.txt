			<description>Hell on Wheels: Platoon Level Tank Tactics Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The purpose of the game is to simulate the tactics and command and control problems facing individual tank troop/platoon commanders. Of necessity, such a game cannot expect to cover fully all aspects of tank combat at this level, and therefore I have chosen to gloss over the detail of the tank gun Vs armour battle, in favour of a more detailed communications and reactions system. Everything is very simple, but it is very difficult to do the simplest things.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game requires a minimum of two participants, Control and Player. The Control determines a fixed (or semi-fixed) defence for the player to fight through. Since such actions are likely to be fast and furious, there is often plenty of opportunity for Player and Control to swap roles. The Player is the commander of a single tank troop/platoon of whatever type the scenario dictates. These rules are written with the European campaign, 1944 in mind, but the structure can be applied to almost any tank engagement, with some small modifications.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;With more players, there is scope for larger games of up to squadron level, preferably with different units with their own terrain model. The back-to-back, two sided game&lt;br/&gt;is also possible, but not recommended, since the detail necessary for correct interaction slows the game down considerably, and in my tests, the presence of a 'live' enemy made absolutely no difference to the players. It is recommended that when playing the higher level games, the ratio of 1:1 Player to Control is maintained if possible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with 1/300, 1/200, or 1/76 scale tanks. Each turn represents about 20-40 seconds. Each player represents one platoon/troop commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
