			<description>The object of the game is to act out the words from your cards to your team and see how many they can guess. Players divide into teams and decide on a time limit for each mime. The first player from team A takes a mime card and spins the spinner, they then try to act out the words on that category card to their team, each correct guess wins a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
