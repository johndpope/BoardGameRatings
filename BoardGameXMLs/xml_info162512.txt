							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wolfie&#039;s Music Games</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolfie's Music Games is a compilation of 10 music-related games for DOS.  Most of the games are remakes of games found in earlier Googlol games, such as &amp;quot;Snake,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Invaders,&amp;quot; and others, but they have been modified to incorporate musical concepts.  For example, the Snake game plays like the original Snake game (or Googolpede, in Googol Math Games), but the player can only eat particular notes.  The Invaders game has alien ships that can only be destroyed if the player uses a particular note for certain ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games focus on teaching the notes of the scale and to expose the player to concept of accidentals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
