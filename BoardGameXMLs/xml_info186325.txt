			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Statless RPG is a light-weight approach to handling actions without numerous methods.  Instead, a single method and rule is used for all resolution, opposed or unopposed.  Characters have only one type of ability--Skill.  Every Skill has a base percentage chance of success that varies with the Skill difficulty.  Characters receive 100 Experience Points to distribute into any Skill during character build.  Character Race then makes adjustment to some Skills based on Racial Templates.  Resolution adds d100 to the character's Skill, adds/subtracts any Difficulty Modifier supplied by the GM, and compares that to either 100 (unopposed) or the opponent's similar roll (opposed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
