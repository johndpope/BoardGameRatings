			<description>A game in the little known third series of games from Melins/Scandecor. Like the bigger plastic boxed games (Play Ecology and others) the game box is hard plastic in excellent quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game tries to simulate real tennis as closely as possible, although with directions quantified to three (forward, left diagonal and right diagonal) and with 4x4 spaces on each side as possible places for the ball to land. For every turn, you can move both your pieces (up to two steps), and one of them must land at the ball. You then select a position on the other side, along the lines from the ball, in which you strike the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to win a tennis &amp;quot;game&amp;quot;, following tennis rules, and there are markers for 0-15-30-40-advantage on the side of the board, but no marker for number of games, since you are only expected to play one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alas, the game has no random elements whatsoever which makes it fairly easy to see through, and once you understand the tactics, a single ball takes forever. This was most likely one reason why the game was short lived and is pretty unknown today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
