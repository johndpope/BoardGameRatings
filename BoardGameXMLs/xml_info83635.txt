			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the endangered species list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're under orders to uncover the cause of a distress signal emanating from a secret military base in Antarctica. Once there, you find the base contaminated by a virus that has ferociously infected and mutated every living and non-living thing in sight. And you're next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've never felt pressure this intense. You can't think. Can't blink. It's just you and a tenaciously unstoppable virus bent on infecting the world. You're U.S. Special Forces Recon Marine Dennis Riley, and you're on a mission that seems impossible.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
