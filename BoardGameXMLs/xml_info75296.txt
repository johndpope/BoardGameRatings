			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Guilddom Adventures Made Easy (GAME), a tiny yet delightful &amp;quot;paper and pencil&amp;quot; fantasy role-playing game specifically designed for a narrator and a single player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play a RPG, people cooperatively tell a story. The story's main character(s) are each controlled by a player. The person leading the game is the narrator, who describes the setting and controlls everything else in the story besides the player characters. The narrator is called the Game Master (GM), the main characters are called &amp;quot;player characters&amp;quot; (PCs), and all characters controlled by the GM are called &amp;quot;non-player characters&amp;quot; (NPCs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GAME rules are fun, succinct, easy to use, and can be adapted to many settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game requires these rules, paper and pencil, two people, and some eight-sided dice (preferably at least three matching dice and a fourth in a distinct color).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design notes are initially hidden from view and can be shown or hidden with a button. These explain why the rules and sample setting were constructed as they are, which may aid adapting GAME to other settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks go to Nathan Brown for many enjoyable afternoons playtesting the combat rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
