							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">President</name>
									
			<description>An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The worst fear of a Secret Service Agent is when the President of the US decides to leave an established motorcade and work the crowd. In this game, one player plays the President and his two Secret Service Agents and the other represents a crowd with an unknown assassin. Can you get the President through the crowd alive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The President starts in one of the two center squares on one side of the board. He then places one Secret Service Agent on each side of the President. The crowd starts with 6 crowd members anywhere on the opposite half of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: The President player must exit from one of the two center squares on the opposite side of the board. The crowd player must assassinate the President.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
