			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;when you were young, you spoke to the moon. you climbed out of your bedroom window and sat on the roof and, at great length, the two of you discussed matters both big and small, both terrestrial and celestial. you confided in each other in ways neither of you could elsewhere. your parents wouldn&amp;rsquo;t understand. your friends couldn&amp;rsquo;t even begin to. and for the moon, the stars in the sky were beyond comprehension, and the planets too wrapped up in themselves. sometimes, the moon told you, it felt as if only the lonely creatures of earth looked up to it. it would bathe you in its serene glow until it passed from the sky, its strange nightlight replaced by bright, lifegiving progression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
