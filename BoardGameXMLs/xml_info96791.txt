			<description>from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disaffected, jealous, prideful, Lucifer was cast from Heaven and from there, the world was cursed with the affliction of his son Satan, and in turn his children of the seven Vampire Houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gothic Society creates an expansive and vibrantly sinister environment, where the world and history as we know it has always been influenced, manipulated and dominated, both overtly and covertly by Vampire powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main rule book includes meticulous historical detail of the First Born Vampires, their subsequent offspring and their supernatural attributes, character creation rules, combat, character examples and enough exemplary information to bring this frightening world to life for role-playing enthusiasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Readers will be drawn into a dramatic and fluid setting, where fiction has been intricately woven into historical fact, and where characters must utilize strength and strategy to survive the ravages of a truly Twisted world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
