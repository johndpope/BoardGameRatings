							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Troll Episode 1: Dawn of the Voyaging Troller</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trudge through your opponents' hoards. Dig deep for shiny loot and get out with whatever you can! Bury your spoils and line the walls with tricksy trinkets, traps (and the occasional Goblin). Because when you're a Troll, there's no time for playing nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Troll is a quick and chaotic party game for 2-4 Trolls looking to ruin someone's day. If you like games with the same flamboyant and manic attitude as Fluxx, Smash Up or Munchkin, then it's time to get your Troll on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stealing, bluffing, plotting and back-stabbing are a given. But get ready to slam your brain into reverse, because Ultimate Troll is unique in that cards are not played from your hand. Instead, they are placed face down, creating a treacherous cavern of ludicrous loot and dastardly traps that your opponents will attempt to steal from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Troll is a great, compact game that's fast to set up and play. It's perfect for when you have limited time or space, or as a warmup game to an epic evening of board gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
