			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Auto Assault is, (was), a massively multiplayer game where you explore a post-apocalyptic future world in customized cars, motorcycles, and semis. Humans, (who retreated underground to avoid a holocaust, only to emerge years later, and find the surface of planet in an ongoing state of chaos), mutants, and biomeks, the game's playable races, are now on separate sides of the conflict fighting for survival, and for control of the world.&lt;br/&gt;Fight bandits and mutated creatures at break-neck speed! Collapse buildings, crash vehicles and destroy just about any other object you see!&lt;br/&gt;Each race has access to roughly the same 4 classes, which fall into the familiar lines of Tank, Healer, Stealther, and Pet Master. &lt;br/&gt;Explore, pillage, and beat down opponents on your own, - or join a faction and help take over as much territory as you can.&lt;br/&gt;Auto Assault offers an action-packed way to play online simultaneously with thousands of others.&lt;br/&gt;OBS! The game servers were shut down on August 31, 2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
