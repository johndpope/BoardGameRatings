							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hair Bear Bunch Game</name>
									
			<description>As on TV [a long time ago], the Hair Bear Bunch live in a dingy Cave in the Wonderland Zoo during the daytime.  However, after dark when the Zoo closes the Bunch go &amp;quot;out on the town.&amp;quot;  In order to do this, they must get out through the Wonderland Zoo Arch without being &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; by Mr. Peevly or Botch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard shows the Cave and the entrance to the Wonderland Zoo with a cobblestone path going between them.  Mr. Peevly and Botch are placed in the center of the board.  The discs which represent the Bears are placed in the Cave.  The object of the game is to be the first player to get his Bear from the Cave, out through the Wonderland Zoo entrance, and back into the Cave again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
