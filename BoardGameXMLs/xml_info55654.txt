							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book Of Mormon Football</name>
									
			<description>After teaching a Book of Mormon lesson, divide the group (or family) into two teams. Place both footballs on the 50 yard line (one above the large football in the center of the board and one below). Each team takes a turn picking a question from the &amp;quot;Question&amp;quot; sack. If they answer it correctly, they then pick a yardage amount from the &amp;quot;Yards&amp;quot; sack. They move their football the indicated amount. Continue taking turns until one team reaches the goal line. Then the team can pick an additional card from the &amp;quot;Extra Point&amp;quot; sack. On a chalk board or piece of paper, keep score. Each team receives 6 points for each goal and the amount of extra points they pick from the &amp;quot;Extra Point&amp;quot; sack. When all the questions have been answered (or time is up), the winners are determined by their score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
