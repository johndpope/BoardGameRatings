			<description>Dragon Brew Dragon Brew is a strategic fantasy beer brewing game where you and your friends take on the role of head brewers competing for prizes at the annual Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Keep beer festival.&lt;br/&gt;Players build brewery estates, harvest grain, quest for ingredients and brew custom fantastical beers.  In order to earn top prize, and the victory points that go along with such prestige, players must adapt their recipes to the ever-changing preferences of the beer festival judges.  The winner of the game is the player with the most victory points at the end of three game years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing The Game&lt;br/&gt;The game turn is broken out into three phases: Spring, Fall and Winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spring Phase&lt;br/&gt;Players spend the spring phase assigning their brewers to jobs, expanding their estates and purchasing brewing supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draft Event or Brewery cards from the draft offering.  Event cards give players an immediate reward and Brewery cards expand a player&amp;rsquo;s estate with new actions or upgrades to existing actions.  These are outlined in detail later in the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spring phase ends after players have assigned all of their brewer meeples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall Phase&lt;br/&gt;Players simultaneously brew their beers behind their player screens.  Beers are created by combining recipe cards in distinct rows.  After the beers have been created, the players lift their screens simultaneously and present their beers, reading their names and adding some flavor text and back story to each beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each judge awards victory points to the beer that most meets their preferences based on color, strength and bitterness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winter Phase&lt;br/&gt;The player&amp;rsquo;s estate is reset for the following turn and the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player with the most victory points after three game years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Brew Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game Board&lt;br/&gt;     344 Cards&lt;br/&gt;     186 Wood Components&lt;br/&gt;     44 Meeples&lt;br/&gt;     160 Tokens&lt;br/&gt;     4 Player Screens&lt;br/&gt;     20 Page Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;     Plastic Insert Tray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
