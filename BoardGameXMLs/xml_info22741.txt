			<description>&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; is game of chance, for ages 9 and up, consisting of four dice: two red &amp;amp; white dice, one blue &amp;amp; white die, and one green &amp;amp; white die. Score sheets, fashioned exactly like bowling scorecards, are used to calculate scores, and series cards are used to record and maintain averages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played as a solo affair, or by any number of players. But six is a recommended maximum, to expedite play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like bowling in a league, the contestants compete for best average between three complete, 10 frame lines of dice bowling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dice:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Red &amp;amp; White dice are to be rolled together first in each frame. If a STRIKE is rolled, regardless of what is on the other die, this is entered on the scoresheet, and the next player proceeds with their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A STRIKE is rolled when one of the two dice shows the word, or when the two dice show ten total pins (5 each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Green &amp;amp; White die is rolled when any combination of pins showing on the dice, other than a STRIKE or SPLIT are shown. This die is rolled after the initial roll of the Red &amp;amp; White dice in an attempt to pick up the spare. Also, if SPLIT is showing with 3, 4, or 5 pins on the other die (Red &amp;amp; White Dice) then the player enters the number of pins on the other die as an initial score and rolls the Green &amp;amp; White die to pick up the spare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blue &amp;amp; White die is rolled when SPLIT appears on the initial Red &amp;amp; White dice roll with 1 or 2 pins showing on the other die. The scorekeeper will enter this as 7 or 8 pins for the first roll. (The SPLIT is counted as six pins plus the 1 or 2 other pins). When either of these combinations occur the player must use the Blue &amp;amp; White die in an effort to pick up the spare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Red &amp;amp; White dice is marked SPLIT, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The other is marked STRIKE, 1, 2,3, 4, 5. The Green &amp;amp; White die is marked SPARE, SPARE, SPARE, SPARE, OPEN, OPEN. The Blue &amp;amp; White die is marked OPEN, OPEN, OPEN, OPEN, SPARE, SPARE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Publisher/Designer. The game is copyrighted 1979, to J.
