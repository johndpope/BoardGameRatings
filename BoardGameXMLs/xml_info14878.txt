			<description>This is a game for people who love rolling dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to move around an outer (primaries) track, then an inner (election) track toward the final election space. A player who lands on an election space rolls 2d6 three times and collects a card if he gets 8+ twice. Land on Campaign, Power or Delegate and take a corresponding card. On a Power or Roll-Off square, the player can challenge an opponent for 1-2 matching cards; highest on 2D6 wins; defender wins ties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To move up to the Election track, the player must turn in 2 Election cards, 4 Campaign cards and 4 matching delegates (same party, all four regions). The player turns them all in and starts collecting again on the inner track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With another full set (delegates must be from the same party as before), the player gets to roll some more: he and the player with the most Delegate cards roll off 2D6 five times. If the player trying to get elected wins 3/5 rolls (opponent winning ties), he wins the game. Otherwise, he loses all his cards, stays on the Election track and starts collecting again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
