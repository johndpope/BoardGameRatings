			<description>Who&amp;rsquo;s afraid of the big, bad squid? I&amp;rsquo;m sure you know two to eight (or even more) players who aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Establish your supremacy over all other squid cults by retaining the favor of the Squid Totem for three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A Squid Totem (We used a plush orange squid.)&lt;br/&gt;    * A poker deck for every four players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players, playing in teams, attempt to contol the Squid Totem by playing the highest card each round. However, if two players tie for highest card, the totem goes to whoever played the lowest card. If all players tie, the totem returns to the center of the table. Each player plays with their own set of cards, made up of one entire suit from a deck of cards. Each time a team (or the totem) wins, that team (or the totem) gets a point. The first team to get three points wins. However, if the totem gets three points, or if all cards are played without a winner, the totem wins and everyone elso loses. There are also some variants to these rules available on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/211/uncontrolled-squid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/211/uncontrolled-squid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
