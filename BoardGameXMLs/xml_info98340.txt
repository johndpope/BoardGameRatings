			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two solo racing games for the Bally Astrocade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have a steady hand behind the wheel? Well, you'll get your chance to find out when you play 280 Zzzap. (from the manual)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;280 Zzzap is based on the arcade game Datsun 280 Zzzap, and gameplay is similar to that of the more popular Night Driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game presents a simplified first-person perspective of a driver looking out the windshield of a car. Displayed along the bottom of the screen are the time, mileage, and a speedometer. The object of the game is to travel the most miles in a specified amount of time (set by the player at the start of the game). Crashing into the &amp;quot;white road pegs&amp;quot; that mark the sides of the winding road will slow the player's progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you think your driving ability is Grand Prix caliber? Play DODGEM and you will get your answer. (from the manual)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dodgem is a stylized auto race presented from an overhead perspective. There is no winding road here, the player has the entire width of the screen for use as a track. As the player speeds up, slower cars will be encountered which the player must avoid and pass. As with 280 Zzzap, the object is to travel as many miles as possible in a limited amount of time. The player's progress is slowed when other cars are hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
