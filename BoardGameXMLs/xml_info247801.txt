			<description>From DriveThruRPG's Listing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hit the rainy streets of an enigmatic metropolis as a modern-day legend in search for the truth. Investigate unsolved cases, uncover the stories of the city residents, and confront the hidden forces pulling the strings from beyond the veil of the Mist. Make hard calls about which aspect of your life to promote and which to neglect; then suffer the consequences. And when it all falls apart, stop holding back and become the unstoppable incarnation of your Mythos&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of Mist Core Book contains everything you need to create and run City of Mist stories: rules for creating your own characters and crew, a comprehensive explanation of the roll+tags system, the Mythos &amp;amp; Logos character development rules, and a complete guide for the MC (aka Game Master) including tips on how to orchestrate the drama as well as guidelines and examples for creating cases, characters, locations, and story arcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook design is a homage to super-powered noir graphic novels with six comic strips, full-spread chapter covers, and staggering character and location art back to back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT'S IN THE BOOK?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 1: The Lowdown has the inside scoop on the life of a Rift (a player character) and the process of awakening, and describes some of the main City districts, locations, and local Rifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 2: Who Are You? is a guide to the Exposition Session, in which you create your series as a group.
