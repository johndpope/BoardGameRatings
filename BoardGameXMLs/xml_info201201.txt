			<description>Vampire: The Eternal Struggle Third Edition is the third edition of Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, following the first edition (Jyhad/V:TES) and the second (Camarilla Edition). Unlike the first two editions, Third Edition exclusively features cards and decks for the core clans of the Sabbat (the Lasombra, Tzimisce, Panders, and the antitribu clans), rather than the Camarilla.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to make Third Edition more accessible to new players, the Vampire: The Eternal Struggle Player's Kit was published in conjunction with Third Edition. The Player's Kit consists of four mini-decks, each of which contains half of one of the four preconstructed starter decks for Third Edition, as well as a number of blood tokens, rulebooks, and a walkthrough for running a sample game using the included decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of each card in the Third Edition set was erroneously printed upside-down. As a result, cards from Third Edition are normally legal for use in tournaments only if placed in card sleeves that mask this discrepancy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
