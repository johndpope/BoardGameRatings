			<description>111 questions and answers to mysterious, hair-rising, spooky or horrific subjects can be found in each of the four packets, shaped like a fan and based upon the Quiz &amp;amp; Co series. &lt;br/&gt;Each card is divided into a yellow and a black part, in the yellow part one finds numbered questions, on the next card the corresponding answers, equally numbered, can be found in the black part. &lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with questioning and answering by points. 10 points are the final goal, or it can also be played by time. Who has the most points after a certain time wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
