			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CASTLES II: Siege &amp;amp; Conquest is a game of medieval diplomacy, treachery, and power. To win, you must survive. To survive, you must scout the surrounding territories, defeat the native militias, subjugate the land with castles, feed and maintain the people, forge diplomatic alliances, appease the church and... unite the land under your iron fist. Did we forget to mention the other power hungry barons? They're out to gin the same crown and you sit squarely in their path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CASTLES II: Siege &amp;amp; Conquest is a completely new game system, based on the best selling CASTLES. In addition to building castles, you can now siege, attack and destroy them. Forge political and military alliances with the other computer players, or fight and conquer them in the fields or in their castles. Scout unknown territories, spy on and sabotage enemies, recruit infantry and knights, gather gold and grain, mine for iron, trade for timber and stone, research new weaponry, and pay the church of indulgences... just a few of the fun things that go into a good, medieval days work!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
