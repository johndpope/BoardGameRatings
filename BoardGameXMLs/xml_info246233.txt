It&amp;rsquo;s our biggest project so far.&lt;br/&gt;It has a strong emphasis on tactical actions in both single player mode and multiplayer mode. With clever management and strategy, players will succeed in combat, on which the gameplay is strongly focused. Single player missions are based on historical events which occurred in these Dark Ages. Each RTS fan will find features that suits their needs. Those unfamiliar with the genre, should find this title to be a great starting point. Ancestors Legacy will be released on PC and Xbox One consoles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
