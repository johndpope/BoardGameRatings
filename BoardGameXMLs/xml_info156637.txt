							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fall Schematic: The Cooperative Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Fall Schematic: The Cooperative Card Game is set in a world in which virtual identities pilot unique mechanized constructs called &amp;quot;frames&amp;quot; across a physical world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the more legendary frames of the world are equipped with powerful relics that they use to energize and deploy dormant lesser constructs called &amp;quot;rigs&amp;quot; to battlefields. In this time of conflict,  frames command rigs directly from the field of battle in an ever-growing struggle with the ominous threat commonly referred to as &amp;quot;the Glitch&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall Schematic: The Cooperative Card Game can be played with one to four players. A Starter Kit contains enough contents for a player to enjoy a quick single-player encounter. Combining multiple Starter Kits allows a group of players to engage in a longer, more challenging experience. Over the course of the game players will play rigs, attach mods, and resolve actions and abilities. The Glitch runs on an automated mechanism and does not require any player to control the Glitch's deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
