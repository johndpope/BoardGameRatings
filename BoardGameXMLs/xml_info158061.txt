							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bootleggers: Thug Promo</name>
									
			<description>This 8-card mini expansion for Bootleggers was originally released in 2013 in connection with the Mayday Games re-release of the game. It is a set of Thugs to be added to the game, and consists of the following cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honorary Mayor - Collect all the graft normally paid to the bank this turn.&lt;br/&gt;Potent Mash - Roll an extra die of production at a single still.  May affect Copper's placement of enforcement.&lt;br/&gt;Payroll Tax - Force a player to pay $1G per influence marker he controls.&lt;br/&gt;County Line - Play on a loaded truck. Crates fall off the truck during a chase. Discard half the loaded crates (rounded up) from the truck.&lt;br/&gt;Army Buddy - Play when an opponent plays an influence card.  Receive the same influence.&lt;br/&gt;You Got the Wrong Guy, See - Redirect the target of a Men of Action card to another player (but not the player of the card).&lt;br/&gt;Friends in High Places - Reroll a single die of your choice, discard after use.  The die need not be your own.&lt;br/&gt;I Gots an Idear - Play on a truck. A trailer is permanently added to the truck which expands its capacity by 2 crates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
