							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MASK: Die Jagd nach den Sonnensteinen</name>
									
			<description>An old roll-and-move boardgame loosely based on the popular M.A.S.K. cartoon series and toy franchise of the 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every one of the (up to 4) players takes control of one MASK character and must try to move him on a mini-course (16 spaces) back to the starting point. Movement is determined by rolling a D3, and a special Sunstone-Die determines how many of such stones a player might receive. Once a player gets more than 3 Sunstones at any point, he has to return them all to the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: the Sunstone-Die also determines how many spaces the 'Miles Mayhem' character (a villain) moves. Once the villain lands on the same space as a character, the player has to move his character back to the last space with a vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, at any time, a player rolls the same number as his Sunstones, he cannot advance, but has to go back instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    deck of cards&lt;br/&gt;    2 white 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;    4 miniature cars (red, green, yellow, and blue)&lt;br/&gt;    game board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
