			<description>Radia Senki: Reimmeihen (ラディア戦記  黎明編  lit. &amp;quot;Chronicle of the Radia War&amp;quot;) is an Action RPG for the Nintendo Family Computer created by Tecmo, and released in Japan on November 15, 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radia Senki follows a cast of characters trying to stop the domination of Lemuria by Gadiss, a political leader. The main protagonist suffers from amnesia at the beginning of the game, but he does regain his memories by the conclusion of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radia Senki features both action and console role-playing elements. The player controls one of the five characters available during the game through overhead environments. Players enter battles when the character walks over an invisible battle trigger tile. Battles are fought in real-time, similar to The Legend of Zelda and the screen does not change when a battle occurs. The other characters in the party not controlled by the player can be issued commands during battles, such as fight or regroup. During battle, players can tell the party to act dead, in order to avoid enemies. Characters can also use a variety of damaging and healing spells, as well as spells that affect enemies stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters gain experience after battles and become stronger. Although spells are learned from finding scrolls, the number of times a spell can be cast increases as characters gain more levels. Enemies typically do not drop gold and many drop items the player can sell. Stores in towns buy and sell items, weapons, and armor and the heroes can rest and save the game in any bed found throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Radia Senki: Reimeihen&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
