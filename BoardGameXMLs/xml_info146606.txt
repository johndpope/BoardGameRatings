			<description>A fox-and-rabbit themed press-your-luck game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;Roger Rabbit and his friends are having a picnic at the park, but in order to participate, everyone has to bring a carrot. But Frido the fox knows about the picnic too and he's lying in wait! As soon as the alarm call sounds, all the rabbits run off. Will you be the one who is best at calculating the fox risk and manages to collect four rabbits and four carrots on your picnic blanket first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Collect four rabbit and four carrot tiles to earn a candy token. Earn two candy tokens to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;The tiles (16 rabbits, 19 carrots, 7 foxes) are put in the tile bag. 3 tiles are removed from the game, without anyone knowing what they are (there is a variant with no tiles being removed). Each player gets a board showing a picnic blanket with designated spaces for four rabbits and four carrots. Players take turns. On your turn, you draw a tile from the bag. &lt;br/&gt;If it is a carrot or rabbit, place it next to your board. Then you may keep drawing tiles as long as they show either a carrot or rabbit. You can stop drawing tiles at any point. When you decided to stop, you first place the carrots on your board. For each carrot, you may also place a rabbit. Tiles for which you don't have enough space on your board, or rabbits for which there are no carrots, go back to the bag.&lt;br/&gt;If you draw a fox, the rabbits flee and you have to put all the rabbits and carrots drawn during this turn back into the bag. The fox tile is put into the fox den (i.e. it doesn't go back to the bag). Then the next player's turn starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when a player has collected four carrots and four rabbits on his/her board. The player gets a candy token. All carrots, rabbits and foxes are returned to the bag and a new round starts.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has collected two candy tokens. He/she wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
