							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Desert Game</name>
									
			<description>This game published by the Sage Publishing Company in 1979 is a Trivia type Game where players are tested on their knowledge of the desert environment. Questions about   Why a pit viper is called a pit viper (the pit vipers have developed special organs of heat reception that help them to sense warm-blooded animals, an ability that is especially useful at night, when many of them hunt. These organs consist of pits, for which the group is named)  and What creature impales its prey on cactus thorns?  (Loggerhead Shrikes (they are a bird) often impale reptiles and small mammals after the prey becomes tired from being chased.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
