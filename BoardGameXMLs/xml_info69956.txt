							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tecmo Super Bowl II: Special Edition</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Tecmo Super Bowl II was an update of the previous Tecmo Super Bowl released on Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and Mega Drive/Genesis. TSB II was released on Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994. The game still had all of Tecmo's revolutionary features (breaking tackles), but now teamed with the NFL Players Association, the game had names for nearly all of its players, with a few players still under generic names. The game also added a new feature, Player Trades. Gamers were allowed to trade for three weeks before the season. For the first time, Jerry Rice could play for the Cowboys, or Deion Sanders could play for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The game was somewhat well known when it was released, but now, the game is relatively rare.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tecmo_Super_Bowl_II:_Special_Edition,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
