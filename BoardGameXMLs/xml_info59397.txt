			<description>(From the bottom of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Adam Power. Using the Power Gem, you become Lord Power, a being of supernatural strength!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil dictator Arkus, and his monstrous servants, Raygoth, the Goon of Doom, and Ggripptogg, the four fisted brute, have taken over a starbase near the edge of the galaxy. Arkus must be stopped. You must make your way through the space maze, acquire a secret weapon, and gather your allies. Shaya, the Queen of Power and Sydot, the Supreme do battle with Ggripptogg and Raygoth and prepare for the ultimate conflict with the evil Arkus. Accept the challenge, fire up your power ship, and jump into hyperspace. Meet your enemies and drive them from the galaxy to win for all of us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
