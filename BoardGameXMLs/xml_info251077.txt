			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie hunters are trapped in an office building with tons of stuff. Here's your chance to bury them in over 100 things found in a desk. Bring out their inner hoarder as you help them with items guaranteed to exceed their carry capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not just the fact that the stuff is there, but how much of it is there is detailed, use this in your Call of Cthulhu or Delta Green game and they will think the mismatched items are a clue from the Old Ones... maybe they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
