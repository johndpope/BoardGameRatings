			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frozen Climb of Icarus is a story roleplaying game about a Spartan rite of passage. Characters are Spartan youths on a journey to the cape of a frozen peak (ostensibly, Olympus). Their journey requires they travel with only a spear and a pair of sandals and return alive. One among them will prove his or her worth to Sparta above all others by returning with the head of a boar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
