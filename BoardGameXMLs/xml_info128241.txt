			<description>From Wikipedia: Astro Chase is a scrolling shoot 'em up game, licensed by First Star Software to Exidy games for release as an arcade game. The game was originally released by First Star Software in 1982, on December 7th. The player is an astronaut who pilots a saucer-shaped fighter ship against aliens bent on destroying Earth. The enemy aliens attack the player with an endless supply of attack saucers; however, they are but a mere distraction. The real threat to Earth are the 16 Megamines that start at the end of the universe and then slowly and silently make their way towards planet Earth, displayed in the center of the screen. If a single Megamine manages to reach Earth, the planet explodes in a spectacular explosion. The player's saucer scrolls in eight directions and the player can shoot in all directions. The game features Single Thrust Propulsion, which lets the player lock their ship on course and continue to travel in the desired direction while simultaneoulsy shooting in ANY of the 8 directions. The game's music is an endless loop of the 1812 Overture. Once the player destroys all 16 Megamines in a given level, he or she is able to move to the next level. Every four levels, there is an animation in which the pilot receives a hero's welcome with a parade that grows with each viewing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Astro Chase,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
