							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cthulhu Saves the World</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After his long slumber, Cthulhu has been risen from the depths once more to destroy the world...  But what's this?  He's been deprived of his powers!  And now the only way to regain them, and thus destroy the world, is...  to become a hero?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the creator of Breath of Death: VII comes another retro-styled throwback to NES era games that knows its roots and isn't afraid to poke a little fun at them.  Frequent humor aimed at those who have played both classic and modern RPGs only serves to enhance the unique combat system that both draws from and adds to the classic turn-based system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would you save the world...  so you can destroy it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
