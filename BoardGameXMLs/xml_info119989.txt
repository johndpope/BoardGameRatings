			<description>18 cards are placed around a room where the guests can easily see them. The guests receive a score-card, on which they will write down their answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have an illustration which is a kind of illustrated cryptic clue. Under the picture is the item that guests must write down in their related answer. Card examples:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card 6. A close-up picture of a tree and the subject is 'Find the Misician'. Answer = Bach (suggested by the Bark of the tree)&lt;br/&gt;Card 17. A picture of a Shell oil can and the subject is 'Find the Seagull'. Answer = Petrel (the visual clue is Petrol)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I told you they were cryptic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to answer all 18 cards correctly, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
