							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alarmstufe 6</name>
									
			<description>The title refers to a 'level' of an alarm. Level 1 might be helping a cat down a tree but Level 6 might be a massive fire at a chemicals factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a track of 60 spaces and, in that regard, it is a 'Goose-Type' game. Throw the die and move along the track and if you land on a space with instructions, you must obey those instructions. It has a few differences to common games of this type. Some spaces 'attract' other players' pieces to come to help you with an Alarm. This in effect means that other people will be helped forward if they are behind or brought back if they are in front. First to get to space 60, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces are small metallic fire-engines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
