			<description>A Competitive Storytelling Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your journey has taken you high amongst the Memorandiums; the mountain range at the top of your world, where the peaks scrape the sky as it moves overhead. Golden sparks of magic bursting into life with each impact between mountain and the sky, it is here with the energy of creation itself raining down upon you that you make your camp. For you are Dreamweavers and you have new yarns to spin, tales to tell and dreams to weave. Only here where your reality ends and the countless others hang overhead, the weight of them rubbing across the mountains themselves that you can access the Dreamscape; the collective consciousness that flows between dimensions and seeps into all living things. The Dreamscape offers invention, imagination and inspiration to all things, but to do so across infinite realities it must itself hold infinite ideas. It is your duty as Dreamweavers to offer stories to the Dreamscape, so that those else where may happen upon them in their dreams, and be nurtured by their being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
