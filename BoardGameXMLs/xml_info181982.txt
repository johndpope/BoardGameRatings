Over the years he built up a cult following, many flocked to him and worshipped.  He sent out his cultists to pillage and burn the surrounding lands.  Eventually he amassed a huge stock pile of treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His demise came when a cultist named Zalish Hargih finally saw the evil that was being inflicted on the land and vowed to put a stop to it.  Late in the evening when Gardag was resting peacefully after a large meal, Zalish snuck into his bedroom and murdered the cult leader with a poison tipped dagger.  Shortly thereafter the remaining cultists took their own lives, proclaiming they would rather be with their leader, than face the awfulness of the world without him.  A tomb was erected in the underworld for Gardag by the last of his stalwart followers.  They eventually hung themselves within.  It is said that the skulls of the cultists line the tombs, stacked neatly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great great grand daughter of Zalish Hargih, Hamona Hargih seeks to find the lost poisoned dagger that ended Gardag&amp;rsquo;s reign of terror.  She believes that Zalish&amp;rsquo;s remains may also be imprisoned within the tomb, and would like them retrieved for a proper burial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
