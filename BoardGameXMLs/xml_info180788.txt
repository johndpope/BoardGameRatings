							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naval Action: A Simple Combat Resolution System for Model Fleets of the 1898-1945 Era</name>
									
			<description>A relatively fast and simple naval miniatures (or boardgame, if you want to grid it) set of rules. Each simultaneous-movement turn is 5 minutes of real time. Floor scale is 1 inch per unit, while tabletop scale is 1 centimeter per unit. Ship statuses for all World War 2 ship classes are provided, as are 5 sample scenarios, including Denmark Strait, where Bismarck sank Hood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torpedo tracks are laid out before pre-plotted movement, so &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; torpedo hits (in addition to those from malfunctions) are a real possibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air and sub/antisub rules are simplified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was being considered for publication by Game Designers Workshop, shortly before GDW went out of business.  It is currently free print-and-play on CoatneyHistory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I refer to my Naval Action rules as an alternative naval battle resolution system for my boardgames Lion's Lair:  Malta Convoy Battles 1940-42[/thing], Murmansk Run:  Arctic Convoys to Russia[/thing], and now Matapan:  The Naval Battle for Greece, Mar41[/thing], and I provide individual (deck plan) ship pieces for individual Royal and Italian Navy ships there, using reductions of the U.S. Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence identification manuals' deck plans and/or my own pixel-by-pixel reconstructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
