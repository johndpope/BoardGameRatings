							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Soundscape: Junior Edition</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What was that sound? Someone brushing their teeth? Papers being shuffled? A person rubbing their hands together? Give your answer quickly because time is running out. Soundscape Junior Edition contains nearly 200 different sounds for children to identify on two CDS. Great for travel, parties or at home, in each round of the game 5 sounds are presented for children to listen to carefully and write down their best guess on the scoresheet of what the sound could be. Kids are all familiar with the sound of a 'key turning in the door' or a 'clock ticking', but can they identify it when no visual hints? Soundscape Junior Edition is narrated by kid announcers presenting each sound. Children have a blast playing Soundscape Junior Edition and enhance listening and deductive reasoning skills without even knowing it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
