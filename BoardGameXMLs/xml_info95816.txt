							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SteinPlatz</name>
									
			<description>SteinPlatz is an offensive/defensive game for two. Using cut &amp;quot;stone&amp;quot; blocks in different shapes and sizes, players alternate placing them on the board, with the first to join both sides of the &amp;quot;Quarry&amp;quot; winning the match. Out maneuver and cut-off the path of your opponent by stacking your stones around each other or over each other, cutting off their path. Force your opponent to use up their more valuable stones to counter your moves. Make key strategic defensive moves while staying prepared to switch over to the attack when the time is right. &lt;br/&gt; To win, you must have an unbroken line of &amp;quot;Stones&amp;quot; of your color extend from one Quarry Zone to the other, when viewed from above the game board. The board is 10 spaces wide and 9 spaces across, with a Quarry area of 2 spaces on each end.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has the same number of pieces for play, and they must remain clearly visible at all time to your opponent to assist in calculating the next move or counter-move. Each player has 25 Stones:&lt;br/&gt;3 BLOCKS, 4 BRICKS, 4 BEAMS, 1 SPAN, 3 POSTS, 2 PILLARS, &lt;br/&gt;1 CORNER, 1 STEP, 3 ARCHES, and 3 BRIDGES. &lt;br/&gt;The Steps, Arches and Bridges are multi-directional, as they can be placed face-up or down.&lt;br/&gt;The Stones cannot be stacked higher than 5 Blocks, so during some games there may be areas where no more pieces can be played.&lt;br/&gt;SteinPlatz also has a competition scoring system for tournament matches that count points for unused Stones at end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
