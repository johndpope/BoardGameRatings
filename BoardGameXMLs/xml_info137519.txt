			<description>In a futurist universe controlled by the New World Order, extraterrestrial prisoners and other outcasts from society have become superstars of a bloody and violent sport in the image of its time : PrisonBall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leading one of these prisoners teams, the player will try to qualify himself through PrisonBall play-offs and cups for the very coveted Christmas Cup, a bloody family entertainment for the celebration season .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PrisonBall is played 7 versus 7 on an ice rink and players have to get points in order to win the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals, bumpers, timers and Ko are different means to win. Tactic Cards, corruption cards, low blows, the audience and bonuses are also indirect means to glean a few points or to get rid of your adversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go through a whole season thanks to championship rules that will lead you to the Christmas Cup or simply play a match between one of the major teams of the league or one of your teams created with creation rules.&lt;br/&gt;Follow the three great classifications of players, strikers, pitchers or the greatest psychopath, with the charts won with 'xp and become one of the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the movie &amp;quot;RollerBall&amp;quot;, or the video game &amp;quot;Speedball&amp;quot;, Prison Ball throws us into a gloomy future where shed blood has become a family attraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo rules to simulate matches, the complete set of figurines from Infinity (the game), Greebo, Neomics, Willy miniatures, Pedro Ramos...) can be used with the game. Figurine profiles are available on the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got to win if you want to be free!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
