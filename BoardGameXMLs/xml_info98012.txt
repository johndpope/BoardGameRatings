							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheers and Tears</name>
									
			<description>Card game with 54 cards in 18 sets of three cards. Two are identical, the Cheers cards, and one is the opposite to the Cheer card, the Tears card.&lt;br/&gt;Players aim to win a trick, made up of the two Cheers cards from any set, but this trick is not won yet. You win the trick permanently if you can play the matching Tears card on to it in a later turn. If another player does this to you, the trick is discarded. The game is won by the player who has the most cards in their 'captured' pile, less any cards still in their hand when the Cheers Cards are all played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
