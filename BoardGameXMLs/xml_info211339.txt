							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Minorities at War</name>
									
			<description>HBG is excited to present American Minorities at War &amp;ndash; a Global War /Axis &amp;amp; Allies expansion celebrating the often unrecognized contribution of American Minorities to the Allied victory in World War II.  This set comes with 15 beautifully illustrated full-color markers that help tell the incredible story of the units they depict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this expansion the U.S. player can implement a set of changes to the rules known as a scheme that allows him or her, the chance to draw and place special units and markers. Minority units have special abilities consistent with their historical performance such as increased attack or defense values for elite units, or special abilities for those units with unique roles in the war.  The set is a great addition to the game and an exciting way for players to learn about the sacrifice and valor of American minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
