			<description>This is a British sports quiz game published as a promotional item for Webster's Yorkshire Bitter. The board has three concentric rings of spaces (Qualifying, Bronze and Silver) with a large Gold Medal space in the middle. There is a deck of 56 cards, each with six questions and answers (one for each of six color-coded categories).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and must first complete a full circuit of the outer track, answering a question of the appropriate color as they land on each space. Then they must aim for a Qualify space, where they must answer a question of another player's choice from the next card in order to move to the Bronze track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, players must move around the Bronze track before trying to move up to Silver, and around that track before trying for a Gold Medal question to win the game. The questions range from familiar (&amp;quot;Name all five events in the modern Olympic Pentathlon&amp;quot;) to the obscure (&amp;quot;Which snooker player was able to claim pints of lager as tax-deductible?&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box included an opportunity to enter a real contest to win tickets to five premier sporting events in late 1987 and 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
