			<description>The five issues of &amp;quot;Diceman&amp;quot; were magazine games published using characters from the British anthology comic &amp;quot;2000AD.&amp;quot; Each issue contained three solitaire games starring characters such as Judge Dredd, Nemesis the Warlock, Slaine, and Rogue Trooper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games followed programmed story lines and were based, essentially, on a paragraph system - except, instead of paragraphs, the player was directed to illustrated panels. Each game contained all the rules necessary to play - generally combat rules and record-keeping - and was a self-contained adventure for one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
