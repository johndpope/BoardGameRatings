			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Felix is a game written by Paul Montwill and published by Hit Pak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a series of mazes. Within the maze are a number of orbs which need to be collected within a time limit. The maze is patrolled by a number of re-spawning enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The user controls a hovering craft which can move and fire in eight directions (though your weapon has no effect on some enemies). The craft can hold only one orb at a time, so alternates between &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot; mode when you are looking for orbs and &amp;quot;Return&amp;quot; mode, where you must return to the Home position in the maze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you run into an enemy (or the walls of the maze), your power bar is reduced. If the bar is reduced to zero, then it's Game Over. However returning an orb home returns some of your power. If you run out of time, then it is also Game Over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On completing a level you are awarded a life (you start with none). However additional restrictions are imposed. For example on the second level your ship cannot fire when returning with an orb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
