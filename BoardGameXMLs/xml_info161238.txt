			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We made it: civilisation at last! Fresh food, a proper bed. Ordinary people with simple lives. Safety! Wait - They're doing what..?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events: Goings-on Seen or Heard of in the Olde Worlde Settlement is a tool designed to prompt encounters and other events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On just one page it provides 216 table entries arranged across six columns, for use individually or in various combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries cover the activity itself, its nature and location, plus the people and things involved, and those getting involved...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is compatible with various genres and systems and suitable for use in roleplaying and beyond. It can be used to inspire and detail beings, even at the table in the course of games - and not least to see out what kind of place it is the party just found...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three pages are arranged for ease of use on screen or printed, the key features in two variant layouts. The tool includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     216 table entries arranged in six columns and six rows, all on one page&lt;br/&gt;     six categories - nature, activity, location, individual, other party and escalation&lt;br/&gt;     a compact diceless number generator for a specific range used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be used in conjunction with the adventures The Winds of Foul Crack and The Loss in Hanging Well to add detail to the district around Old Wranglie's, the towns of New Churning and Rict and the settlements growing beyond the Underdelta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
