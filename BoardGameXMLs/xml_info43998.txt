							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bulldogs! Races</name>
									
			<description>Bulldogs! Races details 28 new races you can use in your Bulldogs! or any other d20 sci-fi campaign. These races are built using the Race Generation system found in the main Bulldogs! rule book. All are playable in any sci-fi setting that has diverse alien life. Bulldogs! Races widens the field for players looking for variety! The supplement avoids &amp;quot;humans with a prosthetic face&amp;quot; type aliens as much as possible. Most of these races are radically different from the human form. Some are variations or splits off that human norm, but these are the exception rather than the rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just because these races were generated for Bulldogs! doesn't mean that they can't be used for another sci-fi setting, either. Any of these races is easily portable into any game using the d20 System, even a fantasy if the GM feels they are appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All races in this supplement are built using the Race Generation system found in Bulldogs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
