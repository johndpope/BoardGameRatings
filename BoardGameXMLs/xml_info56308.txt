							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My First Board Game</name>
									
			<description>My First Board Game is a simple game for even the youngest players. Children turn over a tile and more to the color-coded space. Everyone wins! Colorful illustrations feature characters from Suzy's Zoo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Desigen as an Early Learning System, the bookshelf series becomes progressively challenging as a child matures from ages 2 to 4 and up. The games are sized for small hands and easily fit on a bookshelf. They are safe for Toddlers to Tots... there are no small parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The delighful characters of Little Suzy's Zoo bring the game to life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
