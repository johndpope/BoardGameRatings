							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rat-A-Jacks</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed primarily as an investigation, centred on the fear and rumours of the Ratmen called the Skaven. While combat is also included within the plot line, the final confrontation does not have to be a show of arms. That said, I have included a few ideas on how to make the game more combat heavy for tougher player parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is also based upon events that happened in the town many years ago, in the V1-WFRP Adventure The Ritual from The Restless Dead, and so I have set the adventure in the town of Delberz. However, this can be changed if necessary by a GM, as long has the adventure still takes place in a town-sized settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
