			<description>Manhunter: New York is a post-apocalyptic adventure game designed by Barry Murry, Dave Murry and Dee Dee Murry of Evryware and published in 1988 by Sierra On-Line. A sequel, Manhunter 2: San Francisco was released the next year in 1989&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is set in the (then) futuristic year of 2004, when Earth has been enslaved by a race of aliens known as the Orbs. The Orbs, who look like giant floating eyeballs, have implanted all humans with global tracking devices, forced them to wear nondescript robes and forbid them from speaking or communicating. The protagonist has been assigned by the Orbs to track down fellow humans who are believed to be forming an underground resistance. Over the course of the game, the player discovers that the Orbs are not the benevolent rulers they claim to be; they are actually harvesting humans as a food source. The player then &amp;quot;switches sides&amp;quot; and works to overthrow the Orbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Manhunter: New York , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
