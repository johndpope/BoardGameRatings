			<description>The game about Good Driving, made in East Germany in 1960. The box image shows various vehicles but the car was fiction. The Trabant owning citizen could only aspire for such a car, a wish he knew would never be fulfilled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a road network with dials at both ends. Each player starts in a different corner and the objective is to get back to the same corner first after having visited the petrol station. Cars move by the throw of a die. The rules of the road must be respected. When you move you may move left or right but you must keep on the right side of the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you approach a crossroads you must turn the appropriate dial one 'space' to the left or right. The new sign or traffic light now in front of you must be obeyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
