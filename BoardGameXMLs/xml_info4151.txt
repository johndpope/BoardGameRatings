							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black &amp; White: The Adventures in Dairy Farming</name>
									
			<description>Here's a game you don't see very often!  The object of this dairy farming game is to sell milk, increase your herd size, and build up your assets (money, herd builder values, and farm deed values).  The game is patterned after Milton Bradley's &amp;quot;The Game of Life&amp;quot;.  At the start, players can go right into farming or choose instead to take out a loan and go to college to become a Veterinarian, Nutritionist, Geneticist or other professional.  Players buy farms and herds and make money by selling milk.  Along the way they are beset by various random events, hold auctions, switch herds with other players, and perform other actions along these lines.  The game ends when a player makes it to the end of the board.  The player with the most assets when the game ends is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
