			<description>In the award winning game ItzaBitza, drawings truly come to life. Kids help their Sketchy by using Living Ink, a unique drawing recognition system to draw one-of-a kind interactive objects that form the centerpiece of the game&amp;rsquo;s action.  There&amp;rsquo;s little chance for the player to lose interest in ItzaBitza. The game provides a totally unique experience every time it is played. Since the environment is created through each player&amp;rsquo;s personal drawings, the possibilities are as endless and fantastic as the player&amp;rsquo;s imagination. The game comes with five themed playsets: Home Sweet Home, Let&amp;rsquo;s go Camping, Play in Space, A Farm Life, and perfect for Halloween, A VERY Scary Haunted House.Players unlock playsets by winning at least five star challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ItzaBitza is more than just a fun game. The game has been crafted specifically for early-readers. In ItzaBitza, players who are just learning to read start out having a blast watching the whimsical reactions happen between their drawings and their Sketchy. Then all of a sudden, they need to read to win a star. Or to know what to draw so they can help their Sketchy. Parents will be delighted by the game&amp;rsquo;s ability to enhance their child&amp;rsquo;s self-confidence. Unlike some games that leave younger players frustrated by their difficulty and lack of assistance, ItzaBitza provides features to guide children even when faced with unfamiliar concepts. If an early-reader encounters a new word, it can be read aloud to them with the simple act of hovering the mouse over the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a delightful twist on drawing games, ItzaBitza introduces a new way for kids to game and while they are playing, really important learning is happening. New methods to engage children, discovered during a multi-year research project conducted by Microsoft Corporation, are fused into the game&amp;rsquo;s design, yielding a unique experience that encourages fun and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
