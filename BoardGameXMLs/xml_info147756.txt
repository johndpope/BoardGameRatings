							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NineTacToe</name>
									
			<description>The NineTacToe playsheet depicts nine Tic-Tac-Toe boards with numbers in the spaces; the numbers 1-27 each appear three times throughout the boards. Players take turns choosing a number and marking their symbol in the three spaces where it appears. In effect, each number choice is a play on three of the nine Tic-Tac-Toe games at once. The object is for a player to win a majority of the nine sub-games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
