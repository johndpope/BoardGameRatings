			<description>After being attacked by an angry kraken, The One Winged Osprey is lost at sea. Food is running low for you and your fellow pirates, and there won&amp;rsquo;t be a rescue any time soon. To make matters worse, there seems to be a group of cannibals on board, making their way through the crew at night, one by one&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Osprey Adrift is a card game of deduction, deception, and cannibalism for 4 to 12 players, set aboard the cursed One Winged Osprey during the golden age of piracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game begins, each player is given the role of one of the hardened and storied pirates of the Osprey. In addition to their public Role card, each player is given a secret Identity card: Sane or Cannibal. If you&amp;rsquo;re Sane, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to figure out who the Cannibals are so you can force them to walk the plank. And if you&amp;rsquo;re a Cannibal? Convince the Sane that you&amp;rsquo;re one of them so you can turn them into your next dinner&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Osprey Adrift's gameplay centers around a dual pronged flow of eliminations: The Cannibals eliminate one of the Sane each round, and the entire crew votes to eliminate one more player each round (with the Sane hoping they're getting rid of a Cannibal).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw cards off the Scavenge deck to stock their hands with Food (needed to stay in the game), Coins (used to bid on the right to be Captain each round, and as victory points should the player survive to the end of the game), Actions (used to perform special feats to help or hinder players), and Resources (needed to power many of the Actions). Or, if a player knows they need specific cards, they can dare to ask their fellow crewmates if they'd like to make a trade - in a separate room from the rest of the players, where a pirate's parley can be formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
