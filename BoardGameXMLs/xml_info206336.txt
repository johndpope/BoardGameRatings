			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood and Carnage: The Battle of Komsomolskoye, March 2000'. Following the battles of Grozny and Ulus Kert, the Russian forces reorganized and cornered their Chechen opponents in the town of Komsomolskoye. The Chechens took the town in a daring surprise attack, and on the 6th the Russians struck back. However, the Chechens did not flee this time, and instead fought a two week slug fest in a battle in which no quarter was asked or given, and town of five thousand inhabitants was largely destroyed in the attempt to save it. The &amp;ldquo;sister&amp;rdquo; game to Perry Moore&amp;rsquo;s Valor and Vengeance: The Battle of Ulus Kert, Blood and Carnage has the same scale and design in a very interactive and easy-to-learn game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Blood and Carnage has 384 single-sided counters, two 11 by 17 inch map sheets, one Players&amp;rsquo; Aid Sheet and 10 pages of rules. As with Valor and Vengeance, Antonio Pi&amp;ntilde;ar Pe&amp;ntilde;a did the graphics for Blood and Carnage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
