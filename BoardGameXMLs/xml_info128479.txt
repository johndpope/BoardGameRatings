			<description>The player who is first to find John Smith, Meeko and Flit and reaches Smith's ship with them wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 1 board, 4 Pocahontas pawns, 1 Kocoum pawn, 12 chits showing either John Smith, Meeko or Flit, 24 cardboard trees, 1 die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player rolls the die and moves their pawn up to that number of spaces on the board. If they land next to a tree, they check who hides behind that tree (i.e. which character is on the sticker hidden at the bottom of the tree). If it is John Smith, Meeko or Flit, they gain the corresponding chit. If it is a settler, the player's turn ends immediately. Some other characters force a player to give one of their chits to another player, return a chit to the pool, or exchange that tree with another one. When John Smith is discovered, Kocoum enters the game. Instead of moving their own pawn, players can now move Kocoum instead. If Kocoum reaches one of the player pawns, he steals the John Smith chit from that player. The chit is placed in the village area, and the player's Pocahontas has to return to the village to re-gain it. A player who has collected Smith, Meeko and Flit can go to the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
