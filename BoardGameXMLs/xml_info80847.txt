			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witty, cynical, and heir to a legacy of shame, Andrew MacPhiles doesn't want to be an Earl -- after all, that would be an actual (gulp) commitment! Nevertheless, his spunky girlfriend, Paula, convinces him to leave hist modern New York apartment to reclaim his ancestral home. And so he returns to the muddy, useless stretch of land where stands the Castle MacPhiles, refuge to the most cowardly clan ever to stumble its way into Scottish history. There, he must fulfill an ancient prophecy, and defeat a deadly curse that has plagued his family for centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join Andrew and Paula on this spooky adventure as you explore the castle's eerie rooms and hidden passageways, and encounter the angst-ridden ghosts of 12 generations of the family MaPhiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solve &amp;quot;wee&amp;quot; rascally riddles and persnickety puzzles to learn how a legacy of dimwitted cowardice led the clan to near extinction. Unravel the story piece-by-piece, unveiling Andrew's destiny, and ultimately unleashing an electrifying confrontation with the real Beast Within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the creators of The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour comes this clever composite of stunning 3D graphics and lively animation. Three levels of difficulty pose a challenge to novices and experienced gamers alike. And the enchanting story by renowned author Jahnna N. Malcolm makes the journey worth the taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clandestiny is an experience that will come back to haunt you .. if you've the courage to take it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
