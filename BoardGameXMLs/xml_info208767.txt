							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Play Ball! A Baseball Game of Skill</name>
									
			<description>This 1930's title is a physical-dexterity baseball game. The cardboard playing field is inset in the bottom of the box and has 23 holes punched into it, each with a result ranging from Out to Home Run. A 3&amp;quot; wooden bat is mounted on a wooden peg beside home plate, which has a small hole in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The At-Bat player puts a marble on home plate, and then flicks the bat to propel the marble across the field. If the ball fails to fall into any of the holes, it is a strike, with three strikes as usual causing an out, and three outs ending the inning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
