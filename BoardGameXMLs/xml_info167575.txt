							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FAITH: The Sci-Fi RPG â€“ Core Set</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAITH is a sci-fi RPG with boardgame elements that takes place in the vastness of the universe. As part of the mighty Corvo, the proud Iz'kal, the feral Raag, as versatile Humans, or as the mutant Ravager players will take part in amazing stories all around the universe. During those stories they will explore the Labyrinth in search of new worlds, found new colonies, fight in the power struggle between the Corvo and the Iz'kal and their Gods, or stand by waiting to enjoy the spoils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of FAITH's blend of science fiction RPG and Boardgame, each player has a hand of custom playing cards. These cards can be used to resolve the different actions and confrontations that arise during a game. Additionally, the most important pieces of equipment and the NPCs come in illustrated reference cards. All those cards provide a nice visual reference and contain all the rules necessary to use the relevant piece of equipment or NPC without having to refer to the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system allows for &amp;quot;Luck Management&amp;quot; gameplay to arise: players can decide when their &amp;quot;bad rolls&amp;quot; are going to happen (when they play low cards) and when the moment has come for their characters to shine, playing their court cards and succeeding against all odds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
