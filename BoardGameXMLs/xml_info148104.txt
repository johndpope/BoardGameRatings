			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Repair Bay is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, floor plan of a scifi repair bay, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes the VTT (jpeg) files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card version contains eighteen, double-sided card tiles. Each over-sized tile is 8&amp;rdquo;x10&amp;rdquo; and printed on sturdy 12 point card stock. The UV coating on the tiles keeps them spill resistant, lets you peel transparent tape on and off them without damaging the tile, and allows you to mark the tiles with dry wipe markers then wipe them clean. As you can see in the images below, the card version has the square grid overlay on one side and the hex grid overlay on the other side. We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out. The full layout map is not included with the printed card pages to reduce their cost to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We found this machine floating in the debris field. It&amp;rsquo;s of a highly advanced technology that we&amp;rsquo;ve never encountered before. Do you think its possible to analyze and repair it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Repair Bay is a single map featuring a large repair bay with a small diagnostic room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Repair Bay is meant to be used in near or far future science games, but could be adapted as a cutting edge high tech repair facility in a modern setting. The repair bay would also make an excellent cargo bay as well for a spaceship, space station, or star port or even a room in a modern industrial facility or warehouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One module involving the Repair Bay starts with a cargo freighter hauling back a strange machine. A combination of metal and crystal it is quite unlike anything the crew of the cargo freighter has ever seen. They haul it into a star port or space station and bring it to the repair bay for a sensor scan and possible repair. The engineering crew&amp;rsquo;s initial scan determines that the metal and crystal needed to repair the machine are elements they have never encountered. The cargo freighter is ordered to turn over any minerals they recovered in their salvage operation. The space station attempts to communicate with the crew of the cargo freighter, but get nothing but static.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters and a security team are sent in to investigate the cargo freighter. About halfway there, the alarm klaxons sound with lights blinking red, and the bridge relays that the docking area 1 has been sealed to prevent the entire ship from decompression. When they arrive, they find the emergency airlocks clamped down and the docking area sealed. The cargo freighter has a massive tear in the side, as if something cut it apart from the inside. The docking area shows signs of similar damage. Tracks have been cut into the corridors of the station that look like claw prints. They lead to the repair bay. Once at the repair bay, the player characters see a horrifying sight. Creatures of metal and crystal are incorporating machines, mechs, and other drones, growing and expanding. For some reason, they shun bonding with the machine brought back by the crew to the repair bay, but are definitely trying to form a wall of metal around the machine. Its up to the Player Characters to somehow stop these creatures and save the repair bay and likely the entire space station or star port from complete synchronization with the creatures. If the defeat the creatures, they can use any remaining minerals to repair the machine. Once the machine is repaired it whirrs to life, giving a robotic warning about the dangers of the silicon-based life forms in the asteroid field that bond with machines. It then goes about absorbing all of the remaining materials nearby whose origins were from within the asteroid belt if allowed to do so. It tells them that he is made from the same materials as the creatures, the reason they cannot take over him unlike the other machines. The machine requests to be repaired fully (its propulsion systems are down, which caused it to shut down in the field) and then brought back to the asteroid field to continue his vigilance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
