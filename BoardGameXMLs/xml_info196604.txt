			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Using ERA players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ERA you can create Rolemaster characters and then manage their adventures. Players can also monitor their characters from their mobile devices as the action progresses. But the real magic comes when you start spell slinging. In the free base ERA product you will find 2 sample spell lists, plus the fire bolt attack table along with the heat critical table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This feature package adds all spells, attack and critical tables in all three volumes of RMSS/RMFRP Spell Law. Let your mage learn from the extensive RMFRP spell list selection. All Spell Law spell lists with the complete description of each spell will be at your disposal. Once learned by a character, ERA will display all available spells during the adventure, so that the player can access all descriptions, and the GM can easily indicate each casting, with the option of obtaining automatic computation of penalties depending on preparation rounds, use of hands, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when the elements are involved, you can now resolve directed and area elemental attacks with the corresponding 7 tables, proceeding with the automatic lookup in the 4 elemental critical tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
