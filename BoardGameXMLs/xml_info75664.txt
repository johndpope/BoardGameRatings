			<description>The agents (which aren't assigned to individual players - anyone can move any agent) start at the center of the board. From there they are moved towards face-down disks which, when flipped up, show opponents and the agents which are necessary to defeat these. A disk is flipped open when a new agent moves into a position next to it. Then all other agents (those not adjacent to that disk) are moved back to the board center and the disk is flipped back again, unless all necessary agents are in place to defeat it. In that case, the active player gets the disk (it counts victory points).&lt;br/&gt;Movement is determined by dice rolls. All movement points have to be used before a disk can be flipped over.&lt;br/&gt;When all opponents are defeated, the player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
