			<description>The young magicians are back in Der geheimnisvolle Spiegel (The Mysterious Mirror), exploring a house and seeing what they can find when they look in the mirror. Even better, they want to get their fellow magicians to guess the shapes of what they draw in the mirror!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, players each take a magician tile and slide it into the bottom of one of the tile ladders; they also shuffle the 46 &amp;quot;magic symbol&amp;quot; tiles, each of which shows a line drawing of a familiar item, e.g., candle, butterfly, arrow, spider's web, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player draws a tile, takes the magic wand, and &amp;quot;draws&amp;quot; the image seen on this tile onto the back of the large &amp;quot;mysterious mirror&amp;quot; with the light of the wand. The other players try to guess the image drawn; the first player to do so gets to draw with the wand next, while the previous drawer places that tile into the bottom of her tile ladder. Players keep taking turns this way until someone pops her magician tile out of the top of the ladder, winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With two players, Der geheimnisvolle Spiegel is a co-operative game, with players taking turns drawing an image that the other player must guess. If a player draws three times and her fellow magician still can't guess, then the tile is placed into a third tile ladder. If this ladder fills before one of the magician's ladders, then they both lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
