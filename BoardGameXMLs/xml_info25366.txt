							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cowboy Riders and Indians</name>
									
			<description>This is a very old children's game that has no dice.  Instead, there is a large stand-up metal wheel that acts as a spinner.  The colorful board shows a single path from an old west town to a fort.  The spaces along the path give events of a shootout between cowboys and Indians.  (The players are the cowboys.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
