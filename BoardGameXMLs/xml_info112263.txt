			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place on Adventure Island! (exclamation point required), a largish tropical island far from the trade lanes. Strangely, Adventure Island! doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to stay in any particular place for long; sometimes it appears to be in the Caribbean, other times in the South Pacific, and even on occasion in the Indian Ocean. Those who have been there and lived to tell the tale suppose Adventure Island! only appears where and when somebody goes to look for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters can choose between the five main archetypes. To create a character, use the rules described in the System DL ruleset up until you add skills. Each archetype has five defining skills, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have 8 points to divide up only among those skills. Then you&amp;rsquo;ll receive 4 more points to spend on optional skills, or add to your existing skills, as you see fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
