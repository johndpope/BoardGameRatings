			<description>From the makers of Icehouse comes a new collection of games designed for their hit game Treehouse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3House contains three games that can be played using three copies of Treehouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Ice:  You need a three-digit password to hack into the computer system, but the Intrusion Countermeasure System (ICE) is waiting to get you if you have the wrong code!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martian Chess:  Using your pieces in a corner of the board, position your pieces to attack and capture pieces from other players.  Lose all your pieces and it's game over!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binary Homeworlds:  In this two-player adaptation of the popular Homeworlds game, your pieces become a space fleet trying to control your sector of space.  Build new ships, explore the galaxy, and attack your opponents!  Protect your home world at all costs or it's game over!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
