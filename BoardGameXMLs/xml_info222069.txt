			<description>Berdolock`s Dungeon - An Ascdungeon initiave&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello fellow player!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for play Berdolock's Dungeon. It's good to see people playing retrogames, and have fun. But the adventure not end in this time. The main goal is:build two or more levels for week and put in the air (for a long time...). But the main idea is : put the guys to design new levels for the adventure. If you like to help send your idea and I'll analyze and if the main idea is cool, I'll implement it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I based my idea in art collectives like Blocktronics, and I&amp;acute;d really like to construct and develop a textmode adventure game. It&amp;acute;s only the beggining...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you like to submmit any ANSI art to game, please feel free to talk an send some ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controls&lt;br/&gt;Directional arrows - move and jump&lt;br/&gt;G (only in chapters screen) - cheat! choose level (with mouse)&lt;br/&gt;C (only in chapters screen) - open all levels&lt;br/&gt;ESC - Exit cheat screen and return in game to splash screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
