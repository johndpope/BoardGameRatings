							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silver Cup Sailboat Racing Game</name>
									
			<description>A simple sailboat racing game where the players race along a track around the board. Movement is governed by a spinner. Players may be confronted with trivia questions (regarding sailing) during the game - a correct answer moves a boat forward and an incorrect answer moves a boat backward. Additional cards are drawn during the game which provide further information regarding sailing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
