							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Camp Wicakini 3: Wanagi Mato Lives! (Savage Worlds Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five years after the horrible disaster that resulted in a total loss of Camp Wicakini, it's been rebuilt.  New counselors, new buildings, new everything...except for one man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new caretaker, Max Mason, was one of the last campers to stay at Wicakini.  He survived the initial zombie onslaught, and then the government came and rescued him.  He has sworn that what happened on that fateful day almost exactly 5 years ago would never happen again, and this time, he's prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the blight of Camp Wicakini, Wanagi Mato, is also prepared, and has been plotting revenge for 5 years...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sandbox style adventure follows the first Camp Wicakini adventures.  The camp has been completely rebuilt, but in true slasher-film style, it's been rebuilt exactly the way it was.  There's a few twists on this one, and unlike the first two which were campy (pardon the pun) this one is straight up horror survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a new addition to the grounds, a Ranger Station, put up by the government to help monitor any suspicious activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maps have graciously been included by Fabled Environments once again, and this adventure is completely compatible with the map pack from Camp Wicakini: Part II (Savage Worlds Edition)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get in there and survive!  This adventure is the perfect follow up for the first two adventures, and it's ideal for conventions or a quick pick-up game, with pre-generated characters, equipment lists, and everything you need to run it the second you pick it up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
