			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to COSMIC QUEST, a SKETCH roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COSMIC QUEST is an extremely simple roleplaying system that utilises a single six-sided die, otherwise known as a D6. The D6 is used for every aspect of the game. This is a game about travelling the cosmos, discovering new species and cultures, and going into the depths of space and revealing the secrets hidden away within the stars. Basically, it's Star Trek without all the complicated bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difference is the style - you see, I'm a massive fan of the Golden Age of Sci-Fi, from about the 1930s to the 1950s. Not only that, I'm a big fan of the old adventure serials, such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, and 50s hero Dan Dare. These guys got stuck in, had adventures and threw punches without all the moralising that seems to go on in modern sci-fi. They wanted to explore, discover, meet and greet aliens and protect their world from the bad guys out there in the deep black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So think of this game as a comedy version of Flash Gordon mixed with Red Dwarf, Galaxy Quest, Futurama and Star Trek. That'll give you a pretty good indication of what this game is all about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can run the game deeper than that if you wish - there's no reason why you can't - but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to improvise the extras. These rules just cover the adventure side of things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
