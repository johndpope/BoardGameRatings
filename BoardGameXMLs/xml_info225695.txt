			<description>A casual and fast card game extracted from the Living Starship universe where each player is a ship captain vying to have their crew complete the most work to earn the admiral's attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for 3-7 players and features a hexagonal deck of 98 cards that come in each of the seven Fleet Divisions (suits): Agency, Flight, Engineering, Health, Operations, Science and Tactical. Each suit has 14 cards - 7 officers and 7 enlisted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round there is an increasing number of mission tokens (points) to be claimed by the crew cards. Officer cards always outwork (claim tokens of the same color) enlisted cards, even if their numerical value is lower, but they can only be played in singles. For the cost of one of your points, you can play a pair of enlisted whose value exceeds an officer's of the same color/suit and take their claimed mission tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck is seeded with 7 SETBACK cards and the game ends when the last one is drawn. The player with the most points accumulated from claiming job tokens is the winner and is hailed by the admiralty as the most formidable captain in the Fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
