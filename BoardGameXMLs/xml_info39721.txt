			<description>This scenario pack covers actions that involved airborne and paratroopers units.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some of its modules is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sola Airfield, Norway, 9 April 1940: The Germans&amp;rsquo; plan for the invasion of Norway and Denmark was code named &amp;quot;Operation Weser Exercise&amp;quot; and was under the command of General von Falkenhorst; it would be the first major combined air-land-sea effort in history. In a bold and daring plan the First Battalion of Fallschirmj&amp;auml;ger Regiment 1, under the command of Major Erich Walther, would attempt to capture four objectives; Aalborg airfield and the Vordingborg Bridge in Denmark and Norwegian airfields at Sola and Fornebu... &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Gorki, Russia, 14 October 1941: Early in October 1941, the Wehrmacht&amp;rsquo;s Army Group Centre drove 200 miles in five days, its panzers crossing the Berezina and Dnepr Rivers. However, these panzer spearheads had also outraced their supply lines; forcing some 300 panzers of Heinz Guderian&amp;rsquo;s 2nd Panzer Group to hold while their supplies caught up. Seizing upon this opportunity to destroy the German panzer force while it sat with its fuel tanks dry, the Soviet Western Front Headquarters ordered its IV Airborne Corps to detach a brigade for a special operation...&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Northeast of Gela, Sicily, 11 July 1943: Just over a year after its activation, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under the capable leadership of Colonel James M. &amp;quot;Jumping Jim&amp;quot; Gavin, made its first regimental size combat parachute attack as part of the Allied Invasion of Sicily known as &amp;quot;Operation Husky.&amp;quot;  The 505th&amp;rsquo;s objective was to drop behind enemy lines around Gela, close off roads leading to beaches and secure the drop zone for further use...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South of St. Come-du-Mont, France, 7 June 1944: Shortly after midnight on June 6, paratroopers of General Maxwell D. Taylor's 101st Airborne Division became the first Allied soldiers to touch French soil during the Invasion of Normandy. The 101st had been assigned the initial mission of securing Exits 1 and 2 from Utah Beach and having secured them on D-Day, Taylor immediately dispatched the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment southwest to conduct a reconnaissance towards the road junction south of St. Come-du-Mont...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bois de Bavent, France, 29 June 1944: By late June, the British 6th Airborne Division had settled into a defence role east of the Orne River; despite this role, the division continued to patrol aggressively, seeking and wreaking havoc upon the enemy wherever possible. At no place was this havoc more evident than in the forested area called Bois de Bavent, where a cat and mouse game was taking place between the division&amp;rsquo;s patrols and the German&amp;rsquo;s outposts...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North of Heelsum, Holland, 18 September 1944: As Operation Market-Garden commenced, ad-hoc German defences were asked to oppose some of the initial paratroop landings.  One such case occurred west of Arnhem, where NCOs from an SS-Officer Cadet school, personnel from a Kriegsmarine unit and Luftwaffe ground crews attacked the 1st Airborne Airlanding Brigade...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
