			<description>Players explore the best ways to process dredging spoils. The game was created for the dutch ministry of water management by the dutch organization for applied research TNO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players place a tile on the board in Carcassonne fashion. However, to put a meeple on the tile, one has to answer a question about the dredging process. The player who scored the most points, and knows most about dredging, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
