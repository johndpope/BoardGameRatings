							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Obsidian: The Age of Judgement</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The corebook to the Obsidian universe, this book has all the rules, mechanics, history, setting, and players that are used in the game. Obsidian is set in the 2299, as a desperate humanity wages war against the manifested legions of Hell itself. In the final battle, the last vestiges of mankind construct a fortified city to hold the Daemonic hordes at bay. Within this city, massive corporations vie for power, Daemonic Kults carve a bloody swath through its citizenry, and technology has surpassed the limits of the flesh. Take care when choosing your allies, even more when choosing your enemies. This is the Zone. Obsidian allows the player to take control over any type of character, from the infernal kultist to the self proclaimed messiah. In between are littered a menagerie of corporate soldiers and cybernetically-clad street assassins. Included in the book are rules to create Daemons from scratch, security systems, corporate construction rules, and of course all the tools necessary to make and play an Obsidian character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
