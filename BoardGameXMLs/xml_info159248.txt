							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chase</name>
									
			<description>The Chase is played on a square wooden board with a round pit, the &amp;quot;hideout,&amp;quot; carved out of the center.  Four lines of small holes extend vertically and horizontally from the pit to the sides of the board, and continue around all four sides making a border.  Near each corner of the board are four more small holes.  Printed on the board over the lines of small holes are the outlines of footprints leading in one direction, ultimately towards the hideout.  Printed over the groupings of four holes are a bomb, a noose, a gun, and a knife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four players have four pegs each in their own color.  Play begins with their four pieces resting in one of the four corner groupings.  Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine the length of their move.  Any one of the player's pegs may be moved, but most be moved the exact number of footprints rolled on the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If landing on a hole occupied by another player, the first peg is returned to its home base to begin again, and the peg in play is moved five extra spaces.  Players may not land on a footprint occupied by one of their own pegs; they must choose to move a different peg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hideout may only be reached by an exact roll of the die.  If no other moves are possible, that player forfeits the turn and the peg remains in place.  The first player to move all four pegs into the hideout wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
