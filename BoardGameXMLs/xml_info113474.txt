			<description>From the back of the box...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Deceive and Decide is a hilarious word-bluff game: the players deceive each other with made-up definitions to words you probably never heard.  Then they decide which outrageous definition is correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deceive and Decide contains 1000 obscure words complete with pronunciations which are known only to the poker-faced Word Master.  Each player concocts his own whacky definition and the Word master reads them all allowed, including the real one.  The players vote on the definition that seems most plausable - and everyone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game goes 'round the table at a razzle-dazzle pace as each player yakes his turn at Word Master.  The definitions range from ludicrous to bizarre - if you can stop laughing long enough, you may even want to add up the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine creating defintiions for words such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beccabunga&lt;br/&gt;Gardyloo&lt;br/&gt;Dorking&lt;br/&gt;Xylophonist&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game sounds similar to Balderdash, but there is no board and the card layout and playing equipment is quite different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
