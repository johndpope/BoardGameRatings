			<description>The game was patented in 1908. &amp;quot;It is listed in the Gamages Christmas Bazaar Catalogue of 1913, where it is priced at 2s 6d and described as an 'exciting war game, played by 2 or 4 persons by pieces representing Generals, Cavalry, Guns, Infantry and Ammunition, on a battlefield&amp;quot;. (from C. G. Lewin, Wargames and Their History).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle is played on a regular 8x8 chess board. Pieces that are square tiles with symbols, letters, and digits on to describe the type, movement and attack patterns of each. When played with four players, the pieces on each side is divided between two players so that one commands the eight infantry units and the other player commands the remaining eight units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
