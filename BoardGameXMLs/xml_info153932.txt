							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Phenomenon</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phenomenon is a game about people with super powers. It is not a game about superheroes, superheroes wear tights, are good guys and their stories usually have a happy ending. The Phenomenon is a game about people with super powers, ordinary people who suddenly gain the power to do the impossible. But the power corrupts them and their story turns into a race against the clock, will they be able to do that which is important before they are consumed by the corruption?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phenomenon is a game for three GMs and one player and plays in three to four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
