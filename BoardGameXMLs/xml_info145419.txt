			<description>It's summertime and that means it's garage sale season! It's time to get rid of your old junk and buy some new junk. In Garage Sale, players simultaneously put up items for sale and negotiate to buy them from each other. The goal is to collect sets of items while maintaining cash flow. The catch is that once you feel you are done collecting a particular set, you can't go back and add to it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Garage Sale is played over four rounds. In each round, there is one turn per player. On a turn, each player puts up a card from his hand for sale. Players then negotiate to buy those cards using coins and dollars (represented by face-down cards from a player's hand). Once all negotiations are done, one player is allowed to add cards to his storage pile. The cards stored will add to his income this turn (cards and coins) as well as adding to his final score at the end of the game. The scoring is based on the amount of stored cards, bonus stars, sets of colors, and remaining coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
