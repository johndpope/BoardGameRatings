			<description>An Exciting Car Touring Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start at London, tour Great Britain and be the first to return. But be careful - the road is full of hazards laid by other players! Take the fast route and meet the hazards head on, or take the slow route and collect protection cards. Which is the best route to win the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to go around the circuit and be the first to return to London.  The first player to do this is the winner.  Instead of a turn, you can lay hazards for other players.  When taking the longer route, you can stop at AA Service Centres and collect protection cards or take the shorter route and pass the other drivers.  If you land on another player's hazard counter he hands you a hazard card.  Do you have the right protection card? If not, call the AA van. When it arrives you can travel again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game Board&lt;br/&gt;     5 Cars&lt;br/&gt;     4 AA Vans&lt;br/&gt;     5 Triangle Warning Signs&lt;br/&gt;     20 Hazard Counters&lt;br/&gt;     25 Hazard Cards&lt;br/&gt;     20 Protection Cards&lt;br/&gt;     1 Die&lt;br/&gt;     Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
