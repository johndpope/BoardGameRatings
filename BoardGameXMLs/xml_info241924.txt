							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Conquest</name>
									
			<description>Object of this game is to conquer as many constellations (groups of stars) as you can.  You conquer a constellation when you get your colored discs on more than have the number of stars in the constellation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play takes place on a 34&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; mat with images of the constellations.  Players roll dice to move their pieces around the track on the outside.  You either stop on spaces with color\star combinations that allow you to put a marker on a star or stars in a constellation or you land on spaces that allow you to take a card and follow the instructions on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two other variations of game play include The Game of Polaris (The North Star) in which players start in a different constellation and move towards Polaris.  Final variations include a Fast Game Variation which allows you to just conquer stars based on dice throw instead of moving around the track on the game mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
