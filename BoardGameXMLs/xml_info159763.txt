Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf was supposed to be a console version of the first Witcher game that was built from the ground up for Widescreen Games' DaVinci Engine and featured a host of differences. It would have featured a new interface, redesigned boss battles, new music, some new models, and a redesigned character development system, in addition to an entirely new action-oriented combat system with enhanced AI, additional motion-capture animations and the ability to directly control Geralt's defensive maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On April 29, 2009 it was announced that the production of the game had been halted due to late payments from CD Projekt to the French developers of the console version, Widescreen Games. A release from CD Projekt's CEO Michał Kiciński stated that payments were delayed due to Widescreen games not meeting development deadlines, additionally stating that &amp;quot;technical incapability created a risk of missing planned quality&amp;quot; and that CD Projekt had ended their association with Widescreen games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
