							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">x6 Core Rules (2nd edition)</name>
									
			<description>x6 is a universal system for pen-and-paper roleplaying games. This core edition presents the basic game mechanics comprising the x6 system, along with a basic selection of character abilities and equipment that would suit a contemporary game setting. With some work, the information presented here can be adapted to suit a science fiction, fantasy, horror or almost any other roleplaying genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 2nd edition is an amalgamation of x6 and another generic system, Multi10. The core resolution mechanics of the first edition have been retained and enhanced, while most of the character building and combat systems have been imported from Multi10. The result should be a capable game system with a decent amount of character customisation and fast combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
