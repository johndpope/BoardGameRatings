			<description>This game has hit full release as of Dec. 20th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BATTLEGROUNDS is a competitive survival shooter. Players are dropped into a wide, open area, and they must scavenge various weapons, gear, and items to buff themselves up for inevitable conflict.  During the course of a match the battlefield slowly shrinks, adding pressure to all in its grip. Players can play Solo against other Solo players, in groups of two (Duo mode) against other two-man groups, or in Squad mode with up to four teammates.  The game offers vehicles including motorcycles, automobiles, or boats to aid in traversing the distances. Games are one life only and you're out, adding to the tension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://battlegrounds.gamepedia.com/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS_Wiki&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://battlegrounds.gamepedia.com/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROU...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
