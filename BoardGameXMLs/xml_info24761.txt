							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The AAA Safe Driver Game</name>
									
			<description>From the insert:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this game is to be the first player to land on each of the six blue Safe Driver Stars by exact roll of 1 or 2 dice while traveling clockwise around the gameboard. Player draws the Safe Driver Card from the deck on gameboard which matches the Safe Driver Star on which he has landed. First player to reach HOME with all six different Safe Driver Cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parts list: 1 gameboard and box with rules platform and plastic tray; 14 Violation cards; 4 AAA Membership cards; 4 sets of 6 Safe Driver Cards; 2 dice; 4 playing pieces; 1 returnable market research card; and approximately $850 play money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- - - - - - - -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The market research card (return address: Interstate Games, 35 Morrison St. Manchester, NH 03104) asks if you enjoyed playing the game, found the directions easy to follow; learned more about AAA services, etc. It also asks how many times you played it and with what ages of players (10-15, 15-20, 20-50, and over 50). Box says for ages 8-80.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, I wonder how many surveys were returned to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
