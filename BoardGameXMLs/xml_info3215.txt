			<description>Based on information from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart is about buying, selling and using Smarts in Smartcity. 'Eating' the Smarts determines your emotional situation on the Emotionhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Smart players struggle to be the best Smartdealer and&lt;br/&gt;to become the owner of three new Smartshops. To do this, players buy, sell and use Smarts in the twelve neighborhoods (gameboard).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In trading Smarts, you compare the popularity of different types of Smarts in the various neighborhoods, your distance from the neighborhoods in which there is demand for Smarts, the amount of various Smarts others want to  sell and the amount of Euro's others bid on new Smarts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trade is connected to the four actions in every round.&lt;br/&gt;The Smarts you supply but don't sell are the Smarts you 'eat'. This 'eating' influences your emotional situation. How Relaxed, Dull, Hyper and Heavy you are, is indicated on the Emotionhead display. &lt;br/&gt;The corresponding actions can be used to improve your Smarttrade. So it's important to work on your emotional state.  Be careful of partial or even total epileptic attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available tactics include good bidding, good selling and good 'eating'. Doing well in one of these gives opportunities to do well in the other two. But sometimes it is important to 'take it easy'. In many cases the winner at the end doesn't sell in every round and doesn't play a large role in every auction. The best advice: play Smart!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A2-sized city board, painted by Annette Wiesman&lt;br/&gt;     real Smarts (actual candies, made of sugar, water soluble)&lt;br/&gt;     real half walnut shells &lt;br/&gt;     play Euros &lt;br/&gt;     Emotionhead board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
