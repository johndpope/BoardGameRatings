			<description>Grubfist: 3-7 Players. Plays in 15 minutes. Matching / Trading Game. Comes with 7 sets of goblin goodies and 6 gemstones. Standard and optional rules included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grubfist is a game of matching sets with things you might find in a goblin&amp;rsquo;s belt pouch. Players of all ages will find the game tempting to pick up and play. While passing frogs, ants, bits of chain or blunted fish hooks, players may feel the urge to cheat&amp;hellip; which is not only allowed, but totally expected from time to time in a goblin&amp;rsquo;s cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes matching sets of goblin goodies which bring a unique feeling to game play, bright plastic gemstones for the final grubbing of each round, and instructions for standard and optional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep your favorite goblin treasure, and pass the unwanted to your fellow goblins. Cheat if you feel you can get away with it, and when someone grabs for the gemstones&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t get kicked out of the cave. There can only be one goblin king!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
