			<description>From the instruction booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;The player to collect the most fish before the ice is broken wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;-4 tiles with 2 fish on them&lt;br/&gt;-12 tiles with 1 fish on them&lt;br/&gt;-1 penguin tile&lt;br/&gt;-1 broken ice tile&lt;br/&gt;-1 Skating Bear pawn with stand&lt;br/&gt;-Instruction booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;1. Remove one 1-fish tile and one 2-fish tile from the game.  Shuffle the remaining 16 tiles and arrange them picture side down in a 4x4 grid.&lt;br/&gt;2. Place the Skating Bear next to the tile grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;1. Youngest player goes first.  Place the Skating Bear on any tile.&lt;br/&gt;2. Lift up the bear and turn over the tile.  If you see a picture of one or two fish on the tile place it in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;3. Place the Skating Bear in the empty space for the next player to move.&lt;br/&gt;4. Play continues to the left following the same game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turning over the Penguin tile&lt;br/&gt;If you turn over the penguin you must give up one of your fish tiles.  Take the tile and put it aside out of play.  Your turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turning over the Broken Ice tile&lt;br/&gt;If at any time during the game a player turns over the broken ice tile, the game is over.  Each player now counts all the fish pictured on their tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most fish wins the game.  If there is a tie for the most fish then all tied players are winners!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;For a quicker game, try a 3x3 tile grid but remember to keep the penguin and broken ice tile in the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Restorage&lt;br/&gt;Save your package because after you play the game you can put all the parts back in the bag and reseal it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
