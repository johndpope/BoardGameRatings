							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monty&#039;s Moon</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A monkey is sad because he is the only one without a girlfriend. He hears a rumor there are monkeys on the moon and becomes determined to reach it. A fairly typical launch title with upgrades though with more objects to avoid than most. Gain bananas to buy upgrades in several areas to improve your flight abilities or banana numbers. This game also has a number of achievements you can try for. This game is also more difficult than most launch titles. Even after full upgrades you will have to try to reach the objective of getting to the moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
