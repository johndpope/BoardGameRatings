			<description>This game is played with a Spanish deck of cards (standard deck without the 8s, 9s and 10s). After cards are dealt, players bid. There are three possibilities, either pass, or playing with a partner or playing alone. Then the winner, depending on his bid, plays alone or calls a card, and the holder of that card becomes his/her partner (but it is not announced and becomes evident only during the play). Then tricks are played, and the highest bidder has to win 6 out of 10 tricks in order to win the contract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
