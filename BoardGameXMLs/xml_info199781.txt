			<description>オリンピック熱狂遊戯盤 [= Olympic frenzy board game] &lt;br/&gt;Board game issued August 1932 as a supplement to volume 19, no. 8 of the monthly magazine &amp;quot;Shonen Club&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced at the time of the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Four players represent the USA, France, Japan and the UK. Each has 4 starting counters (athletes), who must move to the centre of the circular board (bypassing the unplayable spaces representing Finnish, Norwegian, German and Canadian competitors), collect a 'laurel wreath' and return to the goal behind the player's 4 starting spots. &lt;br/&gt;Paper-scissors-rock is used to determine which player is able to move one of his athletes to an adjacent space. If a player's athlete lands on another player's, the two play paper-scissors-rock again: the winner can move to an adjacent space, the loser's is eliminated. &lt;br/&gt;The reverse side of the board features name and photographs of all the Japanese athletes who competed at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
