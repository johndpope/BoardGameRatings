							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nine Homeworlds</name>
									
			<description>Nine Homeworlds is a 9-Card Nanogame, in which the players assume the role of norse clan leaders who want to collect as much glory as possible before the end of the worlds approaches. Dice rolling and tactical movement are just as important as wise calculation of the enemies' possibilities to gather as much glory as possible before the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and choose whether they want to move one of their heroes to another world or quest a world they are currently at. By moving into better positions, players try to gain maximum points from questing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
