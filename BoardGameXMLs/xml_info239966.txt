							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flies in the Food Truck</name>
									
			<description>How far would you go to help shoo the flies away from this food truck? Would you sing a song, act crazy, or maybe roll a 4-of-a-kind? In this game, you want to help Pesto flick away the flies from his food truck, but this dice rolling game might require you to run in circles or more before you can really help our friend Pesto!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the icky flies on the food pictures can be put on the pawn stands, and be sure to set them in the middle of yourself and whomever you are playing with. You both want to have a set of 5 dice and make sure to pick a character from the set of cards. You are going to pick a new card in each round, but before a new round starts you must act out or do whatever your character card tells you to do! Next, you are going to start rolling your dice until someone gets a 4-of-a-kind. Once someone gets the number, they can knock down one of the bug food cards. The first player to knock over the required number of cards is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
