							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ambition &amp; Avarice</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambition and Avarice is an action-adventure roleplaying game with an easy-to-understand OSR chassis. The characters are rough and ready adventurers. No more moralizing paladins and clerics. Even the religious characters are willing to get a little dirty in the pursuit of their goals.&lt;br/&gt;The game brings a fresh look to medieval fantasy with 10 unique classes that each bring something special to the table. Each class features; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Expertise in a class-specific task; like the Sorcerer's counterspelling ability or a Cultist's ability to sacrifice humanoids to curry favor with their god.&lt;br/&gt;     Identification of something in the world; like the Priest's ability to identify divine symbols and beings or the Savage's ability to spot weakness in combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Companions to serve as henchmen; like the Knave's ability to recruit spies or the Conjurer's ability to create imps to serve them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five magic-using classes have a varied selection of new and exciting spells. There are easy methods to create your own enchantments, raise unique undead to serve you, or craft cursed items to give to your enemies. The non-magical classes have their own rich choices and don't fade away in importance as the magical characters advance in level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These classes can then be combined with 10 classic fantasy races; from elves and dwarves to orcs and lizardfolk. You can combine them however you wish, creating everything from goblin knights to dwarven brigands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire package is designed to allow quick character generation and presented in a format that is clear and easy to read. The text is packed with expanations of not just the rules, but the reasons behind the rules. It is an ideal choice to hand to a new player who is looking to get into the great game, but turned away by thick rulebooks with byzantine organization. The adventuring mechanics are also OSR compatible and allow easy integration with a variety of old school campaign material. You can pick up this game, grab an old module, and get playing in a very short amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
