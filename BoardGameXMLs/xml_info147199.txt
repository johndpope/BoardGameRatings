			<description>Zombie Solitaire is like regular Klondike solitaire with one big difference: you get to save survivors and destroy Zombies!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Solitaire requires [2] decks of regular playing cards (including one &amp;ldquo;joker&amp;rdquo;), One deck will be used for the [52] cards and [1] joker.  The other deck will supply the [7] zombies &amp;quot;the logo side of the cards&amp;quot; and four sets of A thru 6 for the [4] ammo boxes with 6 shots each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could use 4d6 instead of the four sets of A thru 6 for the ammo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS:&lt;br/&gt;Two normal decks of cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [1] 52 card deck for basic game play.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [1] Joker, which represents you!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [1] second 52 CARD deck, from which 31 cards are needed. These cards represent zombies that must be destroyed and ammo for your gun.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] six-sided dice, representing a supply of ammunition for your gun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Solitaire can also be played using a specialized PnP version &amp;ldquo;Zombie deck&amp;rdquo;.  &lt;br/&gt;PnP cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] Ace: a Safe House&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] King: Grandpa &amp;ndash; the only character willing to sacrifice himself for his family&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] Queen: Grandma&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] Jack: Dad&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 10: Mom&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 9: the children and their friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 8: the children and their friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 7: the children and their friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 6: the children and their friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 5: the children and their friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 4: the children and their friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 3: the children and their friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [4] 2: the children and their friends&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [1] Joker: You, the armed and dangerous hero&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    [7] Zombies - Cards from the second deck (logo side only)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    4D6 die: ammo box (6 rounds each)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Solitaire is set up like regular &amp;ldquo;Klondike&amp;rdquo; solitaire with 7 stacks, four collection zones for aces, and a draw pile &amp;ndash; all from a single deck of cards.  In addition, 10 cards from a second deck are set, faced down, in a pile to the right of the 7 stacks. The joker is placed below the zombie pile, with the [4] dice off to the side.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Draw pile: crowd of survivors from the zombie apocalypse&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    7 stacks: temporary shelters to which some of the survivors have fled and others may follow. Cards that are face-down are temporarily hidden from view; when they are turned over, they can be spotted by the zombies&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    10-card pile (from second deck): zombie horde &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Collection zones: areas in which safe houses may be established&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;The game is played like regular Klondike solitaire, with the usual options &amp;ndash; moving cards from stack to stack, turning cards over when they become open, pulling the aces out and setting cards on top of them as appropriate &amp;ndash; until the first card is drawn from the deck. That&amp;rsquo;s when the zombies finally arrive &amp;ndash; and all bets are off!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zombie Solitaire, only one survivor card &amp;ndash; the top card of the deck &amp;ndash; is drawn each time.&lt;br/&gt;Play the game as normal, but with the following adjustments:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    You do not have to play a survivor card that you have drawn from the draw pile even if you have an available play. It is always your choice whether or not to play a card.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    You cannot play a survivor card on top of a zombie card.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    You cannot move any card (or stack) that is under attack from a zombie and you cannot move any card (or stack) onto a stack that is under attack from a zombie &amp;ndash; until the zombie is destroyed&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    You do not come under attack for drawing an ace from the survivor draw pile (or from one of the stacks) and setting it up as a safe house and you do not come under attack for moving a survivor to a safe house. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    You can move a king (and its stack) to an empty space on the board without coming under attack as long as there is no zombie on the king's stack. But if you move a king from the draw pile to the board, it will come under attack . &lt;br/&gt;        You do not come under attack when a survivor moves from stack to stack.&lt;br/&gt;        When you draw the last card from the draw deck and flip the deck over, this causes a zombie to attack the oldest survivor at the bottom of a stack.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;        When a second zombie attacks a stack the lowest card on the stack is eaten but that survivor destroys both of the zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie threat:&lt;br/&gt;Individual zombies are not a threat to the survivors. They are endangered only when two zombies attack at the same time. When a second zombie card is added to a temporary shelter stack, the bottom survivor card is removed from the game (where it will contribute no victory points to the player&amp;rsquo;s total).  The attack will also destroy one of the zombies, whose card is returned to the zombie horde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory:      &lt;br/&gt;The game is over when you no longer have any available moves, no kings to sacrifice and no ammunition.  Count up the number of Safe Houses you established and the number of survivors who made it to a Safe House. You get [1] victory point for each.&lt;br/&gt;A perfect score is 52.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
