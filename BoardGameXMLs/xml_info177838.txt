							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Macromorph</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macromorphs are size-changing super soldiers, able to grow to giant size with a corresponding increase to strength and durability. Macromorphs are physical powerhouses, and their sheer size allows them to dominate any battlefield. A Macromorph&amp;rsquo;s size shifting powers give them tank-like durability- they&amp;rsquo;ll need it because as the single biggest target on the battlefield, Macromorphs draw more fire than any three smaller heroes. Most Macromorphsconfident in their ability to take a shot that would turn a smaller comrade into a fine red mistwouldn&amp;rsquo;t have it any other way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Macromorph Advanced Class can be used in any of Otherverse Games&amp;rsquo; unique D20 Modern campaign settings. Macromorph mercenaries battle psi-capable terrorists in Psi-Watch, and explore uncharted space as members of a superheroic legion of space opera adventurers in Galaxy Command. Activist Macromorphs trade fire with cyber-enhanced terrorists in Otherverse America and battle perverse, skyscraper sized kaiju in Black Tokyo. A modular set of abilities and entry requirements allow you to custom build Macromorphs designed to fit into one of these settings, or Macromorphs can be imported to any D20 Modern setting that incorporates fantastic powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
