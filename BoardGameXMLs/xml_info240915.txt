							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fracas (2002)</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fracas is a strategy game of tactical combat and world conquest. In Fracas, up to six human or computer players duke it out over land and water. Players deploy troops and build ports to attack opponents' countries and defend their own. Fracas now supports network play over a LAN, so you can play with your friends, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything in Fracas is customizable! The maps in the game are always random, allowing players to continually explore the tactical advantages of new worlds. The parameters that govern the size, shape, and mechanics of the world are tunable by the user. There are also multiple computer 'personalities' to play against. With so many options, it's easy to get addicted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a fully-functional map editor for Fracas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
