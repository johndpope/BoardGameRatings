			<description>The All-About-Delaware-Game is an educational exploration of the state of Delaware.  The large six piece board is a relative map of Delaware's three counties, with parks, natural resources, shopping centers, highways and places of interest noted on the board.  Players start at a residence and must travel via dice rolling along the varied highways of Delaware to nine locations, shopping, exploring, and gathering items.  The first player to collect travel cards for everything on their list and return to their residence wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
