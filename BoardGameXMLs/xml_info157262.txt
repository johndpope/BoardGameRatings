							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Galleon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yarr, matey!  This is a map covering four levels of a Galleon-style warship (minus the cannons, of course, since this is meant for fantasy!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the map doesn't detail anything other than the ship decks themselves you have the option of deciding where the ship can be found.  Is it at sea, or is it docked?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If docked, perhaps your players need to sneak aboard for some reason...maybe to retrieve an artifact from the cargo hold, or to free a prisoner, or become stowaways because they simply can't afford passage to wherever they need to go. If the ship is at sea, perhaps your players are merely passengers on a ship and pirates attack?  Perhaps they're looking to do a bit of piracy themselves?  If so, you can print additional ships to create a ship to ship battle, all from the same file!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether its piracy or battling sea monsters on the high seas, if you need a ship for your adventures, this is it. &lt;br/&gt; The ship itself is 140' long and 40' wide at its longest and widest points, respectively.  Four different levels have been fully mapped out - The main deck, captain's quarters, crew quarters, and cargo decks.  Pick which levels you need for your adventure and print away.  Each section of the ship covers 6 pages in length and shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to print, cut, and tape together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details of the Decks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Main Deck (1st Level) - This is the top level, with clear views of the ocean to either side.  (Print pages 1-6 for just this deck)&lt;br/&gt;     Captain's Quarters (2nd Level) - This section maps out the captain's quarters, private quarters that are rented to individuals traveling on the ship, and the 1st Mate's quarters, as well as a private storage area for use by the captain himself or the passengers.  (Print pages 7-12 for just this deck)&lt;br/&gt;     Crew Deck (3rd Level) - This is the crew deck.  It features officers quarters for the lower ranking officers, hammocks for the sailors, a mess area, kitchen, and two storage rooms for the crew's dry goods.  (Print pages 13-18 for just this deck)&lt;br/&gt;     Cargo Hold (4th Level) - This is the cargo hold.  At the aft end of the ship there is a straw littered floor where animals are transported.  At the forward end of the ship you'll find manacles, to be used when passengers or crew get rowdy and have to be jailed somewhere.  And obviously, there is a lot of cargo, though there is plenty of room to add more or take away from the existing cargo as the GM sees fit.  (Print pages 19-24 for just this deck)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1&amp;quot; = 5' Scale.  At this scale, the ship measures out to 140' long at its longest point and 40' wide at its widest.&lt;br/&gt;     45&amp;quot; x 40&amp;quot; in actual size, though each deck of the ship only spans a mere 6 pages (45&amp;quot; long x 10&amp;quot; wide), so putting it together shouldn't take long at all!&lt;br/&gt;     Square, Hex, or No Grid versions.  Choose which type of grid you want to use and off you go!&lt;br/&gt;     Full Color versions &amp;ndash; These maps are printer intensive, full color versions of each level.&lt;br/&gt;     No Decoration versions - For those that wish to populate each part of the ship with their own furniture and objects, there is a stripped down, no deco version for you.&lt;br/&gt;     VTT Map &amp;ndash; If you prefer to play your games online, there is an included VTT map properly sized for VTT software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
