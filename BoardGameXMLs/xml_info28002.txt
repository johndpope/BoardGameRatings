			<description>From the press release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 108 cards for three to six players. Kids and adults can match wits against opponents while trying to rid themselves of all the cards in their hands. But in this new card game, opponents can openly discuss how to stop each other (within limits). Trying to stop someone from going out normally occurs when a player only has 2 or 3 cards left in his or her hand. The game scenario is in constant change. One minute a player is on offense, trying to win himself. The next minute he&amp;rsquo;s on defense as he works individually or as a team with other players to stop someone from going out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
