							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diverse Roles: A Clement Sector Career Catalog</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will you choose to be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present our newest book in the Clement Sector line of products. Diverse Roles: A Clement Sector Career Catalog presents 19 career tracks for use in building Clement Sector characters. These include careers such as Belters, Clergy, Politicians, Scavengers, and much more.  While these career tracks are specifically designed for use with Gypsy Knights Games' Clement Sector setting, they can also be used with any Cepheus Engine or 2d6 SF RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages are the tools to allow your players to create characters from a wide variety of careers.  Some are honest jobs, some are illegal professions, and yet others are those which tread in both worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a method for creating non-random characters for Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
