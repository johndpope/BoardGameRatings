			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The doors of the inn open and two half-orcs larger than elephants enter, scrutinizing everybody grimly. One of them makes a sign to the entrance, then a beautiful woman in a figure-hugging silk dress enters the tavern. Her face is almost completely hidden behind a black shroud, her walk is cat-like and she attracts the men's gazes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She approaches the portly innkeeper and talks briefly to him, then he points towards the PCs. The woman sits down at a reserved table behind a screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Straight away, one of the grim half-orcs approaches you and says in perfect Common: Begging your pardon sir, my lady wishes to speak with you, would you be so kind as to follow me to her table?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a generic adventure set in a small town. It can be inserted easily into any campaign in any world. The adventure is designed for a party of 4-5 adventurers of 4-5 levels but it can be scaled easily by modifying the monsters and villains statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User submitted information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is also available in an OSRIC version and an Iron Gauntlets version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
