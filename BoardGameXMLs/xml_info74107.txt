			<description>You command an intrepid starship crew, venturing onto new worlds and charting the unexplored quadrants of deep space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Euro Game #3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boldly go where no one has gone before in Final Frontier, where you command a vaunted starship crew of humans, aliens and robots, venturing onto new worlds and charting the unexplored quadrants of deep space to face fantastic challenges in the best storytelling traditions of episodic space operas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While engaging in heroics and daring-do, relationships can form between your crew-members even as they win fame and experience, so only the best leader managing all of the skills and personalities aboard will triumph at the Final Frontier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Frontier is a card-based adventure game for 2-4 players where players manage the crew of a starship as they perform heroic missions. Players take turns selecting different aspects of the mission (Hostile or Exploration, Deep Space or Planetary, Mission Leader, Number of Crew). Players select which crew will go on the mission based on their statistics. The mission is randomly generated by card draw. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of the mission: success, failure or death. Successfully completing multiple missions earns victory points and possibly crew upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead bridge crew members can be replaced by ensigns. Red Shirts can be substituted to protect your more experienced and valuable crew members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
