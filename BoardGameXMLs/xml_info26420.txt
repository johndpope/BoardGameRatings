All prototypes submitted must conform to the technical and style requirements, fixed components and a given theme which changes every year. Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published.&lt;br/&gt;For more information:&lt;br/&gt;giocoinedito@luccacomicsandgames.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.luccacomicsandgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.luccacomicsandgames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the award was &amp;ldquo;Faeries and Legends&amp;rdquo;; F.A.T.A. (&amp;quot;fata&amp;quot; is Italian for &amp;quot;fairy&amp;quot;) is a very clever and elegant card game that won hands down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features a deck of 110 cards. Each player belongs to a Techno-Fantasy Tribe of faeries and tries to catch the greater number of treasures by playing &amp;quot;tri-spells&amp;quot; (combination of three cards) and/or beating other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his turn, the player may play a special &amp;quot;charm&amp;quot; card, then he may steal a card in front of another player (with a rock-paper-scissors system printed on the cards), then he may finally play up to two cards in front of himself.&lt;br/&gt;Each player have two &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot; columns where playing cards: the first card of a column is played normally, the second card is played rotated by 180&amp;deg;, the third card completes the column (the &amp;quot;Tri-spell&amp;quot;) and must be placed rotated by 90&amp;deg;.&lt;br/&gt;The three cards of a tri-spell have a different meaning: the first card is for deciding the performed action, the second for the number and kind of targets, the third for the power of the spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player have also a designed enemy (secret role assignment at the start of the game): if he defeat this player, he's the winner. If nobody reach this target, the winner is the player with the most treasure at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the authors, Martina Mealli, she's also the illustrator of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
