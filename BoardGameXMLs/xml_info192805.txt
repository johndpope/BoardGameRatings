							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Keep Talking</name>
									
			<description>This is a game where thinking - and talking - fast is always an advantage.  Can you describe a list of ten people, places or things to your team mates before your minutes is up?  Can you keep a game of work association going without any hesitation?  It's a hectic game where getting your tongue in a twist could be your downfall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are split into teams.  Each card has two parts.  First you have to describe a list of ten things - these might be movie actors, sports people, cities, countries or things like herbs and spices, to give a few examples.  Sometimes there are limitations to what you can say, such as describing actors without mentioning the films they've been in.  Then the second part of the card is &amp;quot;Don't Hesitate&amp;quot;, when two players keep up a game of word association for as long as they can, from the given start word on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
