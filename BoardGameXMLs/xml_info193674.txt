							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pike and Shot: Campaigns</name>
									
			<description>The ultimate wargame set in the age of Pike and Shot is back. You are now in full charge of your nation&amp;rsquo;s armies, throughout a long campaign in the struggle for dominance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can march in the footsteps of the great leaders of these wars, as you take command in the mighty struggles of the Great Turkish War, the Thirty Years War and the English Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History can be rewritten as you use your genius to lead your armies from victory to victory in Pike and Shot&amp;rsquo;s uniquely realized tactical battles. Previous victories and defeats determine the state of readiness of your forces, and every single unit will count to win the final battle. As you progress through the campaign, you will make hard decisions on a brand new strategic map, where terrain, manpower, supply, attrition, sieges and economic damage will all be defining your choices and making the difference between glory and defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
