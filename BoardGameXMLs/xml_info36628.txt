							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rift Rats</name>
									
			<description>Rift Rats is the nickname given to an elite group of Starliner Captains who navigate rifts in the space-time continuum delivering prospectors to landing zones throughout the galaxy (d&amp;rsquo;ers dilithium in d&amp;rsquo;em d&amp;rsquo;er planets). In an effort to deter future prospectors, tribes of native species from these planets have built a defensive network inside the rifts known as the Rat Trap. How good of a starship pilot are you? Think you can survive the 'Rat Trap'?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer notes: &amp;quot;Many solo games offer a very limited course of actions, require very little thought or strategy and are overly dependent on luck. Rift Rats attempts to challenge solo players and provide a variety of different situations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solo or multi-player game. The object is to deliver seven passenger pods to seven landing zones, or to be the first to do so in a multi-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
