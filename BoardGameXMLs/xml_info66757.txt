			<description>Text on the box (translated from German):&lt;br/&gt;The game:&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge, guessing, imitating, laughing, rolling dice, tactics, luck ...&lt;br/&gt;you really find everything in this game about life and environment!&lt;br/&gt;It is exciting, fast and is fun to play again and again. Want to bet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a board showing a track of 60 spaces between &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; and 3 places for certain piles of cards. Additionally the box contains 126 cards (66 &amp;quot;Pfiffikus&amp;quot;, 30 &amp;quot;R&amp;uuml;ffel&amp;quot; and 30 &amp;quot;Belohnung&amp;quot;), 64 reward marker, 1 bag made of cotton, 8 wooden figurines (4 girls and 4 boys, each in blue, red, yellow and green), 2 wooden dice (one to use and one for replacement) and a rulesheet.&lt;br/&gt;Looking at the components it seems to be a fair simple game of &amp;quot;Roll and Move&amp;quot; (sorry, I don't have the rules). I guess that the shuffled cards have to be placed on the corresponding place on the gameboard from where a card is drawn and read to the player who ended up on a certain space. Each space of the running track shows one of 3 symbols: a question mark, an exclamation mark or an explosion bubble.&lt;br/&gt;The question mark belongs to the Pfiffikus-cards. In this pile you find action cards giving you a special task to perform (like balancing a figurine on your left foot while walking once around the room) or question cards. The player receives reward chips for giving the right answer or fulfilling the action task.&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;uuml;ffel-cards are showing the exclamation mark. On them you find a description of what you might have done wrong (like wasting energy etc.) and the punishment you receive (lose markers, go back etc.).&lt;br/&gt;Cards for Belohnung (meaning reward) are showing the bubble. They are listing exemplary behaviour and a reward for it.&lt;br/&gt;Seems to me that you are winning when you reach the finish line and have more reward markers than the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
