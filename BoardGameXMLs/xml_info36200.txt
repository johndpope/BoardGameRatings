			<description>&amp;ldquo;Card game simulating 3000 years of rule by the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt.&amp;rdquo; There are seven kinds of cards in the deck. Each turn the players attempt to play the highest scoring meld to establish control of Egypt. A meld is two or more cards of the same type. The player who controls Egypt may then play additional melds from his hand to gain tribute points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The game ends after 10 turns. Each turn represents 300 years. If the deck runs out before the 10th turn, shuffle the cards and keep playing. Victory: The player with the most accumulated tribute points at the end of the game is the winner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
