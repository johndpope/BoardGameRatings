			<description>This game is about the dutch soccer club Ajax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has the form of a soccer field and the players take control of two opposing soccer teams. &lt;br/&gt;Both teams are made up of 1 keeper, 3 defenders, 4 mid-fielders and 3 attackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duels between two soccer players are fought with cards. The winner of a duel advances the ball one line forward (for instance from a midfielder to an attacker).&lt;br/&gt;First player to score 6 goals wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two versions have been made. The first version dates from 1996, the second one from 2003. Both are out of print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
