			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon Lord is an adventure pack for use with the Chivalry and Sorcery game system. It is intended for a group of four to eight players who control characters of various types and a Gamemaster. This package also includes enough background information to create an ongoing campaign based in the world in which the adventure takes place. This adventure can also be used as an isolated adventure or within an already existing campaign. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The setting is the area of Barrisglen and the wilderness beyond the human settled area of the Glen. The player-characters begin a quest to rescue a kidnapped princess and to end the depredations of a dragon that has the region at its mercy. Of course, all is not as it appears on the surface and the characters must deal with a variety of events and encounters on the way to their final confrontation with the dragon. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;What of the mysterious wizard Malichtharn? Can they satisfy the requests of the shade of Landor? The quest is perilous but the potential rewards are great. Can the characters successfully conclude the quest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
