							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cabin in the Wilderness</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DramaScape makes maps and miniatures for use with any game system with a focus on fantasy, horror, modern, and science fiction settings. This product is the usual DramaScape map but also comes with a Savage Worlds Adventure, it can be use with or without the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a 40 x 20 inch map of a Cabin in the Wilderness, it comes with Square, Hex and No Overlay and also contains the Virtual Tabletop files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everyone thinks this cabin in the woods is haunted. Bunk. The perfect place to cook meth I say. No one will bother us and any sounds we make will be attributed to the haunting ghosts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cabin in the Wilderness has the external view of the forest surrounding the cabin and an internal view of the three rooms in the cabin in the center of the map. Cabin in the Wilderness includes a single page of twelve figure flats for use with the cabin including eight unarmed men, a female hunter, a male and female cop, and a monstrous brute. Cabin in the Wilderness also includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center room of the cabin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cabin in the Wilderness is intended for use in horror or post apocalyptic modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally there is a small Adventure for Savage Worlds included (The map and the figure flats can still be used with any system) starting with the below Adventure Hook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nature&amp;rsquo;s Vengeance: A couple was once murdered in this cabin. Now rumors say the place is haunted and no one goes up there anymore. But a group of drug dealers decide it would be the perfect place to make drugs where the cops are unlikely to bother them. Their presence in the cabin angers a horrific avenger of nature that awakes from a nearby tree. A monster huntress has come to take on the rumored monster that lives in the woods. And the cops might be tailing the drug dealers&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do the Player Characters figure into all this?  They could be Ghost Hunters here to find out about the ghosts and put them to rest. They could be Monster Hunters that are rivals to the huntress and have heard the rumors of a monster that lives in these woods. They could be Detectives trying to bust the drug dealers with backup from the police. No matter what their motive for being here, they are about to encounter an entire web of complications&amp;hellip;continued inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
