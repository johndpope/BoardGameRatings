			<description>&amp;quot;BOP UP YOUR BEE BOP, WHEN THE SPINNER POINTS TO YOU...&lt;br/&gt;I'LL TRY TO CATCH YOUR BEE AND WIN A CHIP OR TWO&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Get ready!  Get set!  Play BEE BOPPER!  One player bops their bee when the spinner points to their color.  To win chips, opponents try to trap the bee before it is bopped, or catch the bee in their net after it is bopped.  Who's the best BEE BOPPER? ...invite the gang around to find out!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must try to increase their initial complement of ten chips to twenty by catching or trapping opponent's bees with their net.  The first to do so is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a large colorful box (16&amp;quot; x 14&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;) with four nets, four bees, four bopping devices, a spinner and a supply of chips.  Apart from the cardboard spinner base, all components are plastic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
