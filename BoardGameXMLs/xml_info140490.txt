			<description>Join the galactic conflict by taking control of one of five factions in this customizable card game. Pick your strategy. You can choose to the Empire, those forces still united in uneasy alliance, or side with the rogue element, Warlord Darkon, and his stolen Imperial Technology. Become a member of the Bogathan Empire, hell-bent on making up for those centuries of denial and finally eradicating all the inferior life forms. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll join with the Merchant Coterie, banding up with other freighter captains, merchants, and mercenaries, while trying to fulfill your Black Market deals. Become a part of the Void, sentient battle computers that want nothing more than to continue to repair and expand, even at the expense of everything else in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shattered Empires is an expandable card game where each player has their own customized deck of cards built around a chosen faction. Each deck contains a Base, which represents the player, then all the components necessary to build a fleet of ships and wage war in an effort to destroy all opposing bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns allocating their resources, building ships, acquiring more resources, then using those ships and resources to attack their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
