							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Santa Anna Rules: Tactical</name>
									
			<description>These rules simulate land warfare in Mexico, 1820-1870.  The rules permit simulation of all the many conflict during this time including the Mexican-American War and the Maximillian War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries.  The rules give a playable game while providing a remarkable feel for the warfare of this time and place.  Unit morale is critical.  Casualties are indicated by figure loss but there are also losses to straggling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also provide two scenarios for the Mexican-American War (Buena Vista and Churubusco) as well as for the battle of Puebla in 1862 and for San Jacinto during the War for Texas Independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
