							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mickey Bingo</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's bingo game with a Mickey Mouse Theme. Each player receives a bingo card with a 5x5 grid of Disney characters with different colored backdrops. A spinner is used to call spaces. The outer circle of the spinner shows the various characters while the inner circle shows colors (5 per character). For example: If the spinner arrow points to the color blue and Donald Duck's face, &amp;quot;Blue Donald Duck&amp;quot; is called out. Any player with a Blue Donald picture on their card would cover it with a chip. The first player to cover 5 characters in a row with chips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
