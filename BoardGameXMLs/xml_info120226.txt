			<description>An action game for two football fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board features several indentations which are long and thin. Each indentation has a player attached, and by moving levers at your end of the table, you can slide your footballer forward or back in order to 'kick' the ball. The ball is magnetic so that it is attracted to the nearest indentation once it has been kicked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one with the most goals after a pre-agreed time limit has expired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
