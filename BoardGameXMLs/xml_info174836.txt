			<description>This is the second promo tile for Lagoon: Land of Druids, introducing a new site type (Totem) with special rules given below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mytreia's Glory (Side Numbered 2A)&lt;br/&gt;Site type - Totem&lt;br/&gt;Energy - Elemeen/Vowelon/Deonin*&lt;br/&gt;If Mytreia's Glory is in play at the end of the game, seeds of the dominant energy are worth 2 Destiny Points instead of 1.&lt;br/&gt;- The infinity action type is new. It mean that the tile has end of game effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Vault (Side Numbered 2B)&lt;br/&gt;Site type - Totem&lt;br/&gt;Energy - Astral*&lt;br/&gt;If the invoking druid's site is not a haven, gain 1 seed of that site's energy and move the invoking druid to any haven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triple Energy Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A site with all 3 energies provides 1 energy of your choice for unraveling. A site with all 3 energies can be unraveled using 3 of any other single energy &amp;mdash; either 3 yellow, 3 red, or 3 blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astral Energy Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Vault is a site of the astral energy, identified by purple seed icons having a crystalline shape as well as a purple tile border. The astral energy is cosmic in nature &amp;mdash; powerful, mysterious, and beyond human understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The energy provided by occupying an astral site cannot be used to unravel any other site. However, an astral site can be unraveled. The required energy to unravel an astral site is three of any other single energy &amp;mdash; either three yellow, three red, or three blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astral sites also have the Astral keyword appearing in italics at the bottom of their text boxes. Whenever a player summons a druid, if any sites with the Astral keyword are on the board, they may choose for the summoned druid to enter play on a site with the Astral keyword instead of on a haven site. Sites with the Astral keyword do not count as havens in any way, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Totem Site Type Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a totem site is unraveled, its tile is not removed from play like all other sites. Instead, when a totem site is unraveled, flip that site tile over to the site on the other side. The new site occupies the same position on the board as the original site. Additionally, all druids on the original site, including the unraveling druid, are transferred to the new site exhausted. The unraveling druid is not returned to its owner&amp;rsquo;s supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that, like any locked site, a locked totem site cannot be unraveled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Promo Tile Setup Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use the promo tile in a game of Lagoon, setup the game in the normal way. Then add the promo tile to the starting tile setup, adjacent to the two non-haven sites. Either side of the promo tile can begin face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
