			<description>Quarky &amp;amp; Quaysoo's Turbo Science is an educational computer game developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions and published by Sierra On-Line for DOS in early 1992. It was designed to teach scientific concepts to children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centered on Quarky and Quaysoo O'Gandi, two space &amp;quot;elfs&amp;quot; that were green and yellow respectively. With the help of the player they raced through a town in vehicles ranging from cars to jet packs. To purchase vehicles, the player answered questions relating to science at stops along the way. Each stop had a theme: the construction site was simple machines, Clown College was chemistry, etc. There were three opposing teams: two tough street fighters, a pair of alien siblings, and a know-it-all named Odessa King. The game also featured an information book that ran over one-hundred pages long and taught science topics such as optics (via a run-in with the light police) and energy (with the help of Sheik Oil Slick).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarky_%26_Quaysoo%27s_Turbo_Science Quarky &amp;amp; Quaysoo's Turbo Science]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
