							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1830: Railroads &amp; Robber Barons</name>
									
			<description>1830: Railroads &amp;amp; Robber Barons is a multi-player computer game adaptation of the Avalon Hill board game, 1830. 1830  is an economics game about buying, running, selling, and manipulating railroads and their stocks. A player uses the stock market each round to buy one share of any of the eight railroads (the first share is the President's Share and counts double). A player controls a company by having the President's and at least as many shares in that railroad as anyone else. On the map, the players place &amp;quot;tiles&amp;quot; to create their rail nets, and run trains to collect revenue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, 1830: Railroads &amp;amp; Robber Barons, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
