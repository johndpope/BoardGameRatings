							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Witness the Murder of Your Father and Be Ashamed, Young Prince</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players of this game play as Princes, the sons of the murdered King. It is an hour until dark, and if what happened to the King cannot be discovered and adjudicated in that hour, all is lost. All assembled know that Crow, the demongod of tricks, darkness and ill tidings, was himself tricked into making a bargain with the murdered King, to the great benefit of the kingdom; what they do not know (except for one) is that one of the King&amp;rsquo;s sons was consecrated to Crow in secret as part of the deal. Ultimately, this Ravensworn serves the whims of his true master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
