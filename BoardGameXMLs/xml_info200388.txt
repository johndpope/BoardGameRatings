							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crucible of Heroes</name>
									
			<description>A harrowing contest of skill, determination, and guile&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of Heroes is essentially a short dungeon crawl type of adventure. However, hidden under the gameplay is a complex and sophisticated storyline. As the players progress through it, they will discover clues, giving them many chances to piece together the plot. It isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary that the players do so, however. In fact, the adventure can be just as easily completed without doing so. If the players are not interested, they will be able to ignore the story elements and play the game as a basic dungeon crawl. But for players who ARE interested, the storyline is waiting to be uncovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3-4 session adventure for 12th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as seven separate PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Title Page&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter 0: Prologue&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter 1: Silverbay&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter 2: Outer Keep&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter 3: Inner Keep&lt;br/&gt;     Chapter 4: Dragon's Lair&lt;br/&gt;     Unique NPC Statistics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
