							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deguello at Dawn</name>
									
			<description>In the early morning hours of March 6, 1836, after a thirteen-day siege, the besieging Mexican army surrounding San Antonio, Texas, launched a surprise attack upon the presidio of the Alamo, which was defended by U.S., Texan and Tejano volunteer militia units. The cheering Mexican soldiers, along with the accompanying bugle call of the &amp;ldquo;Deguello&amp;rdquo;, soon betrayed the surprise attack. Within an hour and a half, the entire garrison of 182 to 225 volunteers had been &amp;ldquo;put to the sword,&amp;rdquo; and General Santa Anna had won his victory at the cost of some 311 of his brave officers and soldiers. Even more, he created an American myth that began with the &amp;ldquo;Deguello at Dawn&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dennis Bishop uses area movement, facing, ranged fire and melee combat to recreate this famous event in American History. Leaders play a big role in the game and rules for Col. James Bowie to determine if he's healthy and able to take part in the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique twist on casualties is also used as the game has a large map (17&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot;) and uses over 400 double sided unit counters (some that are 1&amp;frac12;&amp;quot; x &amp;frac12;&amp;quot;) as well as about 8-10 pages of rules and various game player aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deguello at Dawn was a nominee in the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
