			<description>From the description: &amp;quot;The object of this game is to win points by building words, both on a Playing Field and in a separate Word List. Points are determined by successful completion of play, length of words, and various bonus plays. The first player to score 500 points is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for five additional word-forming games are included, as are four letter racks and the playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
