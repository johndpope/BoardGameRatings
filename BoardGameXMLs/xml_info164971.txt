							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gravity Crash</name>
									
			<description>Gravity Crash is a multidirectional shooter released on the PlayStation Network. Its visual style pays homage to arcade games of the 1980s. A PlayStation Vita port was released in August 2014 under the title Gravity Crash Ultra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player chooses a planet to visit from a top-level menu, and then explores that planet in a two-dimensional side view. The planetary surfaces tend to be riddled with systems of caverns: manoeuvring through them while taking gravity into account is one of the game's principal challenges. Gravity Crash was inspired by three games in particular, Gravitar, Thrust and Oids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose one of two control modes: in the first, the player's craft can fire only in the direction it is currently facing. In the second, the direction of fire is independent of the craft's orientation, controlled by the second joystick on the controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In PlayStation Home, from 17 December 2009 using the Presentation Podium events space, there was an event for Gravity Crash. The event was called &amp;quot;Gravity Crash: Maze to the Mothership!&amp;quot; and featured a maze minigame. There were two prizes on offer, one if the users complete the maze and another for collecting all of the crystals along the way. Successful completion of the maze earns the player an animated Gravity Crash suit for their avatar. The event was only available on the European version of Home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gravity Crash&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
