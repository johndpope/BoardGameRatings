			<description>Every day, hundreds of ordinary people live with a certain knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will be next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one is sure where it started. No one is sure how it transmits. But sometimes, people wake up and know they are marked for death. Sometimes they last hours or just minutes, sometimes days or weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then they die. Always.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell their story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death's Door is a role-playing game for 3-5 players that looks directly at how we deal with death, as people and as a society. It makes no apologies for this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes to look at the door?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
