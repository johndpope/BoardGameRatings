			<description>Where To? is played on a small board with only 29 spaces. On each side of the board is one circular space in one of 4 different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;1 playing piece (with arrow or face)&lt;br/&gt;1 special die (showing 5x straight and 1x curved arrow)&lt;br/&gt;40 cards in 4 colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The players attempt to score the most points with the cards that remain in their hands at the end of the game. The problem is, that only cards from a single color count, but this color is not known until the end of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player rolls the die to determine if the single playing piece is moved in the direction, where it is pointing, or if it can be rotated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when the playing piece moves on one of the 4 colored circles. The players who totalizes the most points with the cards of that color wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules alone would lead to a very short game, because the playing piece could only be rotated in 1 of 6 dice rolls and it would reach a colored circle very fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, there is another possibility to rotate the playing piece: you can sacrifice some cards to do that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Needless to say, that you mostly choose the cards of the wrong color to sacrifice...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Where To?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Color Guard&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Stronghold&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tower 6&amp;quot; are 4 games from Ronald Corn from the 80ies that never found a publisher. They all had interesting mechanics and/or inventive victory conditions - but they had no theme! Since they were not pure abstract games (they used dice, cards or tiles as random elements), this lack of a good theme could be well have been the main reason, why they were never published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
