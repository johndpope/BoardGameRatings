							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trystell: Reborn - Player&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is meant for use with the Saga Machine role-playing system, also available from the Tab Creations Collective. As such, the Saga Machine core rulebook is necessary to make full use of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By default, the Trystell: Reborn setting makes use of four of the five modules found within the main Saga Machine book: the Combat Module, the Environment Module, the Mental Module and the Social Module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only module not in use by default is the Character Design Module. While GMs may still use this module for character creation, if they wish, with no ill effects, it's function has been largely replaced by the Lifepath Module introduced later on in this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific options for the different core modules in use are detailed below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baseline Game: Values given in this book will use the Imperial system of measurement, as for better or worse, that is the most commonly used measurement system where the author of this book resides. In addition, the Trystell setting assumes that the GM is making use of the optional Skill trait, with the default skill list provided in the Saga Machine core rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat Module: This text will assume that the GM has chosen to make use of a hex combat grid, and the optional Bleeding rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mental Module: The Trystell setting makes use of different Power Access traits than the example ones given in the Saga Machine rulebook. Most available Power Access traits use the default power use and power strain rules, but are penalized by encumbrance, and access to their granted powers are restricted by Level. Finally, the GM section of this book should have more information on corruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social Module: By default this book assumes that the campaign is making use of the standard wealth rules, without the option for continuing income. Similarly, this work assumes that the GM is not making use of the optional Recognition trait. Using both of these options is quite reasonable, however, and may be and may be quite suited to a campaign centered around the new Core City (Melanoc), and the outlined campaign presented in the GM's section of this book. Finally, Trystell is considered to generally be a Progress Level 5 world, with an average Control Rating of 2 or 3 (albeit that varies a lot with the region).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
