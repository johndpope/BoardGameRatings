							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knerten kortspill</name>
									
			<description>Like a reversed &amp;quot;old Maid&amp;quot; you get rid of cards by getting pairs. You draw a card from your opponent, and if you got a pair you put it away. When you are out of cards you leave the game.  The player who has the &amp;quot;knerten&amp;quot; card at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the movie &amp;quot;knerten&amp;quot;, a movie based on a book by Anne-Cath Vestly. The story is about a boy who finds a friend in a wooden stick, who lives when the adults doesn&amp;rsquo;t look. (I guess the thought is that kids find joy in simple things. The irony is that now you can buy plastic &amp;ldquo;knerten&amp;rdquo; in the toy shops In Norway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All illustrations are shots from the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
