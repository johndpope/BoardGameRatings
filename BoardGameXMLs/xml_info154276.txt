							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vulgruph&#039;s Hollow</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The once prosperous village of Vulgruph&amp;rsquo;s Hollow has become a den of murder and mistrust as what started as a series of odd animal mutilations has escalated into disappearances among the populace. Built on and across the mouth of a creek, even the stone walls and stoic guards of this dwarven village have done little to bring peace and security to its residents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
