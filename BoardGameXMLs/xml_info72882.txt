			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple war game featuring units with varying movement, attack and range factors.  Units include infantry, artillery, cavalry, support and an HQ. &lt;br/&gt;Players set up on their side of the map in any configuration desired.  Combat is determined by spinning a spinner. Terrain has an impact on game play. Rivers must be crossed at bridges, towns act as defensive positions and therefore get to fire first (but only at one of the enemies that is attacking the defending unit) and most terrain features limit who can move through them.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to capture the enemy HQ or force their surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
