							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Path of the Pumpkin</name>
									
			<description>The Path of the Pumpkin is the prequel of the freeware italian graphic adventure Space Hunter. The interface is in the classic &amp;quot;Sierra style&amp;quot;, with the pop-up inventory in the middle of the screen and the icon bar with the basic interaction: talk, interact and look on the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skar the Pumpkin and his assistant Mr.FeeFee, are two well-know detectives fro Treshopolis. One day, their dreary routine is shattered by an out-of-the-ordinary mission, that will take them on a hunt for a girl who as be kidnapped and forced to marry against her will. The two &amp;quot;detectives&amp;quot; have to do their utmost, in order to bring the case to a conclusion, but... this is only the beginning of something much bigger and much more involved!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the adventure we can control both Skar and Mr.FeeFee. A lot of characters from Space Hunter and the Miciosegone universe appear in this game, like a young Oxy from Oxymous Prime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
