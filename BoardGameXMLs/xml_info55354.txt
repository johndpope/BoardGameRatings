			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The River of Light is an allegorical role-playing game based on the River of Life books by Richard L. Ricks. This game may be used for fun and entertainment or for teaching morality and the consequences of actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The books revolve around the journey of a Traveler on the River of Light, who is trying to reach Fountainhead, a glorious and wonderful place, which one must strive for by working one's way upstream. The Traveler meets numerous obstacles along the way, making this journey a treacherous one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The journey begins, for each Traveler, with his/her appearance on the River. Travelers do not remember anything before this point. All they know they must learn from the two River Guides with whom they share a boat. Soon, they are given oars to help in the rowing of their boat, as their River Guides try to teach them how to navigate the River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, Travelers are issued their own boats, though these boats come in all styles and sizes. At first, they are still connected to the boat of their River Guides, but eventually the rope is cut and they are left to make their own way on the River. The most important possession any Traveler has is his/her boat. Keeping the boat in good condition is the job of the individual. Along the way, there are Way Stations, places where the boat can be repaired, but these are rare. In order to become a successful Traveler, one must learn the proper maintenance and piloting of one's craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The standard scope of a campaign in The River of Light RPG spans the journey of Travelers, beginning with their appearance on the River. Because Fountainhead is a flexible destination, appearing on a River that has many different courses, the scope of this game does not include the destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
