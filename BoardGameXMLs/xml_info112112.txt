			<description>For the first time in what seems an eternity, a tiny village crushed by the huge mass of mountains indicates the presence of other human beings... Will they be a great help or a danger more deadly than your desperate and icy loneliness? The road to the capital becomes clearer and the river, which crosses inhabited land, is not far behind the last peak and mountain pass. The acceptance of your fate and of potential relief of your inner turmoil seem attainable... As existence appears to be possible again, the fear of death grows more acute, increasing the risk of being sucked into a great void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
