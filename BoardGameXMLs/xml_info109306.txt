			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes RPG rules supplements seem to have as much world setting information as they do game mechanics. While solid world-building is a useful skill, you don't always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn't want to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that's needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: All the rules you need to add three new fantasy simian races to your campaign, in whatever capacity you want them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Mangani: a powerful race of gorilla-like warriors.&lt;br/&gt;    The Shift: an eldritch race of cunning ape-men who can take on human appearance.&lt;br/&gt;    The Wukong: a race of sentient, sapient monkeys with the power of speech and hands capable of fine manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
