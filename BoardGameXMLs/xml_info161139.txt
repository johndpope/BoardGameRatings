			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pocket Rugby League is head smashing, scrum packing, ball and all Rugby - played with dice.&lt;br/&gt; We've made this game to give plenty of scoring chances...in fact, not scoring in an attacking raid might be more painful than the huge hits throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt; The gameplay focuses on each side taking turns in an attacking set of 6 tackles.&lt;br/&gt; You are in control of 5 playing positions - the scrum half always starts each passage of play. He will either pass to another position, kick for a field goal or try and gain ground. On the other 4 dice, there is a 1 in 6 chance of 'busting' the line of defense, at which point, your opponent has one more roll of the 'Defensive' die to try and stop the try scoring effort. &lt;br/&gt; If he succeeds, it is recorded as a tackle in the set of 6 and the attack continues. If he can't stop the try, the attackers then gets to roll the TRY / NO TRY dice.&lt;br/&gt; 3 in 6 chance of a TRY / 2 in 6 chance of NO TRY and 1 chance the VIDEO ref is called upon to review the tape - in which a re-roll of the TRY die is made.&lt;br/&gt; You can also kick for field goals, penalties and scrums. All of these are dependent on rolling a certain number to be successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
