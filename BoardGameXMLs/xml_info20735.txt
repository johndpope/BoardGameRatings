			<description>This is a good introductory rummy game for children.  The game is for ages 3+ and is for 2-4 players.  There is a game board that has four toy story characters with numbers 1-6.  The idea of the game is to be the player with the most set tokens once the game board is filled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is filled by either laying a set 3 tiles of same suit in sequence (1, 2, 3 of Woody) or 3 tiles of the same number (4 woody, 4 buzz, 4 what's the horses name again).  You can also add to a set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a wild card in Zurg and there are bonus plays with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sesame Street version is effectively the same game with a different character-set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
