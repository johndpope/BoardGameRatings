							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">40 Overs</name>
									
			<description>40 Overs is a simple card game that pits two players against each other as Sunday League cricket teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First one player bats for 40 overs, or until 10 wickets are lost, trying to score as many runs as possible.  The opponent attempts to take those 10 wickets and otherwise limit the scoring.  Players then switch roles and the player with the higher score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each over consists of the bowling team selecting a card (from a hand of 4) then the batting team responding with a card (initially from a hand of 5, but decreasing as wickets fall).  Each card can be read either as a Batting or Bowling card, but can often only be used in a certain range of overs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bowling cards are either Fielding (cards which reduce the number of runs scored this over) or Special (cards which, for example, produce wickets or allow a player to discard and replace a hand).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Batting cards are similarly Runs Scored (which add runs, minus any Feilding card) or Special (which, for example, defeat wicket appeals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card distribution (44 cards total):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fielding cards: 15&lt;br/&gt;Special Bowling cards:  29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Runs Scored cards:  25&lt;br/&gt;Special Batting cards:  19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
