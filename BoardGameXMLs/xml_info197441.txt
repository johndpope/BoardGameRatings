			<description>Adding play is a 52 card deck game design toolkit game for 1-4 players, play a game while making one. Use adding play to generate new game ideas or improve existing ones. It's a great introduction to game design and makes for the perfect gift for any budding game or user experience designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay begins with players choosing a theme for their game, followed by the game type; infinite or finite. Then in order, players choose from the four suites; motivators, victory conditions, game mechanics and social mechanics. Each card selected is read aloud, once there is, at least, one card from each suit the player can then begin to piece together their game idea. A session should last between 10-15 minutes, it's recommended to repeat 3 times, keeping each session set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To increase the challenge of each game sessions, optional rules such as a time limit for ideas or set quantities picked from each suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
