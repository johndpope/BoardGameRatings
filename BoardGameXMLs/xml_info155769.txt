							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jeu des Échanges: France – Colonies</name>
									
			<description>In this 1941 game, players had to administer France's overseas colonies.  They drew cards representing colonies, then had to use the appropriate tools and resources, and manage local labor forces to gain exports from the colonies.  A colony would go out of play once its major exports were fully exploited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can be played by 2, 4, or 8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
