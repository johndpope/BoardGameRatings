							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost City of Jershon</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, a treasure hunter long thought dead suddenly showed up in the small river town of Talara with tales that astounded everyone. He claimed to have found an ancient subterranean city hidden underneath one of the many mountains in the uncharted lands to the north. He had nothing to show for his journey, and what was left of his clothing was tattered and torn. Many thought he had simply lost his mind, while just a handful thought he had invented the story to account for his miserable failure as a treasure hunter. Regardless, the rumors of the lost city of Jershon have persisted to this day, bringing fortune and fame to the river town of Talara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Lost City of Jershon supplement for RuneQuest! This book contains information about the once thriving river city of Talara, as well as a guide to Jershon, the mysterious city of legend. Game Masters can easily insert this city anywhere into their own campaign world, taking any portion of the material that they like, and tweaking elements of this material to better fit their own campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, there are also descriptions of townsfolk, monsters and items that are associated with Jershon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
