			<description>Subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;An Awesome Game About Women Kicking Ass&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This game is about roleplaying awesome women who kick ass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main mechanic is: Be awesome. (But don't get totally carried away.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no Gamemaster (GMs are an oppressive tool of the Patriarchy!); challenges are given by one player, responded to by another, and the results adjucated by a third.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;This game is centred around players describing the feats of martial prowess (&amp;quot;ass-kicking&amp;quot;) of their characters.  The game is chiefly in the form of a self-refereed conversation game.  Each players contributions to the shared narrative are judged by a peer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are defined by their name, description, three characteristics (qualitative) and a fourth unique self-chosen characteristic.  Each characteristic is assigned a value by giving a description of how great is is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
