			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry in the 10 out of 10 Educational Software series is aimed at 3 to 7 year olds and consists of six mini-games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gnasher - This super doggy game will enhance all sorts of skills. the question appears at the top of the display and the message at the centre tells you what to do. You must bite the answers as they pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Link Up - You must match boxes on the lower half of the screen to those at the top following the rule given at the foot of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artist - Colour the picture by first selecting the colour (move the brush to the palette at the bottom left of the display and click on the colour you want). Then move to the area you want to colour and click again - the area will be coloured the same as the bristles on the brush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab It - A question is displayed and the answer or missing item is somewhere on screen. Once you spot it move the hand there and grab. You must be quick though; the answers move around so it won't be in the same place for long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones - When you start to play Stones, several footprints appear on the stepping-stones across the screen - watch which way they go. Something will then be put on top of the first few; you must decide which pattern they are following. Then, from the four answers at the bottom of the screen, you must select the correct one to fit on the stone with the flashing box around it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Racer - Here's a fast action driving game to keep you on your toes. There are loads of answers on the track - you just drive over the right one for the question at the foot of the screen. Avoid anything else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Matthew Atkinson&lt;br/&gt;Amiga version by Darryl Kiley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
