			<description>Populations is an insanely addictive game about primitive fantasy races and their struggles to sort out who's land is who's!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, players will explore a vast and mysterious world in order to find useful resources and victory points. The various resources (i.e. stone, wood, textile) are used to grow population, build fantastic castles, and discover useful technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, on a players turn, they may spend action points to increase and move their population around the map, and to build castles to secure lands. Additionally, players may always explore new lands by drawing new land tiles and adding them to the known world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the number of players, a victory point goal is set at the beginning of the game. Once a player has achieved the preset goal on their turn, they win the game. Likewise, if a player eliminates all other players from the game, then they stand victorious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
