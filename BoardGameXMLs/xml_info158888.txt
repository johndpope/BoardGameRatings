Both Allies are set for the race to ultimate victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take role of the commanders of the Soviet and Allied armies competing for prize winners: the capital of the Third Reich.

In addition, the players has to seize the strategically important regions of Germany, which later will be administered by occupying troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Result of this race creates post-war spheres of influence by the winners of the Second World War, which influence the balance of power during the Cold War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components&lt;br/&gt;- A map showing areas of Western and Central Europe, where the last battles of World War II took place in 1945.&lt;br/&gt;- Front line markers (2&amp;times;25 pieces), to show the Western and Soviet front lines, which shifted during the operations.&lt;br/&gt;- Logistics blocks (2&amp;times;8 pieces), which form the basis of players&amp;rsquo; military maneuvers on the board.&lt;br/&gt;- Action cubes (2&amp;times;20 pieces), to mark the number of actions made by a logistics block.&lt;br/&gt;- Military unit tokens (40 pieces) with historical markings of armies (Germany, Western Allies) or fronts (Red Army). In the game there are three forces: the Western Allies, the Soviets and the Germans. German units have a current strength, shown by their current orientation.
