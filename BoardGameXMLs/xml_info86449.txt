			<description>From the back of the slipcase:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Challenge your friends to supernatural duels with exclusive Skulduggery Pleasant game cards!  Pit your wits and use battle skills to fight with characters old and new, including unseen secret info on villains from the third Skulduggery adventure!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes in a slipcase &amp;quot;Battle Pack&amp;quot; with a trade paperback of the first Skulduggery Pleasant book.  Made for sale in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the &amp;quot;How to Play&amp;quot; card:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Shuffle and deal all cards face down in stacks.&lt;br/&gt;2. Each player holds their cards so that they can only see the first card in their stack.&lt;br/&gt;3. The player to the left of the dealer chooses a category from their upturned card to do battle with e.g. Adept Magic.&lt;br/&gt;4. The other players take turns to read out the score for this category on their upturned card.&lt;br/&gt;5. The player with the highest score wins this round and places all the upturned cards including their own to the bottom of the pile.&lt;br/&gt;6. The winner then chooses a category from their next card to start a new round.&lt;br/&gt;NB. If two or more cards in a round share the top score then all the cards are placed in the middle and a new round is started (by the same player as before).  The winner of this round takes the cards in the middle too.&lt;br/&gt;7. The person with all the cards at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Optional extra rule:  Once a player is down to only three cards, they may look at all three and choose which to play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art by Tom Percival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
