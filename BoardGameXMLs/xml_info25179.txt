			<description>This is a game for ages 3 and up. The box contains a board, 20 wooden stars, 1 figurine and a color die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is showing a beautiful landscape. On the bottom part of the board, 10 colored fields are arranged next to one another. Across these fields tracks have been punched into the map. The stars fit perfectly in these tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The figurine is a girl with an apron. The girl has to collect the stars. The color die shows the three colors used on the different fields of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For starters the stars are placed on the tracks. The girl is placed next to the out most right field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll the die and bring the girl to the closest field of the same color. If the track on that field contains a star you can remove it from the track and keep it with you. If you have two possible directions to move, you can chose which direction you will take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all stars have been collected. The winner is the player who has collected the most stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
