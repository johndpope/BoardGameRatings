			<description>Footsy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Promiscuity Parlour Game&lt;br/&gt;A game of deduction, risk, and flirting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the dinner party. Promiscuity is the aim here, but discretion is key; it would be thoroughly improper to be open about your conquests after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know who you want to go home with&amp;hellip; only one thing for it, you'll have to play Footsy with them. But how can you be sure you're flirting with the right person?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the night you&amp;rsquo;ll decide on your conquest. Throughout the meal you&amp;rsquo;ll test the feet under the table to try and find your paramour. Once you think you have them, it&amp;rsquo;s time to make your intentions known... It&amp;rsquo;s time to play Footsy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Footsy is a deductive reasoning game in which players hold secret identifies and also target identity cards. In each round, or Night, they must attempt to locate their target character, their Paramour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player identifies their Paramour they win the Night, if they&amp;rsquo;re wrong they are ejected from the party for the Night; they're out of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to hook up over a set number of Nights wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
