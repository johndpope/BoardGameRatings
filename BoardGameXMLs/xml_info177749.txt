			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the accumulatd wealth of my 30 years playing, designing, and (most importantly) Game Mastering paper &amp;amp; pencil roleplaying games.  I wrote a book that I would want to read, something I could refer back to again and again.  Not every suggestion or recommendation is worth its weight in gold, nor will they be to everyone's taste.  However, I believe there's enough personal wisdom shared to change the way you run games forever... if you want to start Game Mastering like a boss, that is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Readers will get the most use out of this book if they're running or intend to run fantasy RPGs. Nevertheless, almost half this volume is genre-neutral and should be applicable to science fiction, horror, super heroes, etc.  It's full of general advice on running games, specific elements that should be included, lots of tables for cultists, monsters, magic items, etc., and a brutal-sounding, sorcerous language you may borrow from whenever you need something suitably arcane or foreign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To wrestle with the dragon and win... that is what I shall teach you!  This book is a door to a parallel world of Game Mastery, a world where Venger Satanis whispers strange and frightening things into your ear... AND YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO LISTEN!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you enjoy this book, you'll probably get a kick out of my others:  Liberation of the Demon Slayer, The Islands of Purple-Haunted Putrescence, and Revelry in Torth.  Eventually, Crimson Dragon Slayer will be added to that illustrious roster.  Thanks for taking a chance on this old demon and his eldritch scribblings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
