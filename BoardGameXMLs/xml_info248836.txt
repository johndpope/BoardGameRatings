			<description>Gut Check is the game of truth or care about the quality and cost of health care and the need for transparency for patients to make the best decisions. You&amp;rsquo;re a patient about to undergo an important medical procedure&amp;mdash; increase your odds of getting the best care possible by persuading your opponents to show their hands and reveal the true quality of their services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s a catch! When your opponents are seeking care, take on the role of a hospital and beat the competing hospitals to the punch by sharing the quality of your best procedures and by setting the cheapest prices. Show your mettle as both a patient and a hospital if you want to thrive in this fast-paced party game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
