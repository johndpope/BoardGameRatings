							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Elixir of Life</name>
									
			<description>From the in-game instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following two dangerous missions to far off, mystical lands, Lara Croft now suspects someone is gathering together the ingredients required to formulate the fabled Elixir of Life. She may be sceptical of its actual potential, but nonetheless Lara is still reluctant to hand over the artefacts she has recovered. Instead she decides to discover for herself the real intentions of her clandestine employer. Lara's investigations lead her to the Scottish castle home of a billionaire recluse...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run, jump, climb, shoot and think your way through a variety of levels, watching out for the traps, obstacles and enemies that will inevitably hinder your progress as you try to complete your adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
