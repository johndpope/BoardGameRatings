							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooftops of Ditchbury</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A busy and prosperous city, Ditchbury began life as a small trading village near a river. As the city grew and the river became a canal, it attracted wealthy merchants and traders, but with them came criminals and dangerous people. Those who don't wish to be seen are adept at using the rooftops to get around, avoiding the streets or using them to find their next target.&lt;br/&gt; Rooftops of Ditchbury is a printable battemap compatible with any RPG game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rooftops of Ditchbury is a day &amp;amp; night set, comprising of 2 30x30 battlemaps. The city has a variety of buildings, with churches, warehouses and grander residences alongside houses, and the rooftops pose various obstacles and opportunities - from dormer windows and planks for access, to broken tiles, steep rooftops and lose tiles. At night lamplight spills into the streets, but there are still dark alleys. Ideal for chases, espionage, assasinations, heists and other adventures of intrigue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
