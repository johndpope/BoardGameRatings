							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Owlman</name>
									
			<description>An asymmetric strategy game based on Britain&amp;rsquo;s answer to the West Virginia Mothman sightings. The game can be played using pieces from a chess and checkers set.  Owlman is an abstract strategy game with unequal forces, based on a loose theme of cryptozoological investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Owlman side has just one piece (a black knight) which starts in the upper left corner. Doc's side has Doc (a white king starting in the lower right corner) and 12 helpers (checkers starting near Doc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owlman's main objective is to frighten all of Doc's helpers out of the woods. Doc aims to reach the Owlman's lair (the upper left corner), along with one of his helpers (adjacent to the corner), who will help him set up his &amp;quot;cryptozoological&amp;quot; camera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in alternating turns, moving pieces on the 8x8 board. All pieces can step to an adjacent space. Only Owlman can capture, by stepping toward a helper, who is then frightened out of the woods. Owlman also has a special &amp;quot;swoop&amp;quot; move (like an elongated knight's move, but 4x2 instead of 3x2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published in the December 2010 issue of GAMES Magazine and online at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://owlmanthegame.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://owlmanthegame.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online play: Super Duper Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
