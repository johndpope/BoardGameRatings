							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gallic Wars</name>
									
			<description>The time period chosen (100-50BC) is principally focused on Caesar's war in Gaul but also includes the major slave rebellion led by Spartacus and the Mithridatic Wars.&lt;br/&gt;You can be Caesar, a confident general who is prepared to gamble when the stakes are high, or Vercingetorix, the great Gallic commander able to fuse the different Gallic tribes into one nation in their fight against Rome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An enhanced computer A.I. plays an aggressive strategy that requires you to use the best formations and tactics history has to offer in order to win the battle. You may also face off against an opponent in a balanced hypothetical match from the &amp;quot;table top series&amp;quot; of battles or join in a multi-player PBEM battle with hundreds of units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gallic Wars Features&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;From Roman palisade camps and fortifications to Gallic strongholds this game has all the features including caltrops, stakes, pits and the famous Garden of Death at the battle of Alesia.&lt;br/&gt;Siege warfare is a major element of this game with stone throwing engines, battering rams, wood towers and stone walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 52 scenarios included (21 historical, 9 hypothetical &amp;amp; 22 from the Table Top Series) covering actions such as Alesia, Sambre, Vosges &amp;amp; Chaeronea. The Table Top Series (TTS) are scenarios made up of evenly matched armies based on points. Many miniature wargamers will recognise the structure of TTS battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the main game engine there is also a scenario editor included which allows players to create their own scenarios from scratch, edit existing scenarios and also create their own Order of Battles. Detailed instructions are included on how to use the editors but also on how to calculate points for your army and even how to modify the stock graphics if a player so desires, called &amp;quot;Paint your own army&amp;quot;. 58 maps are also included in the game covering historical locations and random ones, so a large amount of terrain is available for scenario designers to use creating custom battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
