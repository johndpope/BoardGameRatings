							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flames of War: Normandy Battles – Wargaming D-Day and Beyond</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early morning darkness of 6 June 1944, the largest armada of ships the world has ever seen heaves to off the Normandy coastline. Aboard, thousands of Allied soldiers wait in readiness for their date with destiny. Months of planning, training and preparation are now behind them. On this day they will undertake the greatest amphibious assault in history, and on their success or failure hangs the very fate of the liberation of Europe from the jackboot of Nazi domination. D-Day is finally here! Normandy Battles contains the best scenarios from the original D‑Day series of books, as well as the Battlefront Studio's favourite web scenarios, and updates them for the third edition of Flames Of War, and the two D‑Day compilations: Turning Tide and Earth &amp;amp; Steel. Normandy Battles also includes rules for airborne landings and amphibious assaults, allowing your forces to wage war from the land, sea and sky. The revised Total War rules put a new twist on larger games, giving your battalions additional abilities, and allowing you to field entire support companies. Inside You Will Find: History of the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the subsequent battles to liberate France. Airborne assault mission and rules. Amphibious assault mission and rules. 13 of the best Flames of War scenarios covering the Normandy Campaign. Total War rules allowing you to put bigger forces on larger tables, with two Total War missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
