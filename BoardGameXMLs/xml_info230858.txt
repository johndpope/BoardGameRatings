			<description>Commodore cassette inlay&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Mission 201 was doomed from the start. Why did I ever let you talk me into this Foley? Sending out our one and only functioning bio-mech to survive the ruins was just plain dumb. No, I take that back. It's not fair, it wasn't plain dumb at all, it was SPECTACULARLY dumb. Of course he crashed you idiot - you forgot to teach him to fly the goddamn plan!&lt;br/&gt;  At least you had the brains to gibe it a standard survival kit and radio. If that heap of junk of yours can find the radio and switch it to distress beacon frequency, perhaps we can get the overgrown Coke can back after all. God help us after all if it turns out to be as dumb as you. One billion dollars worth of taxpayers money and you sent it on a joyride to take some pictures!!! I don't care if it you DID find something moving in the city, if we don't get that robot back I will personally drop you in the ruins to find it. In several pieces and without a parachute. Now get out before I rearrange your anatomy...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;   Biomech 1 (or Sydney to his friends) is lost in the ruins of a very strange city on Alpha Five. His creator, Scientist Foley, is threatened with a painful end to his brilliant career if he doesn't come home in approx. one poece.&lt;br/&gt;   What you have to do is guide Sidney out of the city by finding the radio that was on the plane when he creashed it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Geoff Foley</description>
