			<description>U-Fly-It Air Traffic Controller simulates the conditions of a busy airport, where players try to land their planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 4 planes (mounted on the stands) and sets them up in their area of the board.  There are two circular paths around the airstrip: the Holding Pattern and the Landing Pattern.  Players take turns to roll a die to move their planes on the board.  The planes must first enter the Holding Pattern, then the Landing Pattern before they can land on the airstrip; players slide down the planes on their stands as they do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each space on the board contains instructions that must be followed.  Emergency and Special Clearance cards are drawn when planes land on their space, and their effects (beneficial and detrimental) must be executed.  Planes can only enter the Landing Pattern through the effects of certain Special Clearance cards.  To land on the airstrip, planes must land exactly on the Final Approach spaces on the Landing Pattern.  Players then need to roll on their next turn to determine if their planes can taxi to and park at their designated gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to park all his or her planes is the winner.  The game ends when the third player has parked his or her planes, effectively establishing the rest of the positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
