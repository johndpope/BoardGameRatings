							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adept Handybook (version 1.0)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would be nice to say that this edition of the Handybook was &amp;ldquo;years in the making.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps it took &amp;ldquo;a collabarative team of the industry&amp;rsquo;s top insiders and graphic designers.&amp;rdquo; In fact, don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, but this project has been going on for years under government auspices, and I have only now received authorization to declassify this portion of our research. But if anyone asks you, here&amp;rsquo;s the cover story...&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m one lazy mofo. Actually, that&amp;rsquo;s not it, although I do have (what I like to call) a selective work ethic. The main reason for the delay can be tied to three factors. For a while, I just utterly lacked the inspiration to do a new Handybook. I finally got the druthers to work on it, though, and it came along great...until hard drive troubles erased it and I lost all my work. Needless to say, this was a bit discouraging&amp;mdash;factor number one. Factor number two is Vassar College, which I am now attending and which takes up enough of my time that I like to utilize my free time by just not working (on anything, including the Handybook). Finally, FASA, bless their hearts, released a string of books (e.g. Awakenings, SR 3rd Ed., Magic in the Shadows) that kept me on my toes more than expected. Gotta&amp;rsquo; stay on the bleeding edge...&lt;br/&gt;So finally, with the much appreciated (grumble, grumble) prodding of friends, I decided to just buckle down and do a new edition. Granted, this &amp;lsquo;buckling down&amp;rsquo; has still taken, well, quite a while, but so it goes. Oh, and it&amp;rsquo;s now version 1.0 because, as of SR3, physical adepts are now adepts. Thus, the name had to be changed&amp;mdash;hence the new version number.&lt;br/&gt;All things being said, is it worth the wait? Probably not. But oh well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
