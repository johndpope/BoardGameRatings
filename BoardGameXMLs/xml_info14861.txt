			<description>D'Ice hockey is a game of strategy and chance. The object is to build a professional hockey team through trades and player. Build team bonuses in shooting, passing, skating, checking and goaltending. Put your team to the test with a full schedule of games against other teams in the league, complete with playoffs. Watch out though, the injury bug can strike and you have to be prepared for it. Play just one season, or watch your team develop over several seasons. Players abilities can change over time, and players may demand more cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
