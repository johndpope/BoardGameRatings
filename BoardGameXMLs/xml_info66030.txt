			<description>Each player has to complete a different puzzle consisting of 18 pieces. In total there are six puzzles depicting a scene of a Mozart opera (Don Giovanni, Requiem, the magical flute,...), each puzzle has a different color. In the beginning of the game all puzzle pieces are put in a bag. The players then take turns and move their pawn using a die. When a player lands his pawn on a space that corresponds to the color of his puzzle he may draw a puzzle piece from the bag, when he lands on a different space he may exchange a puzzle piece with an opponent. The player who finishes his puzzle first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
