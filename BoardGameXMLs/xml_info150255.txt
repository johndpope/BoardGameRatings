			<description>Players are trying to find the golden helmet, which was buried with a mighty man centuries ago in the area of municipality of Lieto. They travel around Lieto and the player who is the first to find the helmet is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is simple roll and move, the helmet is always in the same location. There are some other locations along the track, where players might get a free roll or lose a turn. About one fourth before the goal it is possible to choose from three different paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically an advertisement of the Lieto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
