			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters are everywhere. They crawl, skitter, and lope through the forests. They lurk in the shadows of your hallway, on your dinner plate, and in your marriage bed. They even infiltrate your friends and family. Is that really the one you love...or a melevolent, inhuman beast wearing her skin, waiting for just the right moment to lunge at you, tearing at the soft flesh of your neck?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these dangerous times, you need help. You need the Field Guide to Monsters. In these pages, teh esteemed Professor Philip Points outlines some of the most dangerous varieties of monsters you are likely to meet, describes the warning signs that tell you with which types of monsters you are dealing, and offers suggestions on how to end the threat once and for all. As an added bonus, Mr. Edward Mefford brings Points' descriptions to life with his haunting illustrations. No monster-hunter, or potential monster-victim, can afford to go without this invaluable work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to possibly saving your life, the Field Guide to Monsters also serves as a role-playing game sourcebook. It provides gamemasters with detailed descriptions of both classic and original monsters. A sheet in the middle of the book gives GMs the statistics they need; once it is removed, the book may be handed to the players as an in-game prop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
