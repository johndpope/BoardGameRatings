			<description>In this game, one player acts as the fox and the other acts as the rabbit. This game board has circular spaces arranged in a grid and the fox and rabbit pieces start in their respective corners. To move, you roll two dice. You must advance your piece in one direction the full number of spaces indicated on 1 die (your choice), then make a right turn and advance the full number of spaces indicated on the other die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rabbit player wins if the rabbit piece lands by exact count on the space marked &amp;quot;White Rabbit's Home&amp;quot;. The object for the fox player is to land by exact count on the rabbit. After the fox lands on the rabbit, the rabbit may attempt to escape by rolling the dice, and if the move shown by this roll would land the rabbit in the 5 center spaces marked &amp;quot;Briar Patch&amp;quot;, the rabbit escapes to the space rolled (landing on the rabbit's house would also escape and win the game). If the rabbit cannot escape the fox wins the game. To compensate for this escape advantage, the fox player gets an additional move on a roll of doubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4-player version may also be played with 2 fox and 2 rabbits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
