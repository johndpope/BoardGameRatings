			<description>In this game you have to make the animal sound that respresents an other player, and an animal sound to ask that player for a card. If you have 3 identical animal card you have a Tetteretet (Sound of a Dutch Elephant). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Make the sound of the animal your are&lt;br/&gt;     Say Tetteretet&lt;br/&gt;     Make the sound of the set animals 3 times and lay down the 3 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stops when a player has no cards left.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is de player with the most sets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horn Card.&lt;br/&gt;When a player is asked for a card he doesn't have, he can give the horncard instead and will receive the asked card in return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player neither has the card that was asked for, nor the horn card, the player makes a mouthfar. The player turn ends and the player takes an extra card from the pile. The game is played clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very good game for young children, familycardgame, training material for speech problems. The game gets better later at night. Especially funny in an international setting since animal sound differ in each country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by Sensalot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
