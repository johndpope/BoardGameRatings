			<description>The Doomstones Campaign vol. 5&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;By uniting the four ancient Crystals of Power, the adventurers have accidentally triggered a Chaos-God's four-thousand-year plan. Now they are the only ones who can stop the stones from bringing devastation to the Old World - hut first they must learn how. And that knowledge is hidden deep in a valley occupied by worshippers of Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;Between them and saving the world lie hideous mutants and Beastmen, long-destroyed Dwarfen holds, ambushes, pursuits, mad ghosts, insane cultists, Undead children, an amazing flying ship and a Dwarf who cannot die.&lt;br/&gt;Determined to stop them are fanatical forces from the Empire and the Dwarfen stronghold of Karak Him, as well as the powers of Chaos who will not let the all-powerful artefacts be destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;As the hole in the sky grows larger and a great storm gathers over the Yetzin Valley, can anyone survive the awful threat of the Doomstones?&lt;br/&gt;Heart of Chaos is the long-awaited conclusion of the Doomstones campaign. It's an epic race against time that blends investigation, deduction, role-playing and combat with cinematic set-pieces and a heart-stopping mid-air climax. Written by the critically acclaimed games designer Robin D. Laws, this book includes descriptions of new magic, a new order of knights, game-information on the daemons of Tzeentch, and advice on writing and running all kinds of adventures. It is designed for PCs in their second or third careers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
