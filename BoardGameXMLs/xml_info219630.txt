							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Radioactive Queens of the Everglades</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A FULLY-ILLUSTRATED 74 PAGE LABYRINTH LORD/MUTANT FUTURE CAMPAIGN &amp;ndash; CONTAINING 169 SEPERATE LOCATION ENCOUNTERS. INCLUDES SAMPLE LOW-LEVEL CHARACTERS AND VEHICLES READY FOR PLAY. After The Fall, the supra-state of Oceania fell into chaos &amp;ndash; particularly the ex-nation of the United States of America. The profuse use of nuclear weapons on the continent saturated the topsoil with radioactive fallout while the toxic poison of chemical weapons residue combined with biological agent horrors to twist the remain population. Those who could descended underground. In the Florida Everglades still not swept away by erosion from Atlantic Storms, various Military &amp;ldquo;Villes&amp;rdquo; exist in underground buildings. These Villes, commanded by the legendary &amp;ldquo;Alphaville&amp;rdquo;, attempt to enforce law and order on the wilds of the Everglades, particularly the Underground Trogs that inhabit caves here. The Villes are armed with various military robots to defend their subterranean bases against the wild Trogs and the other creatures of the the stinking bog. Some of these deadly robots patrol the horrid fen hunting down the vermin and Trogs and putting them to the laser. Meanwhile the lizard-like Trogs continue to breed with high birth rates and attempt to out-strip the populations of the remaining humans who cannot replace their numbers fast enough. The Trogs attempt to capture humans for feasting, sacrifice and perverse breeding with human females for Half-Humans / Half-Trogs. They attack and burn local human communities that have largely descended to a technology level somewhere between the 14th century and the 19th century with steam and coal as limited resource energy. The Military Villes are the only complexes still in commission from the former world in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
