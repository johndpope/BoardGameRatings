			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helping students think more critically, communicate ideas more effectively, and work more cooperatively with others are goals widely recognized as indispensable to a proper education. Yet, developing those skills in our students is often made difficult to accomplish by many factors, including mastery of required subject matter and the challenge of instructing children of diverse ability and motivation. Adventures in Reasoning: Communal Inquiry through Fantasy Role-Play is designed to help middle school, secondary, and even postsecondary teachers enhance students' critical-reasoning, communication, and cooperation skills by guiding students through engaging and imaginative scenarios involving teamwork and problem solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book presents the roleplaying game Ar&amp;ecirc;te in a framework intended to introduce readers to the basic concepts of roleplaying.  Ar&amp;ecirc;te is a full-featured, high-fantasy game with a focus on making group decisions and working out quandaries.  In most respects, the mechanical rules are very traditional class/level/attribute rules.  Adventure design focuses on episodic narratives with pre-determined goals that are intended to be tied to enumerated learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book includes the basic rules and the &amp;quot;expanded&amp;quot; rules for the game, as well as a general introduction to roleplaying, a defense of roleplaying as an educational tool, and four fully-developed scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Quest for Justice&lt;br/&gt;     Judging Truthfully&lt;br/&gt;     Diverse Factions&lt;br/&gt;     The Scales of Justice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
