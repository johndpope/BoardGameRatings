							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rough Riders Ten-Pins</name>
									
			<description>The R. Bliss Manufacturing Company of Pawtucket, Rhode Island produced this &amp;quot;bowling game&amp;quot; at the turn of the century at just about the time that real TEN PIN BOWLING was taking hold in the United States. This game features heavy cardboard &amp;quot;pins&amp;quot; like Rough Rider, Indian, Cowboy Dude, and Cow Girl. Each pin had a number value marked on it. Knocking them over scored you the points listed on the individual pin. You had one shot to score. The pins were randomly set up by your opponent so the numbers on those pins were not in the same place on every turn. highest score after 10 &amp;quot;frames&amp;quot; won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
