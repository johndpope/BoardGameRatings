			<description>Plyt is a great new family board game for players of ALL ages and abilities to play together in a fun, competitive and challenging way and, even better, it improves your numeracy skills!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is easy to play and works around multiplying a number of 12 sided dice together within the agreed time, negotiating the Plyt squares and racing against each other to be the first to reach the winner square.  But there&amp;rsquo;s a balance of risk and reward. Plyters decide how many dice to throw to try and get ahead, and when it comes to it, who they will push back or help.  It starts off gently to let you get the feel of it but as the play gets closer to the end, positions can change quickly and the result isn&amp;rsquo;t certain until the very last throw!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Plyt isn&amp;rsquo;t just about beating your opponents &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s also about challenging yourself &amp;ndash; pushing yourself out of your comfort zone and feeling the buzz of getting it right!&lt;br/&gt;There are lots of different playing options you can choose (all described in the rules and on the website) &amp;ndash; it all depends how competitive you want the game to be and how long you want it to last.  The basic game normally lasts between 25-45 minutes but you can make this shorter or longer &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come Forth and Multiply!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
