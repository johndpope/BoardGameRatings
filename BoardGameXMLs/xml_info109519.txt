			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As most of you reading this broadsheet are probably aware, the Gumshoe game system is really little more than a framework within which to play roleplaying games that focus on investigation and acquisition of clues. Robin and Ken (with more than a little help from others I&amp;rsquo;m sure) have created a mechanically light game that is easily expanded and developed with little affect on the core system. There is a certain appeal to this approach, and it is one that makes creating additional material extremely easy (and enjoyable).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, the first article in this issue, False Prophets: Gumshoe: Beyond the Hype, examines the topic of what the Gumshoe system truly achieves and how better to translate this to players and Game Masters alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To follow this up we present Medic! an article taking another look at the First Aid rules in Gumshoe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
