			<description>Reconstruction of an alleged race game played by the indians in Yucatan, based on an original board. The gameplay is reminiscent of games like Parcheesi or Patolli: players have got to throw pebbles and then use the outcome of the throw to move their stones along a closed track. The goal is to bring their pieces home first - pieces of the opponents can be taken on the way and so get sent back to their home square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yucatan, though, has got some interesting additions to make it more tactical than the average race game: it is best played by partnerships of two, who can under certain circumstances move the partner's pieces; a cross within the track allows the pieces to take shortcuts, and similar pieces can be stacked and moved as a unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
