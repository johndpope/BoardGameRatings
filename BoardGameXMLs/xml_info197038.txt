							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guldgrävarspelet</name>
									
			<description>Players are gold diggers and everyone needs to find as much gold as possible. Each gold discovery weighed on the scale and gives the player the equivalent amount of gold nuggets. Many dangers lurk on the road. Beware of rattlesnakes and bandits!&lt;br/&gt;To find the gold you need to get on a green site. Once there, take your pick or shovel to loosen the &amp;quot;place&amp;quot;. Add &amp;quot;place&amp;quot; on one weighing pan and then gold on the other, it is your gold. If you end up on the trading station so you have to pay in the same way as when you found the gold, it also applies to the saloon. If you encounter Indians, robbers or rattlesnakes, you must wait until the danger is over.The game continues until the gold reserves is over, the one who has the most gold wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
