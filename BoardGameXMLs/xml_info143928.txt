							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Royal Strawberries</name>
									
			<description>Summer is here, which -- for the kingdoms of Feorhyrna -- means it's time to raid the strawberry patch! In all the world, no item is more sought after than the Feorhyrnan strawberry: wars have been waged and kingdoms have been lost all in an effort to possess its mysterious, magical fruit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that was last year (things are more civilized now); instead of war, the kingdoms of Feorhyrna have agreed to send eight champions to the royal strawberry patch to collect this year's harvest. It's first-come-first-serve, though, and there are no rules about how to divvy up the fruit...but they'll work on that next year. In the meantime, it's time to bust some skulls and grab some strawberries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Royal Strawberries is a whimsical game of tactics and strategy in which teams of fabulous characters navigate a garden maze and fight for the fabled fruit of Feorhyrna. When the last strawberry is plucked (or the Royal Bazaar is exhausted), the game ends and each kingdom tallies up its victory points (from strawberries and other bonuses): the kingdom with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
