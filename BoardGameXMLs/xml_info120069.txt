							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken Bones: A Rules Supplement</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you've already grabbed [Wounds, Bruises, and Blood], and you've started dishing out the serious damage. Nothing is cooler than watching your foes bleed to death after you thrust your sword into their chest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, what would you say if you could grab a hammer and cave in their skulls?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's what I thought you would say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Bones picks up where Wounds, Bruises, and Blood left off. With the rules in this PDF you can crush skulls, shatter rib cages, and snap limbs . . . all with the bludgeoning weapons you're already using! This system adds a little complexity to that found in Wounds, Bruises, and Blood but the overall record keeping and dice rolling involved remains relatively low for the reward of swinging your club into a foe's head and watching as he drops dead -- or dying -- from the hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you've no doubt guessed, this PDF requires Wounds, Bruises, and Blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
