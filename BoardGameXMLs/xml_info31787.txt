In the middle of the board is the scoring base.  The scoring base as 10 numbered slots like each players base.  The scoring base also has four channels to move disks through.  Each turn a player may move one of his disks one place; forward, backward, left or right.  Each player is trying to get his numbered disk in the same numbered scoring slot on the scoring base.  Each scoring slot only holds one disk.  Players may use their disks to block slots and channels.
