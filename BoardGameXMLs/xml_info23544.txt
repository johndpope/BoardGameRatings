			<description>Kleptonauts are hunting the dark and empty universe for Lux supplies. They are raiding neighboring planets and settlements as well as each other to get to these supplies. Their only real concern however is that they don't run out of space rum! If you can keep their ships stocked with run they will most likely do your bidding and make you the richest man in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bid space rum for control of each of the 6 kleptonaut ships each turn. If they gain control they can move them to pick op Lux treasures and/or deliver them to their own space stations which will generate money. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
