			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Industrialization, Economics and Capitalism.&lt;br/&gt;A free print &amp;amp; play game from DVGC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Philanthropoly is a card based game where players negotiate and trade with other players to collect action cards to build factories, railroad and/or ports to increase the value of the various companies.  Stocks in the various companies can be bought and sold depending on the players speculations and cash flow needs.  Cash is earned by the play of production cards, with the type of production dependent on what natural resource, region or city card is played in conjunction.
