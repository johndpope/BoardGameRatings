			<description>Libido (リビドー) is a board game released during the Game Market 2016 Autumn (ゲームマーケット2016秋) in Odaiba Tokyo on December 11th 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Libido, all the players are brothers living in the same house.&lt;br/&gt;Being a young adolescent, your 'libido' is without equal.&lt;br/&gt;That's why you go out and buy erotic magazines secretly from your siblings and hide them carefully in the house so no one else can find them. Neither by your brothers adventuring in your room while you are out nor by your mother cleaning frenetically her lovely child's room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the title might suggest, the art is absolutely safe for all players : only the 'concept' is perverted. The game is  mainly aimed at a male audience, nostalgic of their youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
