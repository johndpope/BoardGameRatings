							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Our Town Sparkles / Social Responsibility Game</name>
									
			<description>These are a couple of games, made in Singapore, which come together in the same box. The objectives of these two games are to inculcate good social behaviors and habits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eponymous Our Town Sparkles is a simple roll and move boardgame. The first player to get to the end of the track by exact count wins. The Social Responsibility Game has a circular track (in the sense that you go round and round the track) and players follow instructions on the board where their pieces land. There are Social Responsibility Quotient (SRQ) cards worth up to 20 SRQ points. Players can also earn and lose money depending on their social behavior. There are red penalty cards, drawn when a player lands on a 'Penalty Square', and green cards that a player picks up after landing on a 'Good Social Habit Square'. The game ends when a player runs out of money, or there are no more SRQ point cards. The player with the most SRQ points wins. A curious feature of the game is the role of Social Responsibility Judege (SRJ) - the SRJ administers all penalties, rewards or awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphics and illustrations by Rolling Art Pte Ltd.&lt;br/&gt;The year of publication is based on a discount coupon (for Popular Bookstore) that came with the game and was valid only till October 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A version of this game, called Tampines Our Pride, combining the Social Responsibility Game and Tampines Our Pride Game (a roll-and-move game, like the Our Town Sparkles Game) was created for the Tampines Town Council. The differences are in the roll-and-move game (different track and events) and the Social Responsibility Game has some slightly different artwork - for example, there's a picture of the Tampines Changkat Community Club on the board. The board itself is made from cardboard and not as thick as the mounted board used in Our Town Sparkles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
