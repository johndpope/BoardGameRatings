			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2-4+ players. Theme: Overland Westward Migrations in the USA in the mid 1800&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played using a custom deck consisting of four types of cards: Hazard Cards, Wagon Cards, Destination Cards, and Journey Cards. Each Destination and Wagon Card has a Migrant Point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are trying to play melds consisting of a Destination Card, Journey Card, and one or more Wagon Cards. For each meld played, a player scores Migrant Points equal to the total value of the Destination and Wagon Cards. Hazard Cards may be played on another player to reduce the player's Migrant Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no cards left in the draw pile and none of the players can play a meld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
