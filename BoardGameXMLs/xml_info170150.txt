			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pagan Publishing, the independent game publishing company, has&lt;br/&gt;breathed new life into modern horror roleplaying in the Call of Cthulhu universe. Their combined works Delta Green and Delta Green: Countdown are being hailed by many as the best horror/conspiracy game supplements ever made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, they are based in the Chaosium Call of Cthulhu system. While it isn't a horrible system (maybe &amp;quot;dog with fleas&amp;quot; would be a good way to describe it), it isn't as rules-light and minimal as other games are, like FUDGE, Star Wars or the D6 System. Luckily, Craig Griswold came along and put a set of D6 System-based rules together for modern horror/conspiracy role playing called Into the Shadows. This phenomenal piece of praxis can be downloaded free over the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If we were to combine the two, we could easily play with some of the most interesting, horrifying and well-supported game material in a rules-light environment: Call of Cthulhu and the Delta Green line of supplements is a phenomenal, roleplaying-inducing setting. It is only natural to want to use a minimal system that is also geared towards roleplaying. That is what I attempted to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
