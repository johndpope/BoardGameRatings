			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powered Armor and Vigilantes! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mecha Combat in a Dystopian Future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ultrapolis:  The Ultrapolis is a city that dwarfs all other cities ever to exist. Not everyone who works in the Ultrapolis lives in the Ultrapolis, though. Many live just outside the Ultrapolis, in the Sticks. The Sticks has largely been abandoned by the Powers that Be. Police and rescue departments never much even enter the Sticks anymore. And that is where the Vigilantes step in, filling the void that the absence of the authorities has left, standing the line against crime and chaos through sheer force of will. That, and all of the mecha technology that a secret wealthy benefactor can buy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obedience: A hacker has taken over several industrial robotic builder vehicles and is visiting destruction upon the Sticks. Dozens have already been killed, and the body count is climbing fast. The local authorities have no ability to stop these robots, and the authorities of the Ultrapolis couldn't care less what happens to a few blocks in the Sticks. Thus, the only ones with the power and the will to stop these robots are the Vigilantes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...But, is the newly formed team ready for such a challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
