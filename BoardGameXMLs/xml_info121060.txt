							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monstrous Defenses</name>
									
			<description>GM: The troll shrugs off your puny attacks and swipes at you with one rope-like arm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: What do you mean he shrugs off my attacks? That blow should have dropped him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Well, you need to use fire or acid to kill a troll because they regenerate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: What? That&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous. Just because it can regenerate doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it can&amp;rsquo;t feel my attacks. Let me see that book (grabs for the game master&amp;rsquo;s book pile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a familiar scene. Combat is running along smoothly until a strange power leads to an argument and the game grinding to a halt as books are opened and rules are referenced. This is particularly true when dealing with all the unique defenses monsters can possess. All those seemingly conflicting rules and minor variations can lead to a major headache and a stoppage of game play. Well, have no fear; your friends at Healing Fireball Publications have the answer to this problem in the form of the next expansion in our Combat Cards line. The Combat Cards: Monstrous Defenses are a collection of index card-sized cards with a quick reference to some of the most common defenses that are used by monsters. From damage reduction, to gaseous form, to regeneration, all the most common monstrous defenses are right here. Never stop to search through a book again - with Combat Cards the rules are at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Publisher Blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
