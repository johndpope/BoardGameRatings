							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cleric Bears</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explorers and adventurers alike have encountered many bizarre creatures across the planes, but few are more bewildering - or wondrous - than the cleric bears. These beings are good-natured sentient bears who protect the world from evil, be it physical, emotional, or spiritual. In fact, cleric bears are an incredibly inclusive lot, determined to assist literally anyone in need no matter how different or strange they might appear. Even evil creatures showing signs of pain or repentance will be accepted by the cleric bear&amp;rsquo;s understanding community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The source of a cleric bear&amp;rsquo;s strength is its &amp;ldquo;stare&amp;rdquo; - a magical rune which forms on its belly shortly after birth. Stares forge a permanent connection between a cleric bear and divine goodness, granting them abilities which sustain their quest to uplift all living things. Sadly, they are often tragically misunderstood by those who confuse their compassion for weakness - something many an orc learned far too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name &amp;ldquo;cleric bear&amp;rdquo; is only accurate in terms of divine abilities. In reality, cleric bears belong to all classes, be they spellcasting wizard or stealthy rogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
