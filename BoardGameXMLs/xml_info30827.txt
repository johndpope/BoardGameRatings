							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elementeo</name>
									
			<description>Elementeo is an educational card game developed by Anshul Samar.  Chemical elements can be combined to form compounds that can be used in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homepage:  &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.elementeo.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.elementeo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the Maker:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Elementeo Chemistry Card Game (v1), elements have their own personalities -- Oxygen becomes Oxygen Life-Giver, Sodium becomes Sodium Dragon, and Iodine becomes Iodine Mermaid. Players can create compounds and play with element in the game. Elementeo includes five different levels (element, reaction, compound, alchemy, and fusion) and has elements, compounds, and alchemy cards (which include black holes and nuclear fusion).  The goal of the game is to capture your opponent's electrons and reduce them to 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What People Have Said About The Elementeo Chemistry Card Game (v1):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This young inventor has stumbled upon something that will stimulate minds and make people more interested in science&amp;rdquo; - Dr. Tom Lane, Past President, American Chemical Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Elementeo teaches kids to see elements and compounds not as boring things to be memorized but as interesting personalities and powerful agents at work in the world. Which is of course exactly how real chemists and scientists see them. If they come away from the game remembering a fun fact about an element, or understanding the basic notions of bonding and charge, they will have a powerful head start in understanding chemistry&amp;quot; - Theodore Gray, co-founder of Wolfram Research (makers of Mathematica) and Popular Science columnist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Elementeo builds on games like Magic: The Gathering and Pok&amp;eacute;mon by appealing to kids with its fun factor, but also focusing on the education side. The world should take notice.&amp;rdquo; - Peter Adkison, CEO of Hidden City Games, and former CEO of Wizards of the Coast (the makers of Magic: The Gathering and distributors of Pok&amp;eacute;mon).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update: The first version of Elementeo (v1) has sold out, the next version (v2) is expected to hit amazon.com in the beginning of summer 2012. Alchemist Empire, Inc also released an Elementeo App on the Apple App Store for students to explore the elements and create their own Elementeo elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
