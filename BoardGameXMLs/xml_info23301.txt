			<description>Each player has to bring home his own three animals (a sheep, a pig and a goose). On every turn two dice are rolled, one to indicate the type of animal that has to be moved and one for the number of spaces the animal can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a bear on the board that can be moved with the dice. If an animal lands on the space of the bear, it is sent back to the starting meadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once an animal reaches the barn, it is given to the corresponding player (noted by the hidden color under the animal).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to bring home his three animals (either himself or by the move of another player) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
