							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Speculation</name>
									
			<description>Speculation is the simple fast moving stock market game that embraces the quick fluctuations in price typical of the market of speculative securities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for each player to increase his beginning net worth of $12,000 by &amp;quot;buying low&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;selling high&amp;quot; as prices of individual securities rise and fall on the Market Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wooden market board is used to track the price of each stock (eight areas are Advertising, Aircraft, Automobile, Cosmetics, Electronics, Mining, Paper &amp;amp; Petroleum).  Users keep track of game play on their Security Record sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is determined by calculating each individual's net worth consisting of both cash and the current market value of the securities they hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
