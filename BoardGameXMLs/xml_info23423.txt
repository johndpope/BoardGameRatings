			<description>One of the more novel designs from FridgePlay, compared to the more traditional games they've adapted to playing on a metal wall surface. It is a light-weight golf game, where the players alternate building the course from a stock of fairway tiles. Actual play involves choosing a long or short stroke, and resolving distance and accuracy with a spinner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using hallmark FridgePlay presentation, games can be played over a long period of time by room mates who would rather not see each other but still are trustworthy enough not to cheat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
