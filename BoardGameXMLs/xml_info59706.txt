			<description>This game is packed in an actual rubber boot, which is also part of the game. &lt;br/&gt;The wooden board has 21 fields (7 x 3), several wooden tiles are inserted in gaps. During the game, the players have to get rid of their own tiles by inserting them (thus changing the meaning of the fields they are adjacent to), then rolling a die and moving with a boot piece. Depending on the kind of field they land on, the players have to perform various tasks, including some with the rubber boot (i.e. throwing it between two chair legs etc.). The first player to reach the end field and holds no more tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
