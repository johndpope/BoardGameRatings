			<description>99 Waves to Die is a twin stick arcade shooter, inspired by the arcade games, and 8-bit home consoles/computers, of the 1980&amp;prime;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember when video games used to be insanely difficult?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you used to spend &amp;pound;&amp;rsquo;s in the local arcade trying to get the high score?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When having your three letter initials/acronym at the top of the table meant you were the king?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well we do, and that is why we are creating 99 Waves to Die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A ship, 3 lives, limited smart-bombs and scarce power-ups is all you have to try and survive the waves of enemies that rally against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With voxel based graphics, inspired by 80&amp;prime;s video game classics, a pumping chiptune soundtrack  &amp;amp; excellent 8-bit audio fx, 99 Waves to Die will take you back to those seedy, dark, smoke filled arcades of your childhood. Re-live the 80&amp;prime;s heyday of the arcade, but without the 10p&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive to see Wave 99?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
