			<description>Two players try to destroy each other's Core in a highly strategic battle by employing creatures, spells and dungeon upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures can have up to three of eighteen special properties, such as Coward (roll a d20 to determine the success of an attack), but also Mug (steal Gold on attack). Spell Cards add one-time actions to potentially turn the game. Dungeon Upgrades not only provide utility (such as sacrificing cards to gain resources), but also let the player shuffle new cards through his deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key novelty: build your deck while playing the game. This allows for a dynamic and strategic gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
