			<description>From the Wendell 7 Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wendell 7 is an educational card game that focuses on mathematical addition for students of all ages. Game play can be easily tailored to age/skill level with 3 levels of difficulty (Junior, Senior 5, Senior 7) and an adjustable time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to problem solve and work either alone or with a partner to strategically gain the optimum score of seven points in each round. In the Junior Game, this score is attained through using a hand of five cards and using addition of 1, 2 or 3 cards to reach a total of 7, 17, or 27. There are other goals which require strategic management of cards in order to achieve extra points per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game isn't just for people who score the highest marks for Mathematics in a school examination, it's for everyone! Those who can analyse the cards in their hands and add up quickly and accurately will be the winner, and those who struggle will learn and improve very quickly.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
