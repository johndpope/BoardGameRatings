							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Falling Stars: Beginner Game</name>
									
			<description>Falling Stars is a Role-Playing and Tactical Game of political and military conflict unfolding amidst an alien intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a Tactical Game System?  A tactical game system allows players to skirmish one-on-one with each other using the Falling Stars Opposed d10 game system. Players can take a break from role playing (or completely ignore that aspect of the game) and simply enjoy fighting other players. Players can select teams or elect to play free-for-all or anything else in between. The maps in Falling Stars are scaled perfectly for 28mm miniatures, or players can make their own maps using half-inch grid squares or as a miniature gaming system with ranges measured in half-inch increments.&lt;br/&gt; Maybe that tough talking UPAS marine thinks he can take your brawler. So take a break for the RPG and let the two players settle the argument with the Tactical Game System. Bragging rights goes to the winner, and then the group can get back to playing the role playing game. The possibilities are endless!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This box contains everything you need to learn the basic mechanics of Falling Stars. It includes Quick Start Rules, eight pre-generated characters, the first three chapters of an ongoing sci-fi adventure campaign, &amp;ldquo;Into the Long Dark Night,&amp;rdquo; characters and tokens mounted on high-quality cardboard and full-color printed maps for the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
