							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">God&#039;s Dice</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very simply, God's Dice is the greatest unfinished sci-fi campaign world ever! Emphasis is on &amp;quot;unfinished&amp;quot;. The God's Dice campaign world is my take on the solar system 1000 years in the future, in a setting where faster-than-light travel is still just fantasy, and despite finding itself still alone in the lonely universe, mankind has managed to diversify itself into a stunning array of forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;God's Dice is a future world designed for use as a role playing game setting. Currently, God's Dice is only a setting and does not have its own rules set. For rules, we will be using Fate Core, which is distributed for free at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.evilhat.com/projects/fudge/fate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.evilhat.com/projects/fudge/fate/&lt;/a&gt; and is based on Fudge ( &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.fudgerpg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.fudgerpg.com/&lt;/a&gt; ). Later, rules specifically for God's Dice will be developed or simply customized from the FATE rules, but for now, FATE as written is more than enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2921, and Sol System is a bustling, thriving, humming society. Faster-Than-Light travel (FTL) continues to elude humanity, so even while there has been very little exploration of things outside Sol's immediate neighborhood, within the range of conventional propulsion systems, mankind and its offshoots have colonized and filled up every niche they could find or create. Minor sections of the earth have been regreened and preserved, but the majority of Earth's 28 billion people live and survive in monolithic tower cities rising sometimes rising thousands of meters above the ground, as well as burrowing deep into the earth below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luna is fully colonized. Its interior is burrowed through with innumerable catacombs, blistering into sealed domes and towers on the surface. Mars has been terraformed and is finally green (although technically, it's more of a muddy yellowish when viewed from space). Despite centuries of exploration, exploitation, and development, the Asteroid Belt is still seen mostly as a lawless frontier. Beyond the Belt, the Jovian Alliance is the newest growing power among the Solar governances. They have stations on all of Jupiter's large moons as well as orbiting habitats and other satellites. Beyond Jupiter is the true Fringe. There are legitimate science stations and other operations around Saturn and even the further planets. At least fifty permanent stations are known to exist in the Oort cloud beyond Pluto. But the Fringe is also the home to outsiders. There are Fringers in the quixotic realm of the far inner system - near Mercury's orbit, or even closer. Anywhere that the order of Sol breaks down - there you will find the Fringe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
