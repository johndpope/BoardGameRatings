			<description>Set Back - The Berverly Hillbillies Card Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 42 cards in the deck - 10 each of 'Granny' cards. 'Elly May' cards and 'Jethro&amp;quot; cards and 12 'Jed' cards. The 'Jed&amp;quot; cards include two &amp;quot;set back&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 10 cards for 2 3 or 4 players, 8 cards with 5 players and 7 cards with 6 players and is given 35 units worth of chips to bet with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to win the most chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the cards are dealt each player looks at the hand that they have been dealt and then bids on the exact number of tricks that they plan on winning with the dealt hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you win a trick with one of the two 'Jed' set back cards you are allowed to either keep the trick or give it to another player, most often pushing that other players bid over the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are correct and win exactly the number of tricks that you bid, you win the number of chips equal to that bid, if not, you pay chips equal to your total bid. If you are correct you also score the number of tricks that you bid, if you are wrong you score nothing. The first player to get to 10 points collects all chips remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
