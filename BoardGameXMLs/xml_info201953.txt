			<description>Two to five players race to the hive in the center of the board with both their characters. The active player rolls two color dice. If they show different colors, the player picks one of them and each player can move their pieces to an adjacent flower of that color (if there is one). If both show the same color, only the active player gets to move two fields. If one of them shows a spiderweb, the player can place one of the spiders into another player's field to block the path. Two spiderwebs mean the player can move both spiders and move by two flowers on top of it. &lt;br/&gt;First player who gets both pieces into the hive is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
