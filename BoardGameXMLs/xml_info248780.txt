							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales from the Terror Tomb</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the 1950s there have been anthology comics of short horror stories: Tales of Horror, Weird Terror, Chamber of Chills, Chilling Tales, and many more. Creepshow and Creepshow 2 brought the genre to the big screen, and Tales from the Crypt to TV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this &amp;quot;Tales from the Terror Tomb&amp;quot; setting you play the doomed protagonists of such tales. Hardly &amp;ldquo;heroes.&amp;rdquo; all have given in to their baser natures to acheive their heart's desire. They've succumbed to the lure of a supernatural being, magician, or artifact, and now that &amp;quot;quick fix&amp;quot; becomes their undoing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Terror Tomb&amp;quot; adventures are all about that doom. Each player character scrambles to delay their own destruction by backstabbing and sacrificing the others. In this setting it&amp;lsquo;s not only okay to let loose and be nasty, it&amp;rsquo;s expected! In the end everyone suffers their well-deserved damnation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When everybody loses, everybody wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
