							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eyes on the Prize</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a level 10 party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For ages, &amp;ldquo;the old monastery on the hill&amp;rdquo; was simply that and nothing more to those that knew of it &amp;ndash; a small building of a forgotten age and purpose, overgrown by the land around it. But recently, rumors have been making way among the educated that there is a wealth of knowledge that hides within the old monastery, waiting for someone to find it. Most dismissed these rumors as hearsay... but those with their eyes on the prize continued to pay attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There must have been some merit to these claims, because seemingly overnight a monstrous creature has appeared on the monastery grounds - a serpent the size of a dragon, with a dozen legs and breath that crackles with lightning! There's no doubt the rumors and the monster's appearance are related somehow, and the PCs are tasked to put their skills to work to figure it out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
