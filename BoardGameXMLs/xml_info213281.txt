			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone wants to know the future. Now everyone can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build characters with Chronotech, a new Capability that brings information from the future. Use autoredactors to change sensitive information before your opponents steal it. Loop through time to line up the perfect shot or make the perfect argument. Use historical information from the future to uncover secret organizations today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronotech has new material for GMs too: new civilizations and societies based around issues of time travel and foreknowledge. Learn how the universe's existing civilizations will react to the ultimate disruptive technology, and get advice on how to handle the tricky subject of time travel in your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronotech is a supplement for Sufficiently Advanced. It is focused on the second edition, but contains backwards-compatible rules for the first edition as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
