			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Goal: To rescue Ilse, a princess, from the evil sorcerer, Sondergaard.&lt;br/&gt;This story is an exploration of love and commitment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Villain: Sondergaard the Sorcerer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villain&amp;rsquo;s Allies: Mercenary Soldiers, charmed Ogres, dark faeries, evil spirits.&lt;br/&gt;Malasintha, &amp;ndash; a Korrigan (female faerie under a curse). Extremely beautiful at night, but hideously ugly&lt;br/&gt;in the day. If a man treats her with love &amp;amp; respect equally during the day and night, it will break the curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre, Time, Setting &amp;amp; Mood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre: Fantasy / Love Story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time Period: 1121 A.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Holy Roman Empire, near Leipzig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mood: Dark enchantment. Violent, possessiveness, &amp;amp; greed vs. honor and commitment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Backstory&lt;br/&gt;Sondergaard, a sorcerer living in a dark tower in the Holy Roman Empire near Leipzig, is building an army.&lt;br/&gt;He hopes to carve out an empire for himself amid the dark forests of the land, from which he draws&lt;br/&gt;mystical strength that he uses for his magick. He has charmed a group of Ogres living nearby, and hopes&lt;br/&gt;to acquire more powerful allies in the future. He has forsaken the Christian God Jesus, still holding on to&lt;br/&gt;the old pagan traditions. One day, he saw a beautiful girl strolling through town with her friends. With a&lt;br/&gt;glance, she completely enchanted him (a natural enchantment, really). For many days thereafter, he could&lt;br/&gt;think of nothing else but to possess her. One night, he sent his mercenaries into the town to take her away.&lt;br/&gt;He has imprisoned her inside his dark tower, hoping to convince her to marry him, but has so far failed in&lt;br/&gt;His attempts. He will not charm her or use magick to force her decision, hoping to gain her true respect.&lt;br/&gt;As it turns out, the girl is a princess. The princess is betrothed to one of the characters.&lt;br/&gt;The Korrigan Malasintha is here to test the characters. She will try to find a person that can cure her of her&lt;br/&gt;curse. Her story is designed as a counterpoint to the main love story.&lt;br/&gt;The enchanted forest will be reached at dusk, and it will take a day to pass through. Another day&amp;rsquo;s travel&lt;br/&gt;will lead to the Celtic graveyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
