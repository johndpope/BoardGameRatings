			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the forest the ruins of the old Temple still stretches higher than the surrounding forest. They say it has been abandoned for centuries but rumors say that it recently got some new residents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map pack includes two different version of a ruined Temple. One where it is abandoned and only the dead resides in the crypt. In the other a band of robbers have moved in and taken it as their hideout. You decide which one fits best for your adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is meant to be shown to the players during play and it works just as well for online and offline sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf is in letter format and consists of two different versions of each version of the map, two coloured and two black and white. Both versions comes with and without a grid attached to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map pack also includes a GM version of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
