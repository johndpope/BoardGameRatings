							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quick Draw McGraw Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Somewhat like snakes and ladders, the object of  Quick Draw McGraw is to move your characters and be the first to reach the ranch. Alternate paths provide detours or shortcuts, and movement is governed by a spinner. The players' pieces are characters from the TV Cartoon show. This game is not the same as the 1960 Quick Draw McGraw Private Eye game, which used a similar mechanic but a completely different board. &lt;br/&gt;Recommended Ages 5 - 10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
