			<description>The world is within your grasp! Can you take it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diabolical! is a topsy-turvy tabletop game where you play a supervillain trying to take over the world! To do so, you'll need to complete objectives, called Schemes, to execute the most nefarious plan among your evil compatriots. By effectively managing your resources and commanding your minions to do your bidding, the world will surely be in your grasp!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Diabolical!, players simultaneously issue Commands to build resources and work toward completing Schemes. Working on Schemes earns a player Victory Points, and completing a Scheme earns a player bonus Victory Points as well as additional rewards. Players attempt to maximize their scheme points each round by effectively anticipating their opponents' actions to complete the most schemes possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have access to special abilities they can use to disrupt their opponents' plans, or to push themselves toward victory faster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
