			<description>In distant galaxy space travel is commonplace and interstellar merchants competed with each other for the lucrative interstellar trade routes. Eventually the competition became all-out war and the Galactic Commerce Commission was created. The Mission of the G.C.C. was to monitor interstellar trade and only allow certified and licensed merchants to operate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The certifications were quickly snapped up and soon only one last certification remained. Only one more merchant would be allowed to continue trade. The race is on to be the one to buy that certification or be driven out of business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build a galaxy from a pool of hexagonal tiles and then pick up and deliver goods to various planets and space stations to be the first to reach 1000 credits. Avoid being raided for smuggling and successfully use varying prices for goods to their advantage and become the last licensed space merchant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
