			<description>User description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;aka &amp;quot;The Space Game&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legacy was a long running RPG with LARP characteristics which started at the University of Rhode Island (URI) in 1996.  In this homebrew game, players took the role of a position onboard a space ship, such as captain, science officer, tactical officer, etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was implemented as a campaign (weekly), and as one-shot games for multiple sessions annually at the URI gaming convention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involved intra- and extra-group intrigue.  Players dealt with &amp;quot;the Computer&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;clones&amp;quot;, leading some to believe Paranoia was a larger influence than it was, but the subects were treated quite differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fear of overreliance on the computer was a major theme.  A powerful but distrusted computer allowed NPC-like injects, while limiting the player's use of the computer to solve all of their problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Influences: &lt;br/&gt;Setting: Starflight (PC) &amp;amp; Star Control 2 (PC), Paranoia (RPG), Crimson Tide (movie).  &lt;br/&gt;Mechanics: World of Darkness (stat+skill) and Feng Shui (fast roll)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
