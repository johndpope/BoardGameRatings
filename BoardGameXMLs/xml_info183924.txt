							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Denizon&#039;s Folly</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Denizon's Folly their is a Ring of Sage that transport those who have accepted the fey's gift of fruit. But what was cut is the sage plants can be harvested then dried and ground into a powder. Sage is an essential ingredient in the creation of Sleep spells and especially potions. One plant is enough to create one potion or scroll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also in the adventure there is a chance the party may meet a trickster. Tricksters are considered holy within the fey community because they are entertaining and bring gifts. The trickster loves to find trinkets and hide them among the forest for others to find. A Easter egg hunt if you will. Because of this, any harm that comes to a trickster at the hands of a character will suffer the fey's wrath. Literally. More on that in the next micro-adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
