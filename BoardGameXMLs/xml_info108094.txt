			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villains are, by definition, bad people. It&amp;rsquo;s a given that they&amp;rsquo;re doing bad things at any given point in time; usually hurting people or taking things that don&amp;rsquo;t belong to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Villain-Net, we explored many avenues of villainy. There are, after all, a huge variety of crimes that one can commit to be considered a villain. The work of evil is broad and varied, and has many faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some super villains have a certain mystique to them - they follow certain codes and guidelines, and can even seem noble in their pursuits. Others, however, have a dark and vicious core. Their personalities are horrid to the extreme, and their villainy exceeds the crimes they commit to infuse every moment of their existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some villains live for their Inner Darkness, and use the basest, most evil aspects of their sexuality to enhance their villainy, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villain-Net is all about supporting that kind of thing. It exists to help people damn themselves, after all, and nothing is more damning, in the long run, than when one falls to their own Inner Darkness and transcends mere villainy to become a true monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
