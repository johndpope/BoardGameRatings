			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the solutions you're looking for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Solutions analyzes the challenges of implementing the mythic rules for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and offers you no-nonsense solutions to address them. The mythic rules have been with us for almost two years, and with a wealth of play experience we can see areas where rules interact together in ways that have the potential to unbalance gameplay. The mythic rules are supposed to break from convention and allow players and GMs to creatively violate the expectations of how the game usually works, but sometimes those alterations─especially in combination with each other─go a bit too far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Solutions is a 26-page supplement that explores the challenges of action economy, the nova problem, stacking multiplies, single ability focus, rapid recovery, bypassing immunity and resistance, unlimited caster versatility, and rocket tag, or there is no kill like overkill. The masters of mythic at Legendary Games explain rules rationales and concepts and offer an array of alternate rules to deal with the most problematic elements in the mythic rule set like Mythic Vital Strike, wild arcana, foe-biter legendary weapons, and more! If you'd like to get the most out of the mythic rules but are worried about balance or numbers escalating out of control, worry no more! Nobody knows mythic like Legendary Games, and these Mythic Solutions will definitely help Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
