							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PaRappa the Rapper</name>
									
			<description>User summary (details from Japanese Wikipedia):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the very first rhythm games in video game history, PaRappa the Rapper was designed by musician Masaya Matsuura and with character design by Rodney Alan Greenblat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of the shy dog Parappa, who has to rap himself through lessons in order to win the girl of his dreams. The game plays a song, and the player must push the correct buttons in the correct rhythm. All songs are written in English, even in the Japanese release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was acclaimed for its simplistic design, using '2D' characters depicted like flat paper in a 3D environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters were also made into an animated TV series in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;パラッパラッパー,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
