			<description>Tower Seven puts you in the shoes of a 1980s action hero. During a public unveiling of Tower Corporation's new product, terrorists have taken over the main facility and are searching for a dangerous technology prototype. Trapped in the building, it's up to you to find what they are after, thwart their escape, and save the hostages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tower Seven is a cooperative strategy card game set in a 1980s office tower that has been taken over by terrorists. Via exploration, card play and die rolls, you will battle villains to find items and clues of their ultimate plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, you must find all the clues, recover the item card the clues pointed you towards, stop the escape plan, and ultimately defeat the final boss. The game includes a Threat Level mechanic that rises when certain events occur in-game. If the Threat Level reaches too high, hostages may be executed and you may lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon winning, a scoring system helps you determine how well you did versus the game. Multiple variants and difficulty levels are available to aid replayability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
