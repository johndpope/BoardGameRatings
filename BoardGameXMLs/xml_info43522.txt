							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Communism in the West: Cuba 1958 and Boliva 1967</name>
									
			<description>Communism in the West contains two games covering Communist insurections in the Western Hemishphere during the 20th century.  Both games use area movement and the same combat/game system. CHE is the introductory game in the system and Cuban Revolution builds upon the basic concepts used in CHE adding in Air, Naval, and Artillery units as well as more advanced game concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CUBAN REVOLUTION: Beginning in February, 1958 Castro began the first Guerrilla offensive by coming out of the Sierra Maesta Mountains and attacking the Bastiano troops in the plains. The Bastiano army counter-attacked in June of 1958, driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the Guerrillas in their mountain strongholds, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the Guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano Western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Fulgencia Batista fled in January of 1959, the Guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was officially free. The improbable victory of the Guerrillas resulted in the only communist country in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHE: In March, 1967 the situation in Bolivia was chaotic and the country was ripe for the exportation of &amp;quot;The Cuban Revolution&amp;quot;.  Ernesto &amp;quot;Che&amp;quot; Guevara was sent to Bolivia to begin a revolution which ultimately failed due to the intervention of the CIA and US Green Berets who trained three elite Bolivian ranger battalions who captured &amp;quot;Che&amp;quot; Guevara and later executed him thus ending the Communist threat in Bolivia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
