							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon War</name>
									
			<description>Dungeon War is a game for 2-4 players, where the player control groups of Heroes and Monsters in an expanding dungeon and must gather as much treasure as they can, while using their monsters to defeat the other treasure Hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses tiles to expand the dungeon so no two game will ever be exactly the same. Using a quick and simple turn based system, even with 4 players the game is so fast paced, no one will get bored waiting for their turn. The 62 Event cards add constant challenges to the expanding dungeon and will make even the most seasoned treasure hunter squirm as the dungeon deals its next deadly torment their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the event deck is exhausted or if only one hero remains in the dungeon the game comes to an end and its time to count up the treasure and whom ever has the most will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
