			<description>An Onkey is something that gets whacked by a Bonkey. For example, a Bonkey (Hammer) whacks an Onkey (Nail).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle all the Onkey cards and place them in a face-down stack. The first player turns up the top card. The other players look at their hand of nine cards and if they have the correct Bonkey, they should try to be first to place it on top of the Onkey and shout out &amp;quot;Onkey Bonkey&amp;quot;. If first, that player takes the Onkey Bonkey (a matching pair is called an Onkey Bonkey). If you have a Blank Bonkey card you can also try to be first and cover the Onkey card. If you do, you don't get an Onkey Bonkey but you do stop another player from doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two rounds and the one with the most Onkey Bonkey's, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a couple of errors on the box. It says it is for two to four players but clearly two players cannot play it (the player turning over the Onkey card cannot compete, only the other players, so in a two player game this would be pointless). And the publisher claims it is an educational game! That is stretching the game description to say the least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
