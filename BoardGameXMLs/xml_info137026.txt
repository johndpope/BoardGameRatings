							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Suburban Dispute</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1931. In a suburb of the city of Chicago, prohibition is in full bloom and honest people violate more and more laws. Gangster syndicates spread and become larger, and speakeasies open in dark alleys. This illegal activity has now spread out to the smaller suburbs. It's now your turn to make the best of the situation for your family's sake. Will you become a gangster king, or do you think the stock market will go up after the great stock market crash a few years ago so that you will become a wealthy businessman?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gangsters and upper class people will clash in this board game. Will money win over weapons, or it will be the opposite? Form alliances with your neighbors, build up your arsenal of money or weapons, and let the game run its course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Suburban Dispute you fight your neighbors for the simple reason that you don't like them. The game includes three levels, starting quietly with annoying missions like stealing your neighbor's morning paper or milk, but each level you go up, the worse it gets. In the end, you will be conducting drive-by shootings and burning down your neighbors' houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board features a street down the middle, in addition to the score board, and each player places his house next to the street, with a maximum of three neighbors on each side of the street. The players can choose to be either gangsters or members of the upper class before the game starts, and based on what they choose, they receive specific traits that will help them through the gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns drawing special mission cards and rolling a die in order to see whether they succeed with the mission. If the missions succeed, players gain either money or points, depending on the mission level; if the mission fails, then the police come to arrest them, and they lose either points or money, depending on the mission level. During gameplay, players also have the option of drawing special cards specific for gangster and the upper class which will, in most cases, be helpful in order to get closer to the end goal, which is to either collect 60 points, earn 15,000, or be the last player standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
