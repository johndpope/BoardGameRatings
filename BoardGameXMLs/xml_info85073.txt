			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All New Alef Bet Bingo! Two games in one! Alef to Lamed and Alef to Tav Now you can play Alef Bet Bingo while learning hebrew! - Even if you dont know it all yet! Good for both teachers and their classrooms, and for parents! Ages 3 &amp;amp; up - 2 to 14 players Each bingo card has 2 sides. You can play with: Either 16 letters per card (Alef to Tav) or 9 letters per card for younger children (Alef to Lamed) There are also 4 different colors of each letter so that if you are learning and someone calls a red aleph while you have a green one, you dont just forget the letter because you dont have it, you remember the letter because you need the same one - just in a different color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
