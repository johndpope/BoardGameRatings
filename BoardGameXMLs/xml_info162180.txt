							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MALPRACTICE!</name>
									
			<description>MALPRACTICE! is an original card game filled with sabotage and surgery. Players act as doctors in an extremely poorly run hospital; every round a new patient is admitted, and players take turn treating him. The goal of the game is to heal the patient on your turn, while sabotaging your friend's treatments until they lose and get sued. The game is for 3 to 6 people, and takes approximately an hour per game. Rated 16 and up due to drug references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
