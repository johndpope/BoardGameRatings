			<description>This game has been published by dV Giochi as a reward for winning the 2013/2014 edition of the Gioco Inedito &amp;ndash; Best Unpublished game contest. Powered by Lucca comics &amp;amp; Games and dV Giochi, the contest aims to identify the best new card game design from all prototypes received and to reward it by publishing the game in a fully professional and high-quality format, overseen directly by dV Giochi. All prototypes submitted must conform to the technical and style requirements, fixed components and a given theme which changes every year. Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published.&lt;br/&gt;For more information:&lt;br/&gt;giocoinedito@luccacomicsandgames.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.luccacomicsandgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.luccacomicsandgames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's so stressful being a pirate nowadays! It's even worse when you need to retrieve your buried treasures from a beach crowded with tourists... Your only chance is to occupy as much space as you can with your beach towels and wait until nightfall to dig up your loot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Bury a treasure with a value known only to you, or play a pirate card to find out what the others are plotting...&lt;br/&gt;2. Lay you beach towels to cover the most valuable treasures while you wait for nightfall...&lt;br/&gt;3. Then recover the treasures you've captured! But watch out for surprises!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
