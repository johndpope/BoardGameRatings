			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thralled is an interactive thriller conceived by a group of talented and passionate students who grew up with a strong belief that interactive media has an immense potential for storytelling. We believe that a lot of this potential is still waiting to be explored, and that videogames still have a lot to grow as an art form.  With Thralled, we seek to set foot in that unconventional realm of interactive art and deliver a fulfilling and heart-stirring story that can be played by everyone, gamers and non-gamers alike. Our team's goal is to create an experience that will  touch the player's heart. &lt;br/&gt; This project is currently a part of the Advanced Games class at USC, where many award-winning video games have been produced. It will be in development for a whole year and is targeted for release on the App Store by June 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
