							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bear</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have journeyed back at the cost of great pain and personal sacrifice from a world&lt;br/&gt;after the war that ended everything. They seek knowledge of this past. They must know the&lt;br/&gt;cause, for to know the cause is to alter their own dismal present. Somewhere here, there are&lt;br/&gt;answers. They know this, for they have already discovered some clues, scraps drawn from the&lt;br/&gt;mouths of prisoners as they died from the drug. The Bear. Every prisoner spoke of it &amp;shy;&amp;shy; the last&lt;br/&gt;words from their dry, blackened lips. Someone here will lead them to it. If they can know The&lt;br/&gt;Bear, they will own the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
