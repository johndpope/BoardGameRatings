							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Touring Rock Band 2</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        You were supposed to live fast and die young. At least you lived fast. Now you are not so young. Not so famous. Not quite able to rise to the sybaritic occasion the way you did back in the crazy days. Back when you were the big deal, touring the world behind an album that could have&amp;mdash;should have&amp;mdash;gone platinum. You had your moment and now it has passed. The band broke up, over sex and money and a lot of stuff that seems trivial now. But the dreams never died, and the idea of revisiting past glory seems better and better. God knows you need the cash. And you still have fans on the Internet who would kill to see the band get back together&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Playset is an affectionate sequel to the original JM05: Touring Rock Band, and written as a collaboration by some of our favorite Playset authors!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
