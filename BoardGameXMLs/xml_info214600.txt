			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was going take place in China's Pearl River Megacity, and would sport a number of cool upgrades over the original game, such as the ability to arrest any NPC walking around, similar to being able to throw any NPC into the back of a car's trunk in the first game. The story was going to pick up after the events of the last Sleeping Dogs, but Wei Shen would be accompanied by a corrupt partner named Harry Feng. Players would be able to choose different routes for both characters, opening up different story elements to unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
