			<description>This is a trivia game about movies. Each time a player gets a turn, he can choose for a card with value 1,2,3 or a random value. He can try to earn this card by answering a question or fulfilling a task.&lt;br/&gt;If the question is answered correctly (or the task is fulfilled), the player gets the card. In addition, he may play a card on his playing board. This board contains 20 squares, each of a specific color. When a card is played, the player gains points equal to the value of the card, with two points bonus in the card color matches the board space color.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has filled his entire board with cards. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
