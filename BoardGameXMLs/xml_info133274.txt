			<description>Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2 (爆笑!!人生劇場2?, &amp;quot;A Hearty Laugh! Theater Life 2&amp;quot;) is a Famicom life simulator game that was released on March 22, 1991 and requires Japanese literacy to play. Like all games in the series, an occupation is chosen for the player regardless of whether he goes to university or not. The concepts of going to prison for crimes and gambling in a casino are introduced in the series for the first time. These events are only experienced by players whose characters have become adults. Even with this limitation in mind, it is next to impossible to find a new career after being released. This is because the player loses their job after being sent to prison and must collect unemployment insurance after being released when he lands on a paycheck square.&lt;br/&gt;By reaching certain squares on the &amp;quot;career&amp;quot; game board, the player can temporarily escape to either an underwater realm or to outer space. However, players can be &amp;quot;plucked&amp;quot; out of the realm by an unsuspecting fisherman and be forced to return to the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; game board. Mini games include a Whack-a-Mole clone and a Space Invaders clone that can earn the player valuable game points as well as even more valuable self-esteem (will) points. Even though this game can be considered light-hearted and whimsical at times, there is partial frontal nudity in certain parts of the game. Fortunately, the genitalia are censored and only the other parts are shown. There is no rating on the game, although enough of the genitals are covered up to allow for teenagers to play independently (or for young children to play with parental guidance).&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts, players must customize their faces using three spinners to create a random face. Possible careers include game designer, construction worker, military officer, rock and roll musician, and baseball player. Unlike its sequel and like its prequel, there is no separate board for attending university. The only difference between going to university and skipping to career mode is that the university graduating player will receive more choices and a higher salary. Careers and other aspects of adult life however can be manipulated by a series of stars and events.&lt;br/&gt;Yellow stars help the player either acquire a job or change to a different career. Red stars are beneficial events to a player's career while blue stars lead to events that are harmful to a player's career. When the player sees themself on top of a mountain, that means they have been promoted in their career. A spotlight on the player means demotion to a lower pay bracket within the career. Children can be taken away in special &amp;quot;scandal&amp;quot; squares that show the unfit parent holding the child on the television news. At the end of the game, God goes through everyone's financial moves and the most prosperous player becomes the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bakushou!!
