							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trans-Clyde Game</name>
									
			<description>The Trans-Clyde Game was designed by David G. Watts (Railway Rivals and others) for the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive as part of publicity to show how easy it was to get around Glasgow and the surrounding areas (of west Central Scotland) using public transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a race game comprising a number of short rounds (the rules suggest 3 or 4), where each player starts from a randomly allocated railway station, and must visit three places of interest (in any order) using a combination of overground rail, underground/subway system (affectionately known as &amp;quot;The Clockwork Orange&amp;quot;) or buses, then return to their start point to win that round. The person to get back &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; first scores 5 points, the others scoring one point for each site of interest reached. The overall winner is the person with most points at the end of the pre-agreed number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of a hexagonal base, overprinted with the main rail routes, stations and places of interest (that the players must visit). Each round has a different theme - shopping centres, scenic locations, sports stadia, etc. Players roll two dice if they want to travel by train or subway, and one die if travelling by bus. Certain die rolls will result in &amp;quot;incident&amp;quot; cards, which may force a detour, a missed turn etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-6 players, but best with 3-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Board&lt;br/&gt;Rules (1p)&lt;br/&gt;2 6-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;8 Hexagonal plastic playing pieces with a Bus on one face, and a Train on the opposite&lt;br/&gt;30 Destination Cards&lt;br/&gt;14 Rail Incident Cards&lt;br/&gt;14 Bus Incident Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
