							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Satori: The Ancient Mind Readers</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally, the Satori were a race which resided within the mountains as to not be disturbed by the outside world. This caused the Satori race to become sensitive to sunlight, however over time they left the mountain to expand their land ownership and to gather more resources. Still sensitive to daylight, most Satori either had parasols during the daytime or would opt to do their business at night and sleep during the day. The guards to the Satori city eventually adopted this as a method as well, taking advantage of some of their men's nocturnal lifestyles. This was before their near-extinction caused by ancient humans, and the fear that the Satori may take over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new character race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
