							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oxford: Cambridge Boat Race</name>
									
			<description>Light trick-taking card game. Two separate decks, one for Oxford and the other for Cambridge, each with three suits of eight cards, plus three incident (wild) cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each hand, a player chooses the precedence of the suits. Only five tricks are played with each hand, this stops card counting and makes the game more luck-dependent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tricks count both for a boat (corresponding to the deck used) and for the player. Players that win a trick select which deck will be used and therefore which boat will win the point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first boat that scores 26 points wins. Players then score double for points won from the winning boat. Score is kept on an attractive pad with maps of the Boat Race course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
