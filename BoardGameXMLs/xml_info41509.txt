							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">A.B.C. Educational Cards</name>
									
			<description>This 36-card deck is a simple means for helping small children learn letters and numbers.  There is one card for each letter of the alphabet, and one for each numeral 1-10.  On the back is the letter or number, on the front the same with an illustration (e.g. Z &amp;quot;zebra&amp;quot; with a picture of a zebra; or &amp;quot;5 balls&amp;quot; with a picture).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple games include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Simple Spelling Game.  Spread out the letter cards, and pick out the first and last letter of a common word, e.g. C-T.  Let the child figure out what goes in between, with help if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Easy Counting.  Have the child count the items out loud on the illustrated side, or have two numbers and have them figure out what the sum is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some editions have rules for advanced games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A.B.C. Rummy.  Deal 7 cards to each player.  In a turn, draw 1, lay down 3 or more consecutive letters or numbers and/or add to existing sequences, and discard 1.  First one out cards wins 5 points per card in others' hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A.B.C. Kasino.  Deal 4 to each player and 4 face up in the middle.  In a turn a player plays a card to the table, capturing other cards if adjacent to them, or leaving it there if unable to capture.  After the cards are played out, deal 4 more each, etc., until all cards are played.  Remaining cards go to the last capturer.  Most cards captured wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Snip &amp;amp; Snap.  Deal the deck to 2 players, who take turns exposing the top card in their pile.  They &amp;quot;Snip&amp;quot; each time, unless the card is adjacent to the opponent's last card, when he says &amp;quot;Snap&amp;quot; and captures his whole face-up pile.  Continue until someone has all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
