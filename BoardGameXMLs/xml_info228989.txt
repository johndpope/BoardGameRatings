			<description>Ebon Tendrils: Episode One&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A One-Round Living City Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The letter each of you received contained the same message, leading you here, to a house in the upper class district. The home gives some evidence of neglect, perhaps, you imagine, its owner died during the current war. Of its new owner, a man named Beliakas, you know nothing but that contained in his inviting missive:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I do not know you, but I do know what you have achieved. More importantly, I have seen what you will achieve. I require your services for a matter of utmost importance to the city of Ravens Bluff. If you care for this metropolis, and I know you do, please meet me this evening at my residence in the Garden Quarter. I must apologize for the unorthodox nature of this request, but our need is urgent. I ask only that you trust me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        - Beliakas&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
