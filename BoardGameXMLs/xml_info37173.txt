							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Artist: The Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;For anyone who has ever dreamed of being among the collectors and the collected... Of organizing the openings and celebrating the sales... Of starving artists in a garret for the sake of the muse... But be warned: in the game, as in life, it takes more than talent to win. Anyone can play Artist - but, it's only the right combination of cash, canvases, contacts, and conniving that will make you a success!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first edition states that it was limited to 2000 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include a game board styled after an artist's palette, instructions, a pad of Resume Score Sheets, cards, play money, and plastic discs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
