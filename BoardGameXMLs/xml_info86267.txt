			<description>O Tannen-BOOM! is an explosively fun card game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players seek to Build and decorate their own Christmas Tree while blowing the branches off of their opponent's! Best tree (or what is left of one) will go home with the prize!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn they may draw cards, play cards (branches of your tree) or play Baubles/Bombs.  Players score points for sets of similar Baubles in a row.  Many cards also have additional actions that may be played upon adding them to your tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bauble tokens are also your Bomb tokens so you must choose carefully whether to use them in decorating your tree (to gain points) or in blowing up your opponent's (to prevent them from doing the same).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was submitted as part of the 2010 Christmas PNP Game Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
