							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hermit Crab Havoc</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;You are a tiny faint whisper in the tiny mind of a tiny land hermit crab - let&amp;rsquo;s face it that&amp;rsquo;s really tiny. Still god-hood has to start somewhere and all that you can hope is that your influence will be strong enough to see your crab through its next three vital moults before your rival beats you to it with their crab.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strategy game for 2 players (though it may work eventually for more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game takes place on an area of Australian Mangrove Swamp divided up into hexagon shaped spaces. Each player takes the part of a Land Hermit Crab God guiding their chosen Land Hermit Crab through their life in order to be the first to be big enough to worship at the Crab Temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls 4 d6s which determine direction of movement, distance, the nature of the god gift (usually food but sometimes a shell), and the area where the gift will drop. It is up to the player to decide which die will be carrying out which role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game components (which include crab pictures in a photo frame, hermit crab playing pieces and the entire board) fit onto just 3 pages (2 if you have your own tokens). Compact rules (1 double-sided standard sheet) and an optional player's aid page are also available. The board is modular so as to enable easy storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
