			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legion: Universal Role Playing Game presents a generic, universal system suitable for nearly any genre.  The game is unusual in the amount of beginner information and background it provides.  The game is presented in HTML with these major page divisions: Entry Page, Character Sheet, Introduction, Core Mechanics, Combat, Character Generation, Occupational Trades, and Expansions.  The Expansions page presents various settings for use with the game but it is very brief and generally indicates only genre descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Attributes that can be randomly generated or purchased with points; Attributes run from 1-11 with 5 or 6 being average.  Secondary Attributes are generated by formulas.  Characters also have Traits, Skills, and Talents.  Skills are assigned to an Attribute and have a numeric Range from 1-11 with 5 or 6 being considered Skilled.  Resolution typically uses one die with modifiers against a target.  Combat is quite complex with numerous options and special cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
