							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orphanage of Fear</name>
									
			<description>Orphanage of Fear is a social deduction game for six to seventeen players in the vein of Werewolf or Mafia. Players are either orphan children or sinister boogeymen. Hiding in plain sight the boogeymen wake each night to drag a child into their realm under the bed to fears upon their fear. During the day they hide themselves behind the masks of their previous victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The children have to find out who these monsters are, but they are not entirely alone. In desperation the children can take comfort with what toys the orphanage has, and may draw abilities from the toys themselves. They can shine the light of the magic projector to discover the true identity of the target, shield themselves during the night with their teddy bear, save themselves from the monster in the closet by feeding it their limberjack or hide under the blanket to shield them from all danger, but beware not all toys were placed there for the benefit of the children. The boogeymen can bring their own sackcloth doll to throw off the magic projector and make others perceive an innocent child as a boogeyman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the children can&amp;rsquo;t always rely on toys being there. The orphanage is short, even with many children now missing, and so every round the kindly, but out of his depth, caretaker sees to it that what toys are available are taken back and then given out at random.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orphanage of Fear uses the traditional day night cycle of Werewolf. During the night the Boogeymen choose a child to drag into their realm of existence, along with the toy they are holding, to feed, and during the day the entire group debates and argues about who the impostors are before nominating a child or children. If only one child is nominated they can drag another child with them to the closet door. The player with the most votes is sent into the closet and gets eaten, along with their toy, by the monster inside. The game continues until either all the boogeymen are eaten by the closet monster at which point the children win or there are an equal amount of children and boogeymen at which point the boogeymen win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
