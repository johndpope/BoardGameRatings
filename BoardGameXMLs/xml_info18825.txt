			<description>An exciting dice game that is a good filler. There are four dice with different numbers 0-8 (only one 0). There are four Explosive Power cards (one for each round or stage) and one Countdown card, and two Countdown markers. There is also a card which shows the action to be taken on the result of the dice roll:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Pair - pass to next player&lt;br/&gt;     3 of a kind - Reverse direction (pass to next player)&lt;br/&gt;     2 pairs - pass the dice to the second player along&lt;br/&gt;     4 of a kind - end of the round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice are rolled. The marker on the Countdown card is moved if the next number(s) in the countdown sequence is shown. If none of the sets are rolled and no action can be taken, the marker on the Explosive Power card is moved up and the same player has another turn.&lt;br/&gt;   When the Countdown marker reaches 0 or the explosive Power reaches maximum, the player who rolled the dice receives damage points, according to the current Explosive Power. On some explosions, players on either side of the dice roller may also receive reduced damage points.&lt;br/&gt;   The player(s) at the end of four rounds with the least damage points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
