			<description>Famicom Bunko: Hajimari no Mori (ファミコン文庫 はじまりの森 Famicom Pocket Books: The Forest of Beginnings?) is a text-based adventure game developed by Pax Softnica and published by Nintendo released only in Japan for the Super Famicom. It was released only on the Nintendo Power cartridge rewriting service, which ended on February 28, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of an elementary school boy who is staying at his grandfather's home in Kuzunoki village located in the countryside over summer vacation. He befriends a young girl living in the village, and goes through several mystical adventures over the course of the summer. The graphics are old-fashioned, and there is a distinctly pastoral scheme set throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is very similar to that of Heisei Shin Onigashima, where action and puzzle mini-games are mixed into an overall command-style adventure. The player chooses the character's actions from a command menu, and some commands must be selected within a certain time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Famicom Bunko: Hajimari no Mori&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
