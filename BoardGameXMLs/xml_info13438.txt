							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aladdin: Jasmine Magic Ring Game</name>
									
			<description>This kids game, based on the Disney movie, uses a 3-D game board. The object is to be the first player to help Princess Jasmine gather up her friends and meet Aladdin at the Wedding Pavilion for their marriage. On a turn, a player moves Jasmine (on the flying carpet) to any space on the lower board. Spaces all contain Magic Coins which the player turns over and examines through the Magic Ring revealing the hidden picture of a character. If it is a friend - Abu, Genie, Iago or Rajah - and you have not collected it, keep it and go again. If it is a Jafar coin or a friend the player already has, it is put back and the player's turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have collected all 4 friends move Jasmine to the alter and examine 1 of the 5 Wedding Coins. If it is Jafar you must try again next turn. If Aladdin is revealed the player wins and places Jasmine and Aladdin in the Wedding Pavilion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
