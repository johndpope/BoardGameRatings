							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Super Villain Handbook (Basic Edition - Supers!)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's true, super villains are a secretive lot. Other than the occasional slip of megalomania during world domination broadcasts, most super villains keep the essence of who they are and what they do under tight wraps. Dr. Comics (That would be Dr Tondro... Shh. It's a secret) has tapped every informant, minion, and ex-villainous love interest he could get his hooks into to divulge the secrets of what makes a super villain tick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Super Villain Handbook covers forty archetypes for various super villains that one might encounter throughout comics. While the book was created with ICONS in mind, there are many reasons that this is an essential resource for GMs of any superhero game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book classifies super villains not by what they can do (for example, &amp;quot;control magnetism&amp;quot;) but by their role in the story (&amp;quot;I must make the world safe for my people!&amp;quot;). In such roles, we see everything from the lowly Crime Boss to the Cosmic Menace. This allows villains of all types and power sets to fill different roles at the table without coming across as poorly re-skinned clones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
