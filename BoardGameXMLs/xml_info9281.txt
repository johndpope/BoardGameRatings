			<description>Hyperspace is an exploration game featuring a planet that has four physical dimensions. Two players compete to find the mountain (presumably mineral-bearing and therefore valuable) portions of the planet, using four playing pieces each of which can move across only one of the four terrain types. Terrain tiles are placed face-down, and are turned up when a player attempts to move a piece into the tile. If it's a mountain tile, the moving player scores a point. Tiles are turned over even if the moving piece isn't allowed to move into that type of terrain. The game ends when all the tiles have been turned face-up, and the player with the high score then wins. The counter mix deliberately provides more tiles than spaces on the board, but only 16 mountain tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
