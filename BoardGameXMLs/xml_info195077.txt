							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fear Fetchers</name>
									
			<description>Fear Fetchers is a relatively simple d6-based role playing game where the players are Monsters who are out to gather fear by Scaring humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the players will take on the role of Monsters: creations of darkness designed only to be spectacularly eerie. One of the players however will be the Monster Master, the evil S.O.B. that represents the monstrous overlords, the Scare-victims and everyone or everything else the players might encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core Fear Fetchers is designed to be humorous. If at the end of the evening you&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of good laughs about what happened at the gaming table, Fear Fetchers has done what it was designed to do. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to make the game dark and gritty, but that is up to the Monster Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;source: &amp;quot;About&amp;quot; section from the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
