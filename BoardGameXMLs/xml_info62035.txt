			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the boxed set of The World of Necroscope roleplaying game adapted from Brian Lumley's popular horror novel series and designed for West End Games' MasterBook system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boxed set includes the Necroscope WorldBook, as well as a MasterBook rule book, two ten-sided dice, and the MasterDeck, a card deck used for use with the MasterBook system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This boxed set seems to be somewhat rare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;The World of Necroscope is a roleplaying game set in the dark world of Brian Lumley's imagination. A world where paranormal spies, ESPionage agents, and Mind Spies fight a secret war against darker things and one another. The Wamphyri, or vampires, exist, and their age-old evil stretches from the beginning of time to threaten the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you are undaunted. You are not a mere human. You are talented. You are an ESPer, with powers undreamed of by your peers. You may be a telepath, a seer able to see into the future, a Shaman able to kill with a glance or perhaps able to talk to the teeming masses of the dead as a powerful Necroscope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
