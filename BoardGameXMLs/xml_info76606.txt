							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fury of the Furries</name>
									
			<description>Fury of the Furries is a platform/puzzler game released by Kalisto Entertainment for the Amiga, Amiga CD32, Macintosh and MS-DOS systems. (...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player guides a small furry, bouncy and fragile Tiny across eight regions of the land, Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and latterly the Castle where one must defeat the Wicked One. The regions each have unique music, color schemes and styles. Each has 10 separate levels and a collection of secret bonus levels. The final stage of the game has the player entering the machine (which turns out to be a large industrial complex) and destroying it. Along the way the player must avoid various perils, such as monsters, spikes and acid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's primary unique feature is Tiny's ability to transform itself into four different forms: yellow, green, red and blue. Different skills are required at different points, and not all forms are available in all levels. Particularly in levels which are primarily puzzlers, the player may encounter fields which activate and deactivate certain powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its yellow form, it controls the element of fire, allowing it to shoot fireballs. In its red form, it controls the element of earth, allowing it to eat through some elements of the scenery. In its green form, it controls the element of air, allowing it to produce ropes from its hands to swing around the environment and it can also pull different objects with its rope. In its blue form, it controls the element of water, allowing the ability to dive underwater and shooting bubbles that damage hostiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Furry of the Furries,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
