							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiki Totems</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tribes of the mythical island Tikonia have for centuries worshipped the Tiki God. All was fine and dandy until one day the tribe elder looked at the gathered worshipers and asked a simple question, &amp;quot;My beloved, how do we know that our great God really exists?&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As his words traveled throughout the crowd , he already knew that this was indeed a BIG mistake. The Tiki God was angry, very angry. I mean really really angry like flowing lava is going to burn down your village angry. But that still doesn&amp;rsquo;t describe it well - more like flying burning meteors are going to smash you all ANGRY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
