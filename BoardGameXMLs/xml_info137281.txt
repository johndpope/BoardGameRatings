							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Winx Club: Das magische Turnier</name>
									
			<description>A Winx Club themed memory game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 12 task cards and 48 tournament cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The task cards show which three Winx characters the player has to find. The tournament cards also show these characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The task cards are shuffled and distributed evenly among all players (face down). The 48 tournament cards are shuffled and laid out, also face down.&lt;br/&gt;Then each player turns over one of his/her task cards. It stays in front of them, face up. The task card shows them which characters he/she has to find.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns turning over three tournament cards. The aim is to turn over the three characters from one's own task cards in the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;If a tournament card shows the evil Trix, the active player's turn ends immediately. If a tournament card shows the Enchantix logo and all three Winx, the player gets to put the card in front of him/herself. It can later be exchanged for an additional card-turning activity (i.e. a player gets to turn over more than three cards in a turn).&lt;br/&gt;If a player solves one of their tasks, the three tournament cards and the task cards are removed from the game and the player turns over one of their other task cards.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a player's turn, all remaining open tournament cards are turned over again so that all cards are face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who is first to complete all their tasks wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
