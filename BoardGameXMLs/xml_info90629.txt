			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 2 is a motorcycle racing game for mobile devices. It is the sequel to the mobile title MotoGP and is based on gameplay elements in MotoGP: Ultimate Racing Technology 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features multiple tracks, riders and weather conditions to vary gameplay. The weather affects racing conditions, such as rain reducing traction. Players race in a behind-the-bike perspective on a number of licensed tracks from the MotoGP championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few different modes to choose from, including Stunt Mode and Career Mode. In Stunt Mode, players aim to build up their score by avoiding other racers. Career Mode allows players to create a custom rider and earn points in the championship by racing on the different tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
