			<description>I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees. I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees. I believe I'm sinkin' down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        - Robert Johnson, 1936 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With shaking hands, it's time to spark the lighter's flame and light a smoke. The first drag is not deep - the smoke is in the throat. Shaking, the smoke is blown in tiny puffs. The still shaking hands dial the three identical numbers on the old red phone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duuuut...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A crossroads, they met Ham all at a crossroads just as the sun disappeared behind the horizon. Now with lungs half full of burning smoke and with calmer hands, the cylinder is tilted out of the revolver. Two empty chambers, four empty shells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duuuut...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dark, everyone is alone. He gave them all an offer they could not resist. The smoke flows slowly into the luminous, darkened room. The empty cartridge case hits the round wooden table with a lazy and muted ting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duuuut...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eternal stench of menthol, it always hung heavily around Ham and was never welcome. You could understand them all, all their strange wishes. The grandfather wanted to save his grandson from the shadowy side of life. The Rocker wanted to stay forever with the life and the motorcycle. The striker would break the great power of the other, the detective wanted to be guilty, and the haunt wanted his ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duuuut...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was only one left now, but it was almost done, the debt nearly paid. But the price? Was it too much? The tobacco is gone and the filter begins to glow. It is obviously true what they say - when the angel is busy, the devil must answer one's call...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published as five four-page DOC files, each one presenting a character and the &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; specific to that character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
