							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So Sue Me!</name>
									
			<description>So Sue Me! is the game where you sue your friends, take their stuff and enjoy the wackiness of today's lawsuits.  In So Sue Me! players acquire businesses in order to get income.  But just like real life, any business you own also means you are taking a risk of being sued.  Spin the spinner, and if you land on your own business you collect money.  But if I land on your business, I am likely to SUE YOU!  Five decks of lawsuit cards tell me why I might want to sue, and suggest different amounts for lawsuits.  The backs of the cards, which are unseen by other players show the odds of winning suits at different levels.  So only I know the odds of winning my suit against you.  But look out!  You may have an Unfair Advantage card, which acts as an odds modifier.  Only you know what your UA card says, so we will have to bluff our way to a settlement, or go to trial...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
