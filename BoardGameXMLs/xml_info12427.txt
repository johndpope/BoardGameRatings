			<description>Trivia game about the Star Trek TV shows. It has 2400 questions about The Original Series, The Animated Series, Next Generation, DeepsSpace 9, Voyager and movies. The categories of the questions are: Generations, One to beam up, It&amp;acute;s life but..., Star Date, Other frontiers and singularities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a sheet with two columns: one with the numbers from one to six and the other with empty spaces. The question master throws a die, take a card and asks the question corresponding to the number to the player on his left. If the player answers the questions correctly, she or he ticks the corresponding column in her or his sheet.
