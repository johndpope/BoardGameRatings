			<description>Demon's Crest, known in Japan as Demon's Blazon Makaimura Monshō hen (デモンズブレイゾン -魔界村紋章編-, &amp;quot;Demon's Blazon: Demon World Village - Crest Arc&amp;quot;), is a side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Capcom in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the the third video game starring Firebrand (an enemy character from the Ghosts 'n Goblins series, known as &amp;quot;Red Arremer&amp;quot; in the Japanese version), following Gargoyle's Quest and Gargoyle's Quest II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player collects different 'crests' which, when equipped during the game, allow to change into different-ability Firebrands. Some of the possible powers are Earth, Wind and Water. The player also collects talismans, magic potions and other equipment during the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is a mix of standard platforming, with mild RPG elements. Each level can be played multiple times, and often the player has to revisit a level with new Crests to access areas, items and bosses that he or she could not before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Demon's Crest , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
