							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Block Off</name>
									
			<description>Block Off consists of a playing board, with a plain 8x8 grid, and a bunch of triangular plastic tiles (diagonal cut squares) in white and blue and a single die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate placing 3 triangles of their color, attempting to complete squares in their color, and patterns of completed squares as well. On a single turn they may ONLY complete squares of their color by playing against pieces already on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is an instant tie if played symmetrically. (The rules even warn against this.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mode described above is called &amp;quot;Thinker Style,&amp;quot; vs the &amp;quot;Gambler Style&amp;quot; where each player rolls a die to determine how many pieces they can place. This is intended to eliminate ties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
