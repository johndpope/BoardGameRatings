							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Siege of Irondale</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reports of this army have come from survivors of several large towns being utterly decimated by the hordes of Orcs, Goblins and various beasts and in some of the better defended towns, Hobgoblins. Accounts of a great Wyvern soaring above the army have also been heard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This army bears a crest on their banners &amp;ndash; the silhouette of a Wyvern, encircled by a crown with a tear drop of green within the crowns centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your quest is to find the Dwarven High Priest &amp;ndash; Fathnir Whitebeard. As he claims (through means of a message sent by raven) that the Goblin/Orcish army is led by a far more malevolent force than just primal instinct. Find the Priest, find his proof, if true, locate and if possible destroy this malevolent force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for several level 1 - 3 [characters].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
