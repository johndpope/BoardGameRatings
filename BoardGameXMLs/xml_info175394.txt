			<description>Spa&amp;szlig;vogel Spiel is  a role-and-move game.&lt;br/&gt;The track has 3 parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Player has to collect a full set of city Cards to get in the next part of the track (1st and 2nd part).&lt;br/&gt;There are fields with the city names. Each time a player hits one of these fields he gets one of the cards of this city. &lt;br/&gt;Due to the fact that the number of cards of 1 City is limited the player gets the card from another player if he knows who has this card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third part is only a short part to come to the finish field. &lt;br/&gt;There are some special event fields (fixed events and card driven). Cards are for example: Joker city-Card, Exchange city-Cards, has to skip 1 or 2 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
