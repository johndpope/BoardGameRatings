							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Government Worker: NSFGW</name>
									
			<description>Government Worker is a satirical card game about avoiding bureaucratic work.&lt;br/&gt; The objective of the game is to get through your work day while performing as little bureaucratic work as possible.&lt;br/&gt; The game progresses by drawing cards that: assign you work, let you avoid work by dicking off, and let you pass work off to your coworkers.&lt;br/&gt; The hand ends when a player draws a time card. The player with the least number of work hours recorded on their weekly time sheet is declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSFGW is the &amp;quot;Not Safe for Government Work&amp;quot; adult-themed expansion pack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
