			<description>A sort of &amp;quot;game of goose&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;snake and ladders&amp;quot;). &lt;br/&gt;It has no board, but a deck of cards (square tiles), shuffled and put face down to form the track at the beginning of the game: the first player landing on each card reveals it and follows the given instructions (e.g. &amp;quot;move one space backward&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;nothing happens&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;reach the last player&amp;quot;, etc.); these effects are valid for the rest of the game. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has a pawn (shaped as a car) starting at one end of the track. The goal of the game is to bring your pawn to the other end of the track. &lt;br/&gt;To play, you simply roll a six-sided die, move your pawn exactly that number of spaces forward and execute the instructions on the card you've reached. After that, it's the turn of the next player.&lt;br/&gt;Thus there's no decision to take in the whole game: simply roll the die and hope.&lt;br/&gt;The track made with cards acts as a &amp;quot;modular board&amp;quot; (it is different in every game).&lt;br/&gt;The game was licensed by the Walt Disney Company and so the cards show some of the famous Disney characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
