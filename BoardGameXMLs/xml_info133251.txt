							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Quest for Teh Golden Thong</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is very late on an early spring night. There is a slight chill in the spring air wafting through the shuttered windows. You are all drinking in Rydell's Kapeleia in Athens, and have been at it all night. The proprietors, Zuko and his wife Olsson have just announced last call when suddenly the small fire flares up as the door opens. An old man walks in, looks around and drops his cloak off his shoulders. He instantly transforms into a healthy, robust young man with long black curly hair. By the gods it is Zeus himself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ho patrons!&amp;quot; He bellows, a quick glance around reveals that you are the only ones still conscious. &amp;quot;I have a task for you. My new girlfriend is nagging me for a valentines day gift, and only one gift will do for a beauty such as she - you must bring me Teh Golden Thong of Aphrodite! If you do me this favor, I will reward you all with some really 'phat lewt', or whatever it is you kids call it these days. Now if you will excuse me, I have business to attend to.&amp;quot; And with that, he walks over to Olsson and scoops her up over his shoulder and goes into the back room from whence the sounds of lovemaking soon emanate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddly, Zuko seems to have fallen asleep at the bar with a full pitcher of grog by his hand...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
