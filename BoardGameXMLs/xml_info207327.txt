			<description>Nachhaltige Entwicklung combines education and fun. The game is about sustainable development (that's what the title translates to) in germany. Players act as newsmakers trying to compete for the most important topics to put in their papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 1:&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round there are two of the two-faced news cards on the table, showing a little headline or news story on the upside, and one of seven colors (political topics) and some symbols unseen on the backside (like social security, health, mobility, education, environment, etc.). Players can acquire those cards by blind bidding of reporter cards. They must try to match their reporter cards to the topic of the news item by assessing which political topic this story is about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 2: reporter and news cards are flipped. Players can only get those cards that they have matched the symbols of. The player with the most stars gets the card. Then, every player gets their reporter cards back, regardless of success in the auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 3: Players can swap news and reporter cards with each other if they like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 4: Writing an article - scoring points. This is the only phase with a set player order. The first player chooses two or more news cards of the same color (i.e. topic), then draws an event card from the event deck and reads out the instructions that fit the color of the cards chosen. He then scores points based on the event card, symbols on the news cards, and some bonus points about number of news cards or combinations of symbols. He also gets an additional reporter card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a set number of rounds or time, so it can be easily fit into a school lesson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a reimplementation of a Swiss game called Klartext.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
