							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rappan Athuk Area 29: Castle Calaelen</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castle Calaelen (Cah-lay-lan) sits in ruin, built into the side of a small hill, west of Zelkor&amp;rsquo;s Ferry and north of the Mouth of Doom. Its construction was ordered by an Elven noble with more coin than sense. It pre-dates the fall of Tsar and the Sunken Graveyard, although time has not been kind to it. More a fort or manor than a proper castle, it has been home to anyone who wanted a roof over their heads&amp;mdash;even if the roof looked like it was ready to fall in at any moment. The pale stone bricks of the walls have begun to crumble or roll down the hill, and the main building does not look to be in good shape; the entire structure leans to the east in a worrying way. Recently it has become home to a tribe of goblins who have decided to stay, however a few discarded objects from previous owners have given these goblins an edge over anyone who would dispossess them of their estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
