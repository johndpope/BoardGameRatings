			<description>Following the fall of Rhodes, the Knights of St John rewarded Suleiman&amp;rsquo;s magnanimity by harassing Turkish shipping and commerce from their new home in Malta. In 1565, Suleiman sent his generals to finish the task he had left incomplete more than 40 years previously. The Turks laid siege with a force that reached 60,000 in number. They would exterminate the 500 Knights of St John defending the island and wipe the Order from the face of the earth &amp;ndash; or so they thought.  If ever there was an &amp;lsquo;against the odds&amp;rsquo; situation then this was surely it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waning Crescent, Shattered Cross (WCSC) recreates the incredible events that occurred on this small Mediterranean island and changed the course of European history. Using cards to drive events, WCSC is a relatively quick playing, moderate complexity simulation. Players must decide whether to try to build their hands to a size that might deliver a decisive blow or to use their cards to gradually wear down their opponent. And the play of cards complements the management of resource including supply, artillery, men and even honour. Acts of treachery, torture and atrocities will contrast starkly with acts of heroism, rousing speeches and even the celebration of Saints Days in the midst of horror and terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the full 2-player campaign scenario, there is also a short/learning scenario and a 'bot' controlled solitaire variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
