							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Quest: Slime Race</name>
									
			<description>This is a derby racing game based on the recuring &amp;quot;Slime Races&amp;quot; in the Dragon Quest video game series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses cards to move the various-colored Slimes around the racetrack. Most cards involve moving a specific Slime a specific number of spaces, but several special cards apply to Slimes in certain race positions (e.g. The Slime in first place may double the distance between it and the Slime in second). Some Slimes have a better set of movement cards than others, and therefore receive lower odds on the betting chart.&lt;br/&gt;Players each get a hand of 7 cards. Depending on what cards a player has, they can form a strategy for which Slimes they think they can push into first and second place at the finish line. The players bet on which Slimes they think will win. Players then take turns playing cards to move the Slimes until there is a first and second place winner. Players tally up their score and advance their score marker. First player to reach 50 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook is in Japanese, but there are many illustrations, so it is possible to figure out the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
