			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silly'ables is a hilarious word game for 2 to 8 teams, ages 12 to adult. Each team when it&amp;rsquo;s their turn rolls a die, and by that roll, they&amp;rsquo;ll know whether they&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve a one, two, or three syllable word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 500 playing cards in the game, each with a die representation from one to six. If a team tosses a 1 or 4 they will try to solve a one syllable word, toss a 2 or 5 they will try to solve a two syllable word, and finally if they toss a 3 or 6 they will try to solve a three syllable word. On each card there are random pictures of a red die, which are (all play) cards and the remaining picture of dies are in white (for that team only) cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team will choose their partner to either be the giver or receiver of clues, and will alternate roles each time. No team member can be a giver or receiver more than once in a row. The giver of the clues can draw, do gestures, or give one word clues to get their partner to guess the target word. NO talking other than one word clues!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three special symbols that might be on the cards. One that lets your partner know that a word sounds like another. Second, a symbol that indicates that you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a word opposite of the word given as a clue. Finally third, a hand that shows either one, two, or three fingers which lets your partner know your looking for the first, second, or third syllable of a word to use with other syllables to eventually solve the target word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
