			<description>(Translated from the Japanese rule book)&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players cooperate in order to defeat huge monsters. All damage dealt to the monster is directly converted into Victory Points, and the one with the most VPs when the third monster is defeated, is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;But it is not an easy task to deal damage to these huge creatures. If you're too far away, you can't deal any damage at all. In order to deal damage, and earn points, you need to get close to the monster, and run the risk of taking damage yourself.&lt;br/&gt;And dealing damage isn't the only thing you must be careful about. The other players are aiming at your back. They might try to push you to the front line. If you're pushed to the front, and the monster gets you, all your points are halved!&lt;br/&gt;Seeing to that the leading player gets nicely defeated, and still having cards left to deal some damage to the monster, will make you the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
