			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Xerospace have six Traits (Attributes), namely:  Dexterity, Movement, Size, Perception, Tech, and Psionic.  Characters select two traits in which they are &amp;quot;better than most&amp;quot; and two traits in which they are &amp;quot;not as good as most&amp;quot;.  Traits are then assigned values of 5, 6, or 7, depending on their categorization.  Each trait in turn yields up to three starting Skills and each character may select a total of five starting Skills.  Characters will start with Skill Values of 5-10.  Characters also have a variety of other traits including Mutations, Life and Energy.  Mutations are special abilities (beneficial) and work much like bonus Skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skill resolution is performed by 2d6 plus related Skill Value plus related Trait Value, producing a number from 1-21.  Various types of success (or failure) are supported based on the results--each Skill uses a unique chart of results.  Whenever a character rolls &amp;quot;Doubles&amp;quot; on a Skill check this is noted and eventually leads to a Skill Value increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is atypical inasmuch as each &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot; is divided into three &amp;quot;rounds&amp;quot; which are, in order, Preparation Round, Maneuver Round, and Resolution Round.  Combat otherwise resolves much like a Skill resolution.  Note that &amp;quot;Combat between spacecraft should be run just like combat between individuals&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
