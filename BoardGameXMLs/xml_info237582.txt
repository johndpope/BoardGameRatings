			<description>NeoExodus Legacies Keystone Episode 0.2 - Machine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that the dying words of the First Ones was that they will yet consume everything. You, your friends and family, the multiverse. This is simply how things are, you must accept it. If this is the case, even the Kaga, man-among-gods and god-among-men will fall to them, though it is what defeated them two millennia ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or did it? As you know, there has been a recent uproar in communities of living machines, &amp;ldquo;androids&amp;rdquo; they are called. They say one among them has begun preaching that their creator, the Kaga, seeks the destruction of the world. Was its long ago victory over the First Ones simply a ploy? More likely, one android has simply gone mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I understand that is where you come in. I don&amp;rsquo;t care if you believe the androids or the one they call Heretic. I just want to wish you luck. I truly do hope you find it &amp;ndash; if you have a moment on your return, I would like to know what he was like. He certainly had to have gotten these unlikely ideas from somewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        - Large-Biter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A problem-solving adventure set in the Arman protectorate. The party begins play right in the middle of things: they are climbing the outside of the &amp;lsquo;booting up&amp;rsquo; walking fortress, which has begun booting up without anyone commanding it to. What could go wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3rd - 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
