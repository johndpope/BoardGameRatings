			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules began as an adaptation of the Fate 3.0 rules, as seen in Spirit of the Century, to the Castle Falkenstein setting. It eventually evolved into a slightly more generic set of rules for any Steam and Sorcery setting, taking some liberties with the Falkenstein setting in the process and adding elements from Changling :The Lost and other sources. This is version 1.20, and includes an expanded Lore section with sample spells, how to build new Lores, Matter Lore was renamed Transmutation, Cantrips are now a stunt and were replaced by the new Technomancy lore, and Summoning now requires a Stunt (each Lore now has at least 1 stunt). I also added the Troll race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
