			<description>Players try to bring their population to prosperity by gaining the blessings of the olympian gods!&lt;br/&gt;The game uses dice to track population size and a secret bidding mechanism for gaining the god's blessings.&lt;br/&gt;It's a fun mix of some careful planning and scheming but as always, when gods are involved, things can often go horribly wrong and get a bit chaotic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview: In this game players take control of a population (=points, represented by dice) and compete with other players for the favours of gods in hope of being the first player to advance their population to 15 (20 for a longer game, 12 for a shorter game) points and thereby win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in several rounds divided into Phases, the &amp;bdquo;worship phase&amp;ldquo; and the &amp;bdquo;blessing phase&amp;ldquo;. &lt;br/&gt;During the &amp;quot;worship phase&amp;quot;, players play their offering cards on the gods in rounds of secret bidding.&lt;br/&gt;Then in the &amp;quot;blessing phase&amp;quot;, the gods are checked in sequence for which players played offering cards on them. The player to have played the highest card receives the &amp;quot;major blessing&amp;quot;, all other players to have played any cards with a value greater than 0 receive the &amp;quot;lesser blessing&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;blessings can have all kinds of effects, ranging form players directly gaining points by gaining dice or adding points to their dice, but also performing actions like stealing other player's dice or exchanging dice with other players.&lt;br/&gt;When all god's blessings have been resolved play continues with the next round of bidding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
