							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Brilliant Combat: The Battle of Manila Bay</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Our fleet engaged the enemy in brilliant combat, protected by the Cavite and Manila forts. They obliged the enemy, with heavy loss, to maneuver repeatedly. At 9 o&amp;rsquo;clock the American Squadron took refuge behind the foreign shipping, on the east side of the bay. Our fleet, considering the enemy&amp;rsquo;s superiority, naturally suffered severe loss&amp;hellip;. There was considerable loss of life.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Spanish Admiral Montojo&amp;rsquo;s telegraph to Madrid during the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Brilliant Combat is the &amp;ldquo;sister&amp;rdquo; title of Death Before Dishonor: The Battle of Santiago that was the 2013 CSW Gold Level Donation reward. Like its counterpart the game uses a very simple and fun to play design that models the history well without a lot of record-keeping, and is also very solitaire play friendly. The game features the historical battle, several what-ifs, as well as scenarios that posit the Spanish Reserve Fleet sailing to take back the Philippines, or the German Asiatic Squadron challenging Admiral Dewey&amp;rsquo;s for control of the archipelago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of A Brilliant Combat has one 11 by 17 inch map, one sheet of 77 single-sided, un-mounted counters, one players&amp;rsquo; aide sheet and a 4 page rule book. Graphics are by Bruce Yearian. A Brilliant Combat sells for $11.95 plus shipping. Mounted counters can be had for an additional $5.00.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
