			<description>This is an interesting little card game... &lt;br/&gt;Included are two sets of instructions - a solitaire game called &amp;quot;Barista&amp;quot;, that plays similarly to traditional solitaire, except that you collect recipe cards for different coffee drinks and then build the ingredients on top of them - and &amp;quot;Percolator&amp;quot;, where players race to build a coffee drink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are cute with simple drawings of Vanilla, Cocoa, Irish Creme, Espresso, and the like - there's even a stir stick card that is used sort of like a wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
