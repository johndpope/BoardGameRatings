							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maze of Aeoklidias</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Maze of Aeoklidias. Enter if you dare! Any time, any game any system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within the wilderness, atop a butte of ancient stone lies the Maze of Aeoklidias. There it has lain since before the Great Storm, though none who live now know of its purpose then. Whether ravaged by the Storm or purpose-built by some mad wizard, The Maze stands yet today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing upon which all who voyage there agree is that The Maze exists still, as magical as ever. Fools have gone there seeking treasure and scowlers knowledge, wizards magic and warriors, skill. Those who returned to their kith and kin spoke only of the folly of the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Maze of Aeoklidias, a centuries-ancient magical construction of unknown origin and purpose. What is known is that brave and hardy adventurers have faced the Maze and found treasure beyond mere gold and gems. Be warned, however. More enter the Maze than leave it. Are you up to the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maze of Aeoklidias is an adventure supplement written for the Dungeon Crawl Unlimited RPG system but usable in any other. The basic map contains sixteen simple elements, any of which can be combined and recombined for completely new adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a puzzle and combat adventure. Upon entering the Maze, the characters are presented a Challenge. It's then up to them to solve the riddles, gather what they need and use it properly. Success opens the doorway out. Failure... Not really an option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
