			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For one reason or another, players may wind up rooting through the garbage, whether this be a small household bin, a larger public one, a Dumpster or even a waste disposal site. This could be whilst they are looking for evidence or clues for an ongoing adventure, or perhaps even whilst looking for useful supplies following an apocalyptic event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This modern list provides 100 detailed items that players could find whilst doing this. None of them are relevant to what they are looking for, although players might think some could be, and none are useful without some serious creativity. Many of them are actively disgusting to stumble across and some are potentially dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;91. Syringe - A used hypodermic syringe without a cap on the needle, of unknown provenance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
