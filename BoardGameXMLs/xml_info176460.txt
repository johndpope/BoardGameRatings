			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 60 x 40 inch, full color battlemap of an Arabian Fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT) and include a 360 degree view of the inside of the Arabian Fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very large map and is at a scale of 10ft per inch to enable it to fit into a usable size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If we can break into the Arabian Fortress, we can steal their most precious artifacts, the Lamps of the North, West, South, and East Winds!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Salim Dakin, Arabian Thief&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arabian Fortress is a large exterior map of a fortified city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arabian Fortress is intended for use in fantasy, or historical settings. It can also be used as a fortress town that has survived to the modern day as well. The Arabian Fortress has a 360-degree panoramic view centered in the eastern part of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grasping for Air: Salim Dakin covets the Lamps of the North, West, South, and East Winds, four fabled lamps that when rubbed provide power to the wielder of the artifacts. They are heavily guarded under lock and key in an Arabian Fortress that is oddly placed in a remote mountain range far from the borders of the Caliphate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salim Dakin hires the group to help him obtain the artifacts he covets, offering the group any other treasure in the Arabian Fortress as their reward as well as providing a stipend to start for buying provisions and camels for the travel to the fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the group gets to the fortress, they need to sneak into the fortress or try and fight their way through the fortress to get to the sealed vault. Sali Daba knows how to get through the seal if he has survived to this point in the adventure. However, breaking the seal makes a thunderous noise and alerts the guards to the theft. The group heads inside finding four pedestals with the lamps placed in their cardinal directions. The Arabian inscriptions say Enlil and Ninlil on the north and east pedestals and Amun and Shu on the south and west pedestals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the lamps are rubbed, they summon a djinn or wind elemental that will fight for the person who holds the lamp. However, there is a catch. The north and south winds and west and east winds are diametrically opposed. Then cannot exist in the same area and instead of cooperating, will fight each other for supremacy until one is forced back into the lamp before following the holder of the lamp&amp;rsquo;s orders again. Given the chance, the wind elemental may even attack the wielder of a lamp of the opposing wind. The group may be able to escape with the help of the djinn, and may well let Salim Dakin have his cursed lamps after this experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
