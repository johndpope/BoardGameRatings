							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Last Chance Gas Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 32 x 30 inch map of a Gas Station and Garage, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This the last place to stop for fifty miles. You better head on in and buy some snacks and fuel for the road ahead.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Last Chance Fuel Attendant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Chance, Gas Station and Garage is a single map of the interior of a small gas station and garage as well as the exterior area including the gas pump, fenced gas station area, the road going past the station, and the hilly environs surrounding the station&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Chance, Gas Station and Garage can be used in modern and horror games. It can also be of use in pulp, superheroes (lots of objects that can be thrown around for supers fights), or even post-apocalyptic survival games (The location is not ruined, but a scouring over an abandoned gas station is definitely within the genre).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One idea for the map is to use it with Cabin in the Wilderness. Last Chance is the last gas station before the group gets to the cabin. The locals tell a tale of constant murders near the cabin after a couple that lived in the cabin died under mysterious circumstances, but by their rough country manner, the group may suspect them of possibly being the perpetrators. An interesting twist might be to have these characters come in guns blazing and help them fight the monster after being suspicious of them earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Stop: Being the only gas station in fifty miles has its advantages when the local police look the other way on your activities. The gas station full service fuel attendant pretends to be friendly and points customers inside the gas station. While they are inside he fuels up their vehicle, smiles and waves as they pay. Meanwhile, he slashes a tire or causes other damage to their car to get it to malfunction and be unable to pull out of the gas station. After the customers leave the general store, they find their vehicles unable to move, forcing them to pay extra for garage repair fees and in the worst cases, they have to stay in the local motel while their car is fixed in the garage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters can get involved as a group of detectives sent by a higher governmental police agency (Such as county, state police, or even F.B.I.) assigned to investigate a rash of murders in the local motel. They could also be private detectives hired to investigate the murder of a particular victim. Another possibility is they are simply traveling through and end up at the Last Chance and may be targeted by their scam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
