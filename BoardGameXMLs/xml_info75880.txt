			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrillville is a simulation and strategy video game that simulates theme park management. It was developed by Frontier Developments, also a developer of the similar theme park game RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The game is available on the PlayStation 2, the PlayStation Portable, and Xbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike some traditional management sim games that lock you out of the fun stuff, Thrillville allows you to create your own rides and ride them also. There is also an element of retail management, as you try to keep your prices in check with the expectations of your would-be customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Basically, the concept of this game is to build your very own dream theme park that will satisfy people looking for a thrill. The idea is to keep customers happy by building amazing rollercoasters, carnival rides, and carnival games (such as bumper cars, arcade games, etc). In party play mode, you can play all the minigames available against the computer or friends. You also have to build facilities that would be available in amusement parks, such as bathrooms, food stalls, drink stalls and even some hat and balloon stalls. You may also talk and interact with your guests. Using a teen character you may also flirt with the opposite sex. If you have a child as an avatar, you may matchmake. You can play minigames to gain money, make loans, and hire staff to clean, entertain, and fix rides. Keeping your park happy will increase publicity, and money. There are missions availabale to do so that you may gain riches and other suprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reception&lt;br/&gt;Thrillville was generally well-received, except by X-Play, which gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying that it was &amp;quot;as exciting as a tax audit,&amp;quot; as well as citing a lack of customization and people to play with online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Spot: 7.7/10 for Xbox, and 7.6 for PS2 &lt;br/&gt;IGN: 7.5/10 &lt;br/&gt;X-Play: 2/5 &lt;br/&gt;Game Informer: 7.75/10 &lt;br/&gt;Official PlayStation 2 Magazine-UK : 8/10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequel&lt;br/&gt;A sequel, entitled Thrillville: Off the Rails, was released on October 16, 2007 for the PlayStation Portable, Wii, PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontier Developments returned to create Off the Rails for all mentioned platforms, except for the Nintendo DS version, which was developed by DC Studios. The game features over 20 rides and over 30 minigames&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
