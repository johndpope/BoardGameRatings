			<description>Warlords and Sellswords is card game about building an army to impress the local king so that he will hire your army to fight his war. You will compete against other new armies over a ten round game. The king has outlawed open combat between all armies applying for the job but, what the king does not know will not hurt him. You can murder, steal, and sabotage the other armies to make yours look the most appealing for war. The king will make his decision at the end of 10th day but everyday leading up to it he will send an advisor to form an option of the each army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will spend 10 rounds, in 4 phases.  The Draw phase, the Action phase, the Cleanup phase and the Evaluation phase form a single round. During play, players will build an army, by spending resources and hiring troops from their hand. Players do not manage a personal deck, instead they build their own personal army to gain points and disrupt other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round the player with the most points receives a recommendation from the King's advisors.  The winner is the player after ten rounds with the most power in their army, and the most reccomendations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
