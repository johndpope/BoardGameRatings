							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Samurai Warlords: A Game of Conquest in Feudal Japan (1192-1603).</name>
									
			<description>INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;SAMURAI WARLORDS is a semi-historical game where one to four Players assume the roles of minor Samurai Warlords, or Daimyo, in Japan during the time of the Wars for Domination. There are two Periods that Players can choose to Play. The first is the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) when there is a risk of Mongol Invasions. The second Period is the Sengoku Period or Age of Civil War (1467-1603) which is set during the time of the Wars of Unification. There are many rich rice paddies, thick forests with deer and boar and rolling hills, all ready for the taking as the riches of Medieval Japan can be yours. All you need is to demonstrate a firm hand and fruitful estates. A strong sword (or Katana) and loyal followers are also required to maintain your lands and ensure the villagers are providing the proper taxes. You must also be able to defend your territories from rival Lords and invading Mongols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;Players assume the roles of Samurai Daimyos in Feudal Japan during either the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) or the Sengoku Period (1467-1603) with the goals of expanding and improving their territorial control. Daimyos do this by raising Retinues and conquering neighboring territories. Daimyos can, also, improve their holdings by building Hans (Hamlets), Manors and Castles. A Game consists of up to 10 Campaign Seasons. Players may agree to play fewer or more as desired. The Player, who at the end of any Campaign Season (Spring, Summer or Autumn) controls the greatest Settlement Value from their Hans, Manors and Castles, is the Victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
