			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dioxoid is a game of chain reactions.  Inside an oxygen molecule, two players bounce their electrons against each other to surround the opponent's nucleus. A single action may cause a reaction that advances or disrupts every electron, changing the entire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dioxoid is an abstract strategy game. Each player has eight identical pieces which represent electrons. These move one space at a time. When an electron moves adjacent to any other electron, the non-moving electron is repelled and must move away; if it cannot, the moving electron moves away. The repelled electrons may cause others to move, etc. The object is to get all of one's own electrons into the opponent's starting spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
