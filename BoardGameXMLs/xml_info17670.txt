			<description>WICKED WHIST is a board game which adds another dimension to the classic card game - Whist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to graduate from one corner of the playing board to the eye at the center.  This is achieved by playing Whist and, after each hand, moving clockwise around the board - one square for each trick made.  The first player to reach the center (having made exactly the right number of tricks) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways of achieving this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  By completing full circuits of the board and by moving from one level to the next at selected points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  By means of special squares which send you from outer to inner circuits (or vice versa) in a manner similar to Snakes and Ladders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The layout of the board forces players to consider in advance how many tricks they require to win so as to land on an advantage square, or avoid a forfeit square.  At the same time they must also consider what they need to do to force their opponents into minimizing the tricks they win, or forcing tricks on them so that they land on a forfeit square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
