			<description>Ludonaute announces Yggdrasil for Ipad, its co-operative board game designed specifically for Ipad. Ygdrasil for Ipad features the Pier&amp;ocirc;&amp;rsquo;s wonderful artwork and the original game rules. You can play solo or in Pass &amp;amp; Play mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ipad application makes the game even easier to play, faster and addicting. You can play a game in half an hour, without be annoyed setting up the contents, nor putting them away, with a nice background music. In short, such happiness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like in the &amp;ldquo;cardboard&amp;rdquo; board game, you can adjust the difficulty level with the special cards and the number of Gods you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yggdrasil for Ipad supports Game Center. We have entered a scoring system, which allows you to compare the scores of all your games and if you deserve it, to enter the Hall of Fame. You can unlock gradually Ragnar&amp;ouml;k cards and the 3 promo Gods Vidar, Frigg and Balder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bader, who is Balder (Baldr)? Baldr is a new God we offer you in Yggdrasil for Ipad. We told you a litle about him here. His power: for one action, you can score one victory point. Enough to break your records!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
