			<description>The objective is to create a tweet/response for the selected #hashtag.&lt;br/&gt;For example, if the chosen #hashtag by the round leader is '#useless' players write something that is useless, such as 'Grandmas bra' or 'My husband's handyman skills'.&lt;br/&gt;Your response can be anything, as long as it relates to the #hashtag; Tell the truth or make something up; Be creative, witty and funny.&lt;br/&gt;Players get one point for each response they match with the correct author, and two points are awarded by the round leader to the player whose response they like best.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends either when all players have been round leader, or after a predetermined number of rounds. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
