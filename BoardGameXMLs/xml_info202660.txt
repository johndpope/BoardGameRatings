			<description>The wolves want rabbit for dinner, but the bunny has other ideas! The rabbit has superior agility, but the wolves have pack tactics. Will the wolves feast, or will the rabbit rest easy in its comfy den?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Run Bunny Run, one player is the bunny trying to make its way home, and the rest are hungry wolves! The wolf players move by placing cards that show where their next move will be (akin to Wings of War), and they work as a group to corner the rabbit. The rabbit player moves relative to the wolves, trying to find a path through the danger and to the safety of their rabbit hole. Will you be the hunter or the hunted?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the movement cards, the game includes a few rabbit holes and fences to make the gameplay more varied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
