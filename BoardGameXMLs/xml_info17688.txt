			<description>The rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How to play Zig Zag: a game of skill for 2 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;To be first to capture all your opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparations&lt;br/&gt;Issue 4 light pegs to yourself and four dark to your opponent. Place the pegs on the board on the line nearest your recess or pocket.&lt;br/&gt;Toss or draw for first turn. Alternate thereafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Play&lt;br/&gt;1. Move any one of your own pegs at each turn into one, two or three adjacent holes at your discretion provided that: &lt;br/&gt;(a) each hole moved into is in the direction indicated by the arrow surrounding each hole moved out of&lt;br/&gt;(b) intermediate holes, if any, are vacant&lt;br/&gt;(c) the hole your turn ends in is either vacant or occupied by an opposing peg which is removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;2. Continue to move any one own peg in this way at each turn until only one player has a peg or pegs still in play and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copyright 1983 David Smith and Associates. Christchurch, New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other board games in the Quest series are: Mini Halma, Helter Skelter, Tac Tix, Draughts/Checkers, Nine Men's Morris, Mini Ludo.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Handcrafted in solid native hardwood (rimu) by the IQ Company of New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quest  14 Ryan Place, Manukau City, New Zealand&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This board game in the Quest series of the IQ Company of New Zealand is a simple abstract game made as a nice heavy wooden board with wooden pegs for pieces. The board shows a 4X4 grid of holes for the peg pieces. Each hole is surrounded by an outline of an arrow; two of the holes are surrounded by an outline showing arrows pointing in two directions. At each end of the board is a felt-lined depression to hold captured pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not clear if the David Smith in the copyright line for the game is the same David Smith of other games in the BGG database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not the same game as the Zig Zag published by Editrice Giochi, also included in the BGG database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
