			<description>Players are dealt a hand of cards. Each card has one of seven symbols, one of seven numbers, one of seven colors, and one of seven combinations of dots. A draw card is turned over, and it will lack one of each of the symbols, numbers, colors, and dot combinations. Players try to be the first to play one of their cards that matches one of the missing items on the draw card. Then, a new draw card is turned over and the process is repeated. The first player to get rid of his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
