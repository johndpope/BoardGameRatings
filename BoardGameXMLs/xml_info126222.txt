							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Builders of R&#039;lyeh</name>
									
			<description>The antediluvian city of R'lyeh was constructed of cyclopean stones by extraterrestrial intelligences. Players are the shoggoth minions laying the pyramidal cornerstones of dread Cthulhu's great watery manse, where he and his brethren will wait for the stars to align. May the stones that you have quarried from the depths serve to enclose his tomb at the pinnacle of the crazed city!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Builders of R'lyeh is a homegrown game that uses Looney Pyramids (from Looney Labs) and Cthulhu Dice (from Steve Jackson Games), along with custom structural cards. A d12 or 2d6 can be substituted for the Cthulhu Dice hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns adding to a bizarre structure according to their dice rolls. Each player has their own color of pyramid, and there is an additional color for Cthulhu, but players can play their own pyramids or ones belonging to each other. When any one color is exhausted, the player whose color is at the the top of the completed structure wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a solitaire variant included with the original rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
