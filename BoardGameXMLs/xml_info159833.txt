			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;an Alternity mini-scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interplanetary racing vessels or extreme adventure runabouts, of the sort that the heroes must chase down in this scenario, might appeal to the Stellar Ring citizens of a somewhat wild, not over-populated system or to the pioneering pride of a more developed colonial world, such as Bluefall or Alaundril in the Verge. &lt;br/&gt;This mini-scenario should suit heroes created and organised as an expert ship's crew who are used to working together. Multiple possible methods to address each scene don't assume that the heroes own a vessel. A group who are particularly well prepared with a highly-capable ship and/or specialised skills might require adjustments, such as more difficult checks or similarly-competent Supporting Cast rivals, to provide a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;Heroes who are fans of the races might benefit from the specific skill Knowledge-interplanetary racing, which provides details of the events, rules, vessels and personalities involved in this exciting pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
