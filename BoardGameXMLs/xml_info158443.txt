			<description>A Scrabble-like game and board that uses number counters instead of letter tiles. The object of the game is to score as many rows of figures that add up to 21. Players take turns placing counters from their personal sets, of which they have three in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring does not begin until the fourth round, to allow numbers to build up on the board. During the initial three rounds players may not place a counter if the total in a straight line in any direction would exceed 21.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the fourth round on, players aim to place counters so that they complete lines adding up to 21. The basic score for a line adding up to 21 is 5 points, but 10 points can be scored by placing the counter on a square that matches the colour of your own pieces, or more by placing the counter on squares marked 15, 20 or 30, scoring that many points respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a line adding up to 21 is scored, the counter that was last placed is turned face down. No counters may be placed adjacent to such a counter, except for the counter with a star, which counts as 21 in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has used all his counters on no player is able to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
