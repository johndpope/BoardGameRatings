			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Election Frenzy is a new card game, based on the wild world of Presidential politics. Win the game by collecting endorsements, popularity, and media points. Attack your opponents with attack ads and scandals. Manage your campaign funds and win the Presidency!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Election Frenzy, there are 3 rounds, and each round is split into two phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase 1, the Campaign phase, players try to build the strongest hand possible, by collecting cards in the Popularity, Endorsements, and Media categories (suits); similar to poker, Uno, and Sushi-Go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase 2, the Attack phase, players use attacking cards to either burn or steal desired cards from their opponents; similar to Go Fish, and Bang!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of each suit receives 2 electoral points, while the runner up receives 1. (Example: 1st place in Popularity = 2 pts. 2nd place in Endorsements = 1 pt. 3rd place in Media = 0 pts. TOTAL = 3 pts)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 3 rounds, the player with the most electoral points is the President!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some really fun nuances to the game. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, based on the real life politicians who are being parodied. For example, Hillary has a bonus each round for the Endorsements, while Donald has a bonus each round for Media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character also starts the game with a fixed amount of money. Money is needed to launch attacks. There is also money scattered throughout the deck, so even if you spend all of your cash, there is still a chance to replenish your funds by drawing the right cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
