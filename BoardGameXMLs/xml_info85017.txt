			<description>Roll and move with an ever-changing game board. The board consists of seven tiles which contain roads with intersections. One of these tiles is randomly chosen as the starting field; all players place their playing pieces on it. &lt;br/&gt;The active player rolls and moves, trying to reach the field on a tile which shows his/her color. If successful, the player discards one of his/her handcards (the one with the number of the tile). When going over the edge of the board, another board tile with no player on it can be attached at that edge. When a player has gotten rid of all cards, s/he goes back to the starting tile. The first player to reach a certain field on that tile is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
