			<description>The purpose of the game is to knock the other player into a sewer manhole. There is a time limit, and the player has a set limit of stamina, both of which are represented by numbers. The player has two types of attacks: a light punch and a heavy punch. The light punch doesn't push your opponent as far as the heavy punch, but it is harder to block. The heavy punch sends your opponent reeling backwards, but can be blocked easily and takes a bit longer to pull off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every punch you throw, you lose 1 stamina. Flower pots are occasionally dropped from windows, which, if one hits a person, they will be dazed and will lose 5 stamina. When a player is knocked off the pavement, they would then advance to the next street. In addition, a police car will pass by the fighting every 30 seconds which causes the players to return to their starting positions. The fighters are not named and are just a palette swap of the player's character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Urban Champion , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
