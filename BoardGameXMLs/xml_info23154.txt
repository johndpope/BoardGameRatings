							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder in Philly!</name>
									
			<description>Contrary to what our history books tell us, the colonists did not leave England to gain freedom&amp;hellip;.not by a long shot. They left their homeland to gain spacious new territories, listen to jazz and enjoy fast food. However, they did not expect the numerous and unfortunate encounters with the Native Americans. Hence, the colonists needed the support of the British Army. NO WAY DID THEY EVER WANT INDEPENDENCE!  Why, they even held a tea party in Boston to honor King George and to present their &amp;quot;DECLARATION OF DE-PENDENCE&amp;quot;.  This document begged for more British intervention and rule. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were a little harder than expected.  Their Declaration revealed an emotional pleas for more taxes, more stern governors and the security of the Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what happened?  Well, unfortunately for the colonists, King George was fed up the &amp;quot;American Leaches&amp;quot; and wanted to sever all ties. Thaddeus Bell, Philadelphia's Town Crier, was to spread the news of the King's intention&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;intention of war! &amp;quot;Was&amp;quot; is the key word here for Thaddeus never did get the opportunity to ring his bell. The poor fellow's body was found in bed by a rather shaken chambermaid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come visit colonial Philly in the year 1776 and join General Eggs Benedict Arnold, Prudence Plum, Paul Reverse, the Princess Featherbed (to name just a few) and help reveal the facts that will lead to the culprit.  So get out those powdered wigs and pewter goblets and get read to solve &amp;quot;Murder in Philly!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
