			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played by all players in all ages - adults, young and children from agre 5 and up. Goal is to educate about birds and to get familiarized with their world.&lt;br/&gt;The game starter set comes with 30 bird cards, which later hopefully can be expanded by new bird decks, so that all players could have more fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in different age can choose a difficulty level by their knowledge of birds before the game or can start with the easiest setting and enjoy how easy it is to later know birds by their song, looks and local names and memorize them. For that reason we believe the game is perfect for schools as a tool in education. The knowledge from the game will easily go over to the nature since the pictures on the cards are real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is it called Ilmatsalu bird adventure? Because Ilmatsalu in Tartumaa is one of the most densely bird populated are in main land Estonia and a favorite place for a bird tourists. Hopefully all local players later can take a real walk there as well and test their knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is played by moving around the forest (game board) and collecting information tokens for birds. Certain places ask questions and answering them, lets you keep the card. First one to collect certain number is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
