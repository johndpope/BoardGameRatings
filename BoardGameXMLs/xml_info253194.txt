							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supervillain: This Galaxy Is Mine! â€“ Lootable Planets expansion</name>
									
			<description>Not all Villains are as smart as I am. Frankly speaking, all these other Villains are much inferior to me, the great and one of a kind! But this is in our Galaxy. Recently another Galaxy has approached ours; it looks like the local Villains were pumpkin-headed enough to waste each other. Only Minions remain. The poor things wither without supervision on their desolate planets...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scouts (those who managed to survive) report though that space self-defense forces are still active on some planets, while miniatures shaggy alien beasts were spotted on other planets, while somewhere else... these issues have to be dealt with. I have to send an Asteroid there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or two Asteroids. Or, even better, three. Somebody has to scavenge the scarce values left on these mysterious planets. Otherwise other Villains are going to loot everything...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Postscriptum. A special note for Asteroid firing pointers: &amp;ldquo;Shoot gently! The Asteroid must neatly penetrate the force field around the planet leaving all the valuables intact for further scavenging. Understood?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, Lootable Planets expansion provides an alternative. You may launch an Asteroid either into another Villain or into Lootable Planets. Then, in the beginning of your next turn, the Asteroid hits the target and... you find out what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards of the Lootable Planets expansion are very useful. Hitting such a card is like hitting the jackpot! For example, May the Loss Be with You! card allows you to seize a random card from other Villain&amp;rsquo;s hand immediately, Backdoor Asteroid &amp;mdash; to deliver a sudden blow to other Villain&amp;rsquo;s planet, while Star Shower &amp;mdash; to launch two Asteroids at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other cards of the Lootable Planets expansion are not that efficient. Sometimes the Minions point the Asteroid not very precisely and it smashes a half of the planet. The remaining half brings smaller loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, there are two nasty cards &amp;mdash; Ambush of Alien Hamsters and Assault on Black Hole. The Minions have launched the Asteroid... in a wrong direction. Assault on Black Hole simply &amp;lsquo;eats&amp;rsquo; your Asteroid, which is logical &amp;mdash; what else would you expect from a Black Hole?! But the Hamsters are worst of all. These tiny evil beasts retarget your Asteroid into you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
