							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Galaxy Corporate</name>
									
			<description>The Galaxy Corporate is a world of trading and piracy for two to four players.  Players amass influence by buying planets and trade outposts (or taking them by force) in their quest to become the largest corporation in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique economy system combines with a modular board to provide a different galaxy with every game.  The laws of supply and demand force players to turn simple buying and selling into strategic economic weapons.  Real weapons are also available in the form of ship upgrades and mercenary vessels to turn rivalries hostile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be a peaceful trading baron or bloodthirsty pirate?  The choice is yours in the Galaxy Corporate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
