							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Damsels in Distress</name>
									
			<description>This is my third game inspired by the Venn diagram. In this game, players choose a fruit cart in the marketplace, and gather the fruit located there. Each carts' contents overlap so taking fruit from the cart affects fruit taken later from the same cart. Using only cards, the Venn idea was definitely abstracted a bit.&lt;br/&gt; In Damsels in Distress, the players are wicked queens/witches that have determined through their talking mirrors, that damsels in the area are more fairer than they. Taking the fruit they poison the apples, feed the monkeys, draw cards, and hinder the prince charming on his way to save the damsel. The apples if given to the damsel before the prince arrives, will put the damsel into a deep sleep (coma). The player who does this will gain the prestige for doing so, of her wicked guild of witches and warlocks. The charming Prince of each Kingdom is headed towards his Kingdom's damsels, and each round saves one, unless hindered (slipping on a banana peel, perhaps? Or better yet, attacked by a band of flying monkeys?). In this community of Witches, there is more prestige for a collection of damsels from different Kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
