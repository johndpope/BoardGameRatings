			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retention is about a man who ran through out his life, not willing to look back at his past. He rarely slept, and during a trip got into trouble. He then finds himself lying on the ground, buried beneath his bicycle. Moments fly by and he cannot move. You must help him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
