							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Native American Rummy</name>
									
			<description>The learner will be able to categorize various aspects of Native American tribal life by matching such things as people and artifacts into collections which represent four major Indian culture groups: Plains Indians, Northwest Indians, Eastern Woodland Indians, and Southwest Indians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a structure that is similar to rummy.Players gain points by matching up sets of cards that belong to a particular suit. Each player is dealt 7 cards and the rest of the cards are placed face down (pick up pile) with the top card turned up (discard pile). The person left of the dealer takes a turn first by picking up a card from the pick up pile or the discard pile and laying down any &amp;quot;matches&amp;quot; that are allowed. The player must then discard and play goes to the next person. Play continues until one of the players has laid down all of his cards and then discarded. The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;56 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
