			<description>In-Game Text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every puzzle in this game has more than one solution. What's more, there is no right, wrong, or even preferred solution. If it works then it works, no guilt, no illogical repercussions. There are, of course, consequences to your actions but they are only logical ones (e.g. if you burn a table to ashes you can no longer eat your dinner off it, or what have you). Save your game every now and then, in case you decide you would have liked to try that last puzzle a different way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
