			<description>Author's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is night on this side of the planet. Settled areas are lit: a jagged crescent in the tropics, lining the inland sea. The bright splatter along the top of the curve is Tanhua, as bright from space as New York. The north continent is darker, sprinkled finely with small lights, where the failing climate makes it hard to survive a winter. And the northernmost point, almost lost on the slope of Mt. Cordia, is the original Aleheart Colony&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Floatpoint is a science fiction story in which the player must decide the best diplomatic outcome for Earth and its lost colony. It took first place in the 2006 IF Competition and received XYZZY awards for Best Setting and Best NPCs of 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
