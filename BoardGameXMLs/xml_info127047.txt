							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alternativa</name>
									
			<description>Alternativa is a classic point&amp;amp;click adventure game based on the original sci-fi/cyber-punk script which is composed of a number of shorter stories that lead us through the lives of individual characters as well as the fictional world of the future. Non-linear storyline full of unexpected turns, at times spine-chilling atmosphere, logical tasks, historical and scientific facts &amp;ndash; Alternativa is all of that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Alternativa is a very complex and elaborate world, the story concludes in a logical and gripping manner. All the questions are answered. At the same time, new thoughts and goals surface. And it's these goals that the heroes of Alternativa try to achieve in the sequel which develops directly from the first part without forcing the player to know all the previously revealed facts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
