			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A.I. Generated Tier 2 Adventure&lt;br/&gt;3-5 Characters, Level Range: 5-7 &lt;br/&gt;Adventure CR Rating: 6&lt;br/&gt;Designed for a party of 4 characters at level 6 with an average magic bonus of +1 &lt;br/&gt;Difficulty Setting: Normal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything is optional. There is no storyline. There are no maps or rules. It&amp;rsquo;s always best if you can allow your story to evolve as a response to your player&amp;rsquo;s actions, as if you planned it that way. Give the party all the agency they want without worrying about anything. It&amp;rsquo;s like a railroad that plays like a sandbox, but don&amp;rsquo;t tell your players that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is for you to make-up a story as you go, on the fly. Use the following encounters to support your group&amp;rsquo;s imagination. Encounters are best if experienced in order - no matter what the players do. But the DM should give the players the feeling of an open world with the illusion of unlimited choice. The math behind the sequence of encounters has been carefully computed to give the most balanced experience possible from a purely mathematical point of view, and the story is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
