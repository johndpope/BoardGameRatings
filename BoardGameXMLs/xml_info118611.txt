							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Haven: Call of the King</name>
									
			<description>Haven: Call of the King is a single player PlayStation 2 game that is a combination of action, puzzle, and shoot-'em-up styles. Releases were planned for the Xbox and GameCube by Xicat Interactive, Inc., but they were cancelled. The game was created by Traveller's Tales and published by Midway Games. It is rated T for Teen due to Mild Violence by the ESRB, but only 3+ by PEGI. It was a commercial flop despite the hype and large budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character  Haven finds out that there's a volcano at the other side of planet Ferra, but must be careful as the guards are after him. Once he reaches there he must go deep down to find an old Aurian map, after you kill a dragon.  Then Haven gets arrested by a guard and ends up in a cell in space, now Haven must escape which he blows up the sylex cells (mission) to escape but ends up in Exarco. He then agrees to help the creatures and find another ship to get to the Mount of Sighs.&lt;br/&gt;He kills the zeno queen and escapes, he arrives in Auria and finds the bell and rings it but has a problem, Chess is in trouble and she needs his help, he returns to save her and they go in search to find catlana, the virus antidote. Chess goes and finds a new ship but it is a ship with Vetch and his guards, they get put in cells but only Haven can escape as the guard did not lock his cell. As he can't open Chess', he finds a ship and chases Vetch, when he finds him he sees the King is being poisoned. Now you must press the correct buttons to defeat Vetch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the end of this game, Haven is chained to a rock, the King is killed, Vetch escapes, and it's revealed that Chess is a traitor. If the player has collected all of the runestones, completed all the runes challenges and has all 8 (2 on Auria, 2 on Ferra, 2 on Ferven, one on Exarco, and 1 on Nequam) black diamonds, an alternate ending can be viewed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was supposed to be a part of a trilogy, but due to incredibly poor sales, the story never continued or was ever finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the missions require you to collect Cogs to operate machinery which will take you to another level or another part of the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Haven: Call of the King&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
