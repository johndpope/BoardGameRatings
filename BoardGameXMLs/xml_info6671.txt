			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Verbatim gives new meaning to word games. It's a classic spelling game with a big difference. The difference is you only have one each of the 26 letters of the alphabet to work with. Each player takes a turn and tries to complete a word of five letters or more by adding a new letter to the letters already on the board.  Complete the word and score. Now you are eligible for the Bonus Round: Spell as many new words as you can in 60 seconds using only the letters of the accepted word and increase your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One classically designed game board&lt;br/&gt;26 letter cubes&lt;br/&gt;One letter rack&lt;br/&gt;One-minute timer&lt;br/&gt;Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
