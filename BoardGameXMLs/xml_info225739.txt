			<description>Next week civilization as we know is obliterated in a catelysmic series of events the survivors simply refer to as &amp;quot;The Meltdown&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You lead one of four factions of these survivors to battle for supremacy in the rising tides above your former home, Los Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with three decks: the Vehicle, Fighter, and Action decks. You can use your faction specific player mat to organize your cards during game play. The faction specific counter is used to mark your score on the battle mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unplayed vehicle cards can be organized above the player mat in the &amp;quot;docks&amp;quot; area either face up or face down (I play face down so my opponent has to remember which vehicles I've played). The unplayed action cards are shuffled and placed face down on the left side of the mat; you will randomly draw from this deck as you play. The fighter deck will usually be in your hand but you can set it in the middle of the mat to keep things organized. Lastly, each player will have 4 action cards in his/her hand, store these on the right side of the mat. The bottom portion of the mat will fill up with won or discarded cards as you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who initiates combat will choose 1 fighter card and 1 vehicle card from his player mat and place them in play near the battle mat.  Add the power scores from each card and place your faction's counter on the corresponding number on the battle mat. The next player will do the same, placing one fighter card and one vehicle card in play and adding his faction's counter to the mat. After all fighter and vehicle cards are played, in order, each player will place an action card face down. Once all action cards are committed to play they are flipped over to reveal their modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
