			<description>from the publishers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DO IT YOURSELF PROPERTY TRADING GAME!&lt;br/&gt;Is your idea of high fashion a well-equipped tool belt?&lt;br/&gt;Is your ideal vacation one in which you remodel the kitchen?&lt;br/&gt;Do you spend your night out at the local hardware store?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you answered yes to any or all of the above, D.I.Y.OPOLY is the game for you. Even you need a little R &amp;amp; R every now and then! Gather family and friends and welcome them into your world of power tools, elbow grease, and sawdust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In D.I.Y.- OPOLY players buy, sell and trade favorite properties, then increase the property value by adding Tool Buckets and Hardware Stores. It sounds easy enough, but add a trip to the emergency room, a project you can&amp;rsquo;t handle, and an exploding toilet, and it gets a little more difficult, and a lot more fun! So choose your token and advance to &amp;ldquo;Get to Work!&amp;rdquo; Who knows? You may soon be elected Handyman of the Year&amp;hellip;or you may get in over your head and have to hire a contractor. Whatever happens, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be almost as fun as building a deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
