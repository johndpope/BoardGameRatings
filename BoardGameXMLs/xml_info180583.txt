							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old House</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 40 x 20 inch Battlemap of an Old House, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The locals claim to see strange things like lights on in the abandoned old house at night .I think it&amp;rsquo;s another ghost myth to bust.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Paranormal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old House is a two floor interior map of an old, abandoned mansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old House is intended for use in horror, modern, and pulp games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cursed Mansion:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty years ago, an entire family was found dead with their toddler missing. Everyone who investigated the murders from the detectives and cops to the coroner ended up missing or dead.  A demolition crew came to destroy the house and the entire crew ended up missing or dead as well. The people in town consider the spot cursed and refuse to go near it, going so far as to beg people from out of town to not approach the house as it may cost them their lives and perhaps their soul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One night, a group of investigators who debunk supernatural myths roll into town and will not be dissuaded from exploring the old house at night. These can be the player characters. They find the front door unlocked when they arrive. Every window is closed with curtains drawn. The wooden floorboards and furniture are partially rotten. Beds and other furniture are stained. Stone stairs are cracked. The bathrooms are the worst. They are the scenes of the initial murder of the family and the tile, sinks, toilets and baths are stained with dried blood. All the mirrors in the house have been smashed. All the painting in the house have been slashed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As they climb to the second floor, the group sees lantern light from a room in the southwest. A pristine crib has a toddler inside bundled in blankets. As they approach the toddler, the child awakes, throwing off his blankets that appear soiled by blood. The child opens his small mouth, hissing and showing two large vampire fangs surrounded by baby teeth. Suddenly the group hears the front door swing open and the loud thump of stone hitting the floor. Within moments, they are ambushed from behind by full grown vampires sired by the toddler, all of the victims of its previous murders. Will killing the toddler stop the others? Or should the group deal with the full grown vampires first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
