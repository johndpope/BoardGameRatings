							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rocket Jockey</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sports game that defies an exact classification.  It combines soccer, racing, demolition derby, rocketry, and surf music into a unique action game.  Your pilot straddles a rocket (or &amp;quot;sled&amp;quot;) which propels you in a straight line (&amp;quot;an object in motion stays in motion...&amp;quot;).  You then fire grappling hooks to attempt to latch onto objects in order to steer your rocket like the Batmobile in the Batman movie of '89.  Said grappling hooks can also be used to latch onto a giant soccer ball, which can be thrown into various nets/goals to score points or better yet, thrown at your opponents to dismount them from their rockets.  You can even yank enemy &amp;quot;jockeys&amp;quot; off their mechanical steeds with a well aimed grapple, and then drag them around the arena. The game uses a physics engine that makes every action have a reaction.  You'll find yourself making hard left turns with a grappling hook, while a second hook is spinning the soccer ball around like a cat-o-nine tails.  All the while the surf sounds of Dick Dale are blasting in the background.  The game captures a retro vibe of a 1920s that never existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 3 modes:&lt;br/&gt;Rocket Ball- soccer astride an out of control rocket&lt;br/&gt;Rocket Race- may the fastest man win&lt;br/&gt;Rocket War- deathmatch: smash, crash, and grapple your opponents for the win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's multiple rockets and pilots to choose from, different arenas, and upgrades to earn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what are you waiting for?  Strap on a rocket, turn on the Dick Dale and blast off!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
