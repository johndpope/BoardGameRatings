							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stellar Annihilation</name>
									
			<description>The enemy fleet is approaching.  Your only chance of survival is to destroy them before they destroy you.  You must carefully fold space before deploying your nuclear torpedoes.  One hit and your enemy's ship will be history.  Of course, one hit and you will be history as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stellar Annihilation is a simple game in which each player draws (in pencil) a fleet of ships on opposite ends of a sheet of paper.  The paper is then folded and the first player shoots by drawing a dot on the back of the sheet with a marker.  The paper is then unfolded and the players check to see if a ship was hit.  Any ship hit is destroyed.  Players take turns shooting until one fleet is annihilated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the solitaire game you draw an enemy fleet and attempt to destroy it in a set number of turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
