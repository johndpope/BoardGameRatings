			<description>A game of planetary collection!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to obtain the most planets/points in his or her collection by the time the deck runs out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When planets are drawn they are immediately placed on the table. Using your probe cards on the planets themselves, you must either complete a sequence of three &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; probes over any number of turns or drop three dissimilar probes in a single turn to obtain that planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use galactic catastrophes against your opponent such as meteor showers, solar flares or radiation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the deck has run out, each player tallies up there points. 1 point for each planet + 1 additional point for each planet in similar systems (example: if you have two planets in the same system and another set of three in the same system, that's 5 additional points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick and easy to play. Get the family in on it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
