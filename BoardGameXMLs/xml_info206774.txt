			<description>Game description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spider&amp;rsquo;s Cradle is a 2 to 4 player cooperative board game where you play as spiders trying to capture insects in a spider&amp;rsquo;s web. Players work together to build a web out of rubber bands laid across wooden dowels. Recommended age is 4 and up due to the game&amp;rsquo;s minimal dexterity requirements and small components. Set-up and break down takes about 2 minutes each, while learning to play takes about 5 minutes. For your first time playing, from set-up to putting things back in the box takes about 45 minutes. A normal game will last about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spider&amp;rsquo;s Cradle is very quick to learn and play, especially for young children but offers dynamic spatial challenges for adults. Because the game is cooperative, parents can work directly to physically help children play and beat the game together. Spider&amp;rsquo;s Cradle allows everyone to feel accomplished as each player will contribute to winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
