			<description>Fast play air-to-air combat miniatures game for WWI planes similar to the game Instant Thunder and Instant Bandits. The game uses a rectangular grid with playing card suits marking 4 rows and cards K to A marking 14 columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planes have individual flight characteristics for vertical and lateral movement, as well as armament and structural points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a card is drawn for each plane to place it onto the grid on the appropriate space. Planes may be able to move to a different space by drawing a new card that must be lower than its movement rating. Thereafter shooting is performed in a similar fashion. At the end of each turn, the planes are removed from the grid, so may reappear on an entirely new angle of attack the following turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules provide many optional rules and very complete aircraft statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
