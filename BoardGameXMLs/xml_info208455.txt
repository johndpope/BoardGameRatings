			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was never any question as to which occupation Hans Von Karlstein would take up. The youngest son of five of Heinrich Von Karlstein, famed witch hunter, whose family, the Von Karlstein&amp;rsquo;s, had served the Empire as witch hunters for five generations. At the age of fifteen Hans began his apprenticeship to the Order Templar as a bounty hunter, then he served with his older brother Karl hunting vampires in Sylvania before finally earning his spurs. Hans&amp;rsquo; reputation began to grow within the ranks of his order as a true servant of the law as he rooted out more and more mutants, cultists and heretics, his complete devotion to duty unquestioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
