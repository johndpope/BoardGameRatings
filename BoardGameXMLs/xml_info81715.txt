							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Paganini Universal Storytelling Game System</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a complete, cohesive, universal storytelling game system. It contains a fully developed set of light, fast playing rules for role-playing. This game is not a rules-heavy, number crunching RPG. You will not need a calculator for this game. You will, however, need an imagination. No matter well done a game is, it can never provide you with something like that. This system does not include an original fiction world, setting, or campaign. It has no information on how to role-play, act a part, or devise a story. There are many good sources for this type of information on the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another important thing about this game is that it's a storytelling game. This means that it focuses more on the plot and the characters than on math and mechanics.  The whole idea can be summed up the following maxim:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We only need rules for situations with an outcome that is not obvious.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
