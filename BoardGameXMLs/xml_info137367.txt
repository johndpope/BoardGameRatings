							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Happy Hippo: Die Talentshow vor Weihnachten</name>
									
			<description>Simple Goose-type race game but with cards added to add a little more variety. The game must have been given away in a Kinder Egg box. Kinder Egg usually feature toys inside but this is a rarity perhaps. The game is housed in a plain yellow plastic egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is to help the Happy Hippo to pass the talent show before Christmas.&lt;br/&gt;The 20 cards are shuffled and laid face down. Each player rolls the die once. The player with the highest score starts. The players moves are dictated by the die (which has to be assembled before play can start).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands on a square with instructions, he/she must obey them. If he/she encounters a square with musical note next to it, he/she draws a card and tries fulfil the task indicated. If the task is accomplished, the player stays on the square. If not, the player goes back to his previous square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the stage (square 50), wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 paper cube with scores 1-6&lt;br/&gt;4 Happy Hippo playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;Game board.&lt;br/&gt;20 Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
