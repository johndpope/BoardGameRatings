			<description>Raptor Run 3D Game by Buffalo Games is a 3-dimensional game that builds right out of the box and then folds down neatly for storage when the game is over. Players race their raptors to the top of Dino Mountain rescuing baby dinosaur eggs along the way. But they have to be careful not to get knocked off by rolling boulders or they will be sent back down the mountain. The first player to collect an egg and carry it to the nest at the top of the mountain wins! Recommended for 2 to 4 players, ages 4+. Contents include 4 raptors, 10 raptor eggs, 1 boulder die, 5 raptor nests and a 10-inch tall 3-dimensional game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
