			<description>In There Oughta Be A Law, each player is a Senator in a committee, trying to make the most money by voting for bills various special interest groups support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of cards: bills and events. Bills can be played as amendments to an existing bill. Events modify interest groups positions on bills or alter a players options for play. Each bill lists the interest groups' positions on bills. Players can add hidden amendments to prevent other players from gaining interest group support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most money received from interest groups at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by Sacred Cow Games, 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
