			<description>In Curious George Adventures Pop-Up Candy Game, players compete to be the first to reach the Man in the Yellow Hat while collecting as much candy as possible along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with packages of Rascals candy, which are placed in the candy circle on the board. Players choose a game piece and place it on the start square. They take turns rolling a die marked with various fruits, then move their piece to the next matching fruit on the track. Along the way, players may land on spaces that cause them to move forward or backward or lose or gain candy. Some spaces have pop-open doors which have hidden instructions inside. The first player to reach the end of the track wins and gets to eat all his earned candy. Other players must return their candy to the candy circle and go hungry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
