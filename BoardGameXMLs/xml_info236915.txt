							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Lua, Buto Pirate</name>
									
			<description>It seems that the temptation of riches and sake are not the only things that can lead the Buto to leave their tribe. Lua a fine specimen of the Buto people has long since left the island of his birth, driven to satisfy a deep and lasting wanderlust the Jung are his new people. Much like many of those who crew the Jung ships he adds somethings few others can offer. His great axe felling foes or masts alike. He still has a few tricks up his sleeve learnt from his youth in the crowded streets of Jima to surprise though.  &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
