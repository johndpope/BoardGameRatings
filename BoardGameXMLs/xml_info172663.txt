							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fidelitas: Promo Cards</name>
									
			<description>In Fidelitas, players take on the role of faithful citizens in a medieval city exerting influence in order to gain the credibility needed to lead the charge against the corrupt crown. Players play character cards to various locations that make up the city in order to meet conditions of hidden objectives. Each type of character card is associated with a unique action that manipulates cards in the game; use the Butcher to bully other characters to new locations, use the Student to gain more cards, use the Soldier to keep the peasants from loitering too long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These nine promo cards include the Candlestick Maker Promo Cards - a new Virtus Card and a new Missio Card; the Barkeep and the Tavern, two new Missio cards; and the Party Pack Promos that include 5 cards - The Bloody Butcher, The Chiselerwith two new versions of The Chiseler and The Herald with art by Jaqcui Davis, as well as The Bloody Butcher, The Chiseler, and The Heralds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
