							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lucia Krille</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a saying about those who steal for a living. You hear stories about skilled thieves, and legends about master thieves, but common thieves? Common thieves aren&amp;rsquo;t worth so much as a whisper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucia Krille was such a thief. A pretty face, but one easily lost in a crowd when she wanted to be, Krille used a combination of charm and camouflage to execute her craft. With thick, brown hair, bronze skin, and just the right scarves and dresses, she could look like she belonged anywhere... for a while, at any rate. She stayed away from the wealthy, working taverns and market stalls, counting on steady hands and a sense of timing more than on any inherent daring or quick wits. She was practiced, methodical, and treated the art of stealing more like a craft. She got caught a time or two, but always found her way back to another street in another town. In fact, her life would have been quite unremarkable if not for a single crime of opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    All the information to use Lucia Krille as NPC villain including her history and relations.&lt;br/&gt;    Statistics, abilities and rules for Lucia Krille (CR 4, 8, 12 &amp;amp; 16)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
