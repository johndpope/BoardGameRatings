			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boy's limbs are held to the tree with wolf sinew. The tree of the gods, the only tree in our land to yield fruit, will receive another sacrifice. Just as it is every time the Erimha arrive to take our young, our tribe will eat the boy to absorb his courage. Chief Enuruk will feast upon the boy's heart, the source of life. His wives will drink the blood, to reincarnate the boy in their wombs. The warriors will eat the flesh and muscles, to remain strong. The rest of the boy will be burned, his ashes will rise to join our ancestors in the smoke cloud above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ritual begins. We chant to the gods, the women ululate with trilling tongues, the beating of drums becomes more furious. Enuruk pushes a whale-bone dagger through the boy's throat. Young Seher's life is drained into clay vessels for the Chieftain's wives. The lamentations of Seher's mother are nearly drowned out by our chants. Seher is consumed by the warriors of the tribe, including his older sister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
