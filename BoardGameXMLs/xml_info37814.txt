							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thirty Years Warfare</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card Game for 2-4+ players. The Thirty Years War took place in Germany from 1618-1648. The main adversaries were the Catholics and the Protestants. Each player takes the role of a Military Contractor of the age. The goal is to use your skill as a general and an entrepreneur to amass wealth and fame.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player creates a Leader character with three random traits (skills). Each Leader has a Reputation score, which starts at 0 and is increased or decreased based on the Leader's performance in campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Leader gains gold each turn based on the value of his employment contract. An additional random amount of gold is gained each turn for &amp;quot;savings, investments, contributions, estate incomes, financial backers, looting, etc.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: When the deck runs out, the player with the most Gold wins. If two players are tied, the player with the highest Reputation score wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
