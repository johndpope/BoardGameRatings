			<description>A Fantasy Island-Building Game for 2 - 4 Tribal Leaders by Andreas Propst &amp;amp; Tobias Strunz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the middle of a medieval fantasy archipelago, rival tribes are building their settlements on neighbouring islands. You are the clan-chief of one of these tribes and responsible for your village. Build and expand your settlement, care for your followers and nurture your clan. Finally you will be able to build a massive army or achieve cultural superiority. Whatever path to victory you choose - the fantasy islands await you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first player to collect 20 Victory Points. Each player starts with a tiny Starting Island made out of 7 hex tiles. Players will expand their islands in order to mine stone, ore and gather wood needed to build the more advanced buildings. Players will grow food and wine to keep their soldiers and wizards loyal and collect mana to cast powerful Spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fantasy Islands, many roads lead to victory: Pure Military force, Naval supremacy, securing the Trade monopoly, keeping your population happy, Cultural dominance or Spellcasting power. Excelling at one or more of these aspects will net you the VP needed to win and furthermore, players will be able to engage in Conflicts (Military, Trade, Sorcery, Cultural and Naval) which, in case they emerge victorious, will get them certain benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a cooperative effort by Andreas Propst (Austria) and Tobias Strunz (Germany).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
