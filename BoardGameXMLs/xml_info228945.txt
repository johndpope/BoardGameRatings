							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trump!</name>
									
			<description>Trump! is a new take on traditional playing cards--adding special symbols to many cards, which alters game play of favorite card games like Cribbage, Go Fish, War, Hearts, and dozens of others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a Trump administration official or staff member and includes additional information about the individual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Officials can be crossed out if fired, resign, or are impeached, changing their value or giving them special abilities in many card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is one part update on classic card games, one part education, and one part resistance, Trump! should provide hours of fun and politicized entertainment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
