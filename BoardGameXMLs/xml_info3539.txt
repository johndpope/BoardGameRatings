							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Largo Winch</name>
									
			<description>(Based on Tilsit's page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.tilsit.fr/fiches_jeux/largo.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.tilsit.fr/fiches_jeux/largo.php&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the assassination of his father, the 26-year old Largo Winch finds himself at the head of a ten billion dollar empire, the W Group.  The Adriatic Commission, a secret organization with apparently unlimited power, does not like this and decides to replace him with a more &amp;quot;accommodating&amp;quot; figure head.  All blows are allowed: physical elimination, dismantlement of the W Group, hostile take-over, criminal frame-up, kidnapping of his loved ones, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Largo must fight on all fronts, investigate and foil all attempts on him.  He can only count on Simon, his childhood friend, Joy, his seductive bodyguard, Sullivan, his director-general, and Kerensky, an ex-KGB high-tech specialist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This board game of high adventure will keep all fans of the TV series (itself based on the graphic novels created by Jean Van Hamme and drawn by Philippe Francq) on the edge of their seats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
