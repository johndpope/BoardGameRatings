			<description>&amp;quot;Art of Fighting​ (龍虎の拳 Ryūko no Ken, lit. &amp;quot;Fist of Dragon and Tiger&amp;quot;) is a trilogy of competitive fighting game titles that were released for the Neo Geo platform in the early 1990s. It was the second fighting game franchise created by SNK, following the Fatal Fury series and is set in the same fictional universe. The original Art of Fighting was released in 1992, followed by two sequels: Art of Fighting 2​ (龍虎の拳2 Ryūko no Ken 2) in 1994 and Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior​ (ART OF FIGHTING 龍虎の拳 外伝 Art of Fighting: Ryūko no Ken Gaiden) in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first game, Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia set out to find Ryo's sister, Yuri, who has been kidnapped by Mr. Big. Mr. Big has taken the girl to entice Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo's father and originator of the fictional form of karate known as Kyokugen Karate (&amp;quot;Extreme style&amp;quot;), and because Ryo refused to work for Big. After they defeat Mr. Big, Ryo and Robert face the enigmatic Mr. Karate. Art of Fighting's story ends with a cliff-hanger; Yuri is about to disclose the true identity of Mr. Karate as their father Takuma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only Ryo and Robert are playable in the 1-player story mode although eight of the characters are playable in the 2-player vs. modes. Mr. Big and Mr. Karate can be played in the arcade version by reaching the final stage of the game then having a second player join in, and on the console versions via the use of cheat codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art of Fighting's events are referenced often in the wider SNK universe; The King of Fighters '97, for instance, parodies the events of the game in its ending.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Art of Fighting , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
