			<description>Players have hands of 4 cards with letters on them. On a turn a player plays 1 or more cards to the table, or discards a card, then fills his hand back to 4. When a player can make a word of 3 or more letters from the letters played he announces it and scores, 2 points per letter for 3-5 letter words, 4 points for 6 or longer.  Then another round starts; the first player to 200 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word must start with the first letter played to the round, and must use all the letters played, but all letters after the first can be rearranged to make the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
