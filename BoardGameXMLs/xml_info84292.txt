			<description>From the command 'about' while playing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         IDENTITY **&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Interactive Science Fiction Short Story&lt;br/&gt;Copyright 2004 by Dave Bernazzani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Release 7 / Serial number 041121 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt;about&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to **IDENTITY** - An Interactive Science Fiction Short Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my first published IF work and was created specifically for the 2004 IF Competition. The job of creating an interactive story was a bit more work than I originally imagined. This game took approximately 80 hours of actual code writing with countless more hours reading the IF guides, playing competition entries from the past few years and generally reading up on what has taken place in the IF community in recent years. I grew up with the Infocom games and was pleased to see that the community is alive and well. I'd like to thank the IF community for their help and contributions. I would especially like to thank my beta testers: Chris Cenotti, Jessica Knoch, Vivienne Dunstan and Al. My game grew almost half again in size (not so much in terms of rooms but in terms of interactive objects and extended verbs) thanks to their comments and suggestions. Their efforts in testing are greatly appreciated (though all errors that remain are my own).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are stuck, type HINTS to get clues ranging from a gentle nudge to a nearly complete walkthrough. If you want to contact the author regarding this game, feel free to do so at daveber@gis.net. I hope that you enjoyed this adventure and would encourage new authors to enter into the competition for next year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post Competition: Well... the IF-Comp has come and gone. Identity placed 15th out of 36 entries. Not bad, but I had hoped to do better. I fixed the known technical issues that were uncovered during the competition - fortunately there were not many. I ended up with a lot of good constructive feedback and will continue to work towards better IF. Thanks to everyone that participated in the review process!
