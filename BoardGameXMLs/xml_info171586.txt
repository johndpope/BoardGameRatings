			<description>Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front is a 2010 World War II-era first-person shooter video game for iOS and Android, developed and published by Gameloft. It was released on the App Store on February 22, 2010. It is part of the Brothers in Arms series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was re-released for iOS as a freemium app on November 22, 2011 and renamed Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front Free+. This version replaced the original version on the App Store. Global Front Free+ was released on the Android Market on December 6, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front shares similar gameplay to that of the Modern Combat series more so than its own predecessor, Brothers in Arms: Hour of Heroes. Whereas Hour of Heroes was a third-person shooter, Global Front is played entirely from a first-person perspective, except for when taking cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is controlled using virtual buttons on-screen; a virtual control stick is used for movement, while aiming is achieved by swiping on the touchscreen. The player can also crouch, throw grenades, use their weapon's iron sights, reload, change weapon, pick up different weapons, knife enemies, mantle obstacles, and shoot using buttons and prompts on the touchscreen. All controls can be customized from the main menu. The game originally featured an automatic cover system and a run function, but both were removed from the Free+ edition. Gyroscopic controls were also added to the Free+ edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer mode is playable through both a local Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection, and a global internet connection. During gameplay, players receive dog tags when they kill an opposing player. They can then use these dog tags to purchase reinforcements to help attack the opposing team and earn their own team points. Dog tags are also used to purchase weapons, ammo, and equipment, such as gear, grenades, and health kits, which can be carried to and from the single-player campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Brothers in Arms 2: Global Front&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
