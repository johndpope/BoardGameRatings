			<description>game introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Ascension to Olympus, the ancient Greek mythology game in which the  players try to achieve godliness the only way you know how: fame. In Ascension  to Olympus, players are afforded the unique opportunity to play Godlings, the  offspring of gods and mortals, with the ultimate goal of being admitted as a god to Mount Olympus. To become gods, the players must perform heroic deeds and slay menacing beasts,  but they get no credit for their acts unless they are witnessed by the Greek citizens they are  serving. The more people that witness an act of heroic might, the faster that player will  advance towards crossing the gates and enjoying the wine and ambrosia of Olympus. If no  one sees the player's acts, it's as though they never happened. So fight strong, fight brave, but  most importantly, fight where people can see you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT: Ascension to Olympus is not a standalone game and requires the first edition of Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds  RPG (hereinafter &amp;quot;M&amp;amp;M&amp;quot;) by Green Ronin Publishing for character creation and combat rules. Even though M&amp;amp;M is a  game of superheroes, it is also perfectly suited to tales of Godlings and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;These variant rules for M&amp;amp;M are available as a free download from Animalball Games website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
