			<description>Children's game nicerly put together in Three-dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is in three stages.&lt;br/&gt;Stage 1, you must learn how to look after your horse and collect things like a feeding trough and learn about things such as keeping your horse clean.&lt;br/&gt;Stage 2, you need to train your horse. Learn how to start with a trot and then proceed to a gallop. Also learn how to jump (very important skill in this game because if you can't jump, you have no way of winning).&lt;br/&gt;Stage 3, you participate in a race really, travelling around the outer track on the board and jumping all the obstacles in your way (a ditch or a gate, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All three stages are resolved by dice rolls and earning what you require if you land on the right space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first one home from the 'race'. That player gets a rosette to place on their horse, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
