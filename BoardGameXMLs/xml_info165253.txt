							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gremlin&#039;s Watch</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can afford it, Gremlin&amp;rsquo;s Watch is a good place to keep your enemies. For a fee they&amp;rsquo;ll lock up anyone there and Severen took advantage. Blond and gorgeous and rich, he got co-opted by the lycanthrope king and needed a safe place to build his base. So he paid the fee and got locked up. Protection is protection, he said, even when it&amp;rsquo;s called incarceration. Problem is, Severen&amp;rsquo;s made a deal that will force human evolution down the lycanthrope path, and, you&amp;rsquo;ll know when you see him that, attractive as he is, just about everybody is going to accept his embrace. So, now, today, maybe more than ever, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you. Saving the world from tyrany was maybe necessary, but at Gremlin&amp;rsquo;s Watch we&amp;rsquo;re back another bunch of steps in the cycle. Join the party. Fight the weres. Keep the world safe for humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
