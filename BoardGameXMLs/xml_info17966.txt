			<description>Play the role of Captain Robert Heriot Barclay, veteran of Trafalgar and commandant of His Majesty's naval forces on lake Erie. Your precious supply line is threatened by the American fleet. You must take your makeshift squadron of warships and drive the Americans from the lake. Defeat means the loss of British power in the Northwest frontier. As Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the time has come to challenge the Royal Navy for control of the western Great Lakes. A victory will ensure the recapture of Detroit and give American warships free rein on lakes Erie, Huron and Superior. Britain's hold on the Indian tribes and on the fur trade will be broken, and the threat to Ohio and the Michigan Territory will end. Victory or defeat will have great consequences for either side as you sail into battle on September 10, 1813.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miniature-like game of the Battle of Lake Erie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
