							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Classic Battletech: Jihad Conspiracies – Interstellar Players 2</name>
									
			<description>On October 25, 3068, the Word of Blake flooded the Inner Sphere HPG networks with &amp;quot;White Noise&amp;quot;, a stream of gibberish and propaganda that made communications virtually impossible. Amid the noise, stunning secrets were revealed: Anastasius Focht was once Frederick Steiner; ComStar Primus Sharilar Mori was a Kurita spy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet along with the secrets revealed and the spreading fires of the Jihad, the Blakists unveiled terrible new weapons and an army the size of which the intelligence agencies of the Inner Sphere had scarcely dreamed, spawning a darker, new wave of mysteries, and whispers of shadowy cabals. Hidden worlds, cults of assassins, ancient societies and even the mysteries of hyperspace - all emerged as possible sources for the Word of Blake's newfound power. Once more spanning all of human space from ancient Terra to the far-flung Clan homeworlds, the conspiracies behind the Jihad could be the key to unraveling the greatest war since the days of Amaris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jihad Conspiracies: Interstellar Players 2 describes several of the most powerful and influential people, organizations, and entities at work behind the scenes of the Word of Blake Jihad. Some of these conspiracies are firmly grounded in Classic BattleTech lore, but shown here in ways never before seen; others have only recently emerged from their own shadows. Gamemasters and players can decide which of these power brokers are real and which are paranoid fantasies spawned by the chaos and fear of the Blakist Holy War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
