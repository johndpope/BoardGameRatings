			<description>1920, Witsand City, several young women mysteriously disappeared without leaving any trace. The police suspect a serial killer. You're going to investigate and find out it's much more than that.

Depending on your choice, you will not experience exactly the same adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The abilities of each character are: strength, charisma, intelligence, skill, and search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to these abilities, you will gain additional skills during the game. These skills will be very different for each character. They will be very important to the success of your missions and you will keep them from one investigation to the next. Your characters will also have health and mental health points. You will have to watch them very carefully, because if they fall to zero, your character will either be dead or completely crazy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Conspiracy is a true narrative game, you will not only have to thwart a conspiracy, but also complete many secondary quests that will help you in your investigation.

Each object has a size score and this is limited according to the characters and their strengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You all play against the game together. You decide which character should do which action? Is it better to stay together or separate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To solve each investigation, you will visit different places in the city, in the country and even in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Ultimate Conspiracy is very simple, you are free to visit the places you want in the order of your choice and as many times as you feel necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll have to solve many puzzles to progress in your investigation. Keep in mind to observe the items as a whole and if the solution seems complicated, do not hesitate to come back to it later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In between time, money, investigations and puzzles, you&amp;rsquo;ll always be under pressure in Ultimate Conspiracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
