							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quill: Love Letters</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since early civilisation, love letters have been written to express our romantic feelings in a way that could only be articulated in the form of a missive. These messages are among the trickiest to write, usually with the aim of receiving a similar response from the sender's sweetheart. In love letter-writing, there is a fine line between winning a heart and having your own broken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love Letters is a collection of five new scenarios for Quill, all themed around the heart. You will be trying to win the hearts of aristocrats, professing love to a dear friend, persuading overseas lovers to cross the ocean for you, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
