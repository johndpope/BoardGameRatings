			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A worn shore. Its bluffs collapse into whorls of lurid sand on strands speckled by spray and encrusted with glittering spume and waterborne detritus. Fishers linger tending beacons, while sand prospectors dig and haul. Rain lashes. Waves break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted shore as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including dwellers, beliefs, tracks, sands and things emerging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The waters, if they are waters, could be detailed using Elaboration: Atmosphere &amp; Liquid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
