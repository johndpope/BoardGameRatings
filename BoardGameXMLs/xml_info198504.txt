							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Comes to Stoneholme (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible adventure for four to six 5th level PCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the PCs are asked to serve as bodyguards to one of the nobles of Stoneholme, it seems like a simple enough job, but his subsequent death will force them into a web of intrigue, mystery and danger. Under suspicion for the strange death they were hired to prevent, touched by accusations of devil worship which strike a little too close to home, and faced with their own failure as bodyguards, the PCs will have ample motivation to investigate the matter. As the PCs work to clear their names, they will uncover diabolically dark secrets and face grave peril in the tombs of Stoneholme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death comes to Stoneholme is a Pathfinder compatible adventure suitable for four to six PCs of 5th level, featuring urban investigation, and adventure in the tombs of the dwarven city of Stoneholme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fine dwarven-themed adventure includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Dwarves, diabolical ghouls, and darkfolk!&lt;br/&gt;    New insights into the Underworld city of Stoneholme!&lt;br/&gt;    New magical items and new monsters!&lt;br/&gt;    Two separate dungeon areas &amp;ndash; a darkfolk lair and a ghoulish warren of dwarven iron!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
