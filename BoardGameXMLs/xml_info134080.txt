							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Politocracy The Game</name>
									
			<description>Politocracy The Game is a presidential election campaign board game in which Conservative, Progressive and Centrist candidates compete in a race to occupy the White House. The game is a fun and educational political game for the family, friends, adversaries and Politocrats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die to move along the Campaign Trail, amassing popularity at each Constituent, depending upon Ideology, and whether the Candidate has sufficient funds to acquire the Constituents. At a Political Poll, Candidates can roll the die to access the 'Money Trail' &amp;ndash; to collect funds - Deficit Dollars - from Interest Groups needed to acquire the support of Constituents.  The cost and benefit of each Constituent and the collection of Constituents owned or controlled by a Candidate are based on their Ideology.  Decisions must be made by the Candidates as to which Ideology they should chose or be to win: Conservative or Progressive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope and Change can drastically affect a Candidate&amp;rsquo;s quest for the White House, either advancing or hindering. This is where things can get &amp;ldquo;dirty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards the end, an election is held where two final Candidates compete in each of the 10 U.S. Regions to secure the majority (270) Electoral Votes needed to claim the White House.  Winning a region may seem as simple as rolling the highest die.  However, elections (die rolls) can be influenced by money, advertising and more. Investing in both positive and negative ads is essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
