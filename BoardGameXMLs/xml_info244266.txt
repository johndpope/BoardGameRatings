							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pharisees: The Party Game</name>
									
			<description>Family-friendly, party card game for 5-48 players. &lt;br/&gt;It's The Pharisees vs. The Disciples. It's like Mafia... but with a lot more Bible verses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture this: you live in a distant land, many centuries ago. You&amp;rsquo;ve recently started following a controversial new prophet named Jesus...and the religious leaders of the day, the Pharisees, aren&amp;rsquo;t very happy about it. Each night, the Pharisees sneak into your community in search of a disciple to stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a mission. As a disciple, find and excommunicate the Pharisees. As a Pharisee, convince the disciples you're innocent while secretly trying to stone them each night, one by one. Dozens of special roles help both the disciples and Pharisees accomplish their missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
