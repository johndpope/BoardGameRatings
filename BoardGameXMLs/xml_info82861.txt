							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Brickbreak</name>
									
			<description>In Super BrickBreak, your goal is to hit the colored bricks with the ball to remove them.  Control the paddle by sliding your finger back and forth to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom.  If you get the laser powerup (Pew!), you can fire lasers by tapping with a second finger.  If you hit the ball hard with the paddle, you can get extra points if the ball destroys a brick while moving quickly.  If you have two balls going at once, you score double points for each destroyed brick.  The top 10 scores are tracked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes in Version 1.1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As requested by you:&lt;br/&gt;- ball speed is much faster by default, user configurable&lt;br/&gt;- round ball by default, square ball is still an option&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus:&lt;br/&gt;- enemies&lt;br/&gt;- save game&lt;br/&gt;- background music support&lt;br/&gt;- additional levels available for in-app purchase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
