			<description>Strike it Lucky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FROM THE BOX: Strike it Lucky is the authentic game of ITV's successful quiz show, hosted by Michael Barrymore. In the game, players accumulate money by moving around the board and correctly answering questions. When a player has won E4,000 all the players race across the TV screens trying to get to the other side without hitting too many Hot Spots. The player with the most money is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike it Rich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FROM THE BOX: Strike it Rich blends excitement with risk as you race your way across the board answering questions and avoiding the Hot Spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(NOTE: The game includes the original 'Hot Spot' sound module.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the hit ITV quiz show from the UK of the same name from 1986 to 1996 (and much later as Michael Barrymore's Strike it Rich from 1996 to 1999) hosted by Michael Barrymore, which in turn is based on the short-lived, 1986-87 American game show called Strike it Rich hosted by the late Joe Garagiola.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
