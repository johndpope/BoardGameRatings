							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Forlorn Archive</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Archive of Chellum was once a foremost research institution, but the structure was damaged by earthquake ages ago, and flooded by the nearby river. The vaults were sealed, and a new university built over its remains. However students in the new library have heard ghostly wails, and there are rumors of ghostly visions deep in the stacks. The regents have forced open the grating to the lost archive, and called upon any assistance to help them either excavate any worthwhile knowledge buried below... or decide to seal its horrors away forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
