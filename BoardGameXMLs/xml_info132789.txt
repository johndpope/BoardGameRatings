			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Scouts play - with cookware and tent&amp;quot; is a fast-paced card game that is like a warehouse simulator and takes the life scout for a ride. The aim of the game is to be the most experienced Scouts by collecting the most badges. To earn these badges you must e.g. &amp;quot;Climbing go&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;perform night hike&amp;quot; one or simply &amp;quot;drying&amp;quot;. That seems to be easy with the training and the right equipment such as the &amp;quot;replaced scarf&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ASI&amp;quot;. But beware! Your teammates can help you in your job, but also put obstacles in the way. So it's better to just in case a &amp;quot;fake health certificate 'in the hindquarters have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 118 new cards, the equipment is better and more difficult tasks.&lt;br/&gt;Along with &amp;quot;The Pathfinder Game - We wanted to go to Great ride&amp;quot; there is the possibility of up to 8 players to go on tour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Boy Scouts Game&amp;quot; is the only true journey companions for all the cubs to the warehouse manager -. And a must for all those who can not wait the next camp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
