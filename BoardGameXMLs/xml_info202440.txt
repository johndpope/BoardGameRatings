							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Heavenly Circle of Cartographers</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Divine Queen has created a Heavenly Circle of cartographers. The Queen in her wisdom has decided to open the doors [of the kingdom] to the wider world. She has plucked the most sharp-eyed, the most nimble-fingered, and the most adaptable members of the community and taught them the art of map-making. This Heavenly Circle will travel down from the Sunlit Mountain and discover what lies in the shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Cartographers of the Heavenly Circle, you will go forth and explore new lands. You will seek out other peoples and other civilizations. You will spread the word of the Sun Queen. And you will build a map of what you find for the glory of the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
