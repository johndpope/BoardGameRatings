							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flextiles</name>
									
			<description>from the package&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flextiles are the amazing 25mm scale sheets of colorful plastic scenery that will add a new dimension in your role-playing game! The durable electrostatic plastic is flexible, reusable, and can easily be drawn on with water-soluble inks. PLUS you can see through the translucent ink to the edges to your map underneath, AND these Flextiles won't fly off the table when someone sneezes! Flextiles lay very flat on your paper, vinyl, or acetate maps. THey don't move when you want them to stay put; but when you want to shift their position, Flextiles easily lift on and off any map surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flextiles are designed for use with the CHAMPIONS game map, but can be used with any role-playing game. Look for more sets in the Flextiles series!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;these are clear plastic non-stickers that have terrain on them - trash cans, cars, street lamps that you are supposed to place on a battlemat for superhero games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;they are packaged in a zip-lock bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;admin comment&lt;br/&gt;there appears to be six different sets&lt;br/&gt;they are described below in the More Information section&lt;br/&gt;we will only list one Item with one Version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
