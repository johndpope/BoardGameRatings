			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crossing the depths of Infinity in search of contests worthy of me, I contemplate future games, appropriate pawns, and all outcomes of limitless contingencies. I am an Elder of the Universe, I am immortal. I am the Grandmaster, the universal master of games of chance. I have defeated the likes of beings mere humans have not the intellect to comprehend. The denizens of the third planet from Sol provide excellent pieces for my cosmic matches. Upon my drifting abode, my thoughts often turn to the human known on his world as Peter Parker, and of the beings that congregate around his costumed identity of Spider-Man. Many are the matches that this Spider-Man, his friends, and his foes could provide me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In preparation for such future contests, I've compiled the following information about the allies and enemies of Spider-Man. A host of interesting and varied individuals surround the arachnid adventurer, many who would make wonderful pawns, and even a rook or two, in upcoming campaigns. A sample week in the life of one of your Earthly cities has been included in this log, for you to test your own heroic meddle against some of Spider-Man's greatest foes. Play to the best of your abilities, and learn the lessons that will aid you in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Study the entries in this log with patience and care, for human minds cannot guess when or where I, the Grandmaster of the Universe, shall require the services of your like again. Knowledge of your enemy's powers and tactics greatly alters the odds of survival to your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conversely, you may be called to defend your world against me and my chosen pawns. Woe to you if you are among this globe's defenders when a match beckons. Who among you are prepared for the greatest test of your existences, who among are ready to take up the gauntlet of the Grandmaster, the&lt;br/&gt;greatest gamesman in the universe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
