			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Davae Breon Jaxon's Cinematic Environs series of suppliments is designed to help DMs paint vivid cinematic scenes for their players in a way that gives the environment its own unique character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These environs can take a mundane encounter or location and turn it into an epic scene that the players will be talking about for year to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This seventh in the series deals with Blasted Environs. It discusses the effects of quaking earth, choaking ash, acid pools, rivers of lava, scorching heat, and generally the worst conditions one might encounter on the Prime Material Plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, instead of simply sending the party to the necromancer's tower, the DM can have the tower in the middle of a smouldering plain of poisonous fumes, caustic geysers, and blistering heat. Instead of a few weeks of downtime in a beautiful walled city overlooking the sea, the characters are forced to flee as a volcanic eruption darkens the sky and sends a dealy pyroclastic cataclysm to bury the city forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also incuded is a new character background, new equipment, weapons, materials, spell, creatures, and details on how to apply the Blasted Lands conditions and hazards to any location in your world, if you want to shake things up... literally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
