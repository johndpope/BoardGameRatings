			<description>Paquet voleur is a board game adapted from the television version. Strategy game, knowledge and bluff. Who will be the big winner? Combining general knowledge, strategy, luck and courage, this exciting game is for players with cunning and good bluffing who will try to get the pellets containing the largest amounts of money and gain access to the Final Round. Strategy, thinking and nerves of steel are the party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to accumulate the largest amount of money by collecting the money contained in pellets. Each round you get a new pellet and you must decide to either keep it or try to steal another player's pellet. That player can try to block that theft by correctly answering a general knowledge question. At the end of each round a player is eliminated until someone reaches the final round in which he or she will try to make more money in that single round than any other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
