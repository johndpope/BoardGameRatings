			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Universe is locked in eternal war. Amidst the uncounted galaxies of space, a million races struggle to survive a conflict that has raged since the dawn of creation. The young race of Man, recently ascended from the primordial ooze of Earth, is just the latest to learn of his impending doom.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever watched a science fiction movie thick with dramatic battle scenes and wished that you could step in and control the action? Wished you could command your own termination machines, armored storm troopers, or slime covered aliens. If so, then behold, for the means to do so is here before you now, within the pages of this book. Welcome to Universal War, a 10MM-1/180th scale, mass-combat, science fiction, miniatures war game. It allows players to lead fantastical armies amidst the unlimited planetary war zones of the far future and compete with one another for supreme control over all the fictional worlds ever made popular by novels, comic books, toys, television, and the cinema. Universal War allows its players to build and battle any army they can dream up. There are no limitations and no forbidden ideas, so summon your chosen legions and let the battles begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
