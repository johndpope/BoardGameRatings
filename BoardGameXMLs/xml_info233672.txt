							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Free Animal Republic of Macdonald (F.A.R.M.) Presents the Trial of the Big Bad Wolf, to be Immediately Followed by His Execution, in Celebration of Our First Anniversary</name>
									
			<description>synopsis from the website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One year ago, Old MacDonald's farm animals rose up against him, threw off the chains of agricultural oppression, and founded the overtly fascist Free Animals' Republic of MacDonald. Today, on the first anniversary of that glorious revolution, the F.A.R.M. is holding a gala ball in celebration, culminating in the trial of a most notorious criminal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in the background, shadows lurk. Rumors fly that someone is running the illegal drugs Curds and Whey. The police are looking into talk of a prostitution ring. Why is Big Bird nowhere to be found? And who is this mysterious Chicken Little that nobody wants to talk about?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
