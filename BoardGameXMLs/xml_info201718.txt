			<description>INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;In America&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Old West,&amp;rdquo; the young male braves of many Indian tribes faced difficult trials in order to become warriors. In Braves to Warriors, you and a friend will compete to win five such tests and gain the coveted feather of success in each. At day&amp;rsquo;s end, only the best brave in the tribe will henceforth be called: &amp;ldquo;Warrior&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;Win the most Victory Points (VPs) during the five trials &amp;ndash; swimming, tracking, riding, hunting and fighting &amp;ndash; and finish the game with a higher score than your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;36 cards (7 cards in five suits + one &amp;ldquo;Big Chief&amp;rdquo; card)&lt;br/&gt;10 Feather tiles (2 tiles in five suits)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CARDS&lt;br/&gt;There are five suits, each reflecting one of the five trials in the game&amp;mdash;swimming, tracking, riding, hunting and fighting. Each suit has seven cards valued 1 to 7, which is used during trials. Your goal is to obtain 7 or more of the 13 Success Points (SPs) available during the trial. One SP is scored for each card in the trial suit you take, plus one SP for each value 7 card, during a round of quasi-trick taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
