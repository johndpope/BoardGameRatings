			<description>THEME&lt;br/&gt;...it's the year 2099.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The polar ice caps melted 10 years ago, resulting in a rapid increase in the world's sea level. &lt;br/&gt;Cities drowned, the world's plains turned into lakes, mountains became islands.&lt;br/&gt;Whole populations were wiped out.&lt;br/&gt;The food shortage brought the wars...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we are all divided into 4 main alliances, where each one fights for the last remaining pieces of land.&lt;br/&gt;Each one struggles to reach the pivotal point and control... The 5th Land&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE BOARD&lt;br/&gt;The board can be setup to show 11.664 different map formations,&lt;br/&gt;assuring a different world every time you play and always the need for a new strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;In The5thLand, each player represents one of the 4 main alliances whose aim is to occupy 5 lands, by controling the worlds resources, bankrupting their enemies and ultimately by war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning each player starts with 2 Lands, 2 Army units and a Supply Center with 5 of each resources  and 75 Million Credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Round consists of 4 main Phases where the players have the opportunity to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Extract the resources from the territories they occupy.&lt;br/&gt;    Build additional Military units (Land/Air/Navy).&lt;br/&gt;    Trade on the world markets, Resources and Military units.&lt;br/&gt;    Move military units around the globe to achieve a strategic advantage and Attack when the time is right...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players may act or not in each Phase (clockwise direction) and when all have played, they move on the next Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VICTORY&lt;br/&gt;When at least one player occupies five Lands, the game finishes at the end of that Round. &lt;br/&gt;If two or more players have at least five lands, then the player with the most lands wins.&lt;br/&gt;If there is still a tie, then the player with the most money, minus any loans, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE NATIONS&lt;br/&gt;The world has come together to form 4 main alliances, each one having a unique advantage in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Demeter Federation: an Eco-friendly society, whose efforts have resulted in an abundance of food resources.&lt;br/&gt;    Dionysus Coalition: the scavengers of the world, rumor has it that they can smell Oil from a mile away.&lt;br/&gt;    Hephaestus League: the steampunk nation, with a special affinity for Gold.&lt;br/&gt;    Poseidon Empire: the sea power of the game, their motto: 'In a world of water, Ships are gods'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
