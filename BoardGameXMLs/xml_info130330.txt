							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Where-Wolf?</name>
									
			<description>It's not easy being a werewolf, but you've learned how to make a life. Keep a low profile, don't chase the neighbors, etc... Unfortunately, it seems somewolf else hasn't learned that yet. And now the town's in an uproar over the mess left in the middle of town, and something must be done! The plan: head out into the woods on the next full moon and catch the wolf! The problem, everyone has to be there - including you! So you need to catch the other wolf before someone catches you. But what you don't know: your lovely town of Wolfeboro is inhabited entirely by werewolves and all of your neighbors are facing your same dilemma - catch or be caught!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game begins, you and your friends must work together to create the Wolfeboro woods - every player gets a say in how many trees you use and where they go! Yay! And then its time to hunt down one of your friends before they can hunt you! Each turn, roll your bones to move, but be careful, the wrong roll means you get hit by moonlight and become the prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to catch a w(h)erewolf wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
