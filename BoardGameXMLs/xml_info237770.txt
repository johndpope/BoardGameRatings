			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Arctic Encounters! This is designed and dedicated to give more life into your Arctic themed adventures with fun themes, monsters, and NPC's. In this material you'll find over fifty new custom Arctic themed creatures and creations with full stat blocks, pictures, and descriptions. These creatures range from beast, a new dragon, seven new non-playable characters, weather patterns, and few new items! You'll also find, for your convenience, some official Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition monsters that now have descriptions and pictures to better serve your creative juices when creating an adventure. Creatures taken from the official Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition Monster Manual have the exact stat block as they do in the manual, and have been marked with the red Dungeons and Dragons Logo on the upper right-hand comer of their stat block. These creatures were added to this project because they are common creatures found within Arctic-like environments. Like all creatures in the world of Dungeons and Dragons these creatures can be modified anyway you like and were created for inspiration and ideas for your enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
