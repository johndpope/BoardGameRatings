			<description>Fabulous Finds brings an exciting twist to the seek-and-find genre where an eye for design and profitable rewards are key. The game follows the user who, after inheriting a beautiful home in Carmel, CA from Great Aunt Beatrice, will arrive to find a diamond in the rough. Aunt Bea's larger-than-life personality and equally eccentric collector's eye doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit with the average person&amp;rsquo;s home-decorating style. With a passion for interior design but a pocketbook that doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit the fervor, there is only one thing to do-have a yard sale! Gamers will sort through rooms to find items that fit the theme of the upcoming yard sale, match shoppers to the treasures they desire and use the profits to redecorate each room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;Find treasures throughout your house, then play fun mini-games to sort and repair items to get the best price&lt;br/&gt;Haggle with shoppers at the yard sale to get the most cash&lt;br/&gt;What does each eclectic shopper want? Solve the riddles to help everyone find bargains at your sale&lt;br/&gt;Use the money you earn at your yard sale to redecorate your house buy new furniture, paint the walls and make it your own&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
