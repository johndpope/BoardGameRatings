			<description>Players move around the track on the board following the instructions of the spaces they land on.  When a player lands on a space showing an antique they may buy it at the price shown.  If a player lands on the auction space, that player must auction one of their items to the other players.  Play continues until one player owns all 6 antique items in the game and has purchased the golden hammer.  The game then ends and that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
