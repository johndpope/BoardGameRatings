			<description>The objective of this strategy game is to have conquered more fields than the opponent at the end of the game. Various game modes (victory conditions) are available. Played on a play area with 151 hexagonal squares, of which 139 can be conquered. Each player receives three tokens and 100 field marks. The game is turn-based. Each turn consists of the following four phases:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Move 2. Draw commands-cards 3. Capture by rolling 4. Capture by commands,&lt;br/&gt; which are always played in this order.&lt;br/&gt;When a player has completed his turn, the second player has his turn. This is repeated until one of the players has won the game mode determined by both players at the beginning. &lt;br/&gt;The player has to move each of his token one field every turn. He rooling the dice for each token and destinkt so how many fields he can conquer surround his token. If the player roll a five he can conquer or free five fields.   &lt;br/&gt;The player conquer free fields or free conquered fields. If a field with a token is conquerd, the token go back to the spawn.  &lt;br/&gt;Each time a player move on one of the 12 fields with a star (wich can not be conquerd) he has to draw a command-card.&lt;br/&gt;With this command-cards he can supply for example his movement, instead of one movement turn per token he has by playing the command &amp;quot;move +1&amp;quot; two turns for one token. The command-cards are very different. Some have supply effects for the movement other supply the conquering and others are traps with negative effects. Some of the command-cards ask the player to roll the dice. For example how many fields a player lose by drawing a trap-card.&lt;br/&gt;Some commands (max 5)can be collected in the &amp;quot;depot&amp;quot; and played as a chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an assist app available in Google Playstore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
