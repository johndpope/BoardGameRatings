			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starlight Lines Employee Forum is one of the features hosted on the Starship Titanic Construction Internet website. Users may post unmoderated messages to the forum under any assumed name that they wish to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this context, players take on the role of crew or passengers of the Starship Titanic, as featured in the eponymous computer game that this website was originally created to advertise. The plot on the forum has since diverged widely from that of the Starship Titanic computer game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of playing amount to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Read the most recent posts to understand the current plot (this may amount to over a hundred posts) and the characters that are involved in it.&lt;br/&gt;     Post in a style that is in keeping with the spirit of the game rather than deliberately antagonising the regular players.&lt;br/&gt;     Do not introduce invincible characters or try to kill other people's characters.&lt;br/&gt;     The purpose of the forum is to roleplay in the Starship Titanic setting, not to provide support for the Starship Titanic computer game.&lt;br/&gt;     Keep posts in character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With such few constraints, the characters and events that occur in the Starship Titanic and its surrounding have varied wildly over time. An account of some of the more notable places, events and people can be seen on the h2g2 page for the forum (see the weblink below).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
