							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Potentially Useful Things to Find in the Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland (Mutant Future)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of useful items that could be found by players scavenging for supplies from corpses, vehicles and buildings following an apocalyptic event. Most of these items are useful, although sometimes they may not be specifically useful for characters and in some cases the use is largely as oddly-shaped treasure. The items are less advanced than the high tech equipment from the core rulebook, but are still generally more advanced than those of post-apocalyptic manufacture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general, or sometimes specific, type of item is determined, followed by the quantities found, or quantities inside, followed by item specifics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Propane - 1d3 gas cylinders, roll 1d6, 1-4 full, 5-6 empty (If a full canister is placed in a fire it will explode in 1d4 turns causing 6d6 points of damage in a 30&amp;rsquo; radius)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover, one the front matter and one the Open Game License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also available in a system-neutral version. You do not need to buy both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
