							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earth Delta Mutant Manual (Beta Release)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those of you who have been following this project since its inception know it used to be one book, which was, sadly, growing beyond Word's ability to format and repaginate easily, not to mention turning into a PDF file more bloated than the Federal budget. Bah-dum-bum! (You liberals can substitute &amp;quot;than the compensation for a Wall Street fat cat that leeches off the backs of the Workers&amp;quot;). So, I've decided to split the book in twain, or possibly in clemens, and if you're just wandering in here from some other PDF and have no idea what to expect, let me warn you -- the jokes don't get any better. They get worse. A lot worse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, and this is important -- the game is not a joke. I cannot help being sarcastic and, as an inverterbrate punster, I am spinelessly unable to resist a pun. (See what I mean?) However, this isn't a comedy game -- at least not by design, though you can play it for laughs all you want, and the creatures here, whether they have horrible puns for names or not, are designed to be not just lethal opponents in battle, but to have some feeling of verisimilitude, to be as believable as such strange things can be. To the people living in the world of Earth Delta, these monsters are lurking hazards, potential allies, and deadly mysteries. You, the player, may snicker when you realize what inspired the swarmhound -- but your character will not be laughing as he is covered with vicious, stinging, insects and then ripped to pieces by starving wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of the first &amp;quot;printing&amp;quot; (well, posting) of this book, Heroic Tier monsters are very complete in terms of number -- more than enough to keep you busy from levels 1-10, especially with the Mutant Bolt On and Instant 'Oids to add variety. Paragon Tier monsters are trickling in, and Epic monsters... would be a really good idea. The creatures here have all been updated statistically to the new &amp;quot;MM3&amp;quot; format, meaning generally higher damage and adjusted attack values, but not all have been reformatted to the new style. Also, just to be clear, as any look through &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; monsters will tell you, the DMG guidelines for monster building are guidelines, not absolutes, to be tweaked up or down as the designer wishes, so all you types that went around adding up the skill points for third party monsters in the D20 Era can just find some other hobby. (Obviously, if someone finds a grossly over/under powered monster, I'd like to know about it, but if Reflex defense is 1 too high or too low, why not assume I did it that way on purpose, and if you don't like it, just change it. Sheesh.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
