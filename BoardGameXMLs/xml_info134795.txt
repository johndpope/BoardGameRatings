			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to RAS, a world entered only through Screenplay's new adventure series, the Warriors of Ras. This superb collection of graphic role-playing games promises to bring hours of fun to exercise your wit and reasoning skills. Each game is made up of randomly designed mazes, monsters and confrontations. Even beginning role-players can create strong warriors -- and save them to play game after game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KAIV&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the cave and everything turns pitch black. But unforseen danger will open your eyes in the second game in the role-playing series Warriors of Ras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two dozen of the most insidious species ever created inhabit the cave. Inside the cave also lies the power to conquer them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use Mystical Rings to walk through walls, or annihilate the enemy with Wands of Power. There are Mystery Swords, Magic Potions, and picks to escape thundering cave-ins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your tools carefully. You're only human. You can carry only so much with your hands. So use your head, plan--but be careful! Pits, traps, jagged cliffs and acid pools lie ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As do two more Warriors of Ras games: Wylde and Ziggurat. Each is increasingly difficult. It will be very prudent on your part to explore Kaiv over an over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everytime you play Kaiv the game is different. Your character becomes stronger and you become wiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be strong enough? Wise enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
