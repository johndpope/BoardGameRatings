			<description>A Tale lost in our past...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover a tale long lost in our past. Seven swords need to be found in this Metroidvania adventure where you will discover ancient secrets and fight with an intense combat system that rewards player skill and knowladge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lore &amp;ndash; After Niro cried to create this world he did it again and created the Orins. Once they defy him and with furious anger he takes their voices away and the cause of the great sin... The first seven swords are forever lost in this world. To defy him again is necessary to find them but such a task can only be completed by the last seven Orins that still search for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic Combat &amp;ndash; Using light and heavy attacks with precison and six different styles the combat system heavly relies on timing and patience and this intensive skill based system is supported by the procedural generation of swords and by a diverse range of enemies and bosses. Attacks blend together with a roll movement and the use of ancient relics as well as dynamic body transformations called Kuros that allow even more diverse gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
