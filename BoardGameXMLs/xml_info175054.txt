							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Tokyo: Electric Town</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center of the Akihabara District is an endless neon party, some of the best and most densely crowded shopping in Tokyo. Electric Town is a mecca for otaku, gamers and gadget-freaks of all kinds. Video game megacorps like Sega and Taito have gleaming office buildings here, their outer facades lit with flashy neon. Media giants are headquartered here, setting fashion trends for the entirety of the world. Massive electronics stores sell everything from personal computers to cameras to televisions to appliances and toys- the largest are nine or ten story behemoths with square footage larger than most of Japan&amp;rsquo;s rural villages. Anime and manga shops, book stores, music and DVD stores, bars, restaurants and maid cafes are found on every single corner, ten to a block at least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there are alleys you never want to walk down, leading to places where high tech meets horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the new sites described in this sourcebook, and most of the sites from Black Tokyo Unlimited found in or near Electric Town are part of the bustle and energy of Electric Town. Electric Town is just one of many districts found in the sprawling alpha-city called Tokyo, but is dangerous and exciting enough to be the exclusive setting for many Black Tokyo campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Tokyo: Electric Town focuses primarily on the Akihabara District, as well as the neighboring Rappongi, Harajuku and Shibuya, especially the iconic 109 Building that juts from the Shibuya skyline like a sleek, drawn blade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
