			<description>A game with first class illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;It is a set collecting game, like a Quartet but with a difference. You are collecting the four quarters of an animal. A full set will be numbered 1 to 4 but in the early stages you may well collect the wrong animal part because you did not recognise it correctly. It also has child appeal because the box illustrates wrongly assembled animals, with a good sense of humour on behalf of the publisher. &lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who collects the most correct animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
