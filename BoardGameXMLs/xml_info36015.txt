			<description>&amp;ldquo;Create your own tales of Conan the Barbarian and his adventures in Hyboria. All players share a single common deck. The deck contains six suits of cards: Conan cards, Locations, Events, Lesser Foes, Major Foes, &amp;amp; Specials. There are 30+ cards of each suit in the deck.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to score the most victory points by playing melds from your six card hand. There are four types of melds that may be played: Three Pairs (two cards each from three suits), Two Three-of-a-Kinds (three cards each from two suits), Six-of-a-kind (six cards from one suit), or Flush (one card from each suit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
