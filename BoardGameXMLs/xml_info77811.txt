			<description>From a contemporary brochure from the publisher: &amp;quot;The object of the game is to form books of four cards each. The 60 cards in the game deal with 15 different Bible topics. For 3 or more players of all ages.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Contrary to the publisher's brochure, there are in fact only 56 cards on 14 topics; the rules on the back of the box state the correct count.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is similar to Go Fish, but with additional luck and memory elements. Each card contains a topic, such as Patience or Forgiveness, and four relevant verses from the Bible. A player may keep a requested card if he or she can recite the requested verse from memory. If the defending player fails to recite the requested verse, the requesting player draws a random card from the defending player's hand, discarding it if it is not the requested card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who collects the most complete sets of four cards with the same topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
