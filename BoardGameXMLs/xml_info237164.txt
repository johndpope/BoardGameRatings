							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tarrasque Hatchling</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all the monsters across all the realms and all the planes, tarrasques are easily the most dangerous. These massive beings are vicious, deadly, and surprisingly resistant to magical spells which normally protect the communities in their path. When just one emerges from the bowels of the earth, entire cities will be lost as countless adventurers sacrifice themselves to halt its progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet, even the most powerful of tarrasques once began life as an innocent hatchling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mature tarrasque can lay a single dwarf-sized egg every 500 years, although mating pairs are uncommon. When an egg is laid, it gestates for six months before hatching, usually with the assistance of its mother or another helpful creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hatchling always imprints on the first creature it sees, trusting its &amp;ldquo;parent&amp;rdquo; to feed and protect it in an uncertain world. If the creature it bonds with is not an adult tarrasque, the hatchling will still become a lifelong companion to it and treat any trusted allies like its own family. While the hatchling&amp;rsquo;s first attempts at combat are enthusiastically clumsy, it will eventually grow into a powerful being in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which is a problem. The typical adventurer&amp;rsquo;s life is short and brutal. Even an elf who retires from questing will reach an advanced age at 750 years, fabled rumors of immortality to the contrary. Tarrasques, meanwhile, live for millennia. There has never been a recorded case of such a creature dying of natural causes. So eventually, the tarrasque hatchling will lose its imprinted parent. And when that happens, it will start to lash out at creatures around it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the civilized world views tarrasques as monsters. But the tragic reality is every single tarrasque is vicious because it is grieving the loss of its mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
