			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discombobulation is a fun, fast-paced game guaranteed to make the entire family laugh. The goal&amp;hellip; be the first to play all of your cards before someone can discombobulate you with one of 10 unique Discombobulation challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will go head-to-head against other players to compose rhymes, sing popular songs, make lists, mimic others, remember nicknames, and much more. Mess up, you draw more cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sound difficult? You bet. But outplaying your opponents in a game that requires a quick mind, fast reflexes, and a good memory makes it worth the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
