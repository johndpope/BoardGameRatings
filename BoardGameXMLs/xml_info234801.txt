							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">2259 Earth!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2259 Earth! is a variant of futuristic science and moderate post-apocalyptic &amp;mdash; taking place in the distant future, dystopian Earth has evolved and devolved several times, finally reaching a state where countries and governments no longer exist, but corporations instead run the world. Three classes of people are left&amp;mdash;those employed by corporations, those that are unemployed and unable to work, and the few who work for themselves, often illegally, scraping out a meager existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is divided into three sections; the Historical Background chapter tells the story of how Earth evolved to its fragmented state by 2259AD. The Current Day section describes the Earth&amp;rsquo;s corporate landscape, powerful leaders and way of life for the planet&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. Finally, the Starter Plots chapter provides possible starting points for game masters (GMs) running their first scenario in Earth 2259!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the SRS Sci-Fi Variant, but easily adapted to any RPG system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
