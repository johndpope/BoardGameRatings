							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of the Sexes</name>
									
			<description>Battle of the Sexes has 880 questions or actions divided into five card categories. For every question your team answers correctly, a trophy is moved closer to your team's Winner's Circle. Earn three trophies to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team can use Challenge Tokens. These Tokens could either propel you to an easy victory, or send you backwards. If your team doesn't know the answer to an Our Facts, Our Stuff, Our Pics, or Our Lives question, but you think the other team doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the answer either, you can throw the question back at them by playing one of your challenge tokens. If they answer incorrectly, move the trophy towards your side of the board. If they answer correctly, move the trophy towards their side of the board. Each team only has 3 Challenge Tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
