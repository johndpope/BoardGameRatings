			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luminatrum a world where the powers of darkness and light fight an ongoing struggle for control of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I shape the darkness into nightmarish forms&lt;br/&gt;that haunt your every waking hour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightshapers through arcane mastery take pure darkness and form it into frightful shades that encompass allies and grants those allies advantages. They also cause havoc with their mere presence. They can cause their allies to fight with unknown resolve. They can also cause their enemies to run in fear&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nightshaper is a new leader class that has an arcane flare. They use shadows to lead from the back. They can enshroud their allies in fearsome forms that cause fear. Or they can generate zones of nightmare that cause enemies to be distracted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This preview includes all of the information for a player to begin using a first level nightshaper character. This is one of two unique classes to the Luminatrum campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
