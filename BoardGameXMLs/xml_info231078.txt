			<description>Reading the Play is a card game themed around &amp;ldquo;The King in Yellow.&amp;rdquo; Players race to assemble passages from the infamous play while dealing with the madness contained within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns either drawing from the deck or trading with each other. Each player is attempting to assemble as many sequential lines of the play as possible while avoiding Yellow Signs. The game ends when the final line of the play is revealed, at which point the player with the most lines in front of them wins. Players have to be careful though because if anyone ever has three Yellow Signs in hand the game ends and everyone loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
