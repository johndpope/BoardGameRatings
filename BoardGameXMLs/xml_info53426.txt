							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Journeying West</name>
									
			<description>In the third year of the reign of Tai Zong (629 AD) of the Tang Dynasty, the Tripitaka monk received in a dream a mission from the Boddhisattva Guanyin to journey from his war-torn nation to the Thunderclap monastery, where he would receive at the feet of the Buddha himself the purest teaching and the ultimate sutras. To protect him on his Journey to the West, the goddess gave to him four demonic companions, who themselves are figures of legend in China today. Journeying West invites you to retake this famous journey in the role of the demonic escorts, jostling for status and acclaim as you ultimately journey towards enlightenment.
