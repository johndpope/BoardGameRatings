			<description>An Axis &amp;amp; Allies like strategy game reliving the dramatic events of operation Market-Garden in September 1944. A large narrow mapboard represents the area from Eindhoven by Nijmegen to Arnhem. Units are plastic pieces representing infantry, tanks and artillery; 13 important plastic bridges are included. Almost every bridge is a stepping-stone to success. And every bridge can be blown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to reach Arnhem and make contact with the British paras. The time frame is restricted and if the Allied player doesn't reach Arnhem on time, the paras are doomed and an easy target for the German elite forces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RULES are short and simple: the game focusses on strategy, and nothing else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game map has all the necessary information needed to play the game. Once you've read the rules once, there's no need to look up things anymore. (almost) Every bit of information is on the map.&lt;br/&gt;No looking up hit probabilities, defense factors, or attack factors in rows and columns. No measuring with rulers. Just roll the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved with the use of ten-sided color coded dice: so there's some luck involved, but a reasonable level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good tactics require the use of an optimal mix of units to get the job done.&lt;br/&gt;Each kind of unit has its specific strength and weakness, depending on the battleground. Players should choose wisely which units to use where and when.&lt;br/&gt;In this game the players don't get to choose the casualties themselves: a roll with the dice reveals the distribution of the hits. The FOG OF WAR is simulated by distributing the hits at random. In this way you are never totally in control: you plan your strategies, you work out plans, you anticipate as much as you can, but the outcome is never, ever perfect. With &amp;quot;Arnhem'44&amp;quot; both players get a much more 'realistic' game experience playing this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
