			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, but has not yet been released and made available for purchase. Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a migrant worker trained to operate the ultimate in heavy machinery, you'll be sent to far away worlds to further the interests of your employer. Usually you blast rocks to uncover precious minerals; with all the corporate rivalry going on in the space-age wild west you get the feeling you'll be asked to blast the competition as well. You hope you don't have to deal with the mercenaries the mining companies have been hiring. Then again... if you can't beat them, join them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
