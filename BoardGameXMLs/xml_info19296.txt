			<description>This game portrays a race across the African continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is racing in a jeep across the African steppes and is trying to plant trees. In order for the tree to survive, you have to carefully manage your water supply. You also bring 2 of 4 different objects that can protect you against the hazards of the wild so that you don't lose any time. But watch out - behind your back your opponent may destroy your trees or steal your water supply!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to plant a certain number of trees (depending on the number of players) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
