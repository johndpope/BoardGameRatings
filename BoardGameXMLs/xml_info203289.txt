							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Down the Rabbit Hole (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After chasing a white rabbit through the wood, a group of young adventurers find themselves falling down a peculiar rabbit hole! Can they puzzle their way out of the hole by feeding a hungry dictionary and playing the oddest game of peek-a-boo ever?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Adventures in Wonderland, a mini-adventure path for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game! Chapter 2: Down the Rabbit Hole is a family-friendly mini-adventure suitable for 1st level characters. By the end of the adventure, all characters who have played the first chapter should have earned enough experience points to advance to 2nd level. The Adventures in Wonderland adventure path will take characters from 1st to 5th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Down the Rabbit Hole was designed to be part of a mini-adventure path it can be played alone or even as part of another adventure entirely. The rabbit hole can be a strange but fun transition point between one location and another in any adventure, making the very act of getting from point A to point B a challenging encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
