			<description>From the Publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unthinkable happens in 2016. A nuclear exchange in the Middle East kills 20 million people and cripples the world's oil supply. Crude oil prices spike at $800 a barrel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One year later, the threat of world-wide nuclear war is eliminated when the United States and Europe deploy a comprehensive space-based anti-ballistic missile shield. Russia soon follows with an advanced missile defense system of its own. Intercontinental ballistic missiles are rendered obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Russia becomes the world's primary supplier of energy and experiences a massive economic boom. With its newfound riches, Russia quickly re-establishes itself as a major superpower and restores her military might.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Western Europe, with the notable exception of the UK and Ireland, unifies to create the European Federation. This new nation is destined to be a formidable 21st-century Superpower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2020, the United States is on the verge of finishing construction on the Freedom Star, a controversial orbital military platform that will upset the balance of world power. The European Federation withdraws from NATO in protest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tensions between the European Federation, the United States, and Russia are building and will soon reach the breaking point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EndWar is about to begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
