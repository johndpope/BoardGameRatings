			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book offers new ways to play Succession, both with new rules for the game you've played, and new games you can use Succession's rules to play. This hardly gives an encyclopedic inventory of what Succession can accomplish, and indeed, the kinds of stories you and your friends can tell together are endless. But within the offering this book provides, take note even of genres and sections that seem to offer nothing to you: every section includes novel rules that serve that section's goal. These new rules, like the new Deeds, can likewise serve other genres and styles of story. Indeed, several sections contain new approaches to a common facet of the game, from creating characters, to building the world, to setting up Quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These heterogeneous parts serve not just to provide tools, but to give instruction on how to create your own. The section on Horror, for example, shows how to combine lists of Blessings in new ways, still giving a thematic and guiding set of choices, but giving wider possibility in finding such a set. The section on Space Opera, by contrast, takes the simple existing Blessings and expressly uses them to denote supernormal powers and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With less than three dozen pages, this book is very finite, but every effort has been made to give you and your friends more stories than you can tell in a lifetime. It is the author's hope that the rules here serve to make the telling easy, fast, and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
