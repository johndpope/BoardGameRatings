							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tornado Low Level</name>
									
			<description>Tornado Low Level (also known as T.L.L.) was written by Costa Panayi who also coded Android, Android 2, Highway Encounter, Cyclone and Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a Tornado fighter jet and must manoeuvre the plane at very low levels. The aim is to collect 'targets' on the landscape by flying very low over them, while avoiding pylons, bridges, and other structures. As the level progress, the targets are place in more difficult positions e.g. closer to buildings and on the water in narrow gulleys. Each level had a time limit, and the Tornado had a limited fuel supply. Landing on the airfield would refuel the aircraft. At high speeds the plane's wings &amp;quot;sweep back&amp;quot;. An interesting feature of the game was the 3D view, which included a shadow of the plane on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tornado Low Level&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
