			<description>Super Professional Baseball II (スーパープロフェッショナルベースボール２, &amp;quot;Super Professional Baseball 2&amp;quot;) is a sequel to Super Professional Baseball, although the next game in the Bases Loaded Series is Super 3D Baseball so it is also a sequel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Super Professional Baseball was the basis for the North American port called Super Bases Loaded, Super Professional Baseball II is a significantly different game than Super Bases Loaded 2. The end result of either winning a single game or winning the championship is fireworks followed by a ticker-tape parade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Professional Baseball II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
