			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slam 'n Jam '95 is a basketball game from 1995 which was developed and released exclusively on 3DO.  The game features all 27 teams then in the NBA, though it does not feature any of the actual players due to licensing issues.  The game was perhaps the first 3D basketball game and was known for its quick play which was somewhere in between the realism of titles like NBA Live '95 and the fantasy of NBA jam.  There is a season mode which the player can play through or partially simulate on the way to the playoffs and there is also a playoff mode that can be used as a starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
