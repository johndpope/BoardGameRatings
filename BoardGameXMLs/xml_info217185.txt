							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Camellia</name>
									
			<description>Goal&lt;br/&gt;The tea harvest is upon us. As workers pick the flushes from the tea bushes, the factory needs to dry, oxidize and cook the leaves to create many different flavors of tea. At its core Camellia is a time management game. The tea flushes you have in front of you will be constantly oxidizing and it's up to you to strike at the right time and make the best teas that you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win Camellia you will want to focus upon cooking teas in order to fulfill contracts and make sets. The contracts will change each game so certain teas will be more in demand depending on the contracts available. You can supplement your sets by grabbing wild cards for teas that you cannot get. The wild cards do not count towards contacts and will not earn you any money however, so beware. You can have many sets but few other points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
