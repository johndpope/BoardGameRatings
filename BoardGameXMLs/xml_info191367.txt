			<description>The first player to reach the space &amp;quot;Ziel&amp;quot; wins the game. Movement is determined by playing (very tiny) cards. Some spaces hinder or benefit the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players start with 3 cards. To move the player must match his cards to the number on the space ahead of his playing piece. If he does this with one card (the number on the space and the card are the same), he moves one space. If he uses more cards (adding and/or subtracting) he moves according to the number of cards he uses. After each move the player draws a new card and moves again if possible. If he can't match the number, he can't move and the next player draws a card and continues the game. On the first turn the players may only draw a fouth card, if the can't match the &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; on the first space with their three cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces are little plastic disks with a hole in the center and are moved with wooden sticks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
