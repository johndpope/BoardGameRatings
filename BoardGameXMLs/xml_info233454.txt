			<description>As a serious practitioner of Capoeira, Isabella Sousa loved watching Brandon's movies. She admired and idolized him, training hard and aspiring to be a great fighter as well.  but because of an accident on set and his flighty attitude captured on TV, tabloids began to speculate that Brandon was a fraud, that his martial arts was just for show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isabella wanting to prove the world wrong, sent challenges to him in order to let everyone witness his true abilities.  Unfortunately, his agent ignored the challenges as just a fan girl trying to get attention.  Determined to get a bout with her idol, Isabella travels across the country to hunt him down herself.  Will she help Brandon find his true potential, or will she expose him as an actor relying on stunt doubles and Hollywood post editing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;1 Miniature + Rival/Ally card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
