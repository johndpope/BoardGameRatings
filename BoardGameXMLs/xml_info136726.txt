			<description>Welcome skilled treasure hunter to the ever-changing Echo Dungeon. It will take strategy, skill, and a fair amount of luck to make it to the treasure. Choose your equipment well for it may be the difference between untold wealth and leaving empty handed. However, the real question isn't if you can make it to the treasure but if you can make it back out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echo Dungeon is a light PnP dungeon crawler. Where the objective is to make it to the Treasure Room and back to the Entrance Stairs first. The only drawback is that most of rooms have traps that are trying to prevent you from doing so. This is achieved by placing randomly picked tiles as you make your way through the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played with 1-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
