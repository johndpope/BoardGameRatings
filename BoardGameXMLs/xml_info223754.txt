			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently there has been an uneasy feeling in the small coastal town of Chanler.  Strange things have been happening in the middle of the night.  People go missing for weeks and then return with no memory of where they have been.  Others never return.  The mayor has looked the other way, but not today.  For his daughter has been missing for days, now!  You and your brave companions must find her before it's too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2nd - 3rd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
