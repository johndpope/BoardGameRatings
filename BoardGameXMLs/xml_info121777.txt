			<description>A home version of the arcade game where you use flippers to send the ball to the opposite end of the pitch. This is a reduced size so that it can easily be played on a table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players stand at opposite ends of the pitch. Put the ball in play and frantic flipping becomes the order of the day. Whoever scores the most goals, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
