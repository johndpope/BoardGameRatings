							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Discovery: The Evolution Game</name>
									
			<description>Discovery is a brand new educational and collaborative game, for adults and children from 6 years old, based on the evolution of mankind during prehistory and antiquity. Each card represents a major discovery, innovation or breakthrough in our history. Most discoveries are based on earlier discoveries, called prerequisites, and open the way to new discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to earn the most points, by making discoveries and starting new eras. All the discoveries cards are placed in the common discovery tree, which is constructed together by all the players and organized by eras. A discovery card can be placed in the discovery tree only if all its prerequisites are already there, or if it has no prerequisite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery is a flexible and evolving game universe which allows you, with a single deck of cards to play different types of games. Discovery can be played as a solitary game or with up to 9 players, between humans only or with automatons (virtual players), in teams or individually, with simple fast 5-mins games or complex longer ones (&amp;gt;1hr). Adults and children, beginners and experts, all can play together by adjusting the game difficulty and relative player strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Discovery Simple, each player receives 5 cards and plays in turn. During your turn you can place one or more cards from your hand. If you don't, you must discard one card. You can also liberate cards from other players&amp;rsquo; discards (but not from your own). The game ends when a player places his last cards. The winner is the player who has earn most points. Points are earn by placing or liberating cards, inaugurating new eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Discovery Flash, all players select the cards they want to play at the same time, and then place them in turn. This creates a strong element of risk and suspense, as your outcome will depend on the selection made by the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery Battle is a more complex game in which each card has specific attributes which allow you to attack your opponents, capture loot, make alliances, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
