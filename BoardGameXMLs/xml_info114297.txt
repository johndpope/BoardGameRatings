			<description>In Straw, Sticks and Bricks players take on the roles of Pigentrepreneurs looking to be the first to finish their new housing development and start attracting buyers.  But, in their rush, will they cut corners and use the more readily available straw?  Or hold out and build quality brick homes?  Worse yet, you will never guess who the housing inspector is..  You guessed it, it&amp;rsquo;s B.B. Wolfe, and with his inspection badge, he can even knock down brick houses.  What is a pig to do&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Straw, Sticks and Bricks (SSB) is a resource management game geared toward children, but still providing a challenge for adults.  It uses familiar characters and simple mechanics to engage your children.  Honing skills of matching, set collecting, turn taking, negotiating and counting &amp;ndash; it is a perfect introductory challenge for children, and great for family game night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broken into three phases, in which all players take actions, so as to minimize the down time for players, keeping everyone engaged throughout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase players take turns spinning the resource wheel and collecting building supplies (Straw, Sticks or Bricks) &amp;ndash; or encountering the housing inspector (Mr Wolf), who may condemn one of the recently built homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next phase allows the players to trade the recently acquired building supplies with each other, hopefully to their mutual advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the final phase, players use their hard won resources to build homes in their housing developments &amp;ndash; and once a development is full and ready to open, points are totaled and a winner (or winners) is determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created as an entry for TGC Resource Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
