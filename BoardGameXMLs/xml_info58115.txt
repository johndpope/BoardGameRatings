			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are things that go bump in the night. There are other things that go squish, rattle, scrape and sometimes snarl. But the things you really want to watch out for are not the noisy ones, but the ones with the big sharp teeth that want to tear your arms off and eat you for dinner... just the sort of things you'll find in this book. &amp;quot;Script Crypt Volume 3: The Better To Eat You With&amp;quot; is the third book in the popular Script Crypt line of supplements for Horror Rules. Lurking within these pages are four more brand new adventure Scripts for your favorite little horror-comedy RPG, all hungering to spend a night at the gaming (a.k.a. &amp;quot;dinner&amp;quot;) table with you and your players. So for those who dare, the Crypt awaits. Call it crazy, call it deadly, call it quits - just don't call it late for dinner...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
