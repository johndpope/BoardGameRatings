			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lesters were hosting another one of their fabulous dinner parties. The invitation list was smaller than usual. The Lesters, and a few of their special family and friends were just about to sit down to enjoy the elaborate dinner Victoria Lester had prepared. The table was breathtaking. As usual Victoria had outdone herself. The diners toasted with a vintage bottle of red wine and sat down to eat. As the food was being passed around the table, Victoria started to choke and cough. Everyone rushed to her side in time to see her fall face first into her food. She was dead, she had been poisoned. Welcome to an evening of murder! This is a 'Party Adventure' designed to create a night of intrigue and excitement for you and your friends. Within the comfort of your living room, you set the stage for solving a murder.
