							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Magic Items</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil Gets the Best Toys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every villain deserves some exciting gear, to let them take their evil over the top, and to the next level. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s ancient artifacts of ultimate evil, cutting edge technology that no one else can stand up against, powerful magical gifts from demonic or infernal benefactors, or just plain old piles of cash, it seems that the resources of evil are always quite a bit greater than those of good. And sure, you could probably get by with a robe of the evil archmagi or a +1 unholy greataxe, chances are, you want some magic items that are evil in more than just name. Something that is worthy of that great maniacal laugh that you&amp;rsquo;ve been working so hard on. This book contains ten new magic items designed specifically for villainous characters, whether PCs or NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A shield that can completely devour summoned creatures, cannibalizing their energy and using it to empower the shield.&lt;br/&gt;    A ring that allows you to drain the life force of the creature wearing a paired ring, keeping you fresh and young and even giving you boosts of power.&lt;br/&gt;    The doom cannon, which fires energy blasts, and can be supercharged by causing a living creature to bleed on its spikes.&lt;br/&gt;    A rod that inflicts one of several nasty punishments, chosen at random.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
