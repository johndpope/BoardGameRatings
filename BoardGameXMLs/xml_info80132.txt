			<description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s Introduction&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Dave Woodrum's choice of a convenience store/gas station for his latest action map seemed totally logical to me as editor.  These places are found everywhere from small towns to large cities.  Even if not a location for a planned part of an actual battle, they would be prime locations for information gathering when investigating mysterious events in any part of the country - rumors and secrets would be known by employees and customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such locations are also necessary for the many super-powered characters who do not fly and rely upon more conventional &lt;br/&gt;means of transportation. This location is truly universal and, though the location mapped out is most applicable to smaller cities, suburban areas and rural areas, can even be applied to the most built-up urban areas.  In central cities worldwide, these typical convenience stores can be found in every neighborhood, albeit without the gas pumps.  If an adventure is centered in a high-rise central city, the convenience store is basically the same but without (or possibly with few) gas pumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would also like to take this opportunity to thank science educator Jack Pavlich for his explanation in layman's terms and his suggestions regarding the &amp;quot;explosive&amp;quot; properties of gasoline for inclusion in game terms. This is also the ideal opportunity to thank those GMs and players who have been making suggestions and requests for action locations. I know that Dave has been planning future projects based upon such suggestions. &lt;br/&gt; Scott B. Bizar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
