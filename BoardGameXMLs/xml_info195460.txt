			<description>Defunct is an adventure game with a focus on flow, speed and an engaging world. You are a broken robot that accidentally falls out of a giant cargo ship onto a post-human earth, now inhabited by robots. You have to get back to your ship before it&amp;rsquo;s too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gravitize engine is used to create a separate gravity around yourself, this is the main source of your speed. Use this in downhills to accelerate. But be careful, using it uphill will slow you down. In addition to this the world is full of different speed boosts such as Enerjuice which you can pick up and use to go faster.&lt;br/&gt;These tools enables you to drive through the world, meet strange robots, fly through junkyards and boost your way back to your ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
