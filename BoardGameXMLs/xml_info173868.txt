							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blacksmith&#039;s Burden (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the party arrives in the small village of Goldendale they find a shortage of metal goods and a community upset with the lack of production. Despite their admiration for the village blacksmith, folks grow concerned about his inability to complete the simplest jobs even though they hear the ring of his hammer throughout the night...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 24-page sidetrek details the various NPC's and features in the village of Goldendale as well as the areas (and opposition) the party must investigate to unravel the mystery of the blacksmith&amp;rsquo;s burden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is compatible with the 5th (and earlier &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot;) editions of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. It is intended for characters of levels 2 - 4 and can be incorporated into any setting. It features hooks at the start and finish to draw the characters in as well as to spur on further adventures. The encounters feature maps and stat blocks for all of the party's foes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blacksmith's Burden is well suited for those times when adventurers go &amp;quot;looking for excitement&amp;quot; when they stop off in a backwater town on the way to their next quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
