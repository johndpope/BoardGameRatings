			<description>Hektik is a Pit clone for many players. There are 20 sets of 7 cards in the game. One set is used for every player involved. Each player is dealt seven cards. All players pick up their hand simultaneously and start trading over the table. A player can offer any number of the same symbol, but can only name the number, not the symbol. S/he then tries to find another player who offers the same number of cards. The first player to receive 7 of the same cards calls &amp;quot;Hektik&amp;quot; and is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differences to &amp;quot;Pit&amp;quot;: &lt;br/&gt;- 5-20 players&lt;br/&gt;- Seven cards per player&lt;br/&gt;- All symbols have the same value&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
