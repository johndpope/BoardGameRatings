							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">On The Slopes</name>
									
			<description>On The Slopes is a fast-paced skiing adventure for 2-4 players. Each player is a skier or snowboarder racing around a mountain, trying to be the first to visit every lodge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On The Slopes was one of five finalists in the 2016 Hasbro Game Design Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you have three actions, which you can use to go up a lift, ski down a run, or pick up a stone from a lodge.  But runs and lifts only work in one direction, you must carefully plan your route for the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever you pick up a stone, you also get a Snow Card, which can give you benefits like extra action tokens or a one-time-only ability.  Some Snow Cards let you help or hinder other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When going down runs, you can choose between easy green runs, intermediate blue runs, or advanced or expert black diamond runs.  The more difficult runs are faster, but you might fall and have to take a Wipeout Card, which can cause bad things to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced players can play with special characters that give each player a unique ability they can use throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
