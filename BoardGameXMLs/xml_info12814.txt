							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moon Flight</name>
									
			<description>Moon Flight is an Avon promotional game built around an innovative designed shampoo bottle. The object of the game is to be the first player to land on the moon and return for splash-down on earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has the following contents: instructions, a vinyl playing surface (approx. 13&amp;quot; x 28&amp;quot;), six mover tokens, and the plastic shampoo bottle that also forms the Command Module / LEM combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is determined by squeezing the shampoo bottle (thus launching the LEM off the command module) and reading the resulting face-up number on the LEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
