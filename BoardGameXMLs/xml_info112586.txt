			<description>Stealth games are awesome. Hiding from The Man, skulking in shadows, the thrill of the unseen infiltration. But why do they have to be so... slow?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing Stealth Bastard: stealth, with a great big kick up the arse. A fast-paced, frenetic, one-step-away-from-chunky-death melange of sneaking, platforming, hacking and cursing. A whole lot of fun. It's like Metal Gear Solid and Super Meat Boy had a baby out of wedlock. Semi-literally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jump, sneak, and be horribly dismembered through 28 levels hand-crafted by our crack team of in-house design geniuses, some of the same folk behind the critically-acclaimed Fluidity/Hydroventure, and the retro-styled PSN platformer Explodemon!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And once you're done with those? Fear not - Stealth Bastard includes a FULL in-game level editor - the same we used to create the bundled levels - and even allows you to share, play and rate the community's creations from across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you thought that was cool, we've not even got to the best bit yet: Stealth Bastard is free. Not 'freemium'. Completely free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Endless fun. Zero cost. What are you waiting for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
