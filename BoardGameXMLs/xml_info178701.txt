							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wash Your Sins</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of Finnish soldiers returning from yet another Russo-Swedish War in the late 1500s stumble into a village that isn't on the maps. Originally settled by pilgrims, who believed the local spring had the ability to clean them of their sins, the village is now occupied by people with very dark pasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have built a sauna next to the spring to better facilitate their purification, but everyone still seems haunted by their pasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the soldiers, your deeds during the war weigh heavily on your soul. Maybe you can't sleep or maybe the apparitions of your victims are always there in your peripheral vision. This may be your last chance for a fresh start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe it's just a ploy of the devil to claim a few more weak individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
