			<description>En Route is a pick-up and deliver strategy game with minimalist influences. Players take turns producing and shipping goods around the globe. Commodities are limited and players will be forced to take advantage of their opponents resources to complete their hidden goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use action cards depicting ports found on the map to produce goods or move goods from adjacent ports. Players must plan how to best move their commodities and re-calculate their plans when their goods are re-directed by other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three hidden destinations, each destination requires two commodities to be delivered to it. When a player achieves one of his or her goals the required commodities are returned to the pool of resources so they can be produced again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
