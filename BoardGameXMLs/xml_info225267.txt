			<description>An adventure is beginning. Only you can save Goldfish Kingdom. You have to accept the challenge and face countless monsters with skills. Unless you are a forgetful goldfish, there's no one who can defeat you. Come on! Our savior~~AMNESIA HEROES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;1. Shuffle challenge cards and skill cards separately. Place these two decks in the middle of the table. &lt;br/&gt;2. In the beginning, draw a challenge card and place it in the middle of the table. &lt;br/&gt;3. Place damage marks and goldfish marks aside.&lt;br/&gt;4. The player who looks like a goldfish goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COURSE OF PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four stages in this game. The leader in this turn executes the action.&lt;br/&gt; Learning skills: Through this stage, the leader deals the skill cards to each player. During the process, the leader has to remember which skill cards are in whose hands. It is the key to defeat the monster at the next stage.    &lt;br/&gt;1. The leader deals the skill cards face-up to each player clockwise. &lt;br/&gt;2. Two options to deal cards:&lt;br/&gt;A. Each time deal a skill card to each player clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;B. Deal the skill cards to a player one time. Then deal the skill cards to the next player clockwise.      &lt;br/&gt;Tip! No matter which option you choose, the process of dealing the skill cards can help you to find the best way to remember these cards. &lt;br/&gt;3. Each player chooses a skill card from your hands. Then places it face down in front of you as a skill you can't remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;※ The leader doesn't have to execute this action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select a monster: The leader selects a challenge card from the table or the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the attack sequence shown on the challenge card, the leader has to play skill cards from the left to the right or use goldfish marks to attack the monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;※ Remember the skill cards you dealt? Who has the skill card you need?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
