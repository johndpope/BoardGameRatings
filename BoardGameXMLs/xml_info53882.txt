							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sword of Roele</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;On the border between Anuire and the land of the Khinasi, the Three Brother Mages fight an ancient and immortal awnshegh, the Chimera. The game of cat and mouse has recently begun to draw regents from the entire region. Rumors say that the blade of the last Anuirean emperor, the Sword of Roele, has been tracked to the Chimera's domain, the Chimaeron. The fact that the Gorgon's armies are mustering in Kiergard seems to support the rumor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But choosing sides between the Chimera and the Three Brothers in no easy matter. If the Chimera drives the Brothers out, the trade routes through the Chimaeron may be sealed, leaving the seas free for the Khinasi to monopolize trade. If the Brothers drive the Chimera from the magical sources that give her strength, they may establish a beachhead for the Khinasi traders, who are slowly gobbling up the lands of Anuire just as their own lands were once annexed by the empire long ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will you and your comrades ally yourselves with? Who is the true enemy? Can you recover the Sword of Roele before anyone else does, and lay claim to the Iron Throne?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BIRTHRIGHT adventure is suitable for use with any party of three to six characters of levels 5-8, including at least one regent. You must have a copy of the AD&amp;amp;D game rules, the BIRTHRIGHT campaign setting, and the Cities of the Sun campaign expansion to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
