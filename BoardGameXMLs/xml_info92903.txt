							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TetriNET</name>
									
			<description>TetriNET is a multiplayer online Tetris game for up to six people, developed by St0rmCat in 1997.  TetriNET plays like standard multiplayer Tetris but with a twist: clearing rows will cause special blocks to appear in the player's field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a line containing a special block is cleared, then that special block is added to the player's inventory.  Clearing multiple lines at once increases the number of special blocks received.  At any point, a player may use one of their special blocks on themselves or another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The settings are also very customizeable.  The percentage chance for receiving specific special blocks or even the 7 standard Tetris blocks can be altered for a very wide variety of custom game types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia &amp;amp; User Summary, &amp;quot;TetriNET&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
