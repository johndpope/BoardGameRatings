							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">StoryCards Deck</name>
									
			<description>A deck of 60 cards in five suits for the game StoryCards. Cards are used as a randomizing element in the game: to perform feats, among other things. They are also used during adventure and character creation which can be layed out in a Tarot-like fashion to inspire creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;The StoryCards deck was inspired by the constellations, in the hope that the cards in turn will inspire you in the creation of your own stories. The constellations on the cards are not always the classical ones that you may be familiar with. Some of the interpretations were drawn from other cultural sources, and all were adapted to make them suitable for as many different types of stories as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
