			<description>The card game of legendary role playing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role Quest is a light, social role playing card game set in a fantasy town that has been forsaken by the dark elf queen. Players take on the roles of every day characters and roleplay normal or peculiar situations. They must act their hidden personalities well in order to collect goblin heads (victory points) to win the game. Player curses and actions make the game challenging but also hilarious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two rounds. Each round, players move their meeples to one of the available locations, select a roleplay card from their hand and begin a roleplay scene. During the scene they act their character, personality and sometimes a curse. When the time is up, players attempt to guess the personality on the face down roleplay cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
