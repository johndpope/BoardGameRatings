			<description>snip from introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;  The Draw-Place deck face down in center of table.  Each player draws one card at a time.  First one to draw a dynamite card is the dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deal-The cars are dealt one at a time beginning at left.  With two players,  deal seven cards to each.  After all hands are dealt,  dealer turns up the top card and leaves the deck face down beside it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of Play-To get rid of all cards in your hand.  the first player to succeed wins that round and the others must record their score according to the cards left in their hand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name implies,  their are rock,  scissors,  and paper cards.  In addition,  there are dynamite and double take cards,  all of which come in assorted colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The short of it is,  think Rock Scissors Paper meets Uno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
