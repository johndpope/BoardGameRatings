Each level takes place in one of three locations: outside the castle, on the castle steps, and inside the castle proper, with the stage objectives varying between them, such as simply avoiding all enemies while moving across the screen or collecting items such as screws. Players are awarded points for each successful objective they complete, and have three attempts to make it through the game. Short cutscenes appear at the beginning and end of the game, as well as after certain levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chip 'N Dale Rescue Rangers: The Adventure in Nimnul's Castle&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
