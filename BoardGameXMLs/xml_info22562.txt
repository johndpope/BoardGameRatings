			<description>This is part of the Big Deal series of card games by Patch Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players divide the deck evenly and take turns laying out three cards at a time.  If all three cards match by number or symbol, they take the cards, plus any under them, and place them in there score pile.  Sevens are wild and match anything.  If you do not match, your cards stay out there, and the next player plays his three cards on top of them.  The winner is the player with the most point cards when all of the cards are used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
