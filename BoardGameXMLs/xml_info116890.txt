							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vera Cruz</name>
									
			<description>The beginning of the XVI century was of great transformations in the world, previously unknown lands were discovered by European explorers adventurers ... The New World! More than &amp;quot;discover&amp;quot; it was necessary &amp;quot;conquest&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;colonize&amp;quot; ... Live as one of the early settlers who had the mission to transform the Island of Vera Cruz in what we know today as Brazil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vera Cruz is a board game for 2-4 players created by Julio Trois, whose theme is the colonization of Brazil. Each player is a Portuguese colonizer who must establish his colony, planting sugar cane, catechizing or enslaving Indians, to be the 1st to build the Great Mill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics are worker placement, management and trading resources, and variable phase order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
