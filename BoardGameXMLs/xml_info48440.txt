			<description>Cover:&lt;br/&gt;Killing the competition is no longer a figure of speech ...&lt;br/&gt;The boardrooms become war rooms as the movers and shakers shift their fights from the stock exchange to the streets. Using everything from military-scale assaults on ultra-secure company compounds to stealth missions and sabotage, the fat cats have gone to war. Dunkelzahn's will made the head of security for Fuchi Industrial Electronics a voting member of Renraku's board of directors&amp;mdash; and all hell broke loose. Now Fuchi is in a civil war that may destroy the corporation. Renraku is under siege on every front and must turn to an old enemy to survive, as Ares goes on the offensive to purge itself of traitors. Even minor-leaguer Yamatetsu must fight its way out of Japan when a metahuman takes over the helm.&lt;br/&gt;The most desired asset in this upheaval Isn't a stack of stocks or a portfolio of investments, but a professional shadowrun team willing to keep its mouth shut and do the job.&lt;br/&gt;As the blood flows from the boardroom into the shadows, it's a gamble to choose the winning side&amp;mdash;because no runner wants to end up on the bottom of this pile.&lt;br/&gt;Blood In the Boardroom covers the events of two years of clashing megacorporations and corporate civil war. This Shadowrun adventure offers gamemasters the opportunity to easily tailor a non-linear story tine to their group's specific interests and style of play. It provides everything gamemasters need to involve their players' characters in, the corporate war. Intended for gamemasters and players of all experience levels. For use with Shadowrun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
