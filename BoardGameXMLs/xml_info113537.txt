			<description>From the publisher's catalogue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VROENHOVEN, BELGIUM, 11 May 1940: By mid-afternoon of 10 May, infantry elements of the 4th Panzer Division took over the bridgehead at Vroenhoven, relieving the exhausted paratroopers. During the evening, the infantry pushed west to free the main road and north to join with the Velwezelt bridgehead. Two platoons of the 2nd Company were all that remained of the Belgian troops near the Vroenhoven Bridge. On the morning of the 11th, the Germans started to attack towards the south to completely secure the bridge area. As the lead panzer elements were crossing the bridge, three Fairey Battle aircraft of the Belgian 5&amp;Euml;me Escadrille appeared over the Albert Canal and began a bombing run against the bridge. Because their initial mission was to bomb wooden footbridges, the planes were loaded with puny 50kg bombs instead of the more potent 250kg bombs normally available. Lead by Captain Glorie, the three Battles made a first bombing run though withering anti-aircraft fire. Due to either the wounding of the observer or a malfunction of the bomb release system, Battle number T-70 of Captain Glorie, followed by the T-63 of Adjudant Delvigne, turned about and made a second run. Both were shot down after hitting the bridge. Une vaine mission de sacrifice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to FACING THE BLITZ, an updated edition of the Albert Canal map and scenarios that were included in CH 7/1. A second edition map was printed after the initial print run was sold out and is included with this version. No worries, if you already own the map, a 'no map' edition is also being made available so you can get the new counters and updated scenarios and save some cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
