							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Termites</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Termites are a lowly gang of urban survivors, considered to be the underdogs of most of the gangs that claim turf in the ruined metropolis in which this rag tag bunch dwells. While The Termites have managed to hold their own turf thus far, their ranks are on a gradual decline, spelling out a potential threat for their continued existence as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group is currently led by Pigeon, an initially reluctant leader who was at one time part of another city gang. After Pigeon's allies were wasted in a bloody turf war, Pigeon wandered into the area controlled by The Termites. He was able to prove himself worthy of being part of their group. Pigeon quickly rose up through the ranks of the gang due to his fighting skills, and was considered to be a valuable soldier of The Termites' cause just after a handful of skirmishes with rival gangs and would be invading nomads. Pigeon took on the role of leadership a short time after the death of the gang's original leader, Crud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
