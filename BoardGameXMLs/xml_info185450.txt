							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Teams: Avalon&#039;s Ideal</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all antagonists are villains. Some are misguided heroes. A group of devoted fans to a missing superhero attempt to live up to their idol by putting on super hero costumes, taking dangerous super soldier drugs, and hitting the streets to fight crime. Too bad those illegal super soldier drugs are expensive, so they take to raiding abandoned bases so they can afford to power up. They want to do good but they can't separate the heroes from the villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon's Ideal presents a rival team of base raiders who are trying to live up to the standards of the superhero Avalon. By giving themselves superpowers and assembling a team of devoted fans, they think they can fill the gap left by the missing hero. They are mostly untrained and have rather dogmatic views about good and evil. They could become fanatical zealots or great heroes, depending on who they meet and how they are treated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement stats out the three leaders of the team and gives an adventure seed, showing how they can be used. If you need more antagonists to throw at your players in a Base Raiders game, look no further!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
