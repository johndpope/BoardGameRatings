			<description>At the beginning of each round, a new pool of VP tokens is added. The number of VP tokens in said pool is determined by a dice roll (2d6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the start player, players take turns taking one of the four cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They then play them simultaneously, with either the green or the red side face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who played the highest value of red becomes the start player next round. All other players who played red gets nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then starting with the player who played the highest value of green, players get to take the number of VP from each separate pool equal to the value of the green card that he played. This continues in descending order of the value of the green cards played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pool/s with leftover VPs are left as is going into the next round. (So theoretically there could be any number of pools for each round. If the pools have 6, 4, and 3 tokens, and the highest green played was 4, that player gets to grab 4, 4, and 3 tokens from each pool respectively before anyone else gets to grab anything. Yes it's broken. That's why being the start player is important.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
