			<description>Vinegar Joe's War: CBI (China-Burma-India Theater of Operations) is a wargame of the World War II campaign in Southeast Asia: Malaya, Burma, Indochina and adjoining areas of India and China. In that campaign the Japanese overran Malaya, captured the strategic British base of Singapore and conquered Burma. Later campaigns saw the Japanese-Allied struggle for the Indian Frontier, the deployment of the Chindits, and the final Japanese grasp during the Imphal campaign, followed by the Allied counter-attack that won victory in the theater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBI is intended to be a simple game: it allows for the completion of the entire four year campaign within 16 turns.  It includes all critical operations, however: land and air warfare, special operations and logistical considerations. The game has two players: the Allied and the Japanese.  Players conduct operations with their units in their own turns. The objective of the game is to capture strategic locales and destroy enemy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game scale: Each map hex equals 60 kilometers. Each turn represents three months of operations. Each airstrike represents one or two British wings, US groups or Japanese air regiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes three scenarios. Scenario 1, &amp;quot;Singapore to Calcutta&amp;quot; is the campaign game, 1941 - 1945 (16 turns). Scenario 2 covers the last Japanese offensive in Southeast Asia: &amp;quot;Imphal&amp;quot;. Scenario 3 is a short scenario entitled &amp;quot;Fall of an Empire&amp;quot; and covers only the first few turns of the war, through the 1942-III turn. In addition there are two scenario variants, &amp;quot;Operation Zipper&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Historic Withdrawals&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
