							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golfer&#039;s Dominoes</name>
									
			<description>Golfer's Dominoes is a companion set to Dr. Miller's Golf Ace, with similar packaging and somewhat jocular, quirky rules, but there the similarity ends. Dominoes is, mechanically, a much simpler game, based on playing the most advantageous domino depicting one of seven possible golfing situations, from your hand of 4. The 28 dominoes are made of stiffened card and bear simple cartoon-style drawings of a golf ball lying on the fairway, beside a bunker, in a bunker, beside water, in water, beside the hole and in the hole. The player managing to place legitimately an &amp;quot;in the hole&amp;quot; domino with no hazard domino showing on any of the four ends of the pattern wins the hole.  There is no counting of &amp;quot;strokes&amp;quot;. The victor is simply the one who wins most holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
