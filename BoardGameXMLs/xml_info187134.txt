			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifth edition of the game utilizes several resolution tables for combat and actions.  The core rules are designed partially to support any genre (e.g., generic and universal) but the clear focus of the game is on the super-hero action genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game have Attributes (Strength, Charisma, etc.) that have an associated numeric Power Level from 0 to 8 (humans typically have a 1 in every Attribute).  Characters also have Skills--the rules offer sample Skills but it is assumed the players will create their own lists.  Characters also may have Advantages and Disadvantages, and if the super-hero genre is being utilized then characters may have (or later develop) super-powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action resolution utilizes a pool of d6, with the number of dice being equal to the Power Level of the appropriate Ability or Skill or Power.  The roll is summed and compared to a target Difficulty Number assigned by the Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
