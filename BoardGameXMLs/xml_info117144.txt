			<description>Flinke Flieger is a racing game played in rounds between two teams (or two players). Each round, two players (one from each team) race each other, trying to deliver an egg to their team's nest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the round, each player receives a seagull on a stick, which he has to hold by the stick during the race. The seagulls have a backpack, in which a flat paper egg is placed. Now, a spinner is spun, determining the special conditions for this round: it may be a straightforward race, or there may be special conditions, such as the players being required to run backwards or to spin twice before delivering the egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player drops his egg, he is out of the race for that round. If both players succesfully deliver their eggs, the fastest player's team receives an additional egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until fewer than three undelivered eggs remain at the beginning of a round. Now, players inspect their eggs by flipping them over to see which ones &amp;quot;hatch&amp;quot;. (Those that hatch have a chick painted on the back.) The team with the most chicks wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
