							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Characters, Volume One</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab a Character and Get Savage!&lt;br/&gt;The Savage Characters series utilizes the Savage Worlds Deluxe game engine to present TWENTY ORIGINAL CHARACTERS.  Each character is defined with a rich background, full body portrait, full stats as a Legendary figure, the complete build path to play them at whatever experience level you choose, and five adventure ideas (one for each rank).  Used together, these friends and foes, PCs and NPCs present entwined histories and related adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are grouped into four Dragonlaird Gaming settings with five characters in each setting.  The settings are original but the characters could be easily used in other games of the haunted west, fantasy, modern horror, or space opera genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Ages &amp;amp; Dragon Gods: A beautiful traveling noblewoman hides a secret life as the larcenous Lady of Red Silk.  Out of love, a grizzled mercenary from Moorish Iberia keeps the noblewoman safe  A priest of the Dragon God with a secret carries out the will of the Roman Draconic Church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demon Streets &amp;amp; Made Men: A nightmare from another dimension controls one of the Five Families and plots to consume New York City into a soulless Hell. A hideous creature skulks in shadows, influencing minds and enacting the schemes of its master.  A Catholic made man for the Romanos learns of the growing darkness and vows to protect his city from Satan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Lands &amp;amp; Sixguns: A mad scientist performs twisted experiments in a hidden lair in the Sierra Mountains.  An American Black Bear is made intelligent by science and takes up a gun and crime.  A heartless thug parlays violence and schemes into rule of the town of Miasma Springs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theta Ships &amp;amp; Iron Men: A disgraced captain of the Royal Stellar Navy hunts the creature who stole his flagship from him.  An alien bounty hunter burdened with a rigid moral code travels the Galaxy after criminals.  A spy for the ancient Spironetti Empire seeks to rock the foundations of her own people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are a Gamemaster using these characters and adventures to enrich your campaign world or a player looking for a different sort of character, Savage Characters is sure to Fire Up Your Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
