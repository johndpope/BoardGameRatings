			<description>This game was produced by a commercial ad agency as its contribution to the Singapore National Council Against Drug Abuse, as part of the Partnership for a Drug Free Singapore programme. Essentially applying the mechanics of the game, Snap, the game uses 60 cards (4 each of 15 designs) with illustrations of grotesque and pitiful creatures that have succumbed to the evils of drug abuse. Each card comes with a little rhyme detailing the sad fate of its character - for example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAK THE RABBIT&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I wish you peace&amp;quot; said Mak the rabbit.&lt;br/&gt;His friends gave him drugs,&lt;br/&gt;Now he can't kick the habit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are dealt out evenly to each player and players take turns to reveal a card from their stack. When two cards of the same design are seen, the first player to shout &amp;quot;NABBED!&amp;quot; gets to keep both stacks of upturned cards adding all of them face down to the bottom of his/her stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of the agency providing the concept and design of the game was WORK - no individual designer was indentified. The illustrations are credited to Theseus Chan and the rhymes to Jim Aitchison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partnership for a Drug Free Singapore programme began earlier in 2002 and featured the characters in a series of cartoons with anti-drug rhymes. The card game was published in 2004 and was distributed in schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
