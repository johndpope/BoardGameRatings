							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Loved</name>
									
			<description>I wanted to build something confrontational, that would engage players to give thought to what they are doing both in and out of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result is Loved - a short story in the form of a flash platformer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer's Description from Kongregate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Loved is standard platformer fare: move here, jump over there, don't land in the spikes. Sometimes there are save points. In this case, there's nothing to collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this platforming is experienced simultaneously with a disembodied speaker who sometimes gives you commands. And depending on how you respond, this voice will react in different ways. And you might start to see the world in a somewhat different way. And this trifecta-gameplay, narration, and effect-develop the short story that the designer talks about in his description of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trigger warning: abusive (but not vulgar) language and abusive relationships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
