			<description>The object of the game is to be the first player to collect three blue monster discs. At each turn, a player spins the spinner and moves his diver down the safety line the number of spaces which was spun. If he lands on an empty space he may move a disc on his safety line to any empty space on his line. Or he may move one of his opponents discs to any empty space along that player's safety line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
