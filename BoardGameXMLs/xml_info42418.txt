			<description>There are 72 large strawberries displayed on the game board. Each player has two wooden bears and places them on one of the berries. Little wooden pieces (or, if you prefer, gummibears etc.) are placed on all other strawberries. These pieces come in three colors, worth 1, 2 and 3 points respectively (of course, if you use candy, you can choose your own preference of colors). The players roll one die and move one of their bears 1-6 berries in a straight line (the strawberries form kind of a hex grid). If you cannot move because you are blocked by other bears or by the end of the game board, you have to pay one of your pieces. Otherwise, you pick up the piece on the berry you end your move on, if there still is any. Game ends when there are no more pieces to be found (or, for a shorter game, only 10 left) or everyone has eaten enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
