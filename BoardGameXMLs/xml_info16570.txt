			<description>This game, endorsed by Lucille Ball, is a nine-hole tabletop miniature golf course. The course is molded plastic, complete with trees and water hazards. Some holes have special obstacles such as a tunnel, bridge, and a waterwheel. Everything slopes down to the center where a small golfer stands. He is controlled from the side of the board using a knob to pivot him in the direction you want, and a lever that swings his club. On your turn you place a metal ball in the depression in front of the golfer, aim him at the hole you're playing and shoot the ball. If you miss, the ball will drain down the slope and back into the depression. The player who finishes the course in the fewest strokes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
