			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The life of an adventurer is not always fun and gold, sometimes it's bleak.  For Theron Sternwood and friends, life has taken a turn for the worse.  When their fortunes are told, they discover they have no future.  Turning to the Temple of Istus and the goddess of divination for help they find their fate in jeopardy for the &amp;quot;Voice of Istus&amp;quot; has grown silent in death.  They must find the former &amp;quot;Voice of Istus&amp;quot; and get her to take up her duties again if they are to have a future.  But to win back their lives, the heroes must seek misfortune in the hidden temple of Ralishaz, the god of ill chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ill Omens presents a prelude to the new The Lost Tombs adventure series predicting that doom lies on the horizon for Greyhawk.  But here, too, are clues to how that future may be avoided, and there are clues about the dangers the heroes will face in the coming days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario uses resources presented in The Adventure Begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
