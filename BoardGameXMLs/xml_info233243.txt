			<description>A card game based on the Science Fiction novel by A.E. van Vogt. Players meld cards to complete adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck. The deck has 10 suits: Ship, Crew, Location, Alien, Power, Politics, Trick, Equipment, Investigation, Naxialism.  There are 20-23 cards in each suit. Each suit has a unique ability which can be activated during the action phase.  For example a Ship card can be used to draw 2 cards from the deck, a Crew card allows you to search the discard for 1 card etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw 2 cards from the deck and put them in your hand.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You may play (discard 1 card from your hand) to activate its ability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolution Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If you have 1 card from each of the 10 suits in your hand, you may make an adventure meld.  Place the meld in a pile beside you. &lt;br/&gt;     If you made a meld draw 10 new cards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logistics Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Max hand size is 10 cards. discard excess cards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete 4 adventure melds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
