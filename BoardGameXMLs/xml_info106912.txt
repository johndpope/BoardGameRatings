			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your heart pounds as you maneuver toward the fearsome Stone Ogre.  Ducking under the wide arc cut by its huge axe...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Captivating World...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Experience the thrill of battle.  Aim every blow, feel every wound, and discover the fatigue that can be as lethal as a swordblow.&lt;br/&gt;     Meet the fascinating residents of Ashtalarea.  Learn their faces, listen to their stories.  They all have their own tale to tell.&lt;br/&gt;     Prepare for the elements - the harsh rains and blizzards are as dangerous to your company as a band of vicious Cliff Trolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...with Bold Adventurers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Become a brawny Krag Barbarian, a stalwart Tegal Amazon, or a winged Kelden Far Seeker.  Choose from four races and more than 40 different classes.&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure with up to six companions, chosen from any characters you've created - or invite your friends to join you with their own.&lt;br/&gt;     Watch your characters suit up for battle, choosing from hundreds of combinations of weapons and armor.&lt;br/&gt;     Learn spells from a master sorcerer, then change them to suit your needs - the power of a spell, its effect, its range, even its name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...is Only the Beginning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In this box, you'll explore the expansive Realm of Ashtalarea, but the innovative modular design of Knights of Legend allows the development of future realms of adventure.&lt;br/&gt;     Hundreds of unique quests and subquests, with their own challenges and rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
