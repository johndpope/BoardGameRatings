			<description>Tumble-Numbers is an interesting dice game similar to Shut the Box except that instead of a box with fixed numbers (1 to 9), it uses a set of ten red six-sided dice with non-standard numbers (as high as 10 and including blanks) to generate the numbers that have to be eliminated by rolling a pair of ordinary green six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blanks can be used to represent any positive number but must always be removed together with another red die not showing a blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player keeps on rolling the green dice and removing red dice that add up to the total on the green dice at each turn. When the player cannot do this, they take the sum on the remaining red dice as their penalty score (blanks count 20 points). When the player manages to get rid of all red dice, they subtract 10 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player reaches 100 points or more, he/she has to drop out. The last surviving player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
