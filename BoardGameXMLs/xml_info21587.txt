							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Voyage au c≈ìur de Lyon</name>
									
			<description>In this game, players will each have a personal profile indicating which parts of the city of Lyon they must explore in order to win (ie: the sportsman will have to visit stadiums...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is then a classical roll-and-move where depending on the place your pawn is, you will have to answer special questions about the history and the city of Lyon.&lt;br/&gt;When a player has visited all of his 5 destinations, he needs to rush back to place Bellecour (biggest square in Europe), first one there wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is entirely bilingual, questions are both in French and English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
