							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Victory Decision: Future Combat â€“ Rival Species</name>
									
			<description>Rival Species is the first expansion for Victory Decision: Future Combat and focuses on genetically engineered alien threats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some alien races engineer and grow all of their technology organically. This could be due to viewing mechanical technology as blasphemy or the species could be a predatory culture with no higher goals than the propagation of their species and the destruction of any other life that could pose a threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Bio-Engineered force is not governed by a strict military structure in the way other races are. The group intelligence of the Bio-Engineered Aliens allows them to integrate a huge amount of hordes until their armies become immense forces, crushing any resistance that crosses its path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rival Species brings you a complete army list, new Special Rules like an additional Overwatch Action, new Psi Powers, new Abilities and Weapon Features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A copy of the Victory Decision: Future Combat rulebook is necessary to fully use the content of this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
