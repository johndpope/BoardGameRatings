							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ozzy Versus The Universe Part I - Demons of Topaz</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ozzy, lone and intrepid space traveller and keen exponent of the deadly Sonic Triang explores the seemingly endless depths of the dreaded asteroid, Topaz, searching for the seven jewels he needs to re-energise his ageing spacecraft. But can he survive a confrontation with the Demon Guardians - who slowly awaken to avenge the destruction of the Sacred Crystals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was the first release from the Firebird Gold label. The game was written by schoolboy Andrew Bailey in just a couple of weeks. The boomerang weapon inspired the name of the main character &amp;quot;Ozzy&amp;quot;. A sequel was planned but never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
