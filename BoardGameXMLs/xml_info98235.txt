							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Videocart-13: Robot War, Torpedo Alley</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field at the start of play contains 1 man, 4 robots and 4 electric force fields. No play can start until the man is moved. When this is done by moving the right hand controller ... the robots begin their pursuit. If during the chase, a robot collides with an electric force field the robot is destroyed. If the robot catches collides with the man, one&lt;br/&gt;force field is removed and the robot is repositioned randomly somewhere on the screen. (If two robots collide one is repositioned randomly).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robots are controlled by the computer and stalk the man automatically; however, if a 2nd player wishes he may over-ride the computer by simply moving his controller. In so doing the 2nd player moves the whole group of robots in unison.  He can also return control to the computer by releasing his controller knob in which case the computer again controls the robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One point is scored by the winner of a round. If all robots are destroyed by being lured into the electronic force fields the man scores 1 point. If the man is caught 4 times (all the electric force fields disappear) the robots win 1 point. A game can be comprised of several rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torpedo Alley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field appearing on your TV consists of two guns-- lower left and right; a field of mines-- center screen; and 3 rows of ships moving across the screen. The bottom row of ships is moving the fastest, the middle row slower and the top row the slowest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players can position their respective guns left or right by moving their hand controller left or right. They also can change the angle of the barrel by twisting left or right. Firing the gun is done by pushing down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a ship on the lower level is hit 1 point is scored for the player who fired the shot. The 2nd row of ships is worth 3 points and the top row is worth 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
