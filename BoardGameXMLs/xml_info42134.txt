							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Byzantine Kingamon</name>
									
			<description>Byzantine Kingamon is an adaptation of Backgammon for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game, with a couple of little twists thrown in, one of which is from Byzantine Chess.  Play is nearly identical to Backgammon; however each player also has a king that move like any other piece.  You must keep your king safe, though, because if your king gets captured, you lose the game.  There are a few other subtle differences from Backgammon, such as requiring exact rolls in order to bear pieces off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As is typical for Richard Hutnik's designs, there are numerous variants offered up, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
