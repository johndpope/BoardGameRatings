			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of 5th Edition fantasy, a character&amp;rsquo;s choice of background represents where he or she came from, and better defines a character&amp;rsquo;s place and role in the world of the game. Selecting a background provides a player with important hints and clues as to how best to portray their character in action, as well as outfitting the GM with hooks to hang important plot developments on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, a player&amp;rsquo;s choice of background may equip his or her character with useful skills, proficiencies, and other features as well as providing a basis for his or her personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws &amp;ndash; all important pieces of the inspiration system. Contained herein are four backgrounds for members of the working class: the Everyman, the Farmhand, the Journeyman, and the Village Idiot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
