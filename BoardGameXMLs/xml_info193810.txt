			<description>From the inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Football. Nominated as &amp;quot;Coach of the Year&amp;quot; last year, you have the freedom of coaching any of the premier American Football teams. Your price? Well it's difficult to say, but one thing is sure, the team you will coach will give you a pre-season working capital of $250,000. What you do with it is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the game: select your squad; beat the transfer market; beat the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you have to do is field the best team at the best time and make money! If you're good enough, then win the Superbowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's lookin' at ya, kid ... Go for it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very simple management game. The programmers either had a poor understanding of American Football or had to significantly simplify in order to fit within the limitations of 8-bit computers. The player is asked to select one of two divisions, each of eight teams. In 1984, the NFL was actually made up of 28 teams across 6 divisions, so many teams are not depicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The management consists of buying players on the transfer market (taking bank loans if required) and then swapping members of your team before the match to balance skill, energy and morale. You have 11 players on your team and 4 in reserve. There is no concept of different positions, offence or defence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has no control over the matches, the game simply shows highlights. Only a passing game is depicted, and only touchdowns are scored (for which 7 points are awarded - there is no kicking of extra points). No field goals are shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Position in the league is based on the British system of 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss, rather than the American system of Win-Loss-Tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
