							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Cent: Bulletproof</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;50 Cent: Bulletproof is a video game for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox platforms. It was developed in response to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas after 50 Cent was asked to voice the game's protagonist Carl &amp;quot;CJ&amp;quot; Johnson with 50 Cent stating that he will only voice himself in video games. The game was reworked into a PlayStation Portable version and titled 50 Cent: Bulletproof G Unit Edition, with a top-down perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The titular protagonist is hip hop musician 50 Cent playing himself. The story revolves around 50 Cent's search for vengeance, hunting down the hitmen that attempted to murder him. The game also features Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks, and Young Buck, members of the G-Unit rap crew, as 50's gang. Dr. Dre plays an arms dealer, Eminem plays a corrupt police officer, and DJ Whoo Kid playing as himself as a person selling &amp;quot;bootlegged&amp;quot; music (of the G-Unit camp) out of his trunk. There is also a video game soundtrack album available titled, Bulletproof, and released by DJ Red Heat's Shadyville Entertainment. It also won &amp;quot;Best Original Song&amp;quot; in the 2005 Spike TV Video Game Awards. A sequel, 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand, was released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G-Unit edition&lt;br/&gt;On August 29, 2006, Vivendi Games released a G-Unit edition for the PlayStation Portable. While the story and cutscenes are the same as the console counterpart, the game eschews the third-person perspective gameplay for a top-down, isometric viewpoint. Also added is multiplayer gameplay through ad hoc wireless connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
