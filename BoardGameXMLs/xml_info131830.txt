			<description>DAM IT the River Conquest Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great strategy board game DAM IT takes place on a grand river system. With your crew of skilled beavers you will be charged with the task of damming rivers that legends say can&amp;rsquo;t be dammed. To make matters worse your enemies on the other team will be fighting for the same goal. A good balance of military strategy and well placed dams will be the key to your success. To master this game you will have to use strategy, team work, and just a little bit of luck. During game play you and your team will be faced with tough choices, but don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to get wet just make sure you can swim. DAM IT Two Sides&amp;hellip; As the game begins, six beaver tribes march onto the battlefield. The Red, Green, and Yellow tribes form the Honored Beaver Alliance, fighting for peace, justice, and wood. The tribes of Blue, Black, and Purple unite to form the Midnight Warriors, fighting to protect the homeland of their ancestors. One Battle&amp;hellip; There is an uneasy calm as both teams face each other from across the river. Each tribe raises its flag as the architects discuss their building strategy. The kings stand nobly to ensure victory, and out of the silence comes the command of a warrior: &amp;ldquo;Charge!&amp;rdquo; One River. There can be only one victor, the team with the will to Dam It.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Dam It is a team game that can be played by 2 players, 4 players or 6 players. Games involving 4 or 6 players are always played in teams. There are 4 ways to win. &lt;br/&gt;(1)_eliminate the kings of opposing players &lt;br/&gt;(2)_capture the dens of opposing players &lt;br/&gt;(3)_dam the end of the main channel river and control it for 6 consecutive allied turns; and &lt;br/&gt;(4)_control 50 or more worker beavers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game time: approximately 1 hour&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: It&amp;rsquo;s important to spend 10-15 minutes, or so reading the rules carefully. The more time you spend learning the rules, the more fluid and enjoyable the game will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five types of beavers &lt;br/&gt;1. Worker beavers &lt;br/&gt;2. Flag beaver &lt;br/&gt;3. Warrior beaver &lt;br/&gt;4. Architect beaver &lt;br/&gt;5. King beaver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dam It, each beaver serves a different purpose and has unique skills. All +1s and +2s are numbers added to die rolls during the combat phase. The combat abilities of these beavers are summarized on the reference sheet under &amp;ldquo;Combat Statistics&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Worker beavers comprise the bulk of your team. These beavers are easily persuaded. These beavers can collect wood and may be led into battle. The red and blue chips are used to represent the worker beavers of each team. &lt;br/&gt;2. A Flag beaver is an elite beaver that has been trained to repel attacks. To represent this, he is given a +2 while defending. This is the beaver holding a flag. &lt;br/&gt;3. A Warrior beaver is an elite beaver that has been trained in the art of war. To represent this he is given a +2 while attacking. This is the beaver with a Mohawk or with a Viking helmet (for early editions the warrior is also represented by: muscles, snorkel, eye patch, and hair). &lt;br/&gt;4. An Architect beaver is an elite beaver that has studied his/her whole life to become the leader in dam construction. This beaver must be present to construct dams. If the Architect beaver is eliminated, that player can not build dams. This is the beaver holding a book. &lt;br/&gt;5. A King beaver is an elite beaver that is cautious and effective in his war tactics. To represent this he is given a +1 while attacking and a +1 while defending. If this beaver is eliminated from the game, then all other elite beavers from that player are also eliminated, and that player&amp;rsquo;s turn is skipped for the rest of the game. This beaver is the one with a crown on his head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
