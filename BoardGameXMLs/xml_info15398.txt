			<description>Fight Dice is a freely downloadable PDF-based dice based combat system adapted for action figure battles.  Players allocate (six-sided) dice from a pool for each action figure to allow for movement and/or combat.  Combat consists of sets of dice rolled for attack and defense (as allocated,) defense dice that are equal or higher cancel attack dice, the number of remaining attack dice are removed from the defender's dice pool.  Movement is one inch for each die allocated to movement.  Advanced rules allow for enhanced movement/range mechanics, foreign objects, grappling, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game guidelines state that a standard human gets 8 dice, a martial artist 20 and a Gundam Fighter gets 36.  Players are encouraged to use their imagination to assign values to action figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
