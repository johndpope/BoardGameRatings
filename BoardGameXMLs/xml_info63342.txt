							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Behind the Eyes of Madness</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanity is a thin sheet of ice that we all walk upon.  Beneath us, the cold, black, endless depths of madness await.  One false step could cause the ice to crack.  For some of us, the cracks have been growing slowly, for years, and no matter how carefully we step it is only a matter of time.  Encounter the wrong person on the wrong night, and suddenly you're plunged into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As city dwellers, we are keenly aware of the madness beneath us.  We see the homeless crazies ranting on the streets, pulled so far down that they can no longer even see the light of the surface.  We've seen friends drowning, threatening to pull us down with them when we tried to save them.  We've lived in families where people spent desperate lives trapped just below the surface, able to see it but never able to break through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you avoid falling in?  Will you fail, but succeed in maintaining some sort of half-life, some tenuous connection to the human race?  Will you keep sinking down ever deeper until what you once were is gone from sight forever?  Or will you be one of the rare few who are able to flail and scratch and pull themselves back out of madness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind the Eyes of Madness is the first sourcebook in the After Midnight series. After Midnight explores the bizarre, the mysterious and the terrifying things that one can encounter on the streets of the city before dawn.  Behind the Eyes of Madness features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The most complete and realistic rules for mental illness ever; allowing PCs to go insane, be insane and fight their way back to health.&lt;br/&gt;     Mentally ill homeless &amp;quot;crazies&amp;quot; as a playable character class.&lt;br/&gt;     In-depth background information on mental illness and health in city society.&lt;br/&gt;     In-depth info on sex, religion and politics and how they can help or hurt mental health.&lt;br/&gt;     Profiles of molesters, arsonists, serial killers, rapists and other psychologically motivated criminals.&lt;br/&gt;     New information on Colin, including the terrible secrets of his past.&lt;br/&gt;     New bonus characteristics, skills, equipment and disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;     Two complete adventures: &amp;quot;My Friend Jim&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Bride of Colin&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
