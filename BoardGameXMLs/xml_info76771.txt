			<description>The NES Max is a first-party controller that was released by Nintendo in 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The controller featured a &amp;quot;cycloid&amp;quot; in the center of an 8-direction D-Pad &amp;quot;ring.&amp;quot; This simulated a joystick however it did not have analog response and was more of a way for a player to push the d-pad in a certain direction in a more fine-tuned manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also featured 2 &amp;quot;turbo&amp;quot; buttons for A and B, which simulated the respective button being pushed in rapid succession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
