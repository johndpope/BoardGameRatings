							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 2 – Spitfire Mk. IX</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spitfire Mk. IX was designed and developed to compete with the Focke Wulf FW-190 which in some regards could out-perform and out-climb previous Spitfire versions. The Mark IX was based on the Mark V airframe with the addition of the new generation of Merlin engines allowed this aircraft to duel with the deadly German enemy. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft included George &amp;quot;The Falcon of Malta&amp;quot; Beurling, Johnnie Johnson and Stanisław Skalski. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. Larger maneuver cards (63 x 88 mm) are included with this model, to handle the fast movement of this airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
