			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;POOR VICTOR -- HE'S OLD NOW. THIS MONSTER MUST BE STOPPED!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1940, inspired by the great novel Frankenstein and the 1939 film Son of Frankenstein, Dick Briefer brought the immortal tale of science gone wrong to the pages of Prize Comics magazine. In doing so, he created what historians name as the first ongoing horror series in comic books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2015 is the 75th anniversary of the debut of Briefer's New Adventures of Frankenstein. In celebration, NUELOW Games is releasing a series of books featuring the best of the 100+ Frankenstein stories that Briefer wrote and illustrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In NUELOW Games' New Adventures of Frankenstein: The Monster vs. Bulldog Denny, Briefer moves beyond the novel and movie that first inspired him, as one of the victims of the monster's evil rampages grows up to be its tireless nemesis. The book pickes up where the first in the series left off, and brings you four action-packed spine-tinglers as only Dick Briefer could create!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the classic comics, New Adventures of Frankenstein: The Monster vs. Bulldog Denny, contains a universal roleplaying game supplement that gives gamemasters a quick way to flesh out minions of evil masterminds like the Monster whom pesky players decide to spy on or take a liking to instead of simply mowing them down as expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
