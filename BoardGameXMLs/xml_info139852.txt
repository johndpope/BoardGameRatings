			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a tunnel collapses in the Dul'Urich Underkingdom, Prince Dwalin is sent to find a fabled pass in the north.  Several days later his bloodguard returns beaten and malnourished claiming the prince and his band became dull of wit and disappeared sometime in the night.  The news bodes heavily on the underking's heart and he entrusts his herald the task of finding his son.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the characters.  Herald Gal'kut hires you to find the prince.  This is no easy task, as the prince's path lies over the Laridian Wastes - an area teeming with harpies and hell hounds.  Even if you think you're ready to find them, think again.  Someone powerful has found them first, and if he succeeds in his foul plans the world will never be the same again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
