			<description>Mash the buttons along with your opponents in this exciting 2-4 player dice game that emulates playing an old school fighting game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you remember the glory days of arcades; walking into that dimly lit building, the buzzing lights and distractingly repetitive tunes fighting one another, vying for your attention?  I recall fondly how my shoes fought for every step as the floor clung stickily to them and feeding my quarter into the arcade machine only to watch it disappear and the machine not reading it. Do you recall the days of getting really good at your favorite game and taking on any challenger; and then getting destroyed by that one person who didn&amp;rsquo;t know what they were doing, and kept hitting the same button over and over again?  Well ... welcome to Button Mashers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Button Mashers is a 2-4 player dice game where players take turns rolling dice, and match the results to their character's special moves to deal damage to their opponent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
