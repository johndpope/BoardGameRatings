			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;◦Realization of the bus line M42 along the famous 42nd Street in Manhattan, New York. Beyond that, many side streets and different scenarios offer a lot of variety &lt;br/&gt;◦Famous buildings and places of interest along and nearby the route such as the Times Square, Chrysler Building, Grand Central Station, Circle Line, Intrepid and of course the Port Authority Bus Terminal as well as each and every house on 42nd Street which have all been realistically recreated.&lt;br/&gt;◦The &amp;quot;City Bus Simulator&amp;quot; uses a physics engine to create a realistic simulation. &lt;br/&gt;◦3 game modes: Virtual world (incl. driving to schedule), missions, campaign.&lt;br/&gt;◦Interactive tutorial (optional).&lt;br/&gt;◦Complete route incl. side streets which are explorable from the very beginning (with the exception of the tutorial).&lt;br/&gt;◦The player slips into the role of &amp;quot;Carlos&amp;quot;, bus driver in Manhattan &lt;br/&gt;◦Character is animated and controllable using keyboard and mouse. &lt;br/&gt;◦Ego- or 3rd person view can be selected; voice output with subtitles (can be switched on/off)&lt;br/&gt;◦We have a typical New York City Bus in operation as well as a drivable service vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
