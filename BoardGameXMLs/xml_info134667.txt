			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT&amp;rsquo;S GOING ON?&lt;br/&gt;There just isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy way to tell someone that a Viral Epidemic has wiped out most of mankind. We know a little more then we did when it started. It has a long incubation period where you feel fine but are contagious as hell. Then you started getting really thirsty, and no matter how much you try to drink, your body just can&amp;rsquo;t hold onto any of it and in a few days you die of dehydration. Thats why the Koreans called it the Water Virus.&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SURVIVOR&lt;br/&gt;You're The Survivor, on a long solo hike through the wilderness. You've had no contact with the outside world since before the Epidemic started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As The Survivor, it is your job to tell the truth about how you survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
