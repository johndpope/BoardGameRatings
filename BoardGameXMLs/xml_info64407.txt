			<description>The first player to correctly answer one question of each color and then answer the Final Question correctly wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.      The current player (Player A) rolls the die, and then moves that number of spaces on the board. Player A must move clockwise around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.      If the player lands on a white space, he acts as directed by the space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.      If the player lands on a colored space, the person to the right of the current player (Player D) draws a card from the corresponding colored card pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.      Player D slowly and clearly reads the question on the card to Player A and sets the timer for 60 seconds after reading the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.      Player A has 60 seconds to work out the correct answer to the question. While Player A is working, the other players may also work out the correct answer to the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the 60-second period, Player D asks Player A for the answer. If correct, Player A keeps the question card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If incorrect, Player D asks the Player B to answer. If correct, Player B keeps the question card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If incorrect, Player D asks Player C to answer. If correct, Player C keeps the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If incorrect, the card is added back to the bottom of the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.      Play then moves to the next player, repeating steps 1-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player has collected one card of each color, instead of rolling the die, she announces &amp;ldquo;Final question, please.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to her right draws a card from the Final Question stack. He slowly and clearly reads the question on the card and then sets the timer for two minutes after reading the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the two-minute period, the player is asked for her answer. If correct, the player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If incorrect, the card is added back to the bottom of the stack and play continues for the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
