							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sen-Tens cards</name>
									
			<description>Sen-Tens cards is a card game where each player makes &amp;quot;headline-style&amp;quot;  sentences using the cards in their hand as well as the cards available in the community pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets four cards, and four cards are set in the middle.  On each turn a player makes a sentence, which is scored by adding the numbers on each card in the sentence.  When complete, the cards are set aside, and the community cards are replaced from the deck for the next player in turn.  Play continues until someone cannot make a sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
