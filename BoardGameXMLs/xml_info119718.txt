			<description>Air-Sea War is a two-player game with player one controlling an aeroplane which is constantly moving from the right to the left of the screen while trying to drop bombs onto a boat controlled by player two, which is moving from left to right, and trying to fire missiles up at the plane. Both the bombs and missiles can be controlled after firing. There are also two neutral craft in the water. A point is added for each hit on the enemy, and one is deducted for each hit on a neutral craft, although scores never go negative. The player with the most points at the end of three minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle is also a two-player game, in which each player controls a tank around walls and mines, with the aim being to fire the most shots on your opponent's tank in three minutes, a point is deducted for hitting a mine, but scores never drops below zero. Multiple modes could be chosen with differing layouts of walls, the option of having mines or not and an option of walls absorbing or rebounding shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Air-Sea War - Battle (Videopac game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
