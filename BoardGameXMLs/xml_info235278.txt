							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kobolds are People Too!</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A silver dragon has been secretly working on an unusual project: the betterment of a tribe of kobolds that live on the slopes of his mountain. Progress has been slow, but through religious devotion to his rules, the kobolds&amp;rsquo; evil nature has slowly receded more and more with each passing generation. One day, if all goes well, the dragon hopes to integrate his kobolds with the people that surround his mountain. However, these people still remember the days when kobolds threatened their lives, and they quietly hope that someone will wipe the kobolds out once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4th - 6th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
