							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stock Car Saturday Night</name>
									
			<description>Print-'n'-Play game by Greg Poehlein brings stock car racing action to your tabletop! This unique racing board game offers cool components in a slick and compact board game design that captures the fast-action feel and strategy of small-town stock car racing in an exciting new way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game abandons the traditional oval-track-on-a-board approach in favor of a mechanic that emphasizes strategy and maneuver relative to the other cars on the track. Strategy cards held by the drivers put race tactics and skillful play in control of the result instead of just rolls of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any good ol' boy can put the hammer down, but maneuvering through the pack, watching your tire wear and fuel consumption and knowing the limits of your machine are tricks only the best drivers can hope to master. When Stock Car Saturday Night is over, will you be up on Victory Lane making a hot date with the Performance Princess, or down in the garage gettin' greasy under a broken stock car?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes printable PDF files for full-color counters, a two-section mapboard, turn and lap markers, and 160 strategy cards as well as a simple three-page rulesheet. Also included is a unique cardstock construct in the MicroTactix tradition -- a paperback-sized full-color slipcase storage box you print and assemble to hold all the game components, allowing you to display and transport your game after it is printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.microtactix.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.microtactix.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
