			<description>Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe is a game that is about investing in combinations of the most profitable companies to earn the most money.  The game models the westward expansion of railroads from the East Coast all the way to the Pacific.  Players begin with a set number of cubes which they can choose to invest as shares, expand railroad networks, add to the value of resources or add resources to railroads.  Like colors for railroads doubles income at railroad stops.  Each railroad has a varied amount of stops and resource combinations to ensure that every game is different.  When two adjacent starting railroads have fully developed their routes, the second stage of railroads opens up and dividends are issued to the first and second majority owners matching that company color.  The game progresses until all players pass or there are no more valid moves to be made.  A final dividend is triggered and the player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
