			<description>From the back of the module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest of the Restorationists is nearing an end.  Your party has been entrusted with finding the secrets of the Sky Chariot of the Ancients, and returning the information (and anything else) to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However easy that may sound, there are always complications.  General Timon, who has made quite a name for himself in these parts, is negotiating with the King of the Mountain--he wants an alliance.  In addition to your mission for the Restorationists, you must also prevent Timon from strengthening his position in these lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you resourcefuil enough to complete the task of finding the Sky Chariot and stop Timon at the same time?  Or will you be forced to achieve one at the expense of the other?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time is running out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module includes a 46-page adventure and also contains a 50-page official rules expansion by Kim Eastland as well as an entire city to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Module also includes a large 2-sided map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
