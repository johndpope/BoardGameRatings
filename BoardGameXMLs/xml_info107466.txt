							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Master of Pizza</name>
									
			<description>You've just received three orders for pizza, so it's time to gather the required toppings and deliver the largest and most delicious pizzas possible. If you outperform the other would-be pizza chefs, you will be Master of Pizza!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck in this trick-taking game consists of 40 topping cards (five types of toppings valued 0-7 in each type) and 15 order cards (five each of small, medium and large pizzas, which use three, four or five toppings, respectively). At the start of the game, each player receives one order card of each size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master of Pizza lasts 3-5 rounds. In a round, each player starts with 8-10 topping cards in hand; thus, each round consists of 8-10 tricks. The lead player in a trick plays one topping card to the table, then each player follows, with no requirement to follow suit. The highest card in the suit led wins the trick, and the person who played that card collects the topping cards one-by-one, placing those cards in separate stacks by topping type on the table in front of him, with the most recently played (and collected) cards on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, each player decides whether to score for one of his order cards in hand. For each topping shown on the order card, the player scores only the topmost topping card, scoring zero points if that topping is missing. The player then discards the order card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after five rounds or at the end of a round in which at least one player has scored his third order card. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
