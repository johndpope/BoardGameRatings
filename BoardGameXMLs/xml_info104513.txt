							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation: Deadly Decoy</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. State Department is counting on the GI Joe Team to keep Cobra far away from Washington in OPERATION: DEADLY DECOY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your code name is Presto because of your amazing ability to look and sound like anyone you choose. This talent will be very important as you join Flint, Roadblock, Gung-Ho, and Lady Jaye in a breathtaking mission to make absolutely sure Cobra won't interfere in the secret talks between the U.S. President and China's Premier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Briefing Room of the Pit, Duke outlines your two-part plan. Operation New Pit will attempt to lure Cobra to what appears to be the GI Joe Team's new headquarters in Northern California's Sierra Mountains. Even more clever is Operation Circus, in which you, Presto, will pose as the President's young son, attending an international circus in Berlin. Cobra will probably try to kidnap you - and get a big surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These missions require split-second thinking. At every turn you'll face plenty of danger, so make the right decisions as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
