			<description>Based on the LWT TV Series LONDON'S BURNING this game is based on the activities of Firefighters in London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a character from the series and they compete with each other to find and rescue a character from a burning Hospital.  The players are required to collect items of equipment and then race towards the Hospital entrance, possibly having to deal with other smaller incidents on the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will come across many different challenges inside the hospital and they must try to combat them by collecting items of equipment to stop their lives being lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire prevention cards are also used to recover lost &amp;quot;lives&amp;quot; with players using them before the five lives they are given at the start of the game are reduced to zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who is able to take the casualty through one of the two Fire Exits is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
