							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dick Tracy Crime Stopper</name>
									
			<description>Twenty clue slides are randomly placed in the slots on the gameboard. One of the eight criminal portraits is chosen secretly and placed inside the gameboard. The portrait is now hidden by the clue slides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn, spins the spinner. The spinner will tell the player which two clues may be removed from the gameboard. The player may then guess which of the eight portraits is concealed by the slides by pressing the appropriate button on the gameboard. If the word &amp;quot;guilty&amp;quot; lights up, then the player has solved the mystery and won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses one &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; battery and a standard flashlight's bulb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
