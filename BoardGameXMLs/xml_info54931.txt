							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Seventh Circle</name>
									
			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure requires the Fallout PnP core rules. A copy of the Tribes! sourcebook may also be helpful, but is not required. The adventure can take anything between a couple of hours to a couple of days to resolve, depending on how much the GM wants to make out of it. A new species of sentient creature is featured within the adventure, details can be found within the section: the bat people at the end of this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seventh circle is a way to introduce a new type of creature into the game system. Thus, the adventure and its solution will focus on information about these creatures. However, the GM should keep in mind that this is an adventure and that the players want to have fun playing it. I intended this module to have lots of religious puns in it. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like that, just omit anything you believe to be inappropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
