			<description>Momotaro Dentetsu (桃太郎電鉄 Momotarō Dentetsu, Momotarō Electric Railway) (also known by the abbreviated name Momotetsu) is a long-running board game-style video game series in Japan; in which players travel by rail, ship, and airplane; attempting to acquire wealth through business transactions buying properties; and dealing with rival entrepreneurs and nemeses such as the God of Poverty (貧乏神 Binbōgami?). The game mechanics are often compared to the board games sugoroku and Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Started in 1988, the series was initially produced by Hudson Soft. The rights to the series are now owned by Konami Corporation, who absorbed Hudson in 2012. The title is commonly thought of as a play on the title for another video game series by Hudson Soft, Momotaro Densetsu, with which it is sometimes confused. The project supervisor for the series is Akira Sakuma, with illustration by Takayuki Doi (土居 孝幸?) and main music production by Kazuyuki Sekiguchi of Southern All Stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Momotaro Dentetsu&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
