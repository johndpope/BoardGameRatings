			<description>&amp;quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&amp;quot; is a 1937 Disney animated film based on &amp;quot;Snow White,&amp;quot; a German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. The film was Disney's first full-length animated feature film, and the first color, animated film in motion picture history. It consistently ranks among the greatest films of all time; in 2007 it ranked at #34 in a list of 100 and was the only animated film in the list. In 1989 the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &amp;quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&amp;quot; Like other Disney projects, spin-off marketing soon created related merchandise. Products introduced in 1937 included &amp;quot;The Game of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&amp;quot; from Milton Bradley Company. A complicated game with several different playing pieces and multiple types of rules, the game attempts to mimic the plot of the movie. The winning player's Snow White playing piece triumphs at the end with a kiss from the handsome prince.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description courtesy of thestrong.org (Creative Commons, BY-NC-ND)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
