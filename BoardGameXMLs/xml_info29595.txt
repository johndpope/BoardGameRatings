							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elementalis: Creationists and Elitists</name>
									
			<description>The war has grown bitter.  As the 3 mage sects battle over the control of Mana, the Flux has been thrown into chaos.  From the Flux come the Creationists, a tribe of creatures dedicated to the health and well being of the Flux.  These creatures come to put an end to the war, and restore balance once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their coming did not go as planned.  The Creationists have now been thrown into the middle of the bloody war and are barely holding their own against the other sects.  To make matters worse, a small group of twisted Purists have been performing strange and sick experiments on fallen Creationists.  These so called &amp;ldquo;Elitists&amp;rdquo; have taken the love of their elemental magic to the extreme using what they now know of the Creationists power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 5 groups now vying for power, what will become of the Flux?  The only way to find out is to pit yourself in the middle of the war and see where fate takes you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creationists and Elitists is a free expansion for Elementalis. This expansion allows the game to handle up to 5 players with two new Mage types to diversify game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
