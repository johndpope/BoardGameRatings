			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of 100 books on alternative history topics that players might find on a bookshelf. The books are mostly suitable for a modern setting, as the vast majority were first published in the late 20th century, although some are older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These books range from ancient aliens, such as those from Nibiru, to lost continents, such as Atlantis and Mu, to alternative chronologies and historical differences, whether civilisation is older than believed to history being a complete fabrication. They range from theories merely outside current beliefs to outright pseudohistory. All the books listed are genuine books, some of them by well known names in the field. Whether or not the books have any in-game value other than decorative is up to the GameMaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries have the book's name, author, if known, and in every case other details, in particular the area that the book covers. They can be used to pad out a bookshelf with other genuine material, although it is unlikely that any one person would have books on the whole range of subject material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some examples are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21. DNA of the Gods: The Anunnaki Creation of Eve and the Alien Battle for Humanity by Chris H. Hardy Ph.D. (How humanity was genetically engineered by the Anunnaki, the aliens from Nibiru, and the attempt to enslave or eradicate humanity)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22. Earlier than You Think: A Personal View of Man in America by George F. Carter (Dates human colonisation of the Americas to 100,000 years ago)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23. Fingerprints of the Gods: The Evidence of Earth's Lost Civilization by Graham Hancock (Claims a highly advanced civilisation was destroyed at the end of the last Ice Age, but passed parts of its knowledge on)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
