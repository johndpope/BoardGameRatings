			<description>A devilish print-and-play game of temporal competition, where two time travellers compete to complete four objectives by travelling back in time to alter four separate time-lines, and interfere with each other's plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game, you will need :&lt;br/&gt;- 1 A4 printout of the board (see files or images section)&lt;br/&gt;- 4 red counters&lt;br/&gt;- 4 blue counters&lt;br/&gt;- 10 black counters&lt;br/&gt;- 1 D6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are printed on the board, and transcribed here :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place player pieces on the beginning of any timeline (I - IV, coloured), and a marker on the beginning of the clock track (X).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round, advance the clock marker one hour.&lt;br/&gt;If the end of the clock track is reached by the first clock marker, add a second at X, and continue advancing this, so that 24 hours are played.&lt;br/&gt;When the second clock marker reaches the end of its track, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the greatest number of achievements (A or B) wins.&lt;br/&gt;If more than one player is tied for the greatest number of achievements, the player with the least pieces wins.&lt;br/&gt;If more than one player shares the lowest number of pieces, the player whose oldest piece has advanced the farthest through time wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, move your earliest piece (that nearest to X along the time-lines I - IV) forward one space, or roll 1D6.&lt;br/&gt;    On a roll of 6, you may move any piece on the board (with the exception of achievements) one space in any direction along its time-line.&lt;br/&gt;    On any other roll, place a new piece on any time-line, that number of spaces back in time from your earliest piece, counting from the previous space.&lt;br/&gt;        If the new piece is placed beyond the starting space, it is lost in time, and your turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land level with another of your pieces, remove the older of the two pieces, and collect the achievement associated with its time-line if you have not already.&lt;br/&gt;If you land on the same space as another piece, move that piece to the equivalent time on any other time-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a co-op game, use only one clock counter (12 hours), and ignore one of the scoring tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
