							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caribou Hunting: The Crossing Place Hunting Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Crossing Place Hunting Game models the cooperative technique of hunting caribou on land and from kayaks as the migrating herds swim across a narrow body of water on the Simpson Peninsula in Pelly Bay. The Caribou player moves a herd of 40 caribou on the game map; each Eskimo player moves two hunters, a kayaker and a beater. The Eskimo players may cooperate in their strategy to kill caribou before the herd reaches the other side of the crossing place or moves off the board and ends the game. This game contrasts with the less productive and more individualistic technique of hunting with the bow and arrow. See Caribou Hunting: The Bow and Arrow Game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Man: A Course of Study, Unit 6, for 5th grade elementary students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
