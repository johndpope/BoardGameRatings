							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Back to the Dungeon Role Playing Game Book 1: Basic Races and Classes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The return of Old School Renaissance simplicity with the combination of New School Mechanics using the OGL D20 but vastly simplified and none of the silly race and class restriction that were a part of the old game. In this RPG Zine there are basic Four Races and Four Classes of of Dungeon Crawl Hack and Slash Deep Role Playing Traditions dating back from the 70s. There are many many more classes and races and you are encouraged to make up more and send them in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game returns to the DIY attitude of the original game before fancy campaign settings and encourages you to &amp;ldquo;Make it up as you Go&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Try Anything!&amp;rdquo; with your characters. If all else fails, pull out your sword and kill it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
