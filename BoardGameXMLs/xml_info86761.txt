							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Lineage Volume II: The Giant-Blooded</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment of Lost Lineages focuses on the Dana-Tuath, commonly referred to as the giant-blooded. The Dana-Tuath are significantly different from the common races presented in the core rules, but great effort has gone into making sure that they can exist in the carefully woven fabric of your campaign without the GM having to put in undue effort or use a shoehorn. That effort notwithstanding, if Dana-Tuath do not fit into your campaign per se, you can still use the classes presented in this product to give a bit more depth to your own cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
