			<description>Players are divided into two camps playing with their pawns.&lt;br/&gt;They put words on the board horizontally on the line closest to his line of defense one word in turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player may form a word on his line of defense by placing the letters on the board and by connecting the excisting words.&lt;br/&gt;If he reaches the defense line of the opponent he earns the TAKENO (bonus token)&lt;br/&gt;He can capture one or more words of the other side of the board by overlapping letters of the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player can not draw enough chips for the tokens required, the game is over. The winner is the player who has the most chips on the game board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
