							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into the Rabbit Hole</name>
									
			<description>A cooperative brainy card game. Light Strategy for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains 49 high quality cards. The goal is to help the rabbits return home, thrugh the rabbit holes, to the hills and to collect 18 rabbit cards or more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player, in turn, takes one card from the deck, plays one card, and moves one rabbit that is already in the game, as explained below. If a player cannot play any card (not enough rabbit holes), the turn passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to three rows of up to 4 rabbit holes may be opened up, each terminating with a hill card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hill card may be placed at the end of a row only after three hole cards have been placed in that row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rabbits are introduced into the game by placing a rabbit card on the first hole card of a row. Only one rabbit may occupy a hole card at any given time. Rabbits may not jump from row to row but they can jump over a rabbit (in the same row) if the hole card on the other side is unoccupied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
