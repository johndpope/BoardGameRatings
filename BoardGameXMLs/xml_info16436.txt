			<description>This is an educational item, with ten different games included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The Lotto Game&lt;br/&gt;2. The Chronology Game&lt;br/&gt;3. Self-Correction Game&lt;br/&gt;4. A Game of Association&lt;br/&gt;5. A Game of Patience&lt;br/&gt;6. The Memory Game&lt;br/&gt;7. the Series Game&lt;br/&gt;8. Invention Game&lt;br/&gt;9. The Clock Game&lt;br/&gt;10. The Dominoes Time Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the rules, it includes a book, 24 cards, and a cardboard clock which are used in the various games. The cards are half black, half white and have a picture of a clock in one half and a different time written in numerals on the other half. Haven't tried the games with my little one, but the components are quite nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
