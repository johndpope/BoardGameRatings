			<description>In this game, players are playing a group of victims trapped in a mansion (or &amp;quot;the Room&amp;quot;) by a serial killer. They need to work together, explore the mansion, collect cues and use deduction to find the &amp;quot;safe exit room&amp;quot;, and manage to escape through the it in 8-10 rounds before the bomb explodes. The serial killer disguised himself and hides among the victims in order to witness the suffering of the victims in a sadistic sense. His goal is to secretly thwart the escape. The victims win the game by escaping the mansion before the game ends. Or the killer wins by thwarting enough people reach the &amp;quot;safe exit&amp;quot; and have them killed by the bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player can move to an adjacent room (given that he has the key to unlock the room) and execute the function of that room, which include: discover a cue card that points to the &amp;quot;safe exit room&amp;quot;, deter the bomb from exploding (if successful, add 2 more game rounds), cure poisons (yes, the victims started the game by being poisoned by the serial killer), and inspect other people's cue card. Players can also do generic actions such as giving room keys to other players, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays similarly to the Mafia/Werewolf family, but with the spatial exploration element on a modular board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is in Chinese only. Here is the Chinese description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;游戏讲述一群受害者被奸徒困在一个完美密室里而且身中剧毒，玩家需要在密室里面互相合作，运用有限的时间去寻找线索和破解迷题，最终突破奸徒的阻挠找到出口逃生。&lt;br/&gt;该款游戏的特色是将玩家的语言和实际行动相结合，游戏的临场代入感非常强，是一个需要玩家之间高度合作和策略运用的新型语言推理类桌面游戏。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
