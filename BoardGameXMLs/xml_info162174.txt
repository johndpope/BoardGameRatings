			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fish Sticks is the first book (of seven) in The Uncommon Commoners campaign series. In this semi-epic campaign, the uncommon commoners will fulfill their destiny. Or die trying. Or both&amp;mdash;if their destiny is to die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bound by destiny and linked by a secret from the past, the uncommon commoners must face their first semi-great challenge, best explained by the following uncommon poem:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Pisco, our village.&lt;br/&gt;Which, I hope, you will not pillage.&lt;br/&gt;Though the village smells please do not go!&lt;br/&gt;I beg you to listen to our tale of woe!&lt;br/&gt;Once we were happy and full of weal.&lt;br/&gt;Now the place smells like a dead seal!&lt;br/&gt;As for the cause of our pain&lt;br/&gt;You do not need a giant brain&lt;br/&gt;Nor the diviner&amp;rsquo;s art&lt;br/&gt;To know that the fish do fart!&lt;br/&gt;I am at my wit&amp;rsquo;s end!&lt;br/&gt;Help us, or I&amp;rsquo;ll go around the bend!&lt;br/&gt;That is what I have to say.&lt;br/&gt;If you won&amp;rsquo;t help us, I bid you good day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Uncommon Commoners #1: Fish Sticks is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure.
