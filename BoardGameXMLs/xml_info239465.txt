							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ski Tour: Biathlon</name>
									
			<description>The Norse god Ullr was god of both skiing and hunting, is this were the roots of biathlon lies?&lt;br/&gt;Military in scandinavia trained with skies and rifles, was it in this competetive enviroment biathlon was born?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well... who cares? Born from the gods or from the military we can all agree that biathlon is a fascinating sport. Hard to master but wonderful to spectate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you are given the chance to take control of your nation during the biathlon &amp;quot;Ski tour&amp;quot;. Guide your skier through a tough course, keep up with your rivals, make your move and sprint at the right time. Remember to always control your stamina so that your shots at the firing range have a chance to hit the target. You dont want to take a lap in the penalty lane. Also your stamina is surposed to last for the entire race...don't rush into the lead before the first corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give your skier boosts of agility or stamina during the race to make bold moves past your opponents or force your rivals into a position where they must waste time and energy on just beeing stuck in the middle of the field of skiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However you plan your race, the glory goes to the skier who is first to cross the finish line. There can only be one SKI TOUR CHAMPION!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
