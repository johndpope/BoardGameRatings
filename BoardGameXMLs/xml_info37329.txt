							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War of Liberty:  An Introductory Wargame Rules for the American War of Independence</name>
									
			<description>War of Liberty is a very short and simple game for simulating miniatures battles in the American Revolutionary War.  The rules themselves are only four pages long, yet detail the necessary unit structure, turn sequence, movement, fire combat, melee, and morale procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infantry units are battalions and made up of 3-6 stands (typically 2-3 stands for American and British, and 4-6 for French), cavalry is 1-4 stands (typically 2), and artillery batteries are represented by a single stand.  The game is designed to be played with either 15mm or 25mm figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four additional inserts are included:&lt;br/&gt;1) A game summary&lt;br/&gt;2) American and French army organizations&lt;br/&gt;3) British, Tory, and Hessian army organizations&lt;br/&gt;4) List of American Revolutionary battles in chronological order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
