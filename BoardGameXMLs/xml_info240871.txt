							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drop Dead</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drop Dead is a cinematic action RPG that is designed to tell a full story in one session. Adventure prep is quick and easy, character creation only takes a couple of minutes, and the game itself can easily fit within a 2 hour window. This game allows for high octane play in emulation of your favorite action, adventure and horror movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to emulate a film, Drop Dead is a rules light narrative system that focuses on the characters and the story first. Game play is done by rolling a dice pool of d20&amp;rsquo;s and using the lowest number rolled to influence the narrative. The lower the result, the worse things become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Drop Dead booklet you can find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A complete narrative RPG system ready to play&lt;br/&gt;    Tips on running Drop Dead sessions along with how to write an adventure script&lt;br/&gt;    Five roll tables for building a session on the fly including the protagonists (d100), antagonists (d100), setting (d100), and plot (d12) that can be combined for millions of variations.&lt;br/&gt;    Three fully detailed ready to run scripts complete with notes, act outlines, and character sheets. Each script is written in a different style and design, showing you multiple ways to prep for a session. The scripts include:&lt;br/&gt;        Blitzkrieg Undead (Action / Horror): Escape from a WWII German camp swarmed with zombies on motorcycles, zombies with jetpacks, bio-mechanical tanks, and creatures of the player&amp;rsquo;s own designs.&lt;br/&gt;        Leave the Driving to Us (Thriller): A slow building adventure across the US South West on a tour bus that is hunted by something in the desert and from the skies.&lt;br/&gt;        Showdown in Chinatown (Action / Adventure): A high octane kung fu action script based on the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest film (or not).&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
