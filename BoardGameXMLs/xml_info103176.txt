							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hui Buh: Die verflixte Gespensterjagd</name>
									
			<description>In Hui Buh: Die verflixte Gespensterjagd, Count Morticor has imprisoned the royal family and while the ghost Hui Buh has been covered with chains, you still have a chance to direct the ghost to help the family escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game the first time, players need to take the string included in the box and form a loop on one end while tying the other end to a plastic key. Before the game begins, the players shuffle the twelve dungeon tiles &amp;ndash; seven of which are blank on both sides while five hide a member of the royal family &amp;ndash; then place the tiles in the plastic grid in the box bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, she tries to use the rope to maneuver the key into the slot on one of the dungeon tiles and pick it up, after which she can then look at the tile. If the tile is blank, she can return it to any empty spot in the grid and try to &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; for a new dungeon tile. If she finds a member of the royal family, she keeps the tile and her turn ends. Meanwhile, the other players are rolling a die that bears the face of Count Morticor among many blank sides. Each time the Count appears, disturbed by the rattling chains persumably, the players grab one of seven ghost chips. If they grab all seven before the active player rescues a member of the royal family, that player's turn ends immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever rescues the most members of the royal family wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
