							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sitzkrieg</name>
									
			<description>Sitzkrieg is an expansion set for Axis and Allies which includes a new board sized 80 x 150 cm, an Excel based IPC-tracker, printable battleboards and a PDF based printable rules set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set comes without plastic figurines, so you need at least any of the Axis and Allies games with all major powers present or spare parts from Xeno Games to have enough figurines for all nations. The playable nations are: Germany, Italy, Japan, USSR, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Kuomintang (KMT), France (Free &amp;amp; Vichy), Netherlands, neutrals and Britisch Commonwealth Nations divided into UK, Canada, South Africa, India and Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map offers you geographical features such as rivers and mountains that have their own influence on the units. When set up, the game starts with a couple of events that took place before 1939. You have to roll for the Second Sino-Japanese war and for the Spanish Civil War to start with. The Long March, The purge and the Winter War all take place in what is called turn zero.Starting turn 1 you may roll for nation specific technologies. Urban Warfare, Burma Road, Lend Lease, Convoys, International and Territorial Waters, Ports, Elite Infantry, Partisans, Spanish Blue Division, Political Leaders are elements that enhance the realistic feel of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to win a bronze, silver or gold (historical) victory over your enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for which Axis and Allies and Xeno pieces can not be used:&lt;br/&gt;-Weather effects like rain, heat, snow, fog and wind effect your troop's mobility. You can make your own weather markers or use the Litko Aerosystems weather markers.&lt;br/&gt;-Oil Derricks (we recommend Petropolis pieces) and oil drums (we recommend the supply counters from Axis and Allies Battle of the Bulge)&lt;br/&gt;-Commanders (we recommend 1/72 scale minis, Table Tactics jeeps or Axis and Allies miniatures commanders) Commanders allow surrender or retreat options.&lt;br/&gt;-Elite Infantry (we recommend 1/72 scale minis or AA Miniatures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get all the miniatures to play all the rules is a bit of work, but remember you can also use them to make house rules for your regular Axis and Allies games or use the Sitzkrieg rules as an expansion to your own games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
