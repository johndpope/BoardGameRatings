			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the real world, the authorities are less likely to react to an outbreak of superpowered vigilantes as favourably as is often depicted in fiction. The actions they take pursuing villains are often criminal themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fictional memo from a government to law enforcement professionals on just what crimes such superpowered vigilantes may break in their pursuit of criminals. The crimes are separated into two main categories, general laws broken and laws that are directly related to superpowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be used in a setting where superpowers have started becoming more common, for when players operate in countries that are less tolerant, or simply to mess with their heads and make life more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A perhaps less than entirely serious supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page of the supplement is the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
