							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Korps Commander WWII: The Road to Berlin</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction to the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road to Berlin is a set of rules in the Korps Commander series, which will eventually cover all periods of warfare at a level which will allow large battles and campaigns to be fought. The series' aim is to utilize the techniques of boardgaming whilst retaining the flavour of miniature gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road to Berlin simulates actions in the Second World War on the Western or Eastern Fronts during the final two years for forces up to Corps or Army levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic units in the game are tank and mechanized infantry platoons, infantry companies, and artillery batteries. Aircraft may be in flights or squadrons, Logistics and engineers are fully covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Corps level assault can easily be played on an 8' x 6' table, whilst the rules are ideal for campaign games where the action is spread across a number of tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
