			<description>Educational game about the geography of France. It has a board showing all the separate regions of the country, but it is really a card game,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three 'Contracts' are revealed. The contract might say &amp;quot;Regions that begin with the same letter&amp;quot;, that sort of thing. Each player has 10 cards and can claim a contract if you reveal the cards asked for. Each contract is worth points - easy to do might be 3 points, more difficult 6 points, very difficult 10 points. When a contract is taken another one replaces it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to obtain 10 contracts scores the points on each contract, plus two points for each contract that another player has less then ten, plus 20 points for going out first. The player with the highest score, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
