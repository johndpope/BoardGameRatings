			<description>INFO: 2 or 4 players, 10-15 minutes per game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOOK: High quality miniatures, fast paced gameplay, each card is its own piece of art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRIEF OVERVIEW: Summoners is a spell casting, card dueling board game. Players choose a summoner to command and duel head to head. Summoners all have their own unique abilities to use along with a spell deck of 25 cards. Each Summoner has 4 unique pets that they control. Gain mana to cast summoning spells and bring your pets to the game board or cast other spells to deal damage, enhance pets, or heal your summoner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four summoner classes and each starts with 20 health. Attack with your pets or cast your spells cards to take your opponent's summoner to zero health. If you've played any CCG's such as Magic, Game of Thrones, or Star Wars, the dueling wizard mechanics will be familiar to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN: The first player to take their opponent's summoner to zero health wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
