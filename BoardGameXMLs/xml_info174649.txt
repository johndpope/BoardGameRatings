			<description>Robot for the world invasion was out of control during the experiment! In order to activate the emergency stop program, it's insert a stop key to all the robot quickly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play this game the player have to provide 5 D6 that are not included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be able to put out all the dice on the slots on the game board in order 1 to 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You put out all the dice in order 1 to 5 on the different slots on the board, the problem is that each slot have an effect on the dice that have not yet been placed. The slots can make you either turn up or down the results of one other die, you could re-roll 1 or all dice and one slot will let you turn over one die to the other side (For an example 1 to a 6 or 5 to a 2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a postcard sized solo game that was given away free at Essen 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
