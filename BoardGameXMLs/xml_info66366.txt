			<description>Did you know that Vincent van Gogh painted over 900 paintings in his lifetime? And can you name the artist of Britain&amp;rsquo;s greatest painting? Developed in conjunction with London&amp;rsquo;s National Gallery, BrainBox Art is full of interesting facts and amazing images of some of the best paintings in the world in stunning high quality on 56 beautifully-illustrated cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple concept can be played by all ages and in large groups as well as a 1 person game. Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material and designed in the UK, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players 1 or more,&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 to 88,&lt;br/&gt;Contains 56 illustrated cards, 1 rules card, 1 timer and 1 eight-sided die,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
