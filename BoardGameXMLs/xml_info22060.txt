			<description>Sinbad&lt;br/&gt;A game of excitement and adventure from the Columbia Pictures &amp;quot;Sinbad&amp;quot; Movies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start at Bagdad and each select one of the four voyages: &amp;quot;Gulf of Fear&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bay of Horrors&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sea of Monsters&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Impossible Ocean&amp;quot;. Each sea has four islands guarded by monsters. Three treasures are placed on each island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use a spinner to move around the four islands. When landing on the right spot, they may also spin to get treasure. Guess the spin means success. Some spots give the opportunity for treasure, but also mean a monster must be fought. Other spots move the player back a space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player completes his journey, the round ends and whoever has the most treasure wins. Players then change voyages and continue until each player has made all four voyages. The player with the highest treasure score after all four voyages wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
