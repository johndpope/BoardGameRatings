			<description>Trivia game for four players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a number of questions; A Home 1, a Home 2, an Away 1, an Away 2, a Bonus question and a Champions League question. Each player starts on his own track. There is no interaction between the tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, a player rolls the die to see which question he will be asked. It will be for one of the Home or Away questions. The Bonus and Champions League question are special and cannot be rolled on the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Home/Away question is worth one or two spaces to be moved on your track. If you land on a Yellow Card space or a Red Card space, various negative effects come into play for you. When you have reached the end of your track, you must answer a Champions League question to win the game. If you get it wrong, you just stay there and next turn you will get another Champions League question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
