			<description>Wild Guess is a simultaneous trivia game based on numbers and statistics and comes with a set of question cards and a set of answer cards with the addition of some tokens, used for gambling for those players that feel they will be closer to the answer than any other.&lt;br/&gt;A question is read by one player who estimates an answer and then tells the other players their answer, the other players then guess whether the answer will be higher or lower than that answer,they also guess what the correct answer will be. Scores are then tallied up for nearest and furthest answer to the question, with the highest scoring player winning over twelve rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
