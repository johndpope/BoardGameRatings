			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of  N/A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baby Boomer is an unlicensed 1989 action video game created by Color Dreams for the NES. It was developed during 1988. As a baby crawls across the screen toward numerous dangers, such as birds of prey or bottomless pits, the player uses his/her NES Zapper to shoot hazards before they hurt the baby. Shooting birds kills them; shooting clouds makes them form ice bridges over pits. Level environments include a graveyard, heaven, and hell. Up to two players can participate simultaneously and use the basic NES controller along with the Zapper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was Color Dreams' first game. Like their other unlicensed games, rather than the typical grey NES cartridge, Baby Boomer is baby blue with an altered design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Baby Boomer (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
