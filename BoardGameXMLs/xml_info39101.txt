							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forest of the Undead</name>
									
			<description>It starts simply enough.  You and your pal decide to cut through the forest to save some time.  Instead, you experience the adventure and horror of your young life as you encounter enough Undead to populate a dozen George Romero films!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 players take turns placing forest path tiles, then moving your pieces along the winding routes.  Using cards, you do your best to ward off the gruesome creatures as well as create some to eliminate your opponent- but watch out! If he dies, he can come back as the Undead and still win the game if you are unable to flee the forest in time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a variety of path tiles and event cards, and the player will need to supply his/her own Explorer and Undead figures (easily borrowed from games already on the market), as well as a few D6 dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is currently a Print and Play game, and is now available here on BGG as well as other websites approved by Steve Bullock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
