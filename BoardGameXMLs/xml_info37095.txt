			<description>Zombie racing! Just saying it causes you to say &amp;quot;What the&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; When some were saying &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; Jim Bob Joe was saying &amp;quot;Why not?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Civilizations have always been judged by their sports. Since before the gladiatorial contests in ancient Rome, man has been defined by his sport of choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie racing. What more can you say?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Heat is competitive on two levels. Not only can players race the Zeds, they can bet on them too! But wait, there's more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marvel (laugh your butt off) as highly trained Zombies (the fresher the better) streak down the track (OK, shuffle) in their quest for the gold (dinner). But these finely tuned athletes (hungry) aren't alone. Each Zombie is assisted by a loyal trainer (baiter) who desires only to share in their triumph (make a buck) all in the name of glory (because they have no other marketable skills).&lt;br/&gt;Zombie racing&amp;hellip; the name says it all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
