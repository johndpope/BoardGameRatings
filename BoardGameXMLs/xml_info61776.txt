							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power of Prayer</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Religion is meant for the masses, not the clerics and the paladins alone. While not everyone can cast divine spells, anyone can live a life dedicated to their god and anyone can pray. Now, the gods listen when your character prays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book of the Faithful: Power of Prayer gives you ideas for your next Pathfinder character. Concept ranging from the newly converted to the those that lived their whole lives surrounded by their faith to those seeking to learn an aspect of their faith more deeply than they had before. Additionally there are seventeen new feats, a new magic item and three pieces of equipment ideal for the faithful seeker's enlightenment and protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
