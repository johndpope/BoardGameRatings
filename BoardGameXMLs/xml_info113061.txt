							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mit Felix durch Deutschland</name>
									
			<description>Felix travels through Germany to visit many sights. Player plays a destination card and a kilometer card, shows his destination and its picture on the board and if the distance is lower than the kilometers you played, you set the card aside for a victory point. If there are other destinations en route, you can set them aside as well. Another player who has cards for destinations on that route can set them aside, too. When Felix is back in M&amp;uuml;nster and one player has played all his cards, the player with most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
