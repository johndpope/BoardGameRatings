			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme/backstory: In 587BC the Babylonian armies of Nebuchadnezzar broke through the walls of Jerusalem, burned the city and pillaged the Temple of Yahweh. Those in the city who survived the siege were deported 1500km to Babylon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of Israel are bleeding. Their capital is destroyed, they are exiled from their land and Yahweh has abandoned them, or so it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nursing broken hearts, the pious of Israel gather on the banks of the Euphrates River. They comfort each other, and turn to the writings of the prophet Jeremiah. Perhaps they will gain understanding before all their hope drains away ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game mechanics: Co-operative card game with a CCG/LCG feel. The box comes with all the cards you need for four starter decks (and a few other cards too). The starter decks are reasonable, but as you improve you will want to craft your own. Unlike other co-op CCG/LCGs there is no 'monster deck' or 'encounter deck' instead there is some very careful shared resource management required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
