ADVENTURE!!! POCKETMODS!!! EXCLAMATION POINTS!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IVANHOE UNBOUND is PROUD to present its LATEST SUPPLEMENT for SWORDS AND WIZARDRY WHITEBOX or ANY OTHER OLD SCHOOL GAME based on the 1974 three booklet version of the WORLD-FAMOUS RPG whose name rhymes with &amp;quot;TRUNCHEONS AND FLAGONS!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you like a little HUMOR in your games, like BOB BLEDSLAW of the JUDGES GUILD?

LUCKILY, he has a lot of Hit Points...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you like a little SCIENCE FICTION in your games, like DAVE ARNESON and GARY GYGAX did?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've got you COVERED as well, with FIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ITEMS sufficiently ADVANCED to be considered MAGIC: Blasters, teleporters, a MYSTERIOUS CRYSTAL, a peaceful pistol and DRUGS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait, THERE'S MORE! This supplement comes in POCKETMOD FORMAT. Print out a SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER which can be TRANSFORMED with FOLDS and a single cut into a TINY EIGHT PAGE BOOKLET with EVERYTHING YOU NEED!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, while THE TINY BOOKLET IS ADORABLE, there's also a couple of larger-size versions so you can KILL MORE TREES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as a SPECIAL BONUS, the actual supplement doesn't use EXCESSIVE CAPITAL LETTERS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
