			<description>Wise Alec is the family fun trivia game that plays to any crowd. Featuring a hilarious demonstration of trivia, tongue twisters, and sassy social strategy, Wise Alec picks up on players&amp;rsquo; clever choices, good manners, and a little luck to find the wisest owl on any family game night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Wise Alec, opponents have a chance for making wise choices before, during, and after the game.

Each question offers a choice of an easy or more difficult question. Players can use their strengths for maximum or minimum risk and reward, but when a player lands on a Wise Alec card the fun really begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique elements of Wise Alec offer a choice of two levels of difficulty on every turn and playing to win by points or time, make the game ideal for multi-generation game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wise Alec was designed by educators to promote a healthy and active lifestyle, good manners, reinforce learning while ensuring each player&amp;rsquo;s ego remains intact as no one gets eliminated and no one feels like a fool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wise Alec was awarded Dr. Toy&amp;rsquo;s 100 Best Children&amp;rsquo;s Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
