			<description>&amp;quot;Stay or Go&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fairly basic roll-and-move aimed to teach children color recognition and set collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a spiral-shaped worm divided in coloured segments (4 colours/black with number/white). Players start in the head and move towards the tail. Landing on a coloured space gives the player one counter (quarter) of that colour; landing on a white has no effect; and landing on a black space causes the player to lose a number of quarters, the colors chosen by player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quarters collected during the game are scored when all players have either finished or dropped out. Quarters forming a circle of a single colour score the most, quarters forming multi-coloured circles score less, while left-over quarters score least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, there are four chances to drop out, identified by the grey shaded areas. This may make sense because the numbers in the black segments increase towards the end, and a player that has collected a good set of circles may want to cut her losses rather than carry on.  &lt;br/&gt;(This is the sole tactical choice in the game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paletti game no. 4065&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
