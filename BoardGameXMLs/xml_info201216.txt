			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where would the good guys be without the villains?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 Villains provides 21 assorted antagonists to use against your characters.  From street thugs to dictators, this volume has them all!  Each villain comes complete with illustrations by expert artist Bradley Warnes and background history, stats and goals with which to challenge your characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters can face off against such enemies as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Sean &amp;quot;Shade&amp;quot; Marlette - A professional gambler turned high-class assassin for the O'Malley Crime Family.  Well-known for his reputation of always catching his prey.&lt;br/&gt;    Martin St. John - A corrupt Cascadian politican working behind the scenes to increase his own power and line his own pockets.&lt;br/&gt;    Frode Falkanger - The ruthless narcotics kingpin of the Franklin Subsector!&lt;br/&gt;    Todd Chisholm - A slick talking confidence man moving from system to system and fleecing the unwary!&lt;br/&gt;    And many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the book has been designed to be used in concert with the Clement Sector setting from Gypsy Knights Games, these organizations can easily be modified for use with any science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
