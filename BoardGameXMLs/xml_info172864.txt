							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delicious: Emily&#039;s Honeymoon Cruise</name>
									
			<description>Delicious: Emily's Honeymoon Cruise continues the story where Wonder Wedding leaves off, of course.  Prepare and serve dishes at top speed, mostly aboard a cruise ship; however, there are a few beach scenes to keep you on your toes.  Emily's sister, Angela, is featured in quite a few levels, offering up clothing, instead of food.  In addition to the usual strong plot, Honeymoon Cruise makes additional use of multistage preparations, particularly for Angela's clothing, which needs to be manufactured &amp;mdash; of course while the shop is open, people are buying, and people are trying on clothes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary by zefquaavius&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
