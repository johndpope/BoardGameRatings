			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover Who Your Hero Was... Before They Were a Hero&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hero Will Rise: Epic Fantasy is the first in a series of Savagely Useful products designed specifically to help players flesh out a background story for their epic fantasy characters in Savage Worlds games. Using a combination of personal choices, random d20 rolls, and draws from a regular card deck, players can determine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Where the hero grew up.&lt;br/&gt;    What kind of family they were born to.&lt;br/&gt;    What they did as a trade or profession before adventure came calling.&lt;br/&gt;    What kind of things happened to them that gave them certain challenges in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using this book, you can not only generate fun and interesting narrative elements for your character, you get special additional abilities and bonuses, as well. In addition, you can use this to generate one or both of your Minor Hindrances, and gain narrative hooks to go with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hero Will Rise: Epic Fantasy is not only fun to use for creating a fantasy hero character, it can work great as a quick generator for NPCs, as a writing prompt for fantasy writers, and for all kinds of fantasy character-oriented needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
