			<description>El Guettar, Tunisia, 23 March 1943: As soon as the movements of the enemy 10th Panzer Division were recognized as a major counter-attack Lieutenant Colonel Maxwell A. Tinscher's 899th Tank Destroyer Battalion, equipped with the new M10s, was ordered to support the hard-pressed 601st. Leaving behind A' Company in reserve, the 899th moved out at 0845 hours in a full-throttle dash to meet the Germans. Captain Kirk Adam's B' Company was in the lead and reached El Guettar just as Stukas worked over the area. Following a meeting between Colonel Tinscher, his S-3 Captain Joseph Morrison and the CO of the 601st T.D. Battalion, B' Company was ordered into the pass immediately, without waiting for C' Company. At 0955 B' Company sped into the valley floor between hills, immediately drawing fire. One destroyer was disabled on a minefield. The rest reorganized, moved off the road, and amid heavy fire from artillery, anti-tank and small arms, focused on enemy armor. Their 3-inch guns proved deadly, destroying ten Mark IVs, two anti-tank guns, and damaging two other Panzers in exchange for three M-10s burned and two disabled. For his action, Lieutenant Coady was awarded the Silver Star...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: RELUCTANT OFFENSIVE is a detailed new ASLComp VARIANT that tells the story of the War in North Africa. It's about time the desert warfare goodness that was spawned by Hal Hock's seminal work TOBRUK back in 1975... was brought to the gaming tables of ASLers. And now it is, in a big way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ninth portion of the set-piece is ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: Reluctant Offensive and takes the action into early 1941 and the first offensive to capture a city that would become a watchword later in the war: &amp;quot;Tobruk&amp;quot;. The action culminates with the Battle of Beda Fomm on a map that recreates the battlefield as well as the long out of print historical map, using the overlay set. This set of 8 scenarios also bring the FORT OVERLAY, depicting Fort Mechili into play. Can you get the Italian garrison in the fort to surrender? We'll leave that to you, your dice and your tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You receive a set of 8 scenarios, all depicting actions from the exciting offensive, rife with combined-arms actions. And yes, these are aimed at playability. Slap them down, bang them out, do it again. And again. Please do a little hooting and hollering while you're at it... at least when you roll 'snakeyes' (or the other guy rolls 'boxcars').&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS&amp;mdash;RELUCTANT OFFENSIVE contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    8 action-packed scenarios depicting actions from Rommel's drive into Cyrenaica &lt;br/&gt;    Color cover sheet &lt;br/&gt;    Descriptive back sheet &lt;br/&gt;    Ziploc style storage bag &lt;br/&gt;    All the interest in the War in North Africa that you have been waiting for someone to show you &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WEST OF ALAMEIN and BEYOND VALOR REQUIRED FOR USE + ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS CORE PACKS 1-2 ALSO NEEDED FOR PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
