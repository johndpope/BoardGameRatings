							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hounds of G.O.D.</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hounds of G.O.D. the players take the role of human-wolf experiments known as Hounds.  Bound to serve the United Earth Corporation and their handler for life, they are forced to face the abominations of science gone mad, survive the hostile environments of far off worlds, and even kill off their own kind.  Everyday is a struggle with difficult choices and the beast within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you toe the line and be a dutiful servant?  Or will you bite the hand that feeds, slip the leash, and become a Stray?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Hounds of G.O.D. is the first game to use our XxX (Ten By Ten) system. A lot of things were left open and undefined intentionally; this is to allow you to take the setting where you want to go. You won't find a lot of crunchy weapons rules in here, either- no listed ranges, re loard times, accuracy modifiers, etc. You can add them, if you feel so inclined; we've left them out in order to create a fast-moving game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
