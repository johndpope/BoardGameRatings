			<description>Bungayopoly: the Bungay Business Game is a roll-and-move business game inheriting elements from Monopoly. It is a local interest game set in the town of Bungay, Suffolk, UK. The board is composed of 4 sections, each featuring a photograph of local a landmark and spaces representing local businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Monopoly, the properties are preassigned, with each player owning all the properties on their segment of the board. Players may spend money to develop these properties to attract rent from players who land on them. The properties all generate the same rents. The game is player with a single 6-sided die. A single deck of 'Take a Street' event cards is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
