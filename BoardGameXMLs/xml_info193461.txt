			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in We Are Abandoned are very free-form with a few variables which are primarily derived by selection during play.  The most notable aspect of the game is the unequal dice used by the game master (d10) and the players (d6) where the high result &amp;quot;wins&amp;quot;.  Characters thus are frequently frustrated in their goals and must choose how to react when things seeming go wrong perpetually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contemplates a single scenario - escape from a collapsed city - and is intended for play during a single session.  The open-ended nature of the setting, however, offers a high potential for replay.  The document includes numerous pre-defined characters that can be used for print-and-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
