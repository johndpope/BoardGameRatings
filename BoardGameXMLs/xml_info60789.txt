							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black Out</name>
									
			<description>The board game, Black Out, is an unusual survival. It was made during the Second World War in the UK, when materials were at a shortage and being used for other purposes. Therefore toys were made of cheap and poor quality materials. The subject matter used for this board game reflects its time and many children during the war loved to play war games. The playing pieces are represented by different vehicles that have to make their way across Central London during the imposed night-time blackout. This was when no lights could be showing so that night - time bombers would not see any targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of the board is completely back with a label with the name of the game and a silhouette image of the city of London. The playing side of the board is marked out with a street map with each corner named marble Arch, Holborn, Hyde Park Corner and Charring Cross. The edge of the board has a boarder with three stripes red, white and blue. The game has pack of cards and 4 playing pieces and instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
