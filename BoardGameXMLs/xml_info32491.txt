			<description>In this game players will try to win cards by playing cards from their hand which match an open card on the table. After that a pandorra card is taken from the pile and if that also matches the pair you just made they stay on the table and can only be collected by playing the last matching card. This will also get you a bonus card from all other players collected cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You score by collecting cards in different groups: Throne, Lords, Knights and Citizins. Each group has a different scoring threshold and lot's of extra scoring options for special combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you score a certain minimum number of points (depends on the number of players) you can decide to end the round (declare peace) and score the points or keep playing (declare war) which will give you the obligation to score extra points each additional turn untill you stop the game. This process enables you to multiply your score by 2, 4, 8, 16 ... depending on how long you keep improving your score. When you declare war all other players are automatically forming a team which will allow them to exchange cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
