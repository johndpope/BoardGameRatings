							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sheep Fold</name>
									
			<description>This Australian game is an early example of asymmetric warfare, pitting two Dingoes against a herd of 28 Sheep that are fleeing from their Paddock across a Wild Belt to the safety of their Sheep Fold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is akin to checkers, with a cross-shaped grid of orthogonal and diagonal lines. Sheep may move forwards or sideways, but may not move backwards or into a previously occupied position. The goal of the Sheep player is to fully occupy the Sheep Fold square across from him with nine Sheep - or to completely block movement by the Dingoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two Dingoes can move in any direction and can capture a Sheep by jumping over it into an unoccupied square. The Dingo player wins if he can prevent the Sheep from making any further moves or if he captures 20 Sheep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
