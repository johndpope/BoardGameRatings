			<description>They're Coming is a zombie survival game. You must move your survivors through several locations to the rescue station while fighting off your opponent's zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the version of the game, players have two modes of play. In the &amp;quot;Single Pack&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Travel Edition&amp;quot; of the game, one player take on the role of the survivors and the other the zombies; in the &amp;quot;Standard&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Two Pack&amp;quot; version, both players take turns being survivors and zombies in a round of play. Survivors draw from a survivor supply deck and must navigate locations (chosen by the opponent) that are infested with zombies (which are played from the opponent's zombie deck).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Standard game, the player who gets the most uninfected survivors to the rescue station wins. Non-standard games can be played by increasing the number of locations that survivors must pass through and/or by reducing the number of survivors to start the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
