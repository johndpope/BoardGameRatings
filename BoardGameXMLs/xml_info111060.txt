			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 3rd-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 8, 13, or 18 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many years, the Western powers have been convinced that North Korea is developing clandestine nuclear weapons, despite both opposing treaty obligations and vehement denials. In August 1998, U.S. sources identified a potential site for the manufacture, testing, and storage of such devices at Hagap village, in P&amp;rsquo;youngan Pukto Province. Further investigation and evidence presented to the international community by the North Koreans showed that whatever was going on in Hagap, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the construction of a nuclear reactor or any other processing plant necessary to develop nuclear weapons. Suspicions were transferred to another location &amp;mdash; Kumchangni &amp;mdash; which was the subject of diplomatic debate for several years before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the name &amp;lsquo;Hagap&amp;rsquo; has re-emerged on the world stage. Recent satellite imagery has shown that work has intensified at the location, and the U.S. government has announced to the United Nations Security Council that a major threat exists and must be dealt with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
