			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long have you travelled and many are the dangers you have faced to reach this point... at last you have found the Keep of the Succubus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You look upon the tall stone wall of the keep grimly, knowing that you must confront the terrible seducer of men and make her pay for what she has done. Once the lines of kings were strong and proud - now there is no king. Once the noblemen trained knights to defend the people. Now there are no noblemen and no knights. All have fallen for her spell, this fell witch, this terrible sorceress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
