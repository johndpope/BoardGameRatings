							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Next England Captain</name>
									
			<description>Fight to create the best career in the mad world of football! Use cards to build your stories and triumph in this quickfire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next England Captain is a two to four player card game that faithfully models the career of a modern footballer; a challenge for everyone who's ever failed to earn millions by kicking things really well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a world where your celebrity wife matters more than the club you play for, but only if you have the right promo deals. It's a world where your status in the squad matters - but not very much - and where retirement is just another opportunity. Here, becoming England Captain has less to do with your footballing ability and more to do with whether you&amp;rsquo;re married with kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with nothing, you gain points as you move to bigger clubs, increasing your on-field stature, sponsorship, and your off-field respect. Careers may go down as well as up - so you won't have it all your own way - but capping it all off with a wise retirement can make all the difference. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
