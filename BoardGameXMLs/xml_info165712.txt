			<description>Potje Duizend (Game of Thousand in Dutch) is a simple game of dice throwing with a calculating aspect. Every player gets a sheet with a matrix of 9 cells, divided in 3 rows of 3 cells each. On his turn a player throws 1 die and notes his result in one of the cells on his sheet. Doing this he should try to achieve a result of one thousand (or as close as possible) when making a final addition if the matrix is full (by considering each row of 3 cells as a number and adding those 3 numbers). The player closest to thousand is the winner. Attention! If one of the diagonals shows 3 same numbers, this number may be multiplied by 10 and used as a bonus to come closer to thousand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
