			<description>RayForce (レイフォース)is a vertical space shooter style game by Taito released for the Taito F3 arcade hardware in 1994 and later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to trademark problems, when the home version was released in Japan it was renamed Layer Section. Finally, when Acclaim got a hold of it for the North American and European home releases, it was renamed yet again as Galactic Attack. To add more confusion, the game was also titled Gunlock in European arcades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is provided with a ship called the RVA-818 X-LAY, which is outfitted with two weapons: a primary weapon that fires straight lasers and increases in power when the player accumulates power-ups, and a secondary lock-on  missile launcher, which can also be increased in power, that can target up to eight enemies at once by moving the targeting reticle. This weapon is used to attack enemies that appear on a lower plane than that of your craft, which are inaccessible to the player's primary weapon. During play, the screen predominantly scrolls vertically, but there is some horizontal leeway as is common in games of this genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, RayForce , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
