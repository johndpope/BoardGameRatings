			<description>Brigade/Regiment-level simulation of the American Revolutionary War, specifically the Southern Campaign conducted between 1778 and 1782.  The four-sheet, 22&amp;quot;x16&amp;quot; strategic map is centered on the Carolinas, with portions of Virginia and Georgia also represented.  Approximately 250, half-inch counters represent the forces available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement of forces is by pre-plotted orders, with opposing forces ending the week in the same hex having their combat resolved on a separate set of geomorphic, tactical combat boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tactical combat system is rather advanced for the time, including such elements as LOS, panic, bayonet attacks, enfilade fire, cavalry charges, facing, and elevation advantages.  The strategic game also has rules for supply/foraging, lines of communication, weather, forced march, baggage trains, partisans, forts and garrisons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
