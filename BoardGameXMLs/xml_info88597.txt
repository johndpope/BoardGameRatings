			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for Four 7th-level Characters&lt;br/&gt;Featuring Material From Weapons of Legacy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Plume Mountain, the new revised adventure by Andy Collins, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, and James Wyatt, recasts the three famous weapons Blackrazor, Wave, and Whelm as legacy weapons and presents Lawrence Schick's entire dungeon fully revised and updated for D&amp;amp;D V.3.5. So if you've been looking for a classic adventure that you can use with the newest rules, download this web enhancement now and introduce your PCs to the wizard Keraptis and his minions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons of Legacy not only offers rules for creating weapons whose powers increase with their wielders&amp;rsquo; abilities, but it also provides a whole book of such weapons, each with fully detailed statistics. Legacy weapons are a convenient way to ensure that your characters don&amp;rsquo;t constantly have to &amp;quot;trade up&amp;quot; weapons to get items commensurate with their power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Plume Mountain is a D&amp;amp;D adventure for four 7th-level player characters (PCs) that utilizes the new material in Weapons of Legacy. The first version of this adventure was written by Lawrence Schick. Later, Bruce Cordell updated the original dungeon in Return to White Plume Mountain. Now designers Andy Collins, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, and James Wyatt have updated and expanded the adventure again, casting the three signature weapons as legacy weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main action takes place within the volcano known as White Plume Mountain, home of the ancient wizard Keraptis and his minions. The PCs may attempt to locate and remove one, two, or all three of the legacy weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, feel free to adapt the material presented here as you see fit to make it work with your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by;&lt;br/&gt;Outside the Mountain is Just as Dangerous as Inside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
