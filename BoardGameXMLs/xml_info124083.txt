							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Of Mice Men and Wizards: A Free RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...And the Great Rat said unto the smaller one: &amp;quot;Let There Be Blood Tonight, my Bonnie Wee Lad&amp;quot;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Rat Wars. This is the great chronicle of the mighty struggle between wizards, men, and rats. The war was started many cycles ago. It is a war of cheese, the lifeblood of the universe, but that would just be stupid. So the cheese is made of gold, and magical. You must now make the most important decision of your life: will you be a mouse, human, or wizard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game with 15 cheese points to spend on various attributes in the game. You also start with 15 attribute points to spend on the following attributes in any way you see fit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Awesomeness&lt;br/&gt;     Personality&lt;br/&gt;     Ass-Kicking&lt;br/&gt;     Smarts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher the attribute the greater the chance you have of learning an attribute from your chosen school. This will determine which powers are available to you with your cheese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's reiterate: YOU HAVE 15 CHEESE POINTS! NOT 10, NOT 100, 15!!! Good. You never know with these dang, powergamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amendment: You also get bonus cheese points to be spent only in your attribute equal to that attribute. So a wizard with 25 smarts would have 25 smarts points to spend etc. (15 cheese points +10 smarts from being a wizard). If you reach level 2 you would get 2 attribute points to raise your stats and 2 cheese points to spend etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
