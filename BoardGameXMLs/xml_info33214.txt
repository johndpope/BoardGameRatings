			<description>An entirely new map game requiring skill and judgment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exciting, interesting, and educative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A competitive game for 2-4 players in which the chief cities and towns are visited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt eight cards (two of each color).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player arranges the cards, so as to form a journey by the shortest route, starting and finishing at the nearest large town to where the players live, or to where the game is being played.  Players then set off on their journeys. Along the way watch out for collisions, traffic lights, and ferries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corresponding numbers on the cards and towns to be visited are given, to enable very young children to easily identify their route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first person to have visited their eight towns and returned home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 playing board&lt;br/&gt;     32 cards in 4 colors&lt;br/&gt;     4 metal cars&lt;br/&gt;     1 die&lt;br/&gt;     1 wooden dice shaker&lt;br/&gt;     rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
