			<description>The game board looks similar to a Carrom board, but the goal is not to sink disks into holes, but to flick rings against other rings and into certain areas in the center of the board where each ring counts a number of points. After the first ring is flicked, each further ring has to touch another ring to be able to score. There are also some obstacles on the board (around the center).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
