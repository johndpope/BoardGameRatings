			<description>From the Foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZENOBIA is the fantasy roleplaying game of adventure and magic in the ancient world. It is a world where the deserts are home to fierce Saracen tribes, lost cities, sphinx and scorpion-men. And where the cities are home to scheming princes, bandit kings and sinister cults. Opportunity and adventure are everywhere. There are centuries-old tombs to be robbed (if their fiendish residents can be defeated), ancient underground complexes full of obscure traps and breath-taking treasures that were left behind by the gods, palaces owned by fabulously wealthy kings, and temples dedicated to the gods - temples whose physical defences cannot compare with their magical enchantments. From hundred-gated Thebes to the oasis city of Palmyra, from the wealthy caravan city of Carrhae to the strict religious city of dusty Hierosolyma, adventure awaits the brave, the foolhardy and the greedy. And for those who fail, the Afterlife beckons, or worse - perhaps slavery on a rowing bench in a Tyrian war galley, or a life in the&lt;br/&gt;Turquoise mines of Sinai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
