			<description>[from the back of the book]&lt;br/&gt;The court of the Empress: a place of authority, chivalry, intrigue. The grandees of the kingdom spend time at the court of Rohajas to bask in the glory of the empire of Raul, and also to exert tangible political power. It takes no wonder that the rulers of Aventuria face the courtyard of the Middle Empire and send ambassadors, diplomats and spies to feel the pulse of the Empire. But the court is not only a place of authority. It is home to the Empress and her family, surrounded by nobles and commoners, knights and courtiers, advisors and sycophants. But it is at it's brightest splendor, when the nobles of the kingdom shall be summoned to the court day to decide the fate of the empire, when tents and halls become places of representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the imperial court started the eternal journey, it moves from Palatinate to Palatinate, from county to county to bring shine and power to places far from the old imperial city of Gareth. And the call that sends many ministers into sleepless nights lets simple people and the young knights tremble alike with anticipation: &amp;quot;The Empress is coming!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Reisende Kaiserin (The traveling Empress) presents the Imperial Court of the Middle Empire , with its officials and dignitaries , as well as its heroes and villains. In this sourcebook you will find a comprehensive overview of the actors on the court as well as a collection of palaces and  imperial fortresses, and a typical meeting of the nobles in the peaceful city of Ragath in Almada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
