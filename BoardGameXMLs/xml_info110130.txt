			<description>Ha-Shin is a tabletop miniature wargame set in fantasy medieval Japan, where the forces of Light battle the forces of Darkness. It was published in issue #9 (February 2002) of Ravage, a French miniature wargaming magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each mini has several stats describing its ability to move, shoot, fight and use &amp;quot;Chi&amp;quot; powers. The most important is Action Points (AP) which represent the character's life energy.&lt;br/&gt;A player's turn begins by choosing one of several tactics. Tactics influence how many figures can be activated, how many APs are recovered at the end of the turn and what figures can recover APs. The player then chooses which figures to activate, and expends the figure's APs to move, charge, use a ranged weapon or a Chi power. Each fight is duel; duel are resolved by secretly choosing a combat action for each combatant (which can give bonuses or penalties to die rolls), then rolling for initiative, then trying to beat the opponent's Armour score with 1d6 + the fighter attack score. Each damage point lowers the victim's APs, minis with no APs left must make a save roll each time they are wounded to avoid death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player standing wins the game, also players are encouraged to create scenarios and alternate victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include two army lists with classic Japanese folklore figures (samurais, ninjas, shaolin monks, kappas, onis...), a set of markers and tactical advice for both featured armies (Light and Darkness).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: skirmish (1 mini = 1 combatant, 1 cm = 1 m, a turn = a few seconds)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
