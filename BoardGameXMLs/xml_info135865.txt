			<description>In Duck-A-Roo, the little ducks quack happily and swim around the pond. They all want to follow their mother in order to be good ducks, so they try to keep pushing their way to the front of the line &amp;ndash; and with your help, they'll make it there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, place the twenty color tiles face down in the center of the table, then place the mama duck, with the three baby ducks in a row behind her. On a player's turn, she reveals the color of one of the face-down tiles. If it matches the color of the duck at the back of the line, she keeps the tile and scoots the duck forward so that it's right behind its mother. The player takes another turn, searching for a tile to match the color of the duck now at the back of the line. If the player doesn't find a tile of the proper color, her turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the final tile has been claimed from the center of the table, the game ends. Whoever has collected the most tiles wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
