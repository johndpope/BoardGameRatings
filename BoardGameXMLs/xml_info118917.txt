			<description>Kamen Rider: Climax Heroes (仮面ライダー クライマックスヒーローズ Kamen Raidā Kuraimakkusu Hīrōzu, Masked Rider: Climax Heroes) features the protagonists of the Heisei superhero Kamen Rider Series. It is the first Kamen Rider fighting game to be released onto the PlayStation 2 since Kamen Rider Kabuto. The game was released as part of the 10th anniversary of the Kamen Rider Series by Toei, TV Asahi, Ishimori Productions, and Bandai. The game spawned several updates for the Wii and PlayStation Portable consoles as well as an American version for the Wii based on Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat in the game operates on a basic three-button system, encompassing Weak Attack, Strong Attack, and Special Attacks (such as the various Rider Kicks). In addition to this, each Rider has the ability to perform a Form Change once the Rider Gauge at the bottom of the screen fills, whether by dealing or receiving damage or by charging the meter. Form Change can be used as a counter or to extend combos. A number of Riders also have the ability to summon Strikers, such as Ryuki's Contract Monster Dragredder or Den-O's DenLiner. Also, each Rider has a unique finisher called Rider Finale. This attack can only be activated when the Rider Gauge is full and press the R2 button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Decade Mode, the player follows Tsukasa Kadoya's journey through the nine Heisei Kamen Rider worlds as Kamen Rider Decade, fighting the other Riders and attempting to prevent the destruction of the worlds. Decade Mode differs from standard gameplay in that Decade's Form Change and Special Attacks are customizable with KamenRide Cards and Final FormRide Cards earned as the player progresses. The missions in the mode are divided by three levels, with the easiest missions can be played in Level 1 while the hardest can be found in Level 3. Level 2 and 3 can be unlocked as the player progress in Level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kamen Rider: Climax Heroes&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
