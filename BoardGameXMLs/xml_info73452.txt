			<description>From the designer:  Jidoka is a two-player abstract strategy game.  Each player starts with 12 pieces in the back row on a 12x10 checkerboard.  The pieces are numbered from one to seven and that number represents their movement capability.  Each player takes alternating two-stage turns in which they move pieces and may switch positions of pieces if desired.  The first player on the first turn may move only; no switching.  The goal is to capture two pairs of opposing pieces.  It is possible to win with just four captures, or to lose even after making eight captures.  It is being released in 2010 as a print-and-play playtest version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
