							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: Shattered Sphere</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In early 3061, Prince Victor Steiner-Davion returned from the Clan homeworlds triumphant&amp;mdash;but to an Inner Sphere that was radically different. The entire Ghost Bear population had relocated to the Inner Sphere; the St. Ives Compact was under siege; Katrina Steiner-Davion was sitting on the throne of New Avalon. Even with the overwhelming threat of the Clan invasion defeated, the Inner Sphere is still poised precariously between peace and war. Who will light the spark that will set BattleMechs marching and worlds aflame once more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on information from five scenario packs, seven sourcebooks and more than a dozen novels, Shattered Sphere represents the ultimate guide to the people and places of BattleTech, as seen through the eyes of the characters who live there. Offering a brief, comprehensive history of the universe and an in-depth look at events from the Truce of Tukayyid through early 3062, this update is a must for any BattleTech fan. Shattered Sphere also includes detailed maps showing the current state of the Inner Sphere and the Clans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Shattered Sphere was released at something of an odd time as it fell halfway through the release schedule of the BattleTech Field Manual series. It provides a general update on the major changes and events affecting the various Houses, Clans and major Periphery powers from the 3050s through to around 3061; the detailed state and border maps are very useful for BattleTech and BattleForce 2 campaigns, and this sourcebook is one of the few to touch on two of the up and coming Periphery powers, the Marian Hegemony and the Circinus Federation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
