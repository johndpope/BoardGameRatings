							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Celestial FireStorm</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose one of the five celestial animals to fight for supremacy of the skies - using fireworks! Connect firework tiles to gain territory, break up other firework collections, and battle for the largest section of the night sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with tiles, each tile is broken into four sections and contains four fireworks.  At the start of the game, players are dealt three tiles.  Then they choose the celestial animal they want to play - there can only be one player for each animal.  Players place their tiles in such a way as to connect the most fireworks for their animal together.  Tiles can be placed over other tiles, as long as the tile below isn't locked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play one tile from their hand.&lt;br/&gt;     Draw a new tile from the pool of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all the tiles have been placed.  At the end of the game, all the fireworks on the board are tallied for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes rules for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
