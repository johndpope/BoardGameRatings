							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadstorm Pirates</name>
									
			<description>Surround yourself in the &amp;quot;theater cabinet&amp;quot; of Deadstorm Pirates. Once inside, the player is immersed into the wonderful pirate story. You don't just play the game, you're in it! Unlike traditional shooters where players have to follow a set storyline and path, Deadstorm Pirates has 4 selectable stages giving players a fresh new adventure with each play. Play the game in the order you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use both the recoiling gun and mounted steering wheel to shoot enemies and navigate through treacherous water all throughout the game. A new feature rewards cooperative play, a more powerful shot is created when players shoot the same target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See if you have what it takes to sail the stormy seas and claim &amp;quot;Poseidon's Breath.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
