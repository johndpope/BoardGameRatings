			<description>In Rigamaroles, players compete over a series of rounds to be the last two players standing. In each round, role chits will be placed in the center of the room. When given the &amp;quot;GO&amp;quot; by the moderator, players race, and grab one chit. That chit determines the role that player will act out. There will always be one other player in the group who is acting out the same role. Each player must find his/her match quickly, link arms, and sit down on the outside of the room to be safe for the next round. In each round, the last two players standing are ELIMINATED! Play continues as such until there are only two players left and those two players are crowned the Rolemasters for that game! Play several games for a full night of laughs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays quickly. Averaging about one minute per number of players! You can play it with as many players as you wish. In fact, the more the merrier! Unlike other player-elimination games, Rigmaroles is such a blast to watch, and the rounds go so quickly, that nobody minds being eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although players must know how to read to play, there is a variant that allows even non-reading children to join in on the fun. So players of all ages will enjoy Rigamaroles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
