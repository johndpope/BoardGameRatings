							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nine Holes</name>
									
			<description>Nine Holes is played on a 3x3 square grid in which the spaces have three different colors. Each player has three pieces which start off the board. Players take turns entering the pieces on the board and then (assuming no one has won) moving a piece to an adjacent space (including diagonally).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to get all three of one's pieces into an orthogonal line or on all three spaces of one color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
