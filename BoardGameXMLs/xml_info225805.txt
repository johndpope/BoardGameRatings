							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Norticles: Hattrick</name>
									
			<description>The &amp;ldquo;Hattrick&amp;rdquo;  game presents one of the episodes from the Norticles universe, which took place during  prince Linnamen&amp;rsquo;s detective journeys. He was one of the private investigators secretly hired by the town authorities, and it was his conclusions that let the inhabitants of Loch Scarland inform the investigators from the capital city, where to look for the fugitive murderer. Karn did not mention this in his report, so as not to expose the inhabitants to repressions due to the illegal involvement of prince Linnamen. &lt;br/&gt;During the game of &amp;ldquo;Hattrick&amp;rdquo;, the players become the characters of this story. They may once again solve the duel between the two antagonists  (Karn and Milton), changing not only its progress, but also the final outcome. This variant is available also in  the &amp;ldquo;print and play&amp;rdquo; version, which can be found on &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.norticles.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.norticles.com&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;br/&gt;In the box version, you can get to know other characters involved in the story, which will make it possible for you to play alternative scenarios. Among the characters, you will see prince Linnamen, the monks Rafael Gabriel and Augustine, and Mid Guns, the villain. All the characters come from the gamebook titled &amp;bdquo;The Wasteland&amp;rdquo;, where some of the events also take place in a wooden hut. The Hattrick game is therefore a perfect addition to prince Linnamen&amp;rsquo;s adventures in the Kaer-Nar-Nort wasteland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://norticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Wasteland_demo.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://norticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Wasteland_de...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
