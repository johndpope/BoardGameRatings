			<description>A simple card game for 2 to 6 players based on the world of Agent 13.  The game was published in 13: Assassin magazine #4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically a rummy-like game where some of the cards have special powers.  Cards are melded to the table either in front of the person who played it or in front of an opponent.  Each card has a specific number of points... either positive or negative (range -4 to +4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have cards totaling 12 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
