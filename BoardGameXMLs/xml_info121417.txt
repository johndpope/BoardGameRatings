			<description>Embark on a tropical adventure with this explosively charged puzzle game. Big Kahuna Party is a match-3 game with several new innovations designed to provide a frenzied and fun multiplayer experience for up to 4 players. Alternatively, if you're looking to relax, you can play single player and enjoy level after level set in beautiful Tiki themed environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With intuitive Wii specific controls, players can swap tiles faster and more fluidly than ever before using either just the Wii Remote, or with both the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk. That speed will come in handy in the multiplayer modes, where the underwater matching madness can get intense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Kahuna Party also features Bombs! Created as players make matches of 5 or more, explosives come in various sizes from little sticks of dynamite to huge nuclear bombs. These are especially useful in multiplayer competitive matches where players race to own the most territory by clearing squares before their competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With nearly a hundred levels sure to keep players entertained for hours and friendly casual game play that ensures everyone in the family can join in on the fun, Big Kahuna Party is an unbeatable way to take the family on a tropical holiday from the comfort of your own living room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
