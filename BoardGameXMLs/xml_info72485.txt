			<description>&amp;quot;Monster Party is a video game for the NES, released in the U.S. in 1989 by Bandai. It was and remains a relatively obscure platform game for the console, having a small following among some players. Prototype screenshots of a Japanese Famicom version exist, but the game was never released in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Party is very standard platform game featuring horror themes. The main character, Mark, teams up with a gargoyle-looking creature called Bert, and together they attempt to save Bert's home, the Dark World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Party is notorious for prototype images released in Japan before the game's release in the US. The Japanese images of the game reveal the title screen to be covered in blood and the enemies to look much more horrific than in the final game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critics of the game almost always cite the game as being bizarre and note that the weird factors of the game are what make it stand out. The 8-bit blood and the use of the word &amp;quot;hell&amp;quot; in a later level also interests critics, as Bandai and Nintendo were big supporters of video game censorship in 1989 when the game was released.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Monster_Party,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
