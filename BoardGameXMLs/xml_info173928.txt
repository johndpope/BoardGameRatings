			<description>Rise again, noble V&amp;ouml;lva! You are being given a second chance for Glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you walk the grey and barren lands of Helheim, songs of Valhalla fill your heart and empower your very soul.&amp;nbsp; However, you are V&amp;ouml;lva, a seer or &amp;lsquo;wand carrier&amp;rsquo;.  Unlike warriors that got to fight and die in battle to be carried off to Valhalla, you were only an adviser and tactician who assisted by drawing upon the power of the Runes to help your fellow warriors in their battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, Freya smiles upon you and offers redemption to the V&amp;ouml;lva who can prove their abilities.  By using the runes to create gateways, you must work your way up from Helheim to Asgard.  By being victorious in challenges and tests of strength, you gain valour and come one step closing to being accepted in Valhalla!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;Innl&amp;oslash;sning is an abstract 2 player rune casting game where players are fallen V&amp;ouml;lva souls in Helheim looking for redemption so that they may enter Valhalla, the hall of the Chosen.  Players must create gateways, starting in Helheim, and sequentially working their way up to Asgard.  By casting the runes, they will generate power to create those gateways and activate them.  However, this is not enough to gain entrance to Valhalla.  You must also gain enough valour by using the runes to overcome challenges, or to defeat your rival, by drawing upon the strength provided by the gateways.  When you have earned enough valour and opened all the gateways, only then will you be allowed entrance to Valhalla!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have gateways in each of the 9 realms, open all their gateways and have 11 valour wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
