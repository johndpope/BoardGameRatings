			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between 1837 and 1901, Great Britain found itself in a virtual state of constant warfare. Military expeditions undertaken to protect and expand the Empire became an accepted facet of Victorian life.  When compared to great military encounters such as the Seven Years War, the Napoleonic Wars, and the unprecedented World Wars of the Twentieth Century, Britain's colonial wars were small affairs. Yet each produced a more prominent and stronger Empire. The entire period is a portrait of British martial zeal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a set of highly playable rules that is well thought out and well tested  The rules allow for the playing of battles covering Britain's colonial wars in Egypt and the Sudan between the years 1881 and 1898. Also included is one introductory scenario and three historically based scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are designed to play any size action using figure scales between 15mm and 25/30mm,  Modifications for the use of smaller scle figures is easy. We recommend the mounting of of multiple smaller figures on the same size bases given for 15mm figures.  The unit scale is variable. The rules allow for a flexible playing scale that can be used to play small patrol level games up to the largest battle of the period, Omdurman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
