			<description>L'Imagination au Pouvoir (&amp;quot;Imagination in Power&amp;quot;) was published in the Swiss gaming zine &amp;quot;AHA&amp;quot; #88/2. It is a challenging game about the confrontation between the police and the protesters during a fictive demonstration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 15 demonstrator tokens and 4 leaders of protest marches on one side; 10 policemen, 10 anti-demo troups, 3 police cars, 3 anti-demo cars and 1 water gun on the police side, but only some of those tokens are placed on the board, when the game begins:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- the 4 protest march leaders start from all 4 corners of the board, 8 demonstrators are place anywhere on the board.&lt;br/&gt;- the 10 policemen and the 3 police cars are placed on the 3 police headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, 1-4 demonstrators enter play - if there are tokens left outside the board (demonstrators can be arrested in prison for 2 turns). The anti-demo tokens enter play, when the demonstrators have succeeded to win some morale points and the Morale Index has reached a value of 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The so called &amp;quot;Morale index&amp;quot; is a scale from 1-15 points. The game starts with a Morale index of 6. Successful actions (winning fights, repulsements of opponents, finished protest marches, imprisonments and others) change the index by 1 or 2 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be won either by eliminating all opponents or when the Morale index reaches 15 (demonstrators victory) or 0 (police victory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
