			<description>Tossed Together is a fun, high energy, word guessing party game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players work together as a team to give a clue to their teammate for a word that is on a card they've drawn. The catch is, teammates can only say one word of the clue at a time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The first guesser draws a card and holds it so the other players can see the card, but the card&amp;rsquo;s information is hidden from the guesser.&lt;br/&gt;     Starting with the player to the left of the guesser, the other players on this team give a clue to the guesser &amp;ldquo;One Word At A Time&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;     If the players giving the clue break any clue rules, the team loses one point and a new card is drawn.&lt;br/&gt;     When any clue giving player feels the clue is complete, they ring the bell. Once the bell is rung, the guesser makes one guess trying to correctly identify what&amp;rsquo;s written on the card. &lt;br/&gt;     The card is scored: A correct guess is worth one point. An incorrect guess is not worth any points. &lt;br/&gt;     The player to the left of the guesser becomes the new guesser and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;     When time runs out, continue the clue for the current card. After the guess is made, the round ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
