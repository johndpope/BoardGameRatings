							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkest Tides</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure begins in earnest when the heroes arrive at Cata'Lasis or Respite&amp;mdash;places that conceal a connection between worlds. Ranking members of the heroes' organization have sent the characters to the island in response to a request for aid. The aid requests are in response to numerous sightings of unusual creatures that have taken place in the area. Tracking the corrupted beings uncovers a larger tunnel complex. Examination of the caverns reveals that they are the remains of something ancient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkest Tides is a full length adventure for a band of Rangers from Shaintar. It can also be adapted for  Witchmarked heroes from Accursed. The adventure may be played as a standalone, or it may integrated into a larger campaign. It follows a four act structure, while also providing details on the regions of Cata'Lasis in Shaintar and the corresponding city of Respite on Morden from Accursed. Darkest Tides includes necessary game mechanics and opportunity for tasks that can be resolved in a variety of ways. Conversion notes are provided for transferring characters between the two settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shaintar: Legends Arise and Accursed provides additional details about the setting used in this scenario, however, only Shaintar: Legends Arise is required to fully make use of the game mechanics presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
