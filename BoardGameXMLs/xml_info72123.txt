			<description>User summary, some information details from Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Blood (L&amp;rsquo;Arche du capitaine Blood in French) is a French video game for the Atari ST from 1988 made by ERE Informatique (soon relabeled with their short-lived Exxos label) and released by Infogrames. It was later re-released in the UK by Players Premier Software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is rather unique: The player controls a lone space captain supposed to find and destroy the last five of his own clones, and to do so, he must make contact with aliens living on other planets and communicate with them, making them reveal the coordinates for the next planet to go to. Having reached a planet, the player must steer a landing probe over a fractal landscape trying to reach the alien. Once having reached the alien, the game changes into a strange chat session. As the aliens all speak different languages, the player's ship is equipped with a function that translates all speech into a simplified symbol-based text language. The player must thus chat with the aliens, using these symbols, to gain their trust and have them reveal what they know, and especially reveal coordinates for a new planet to go to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title tune is a stripped down version of &amp;quot;Ethnicolor&amp;quot; by Jean Michel Jarre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Captain_Blood_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits:&lt;br/&gt;Didier Bouchon: design&lt;br/&gt;philippe Ulrich: design&lt;br/&gt;Jean-Michel Jarre: Composer (Amiga)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
