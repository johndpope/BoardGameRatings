			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SRD: Super Real Darwin is a vertical scrolling shooter developed by Data East. The game is based in the future on the planet Lakya. The Lakyans unwittingly release the planetary lifeforce which is harnessed by the inhabitants of the nearby planet of Cokyo. The Cokyoans use the lifeforce to create biomechanical ships that they use to invade Lakya. The Lakyans develop their own biomechanical ships to defend their planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls one of these Lakyan ships as they fly through levels defeating the invasion forces. There are a number of different pickups that will make the ship more effective in combat, including armor, speed, and attack upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of SRD is the Evol pickup. These icons will transform the ship into another, stronger form. These transformations would last for a minute before they expired unless the player collected another Evol icon, in which case the ship would upgrade to an even more powerful form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
