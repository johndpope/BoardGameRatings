							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1500: The New World</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1500 - The New World is a board game for 2 to 6 players! Each game sets-up in 10 minutes and plays in under a hour! The fast flowing game play is perfect for casual and serious gamers ages 12 and up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a color for their tokens, and then places their Victory tokens and Royal Support tokens on the map. They also gather their Colony tokens in front of them in preparation for conquest! Set-up concludes with each player receiving their starting cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn, you get to play those cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards can be played for their text. There are two types of cards: Action cards are tan, and you play them during your turn. Reaction cards are red and are played in reaction to other players' playing cards. Each player, on their turn, can play as many Action cards as they are able to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card can also be played to perform one of several basic actions. A card can be played to do any of the following: build a colony, reduce a colony, repair a colony, or adjust Royal Support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have finished playing cards, you get to tally up your points for the turn. You receive one point for each successful colony you have on the map, and a bonus of two more victory points for each of your export or regional monopolies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the other players then takes a turn. Once everyone has had a turn, advance the Time Counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when you move the Turn token into the Game Over square. The winner of the game is the player with the most Victory Points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
