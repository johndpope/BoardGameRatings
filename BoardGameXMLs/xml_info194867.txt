			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game have two types of Attributes - Talents, including Physical, Cunning, and Magical; and Attributes, including Influence, Honor, and Enlightenment.  Characters also have derived values and a variety of narrative Traits.  Attributes have numeric values that typically are set at 6 but may range from 5-7; Talents have a score that represents the dice pool associated with that Attribute.  The game assumes constant conflict for the characters, though combat is viewed as only a minor component of conflict (and an undesirable component, at that).  Action resolution utilizes dice pool rolls.  Characters can sacrifice Honor points for temporary boosts in other areas (generally, an increased dice pool for one action).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
