			<description>World War II land combat with military miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;World War II - The Way It Really Was!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G.I. Commander was designed primarily for use with microscale (1:285/1:300) models, but with the minor modifications indicated in the rules, it can be used with HO scale equipment. It can even be used with board game equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game lies in the data section. Here you will find information in detail unmatched anywhere [...] But G.I. Commander is much more than just a collection of data. The rules have been designed, tested and revised to produce a game that is as playable as it is accurate. Wherever possible, bookkeeping has been eliminated, and you will find that your main struggle is with your opponent, not with the procedures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, condensed in one book, is more information than is normally found in more expensive volumes. With G.I. Commander, you can experience all the dynamic and multifaceted possibilities of World War II, from Normandy to New Guinea, Archangel to Alamein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A4 rulebook, 30 pages of basic rules, 25 of ddvanced rules, and 20 pages of data tables. Game scale: 1&amp;quot; = 50 yards, 1 turn = 5 minutes. Unit scale: micro-scale (1:285/1:300) = 1:1 for vehicles and guns and 1 base : 1 squad for infantry, HO scale (1:72) = 1 base : 1 platoon (vehicle, gun, infantry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
