			<description>Take2 &amp;quot;The fast thinking word game&amp;quot; comes with instructions and 120 letter tiles.  Each player starts with 8 tiles and uses them to make words in crossword/scrabble style in front of themselves. When one player has used all their tiles they call &amp;quot;Take2&amp;quot; and all players draw 2 more tiles to add to their stock. Words can be rearranged at any time and play continues until all tiles are in the players hands and one has used all their tiles. At that time points on tiles not in use count against those players. Several rounds can be played, adding the scores and the lowest scoring player winning after the agreed number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
