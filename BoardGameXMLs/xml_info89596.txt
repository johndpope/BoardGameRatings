							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jackle &amp; Wide</name>
									
			<description>Game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last after years of research Dr Jackle has finally acquired the formula for the transforming potion. Without knowing how long the transformation process will last or even if it is possible to reverse the effects, he mixes the elements together and watches, transfixed, as the liquid bubbles and foams in the glass. This is the moment he has been waiting for.&lt;br/&gt;Locking and bolting the doors to his laboratory, Dr Jackle raises the glass and swallows the potion...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transformation is a success, the potion actually works, but if Dr Jackle could possibly have known beforehand that he would assume the personality and characteristics of Mr Wide he would have never taken it. Mr Wide is a completely evil man, the exact opposite in every respect of Dr Jackle - the transformation provess must be reversed, but how?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his eagerness to experiment with the potion Dr Jackle neglected to prepare an antidote, but there is one person who might just be able to help him. Dr Piqued his sworn enemy and rival created the formula, so he may have an antidote. The problem is finding it. Dr Piqued's secret laboratory lies below ground, hidden in a maze of sewers below Hyde Park. The antidote must be kept there, but getting to it is no easy&lt;br/&gt;matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is comprised of 2 sections, above ground in Hyde Park and below ground in the old converted sewers Dr Piqued uses as a hideout and secret laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 1 - The Park&lt;br/&gt;Your progress through the park depends on how good you are at solving the various puzzles which crop up along the way. You must solve these in order to progress and there are a few hints scattered around. Just to give an idea of what you're likely to come up against, one task you will be set is to gain entrance to the quarry. To do this you need to go into one of the underground labyrinths, to do this you need to cut a path to it, and to cut a path you need... got the picture? Most of the objects you will come across do have a ause and you are&lt;br/&gt;able to Take, Drop and List these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2 - In the Underground Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;There are nine sewers for you to get lost in before you reach the hideout containing the all important antidote - and as if that wasn't bad enough the sewers abound with all sorts of nasty creatures who don't take too kindly to strangers nosing around. They will do their level best to prevent you from reaching the antidote - so keep a look out. If you do happen to come into contact with any of them your energy level will decrease. A word of warning, try not to let it get too low! Should you decide you want to leave a particular labyrinth,&lt;br/&gt;you will find yourself back in the park and you will not be able to re-enter that particular labyrinth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
