			<description>Due to budget cuts,the entire police force in your city has been laid off and now every villain in town is running wild!&lt;br/&gt; The crime wave is raging out of control and it's up to you and your fellow costumed heroes to take matters into your own hands!&lt;br/&gt; Each player begins as an inexperienced vigilante with barely enough crime fighting skill to take on even the most inept villain. On each turn, players divide their time between training their hero, fighting crimes, and reverse-engineering villain technology to use as their own. &lt;br/&gt;By the end of the game each Hero is stronger, faster and equipped with the re-purposed Villain Technology he needs to take on even the toughest Arch Villain! The player who brings the most notorious villains to justice wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
