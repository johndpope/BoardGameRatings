			<description>&amp;quot;They Couldn't Hit an Elephant at this distance&amp;quot; were the last words of Federal general John Sedgwick, seconds before he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania in 1864.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Couldn't Hit An Elephant is designed to deal with divisional- or corp-sized encounters in a normal club evening, the basic manoeuvre element being either the regiment or brigade (depending on the level of game chosen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based in part on previous Lardie rules I Ain't Been Shot Mum! and La Feu Sacre, TCHAE looks to provide enjoyable American Civil War miniatures gaming in typical Lardie &amp;quot;Play the period, not the rules&amp;quot; fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn sequence is card driven, so each commander has a card in the game deck and he takes his turn when his card comes up. Depending on his quality he will have a certain number of command points (variable by dice roll) to use in that turn. Easy things take few command points, more complex things take more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are designed to play quickly, each scale ten minute turn should, with a couple of games under your belt, take no more than ten minutes of real time, so there will be less down time than many &amp;quot;IGOUGO&amp;quot; rule systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
