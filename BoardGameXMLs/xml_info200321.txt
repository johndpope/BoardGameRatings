			<description>Winner, Best Use of Themes/Techniques for Evoking Empathy, 2015 Golden Cobra Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Golden Cobra website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous Golden Cobra winner Heather Silsbee returns with a sometimes searing, sometimes thoughtful, and always playable game about women with social anxiety. Many Golden Cobra games this year address empathy directly, but Just Lunch stands out as a game that combines visceral empathy with sharp, engaging gameplay. Just Lunch is for three people, and like the title says, it&amp;rsquo;s just lunch - but &amp;ldquo;lunch&amp;rdquo; is a minefield of energy-draining triggers for the anxious. And these women are anxious. This game captured the dynamics of social anxiety in casual interaction so well that some of us winced just reading it, and its effectiveness at evoking empathy played out by teaching us new things about how social anxiety works. We particularly liked Just Lunch&amp;rsquo;s careful framing, which provides both context for players unfamiliar with social anxiety and useful tools for exploring it in safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
