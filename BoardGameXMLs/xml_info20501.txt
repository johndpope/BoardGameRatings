							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Relax Wow</name>
									
			<description>Wow is the first game produced by Enjoy Board Game Co.  The owner of the company said &amp;quot;Frankly, 'Relax Wow' is our first product, so it's not enough to compete other famous board games from overseas.  However, we think that simplicity and interactivity of our game are great merits of our game that may not be found in other board games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wow consists simply of players turning over the top card of a stack they hold in their hand.  If the card they flip matches another color on the table, they must throw both hands up in the air, shouting &amp;quot;Wow!&amp;quot;.  Players who do this incorrectly receive all the cards on the table.  Certain cards have different effects - and the player who discards all of their cards first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
