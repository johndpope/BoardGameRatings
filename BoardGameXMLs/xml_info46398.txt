							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aliens Among Us</name>
									
			<description>This is a supplement for the Bureau 13 Stalking the Night Fantastic roleplaying game. It is 96 pages long and contains 9 Complete Adventures and 7 Bureau 13 Agency Information Files. The remaining text from the back of the book reads as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOOK BEHIND YOU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They've been here a long, long time. They shook the ground as they walked, and our ancestors called them gods. We look to the stars to find alien life, but they are in our schools, behind the eyes of our children. Sometimes the very air we breathe carries an unearthly intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we meet them, we are forever changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If we are lucky they are hapless travellers shipwrecked on our solar shore. Otherwise we are prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may make a meal of us, but BUREAU 13 is going to get a sandwich off of them. Eat or be lunch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
