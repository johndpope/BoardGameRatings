							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inspector Moss Investigates</name>
									
			<description>A terrible murder has been committed and it looks as if the perpetrator will get away with the crime. That is, until Inspector Moss takes on the case. With a degree of skill and a small amount of luck, do you have what it takes to solve this appalling crime?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this themed rummy game, players lay sets of suspects while attempting to conceal vital evidence cards that point to the identity of the murderer. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to conceal evidence, simply keep the card in your hand. Of course, by doing this you risk being caught out and having to pay heavily in points - not to mention the card that you wanted to keep secret is now revealed to all. Balance your hand and know when to purposely reveal your evidence to double your points total and boost your overall score, but don&amp;rsquo;t give too much information away to your opponents!  Never fear though, as the astute sleuth, Inspector Moss, is always on hand to provide you with some assistance into your inquiries. If you are able to &amp;lsquo;go out&amp;rsquo; with your cards and are able to identify the murderer, congratulations, you will be rewarded handsomely in points, however, your opponents will not be so lucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspector Moss Investigates is a free PnP rummy game developed for the 2009 Themed Rummy Contest (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3867905#3867905&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3867905#3867905&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
