			<description>Golf Ace strives to simulate the intricacies of golf in a card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comprises four boards, depicting golf holes of various lengths and bearing different hazards, two packs of (conventional) playing cards and comprehensive playing instructions including example holes for the novice to play through.   Each hole has a dominant suit (hearts, clubs, diamonds or spades) and a stroke is made by playing a combination of cards to determine the distance and lie.  Thus playing a 2 + King (picture cards count as 0 or 10) + Ace, equates to a drive of 201 yards. Only certain distances are permitted, as shown on a distance table on each board, and certain cards may land you in a hazard (which, tactically, may still be worth playing).  Playing a card not of the dominant suit incurs a one stroke penalty.  A player may opt to draw from the stock, in the hope of improving his position, or play a stroke with the cards he has been dealt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golf Ace works best with 4 players, but can be played as a solitaire, trying to beat your own lowest score for a round of 9 or 18 holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
