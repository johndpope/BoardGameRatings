			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Teaches Typing 2 is a computer game developed by Brainstorm and published by Interplay Entertainment. As with the previous game, Mario Teaches Typing 2 was designed to teach children to type. In it, Mario and Luigi must recover the pieces of a magical typewriter that was destroyed when Mario incorrectly typed a magical phrase which would destroy Bowser's castle on it. When all the pieces are recovered and the typewriter is repaired, Mario is able to type the phrase correctly and destroy Bowser's castle. The game also features a number of Claymation sequences featuring a disembodied Mario head who talks to the player. Players can choose to select to take a placement test (which is scored based upon accuracy and speed) or participate in lessons (whether in order or selected individually). Also, the sequel has numerous new features, including a customizable certificate of achievement, color coded on-screen keyboard, and customizable lesson plans. Mario was once again voiced by Charles Martinet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
