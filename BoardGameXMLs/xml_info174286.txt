			<description>From the inlay (Play It Again Sam Compilation re-release):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many years, a war has ensued between the Allied Nations and the Volgans. The battle was reaching a stalemate position, but recently the Allies, through good intelligence work and some luck, have managed to obtain the plans of the Volgans' next offensive. If the Allied Forces can capitalise on these plans they can end the impasse and the war. You play the role of Commander John Stryker commissioned to take this top-secret information to the Allies' HQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stryker's Run is a sideways scrolling run and gun game for the BBC Micro and Electron. You are armed with a laser pistol and grenades but can also commandeer vehicles and aircraft that provide more powerful weaponry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Design and Original Ideas by: C.
