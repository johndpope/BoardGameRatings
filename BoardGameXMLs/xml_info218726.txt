			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an ancient and beautiful city, isolated from the rest of the world, an air of peace and tranquility rules the scene. But beneath that air is a stench of corruption. Those who have power plot to keep it from those who don't. Those who don't, plot to take it from those who do. Everyone seems to want something that they can't have, and everyone seems to blame everyone else for their troubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
