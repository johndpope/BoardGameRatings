			<description>The playing board shows 12*16 tiles. Most of them show a piece of cheese, or sometimes a cat. On 6 tiles there is an image of six different sweets (cake, ice cream, ...). At last there is one starttile.&lt;br/&gt;There are also 18 cardboard pieces with 3 times the 6 different sweets.&lt;br/&gt;The last part of the game is a cardboard square with in the middle of it a hole. This is the mousecard.&lt;br/&gt;The first player moves the hole of the mousecard accross the starttile. The first of the 18 sweets is revealed. Now the player moves the mousecard accross the board in the direction of the same sweet as shown on the board. At every tile passed he verifies the nature of the tile. If it is a piece of chees then he continues. But if the cat appears the turn goes to the next player. When at last the tile with the same sweet appears the player on turn receives the sweet.&lt;br/&gt;Now the next sweet is revealed and the game continues. &lt;br/&gt;The player winning 4 sweets wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
