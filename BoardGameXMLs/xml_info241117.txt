			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who ever heard of a civilized gnoll?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stories of a secluded valley full of peaceful gnolls have been swirling for years, the occasional nonviolent encounters dismissed as tall tales or unique oddities. Now you are about to discover these gnolls for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rumors are true...but the full truth is a secret more terrible than anyone knew. A sect of the tribe maintain the magical peace by a terrible ritual sacrifice--not of blood, but of memory. The gnolls who undergo it become Forgotten, losing their identity and becoming a stranger to the clan who once knew and loved them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the truth behind the valley's protection? Will the gnolls be allowed to continue living in peace? Or will their only hope become Forgotten?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forget Me Not is an adventure for 4 characters of 5th to 10th level, lasting approximately 4-5 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
