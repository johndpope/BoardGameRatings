			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four to six 5th-level agents may play (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 10, 15, or 20 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ryan Sean Mavroy (aka Viper) has a vision of global conquest. Early on, he used his expansive resources to establish a power base in India, and later, his operatives infiltrated The Krypt, a well-meaning espionage organization operating out of Russia. It was through these moles that he discovered the linchpin for his current activities: a WWII Nazi research effort codenamed Messiah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the Terrortory storyline season, Viper&amp;rsquo;s minions &amp;mdash; including the agents &amp;mdash; have searched for this research. First they acquired several photographs during Proving Ground, and then they kidnapping the last surviving member of the research team and acquired some of his encrypted findings in SPA6-01: The Divinity Thieves. Viper later captured a mysterious mercenary named Core, whose physiology was augmented with Messiah science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
