							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bomb the Navy</name>
									
			<description>This game uses marbles to Bomb the Navy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game originally came with unpunched cardboard ships with little cardboard stands, marbles, and a set of instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the glass marbles to try to knock of the ships.  However, it appears that some versions use projectile pellets and rubber bands with a wooden cannon instead of marbles.  The number of ships also appears to vary with some editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who shoots down as many ships as possible within three shot attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most sources place the initial publishing date as 1940, but this may be only an approximate date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
