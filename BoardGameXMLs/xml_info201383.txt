			<description>Mystery Solitaire integrates classic cases of murder and mayhem into a mix-and-match multi-deck twist on the classic game of Klondike/Patience. Take on the role of a sleuth and choose which case you will solve. Shuffle your deck of 52 cards together and you are ready to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the abilities on Sleuth cards to help with the investigation while negotiating the obstacles presented on Crime cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win by playing all cards from your deck and tableau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single deck provides hours of single player enjoyment. However, multiple decks allow players to mix-and-match characters as well as unlocking the ability to play a two-player variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you alone find the clues?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
