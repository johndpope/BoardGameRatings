			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snow-White and Rose-Red is a fairy tale adventure where you take control of Snow-White and/or her sister Rose-Red. The goal is to save the Enchanted Bear, who once was a prince but has fallen under a vile curse from the Ungrateful Dwarf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To defeat the Ungrateful Dwarf you need to steal back the treasure he stole from the prince or you need to remove his source of power - his luxuriant beard - with a pair of scissors. Explore the woods near Mother's Cottage, rescue trapped animals, and make sure you never have more than four curses upon you at a time! Will you be able to save the Enchanted Bear and defeat the Ungrateful Dwarf? Or will you become cursed too?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the sisters travel to different locations around the board to have encounters.  These encounters can lead to rescuing animal companions, gaining useful items, collection treasure, encountering the Ungrateful Dwarf, or encountering the Enchanted Bear.  Watch out for the curses!  Curses make it harder for the sisters to complete their goals!  The encounters at the locations are different depending on which sisters are present, and if both sisters are there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played solo where one person controls one or two of the sisters, or can be played as a full co-op where both sisters quest to save the Enchanted Bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
