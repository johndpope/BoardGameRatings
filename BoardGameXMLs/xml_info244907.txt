							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dacians: The Ursyr</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far, far to the north, beyond the mighty, Felstone Mountains and past the northern river-deltas lay the Bruinholdt, as it is known by those who inhabit it, and the fewer still that are ambitious enough to travel there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is a region that occupies much of the area from the eastern Narwood, well into the western foothills of the Tharwall Mountains. A rugged land claimed and loosely controlled by an impressive, mixed-tribal-confederacy of sorts and cultural commingling of several distinct types of advanced, ursine humanoids. Internally, they are known as the Ursyr; to everyone else, they are simply the Dacians.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~Gaergath Helheim, Travelogues, Tall-Tales, &amp;amp; Other Tediums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert Fairbanks second offering with Storm Bunny Studios, the Dacians (the Ursyr) is a completely new humanoid race of evolved bears. Able to walk on two legs, these large and powerful humanoids continue to honor the traditions of their ancestors. Primitive in appearance, these powerful creatures are at home in the cold, whether that is atop the mountains they call home, or in the windswept tundras below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for inclusion into the world of Rhune: Dawn of Twilight, the Dacians offer both players and GMs a completely new humanoid race for their 5e game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This concise PDF offers racial stats for the Ursyr, the Berendi (black bear), Berengar (brown bear), Bjordiak (blonde bear), and Nanuaki (ice bear).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
