			<description>CoDi is a game about majorities in a dodecahedron for 2-4 players. The board depicts the 20 corners of the dodecahedron and each corner is connected to exactly 3 other corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn the player puts a stone of his color on one of the 20 corners. Stones from other colors on neighbouring corners are removed if the played stone if there already was a stone of the other player's color adjacent to them before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all 20 corners have stones on them with the player with the most stones on the board being the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
