			<description>This is a Warpspawn card game.  Each player strives to have founded the most successful Hittite Empire by time the 10th King card is played.  Players draw and maintain hands of Power Cards - economics, religion, diplomacy, disasters, militaries, politics - each has a value which can be used to bid on Empire cards - kings &amp;amp; wars - which may allow you to also acquire  cities, cultures, vassals, bronze.  After the bidding phase comes an event phase when Power cards can be discarded to acquire Empire cards or cause others to discard cards. Periodically - at end of Old (4th King) Middle (7th King) New (10th and last King)Kingdoms - players get victory points for different types and amounts of Empire cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
