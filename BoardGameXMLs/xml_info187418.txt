			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reel Adventures presents a system that attempt to recreate a cinematic style role-playing game with fast action and structured narrative arc.  The system does not us a Game Master, instead cycling similar responsibilities among all players.  The game is atypical in the amount of planning and setup that is needed before play begins. The group generates a &amp;quot;Reel Script&amp;quot; that features a synopsis and four &amp;quot;Acts&amp;quot; that guide the session and form the narrative arc.  Play then proceeds based largely upon shared narrative development.  Characters have three Abilities (Action, Emotion, Brains) that determine a dice pool for contested action resolution.  The mechanic is a simple die pool roll vs. die pool roll with the highest total winning.  The remainder of character generations focuses on methods to maintain a rapidly-paced narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was provided as three downloadable PDF files--a one-page character sheet, a three-page Reel Script, and a twenty-one page rules document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
