			<description>From the Publisher Catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMMBAT is a strategic and tactical battle game that will allow you (interacting through your computer) to pit your skill and dexterity against another player and their computer in a real-time battle to the death!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your opponent are located in a 4096-square-kilometer combat reservation with exactly the same resources available to each, the outcome to be governed only by the skills of the players. As soon as you have established serial communication with your enemy (110 to 9600 baud modem or direct connection), the battle begins! You decide which weapons to carry, then load them onto and manuever up to eight remote controlled tanks with the primary goal of finding and destroying your enemy's base before he can do the same to you. Each enemy tank that you can defeat in combat lessens his chances of finding you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offensive and defensive weapons available to you include: rockets, lasers, shells, mines, decoys, drone reconnasiance aircraft and one nuclear ICBM. All but the last two items may be loaded onto, carried by and fired or dropped by your tanks, up to their maximum load-carrying capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your computer displays current resource status, a map of the combat reservation updated by tank, base and decoy sensors, and handles all communication chores, freeing you to make the strategic decisions and handle the tactical battle situations that arise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMMBAT requires two computer systems, each with a RS-232 port and a 300 baud full duplex modem. Different types of computers may be used; for example, a TRS-80 user may play an Atari user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
