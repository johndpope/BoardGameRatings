			<description>Each player has a face-down stack of sheep cards with arrows to the left right or sheep looking straight at the player. The players now take turns flipping over their top card. If there is an arrow to the left, the active player touches his/her left neighbor's shoulder and says &amp;quot;M&amp;ouml;&amp;ouml;&amp;ouml;h!&amp;quot;. If the arrow points to the right, he/she touches the right neighbor's shoulder and exclaims &amp;quot;M&amp;auml;&amp;auml;&amp;auml;h!&amp;quot;. Direction of play changes accordingly. If there is no arrow, it's the player's choice. If the card shows a sheep with a bell, all players try to ring the bell in the middle of the table (the first one to do so gets extra cards). If the card shows a dog, everyone moves on one seat. The last player who still has a face-down stack is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
