							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Peng Lai: Mythic Chinese Adventuring</name>
									
			<description>A Cinematic Story Game of High Epic Fantasy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a story in Peng Lai that is passed down through the years that speaks about those born into this world with the favor of heaven written upon them. These chosen few will bring about a great change into the world; for better or for worse. It is written that you will know them by the symbols that denote their status and that they will appear a score of years after the stars that mark them have aligned. This alignment happens once in a 1000 years, and it has been 20 years since the last great celestial alignment. All of Peng Lai now waits with abated [sic] breath for what is to happen next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
