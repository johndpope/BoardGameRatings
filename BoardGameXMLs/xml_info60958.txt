			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Misfits and Menaces is a new sourcebook series for the M&amp;amp;M Superlink rules. Each offering will focus on a number of villains and/or one or more villainous organization that may be inserted into most super-heroic campaigns with little effort. Each villain/organization not only comes with full game statistics and back story, but also with several adventure ideas to help introduce the character into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this first issue you&amp;rsquo;ll find our Metahuman Threat Scale, a system used by law enforcement agencies for defining the degree of danger posed by a super-being, along with details for the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A.E.G.I.S. Advanced Engineering Genetic Integration &amp;amp; Structuring is a philanthropic organization geared towards helping humanity through better science. Or so the company&amp;rsquo;s CEO would have you believe. In truth, A.E.G.I.S. runs many secret projects that have resulted in the &amp;ldquo;birth&amp;rdquo; of countless super-villains, and does so with its true goal always in mind: profit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This organization is constructed using the new rules for designing organizations presented in Better Mousetrap, also from Misfit Studios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Anaconda. A former A.E.G.I.S. scientist accidentally exposed to his own experiment, he has been transformed into a snake-man bent on remaking humanity in his image. &lt;br/&gt;    Bloodbath. A gun-for-hire, expert assassin with a dark past and unlikely ties to the super-hero community. &lt;br/&gt;    Catspaw. A mutated, feline humanoid created by A.E.G.I.S. to be the silent fist of their will and goals. &lt;br/&gt;    The Court. A trio of strongmen and assassins, Judge, Jury and Executioner specialize in killing makers and enforcers of the law. &lt;br/&gt;    Headstone. The surviving guinea pig of an A.E.G.I.S. experiment to reanimate the dead, this strong, tough villain summons the undead to work his evil bidding. &lt;br/&gt;    Interface. An artificial intelligence created by Legion Defense Designs (see Better Mousetrap) to help better mankind, corruption in the software&amp;rsquo;s programming caused this unloving but sentient villain to create a robotic body for itself, which it now uses to conquer humanity for its own good. &lt;br/&gt;    Rounder. A gambling addict and former stage magician, Rounder is a low-threat loser who shuffles from the bottom of the deck to get a buck any way he can. &lt;br/&gt;    Sludge. A former mob enforcer subjected to a failed experiment, Sludge is a walking radioactive toxic spill looking for payback. &lt;br/&gt;    Valentine. A secret government agent who lost the love of his life to an extra-terrestrial super-villain, Valentine now wages a one-man crusade against all aliens, purging them from Earth with violent impunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
