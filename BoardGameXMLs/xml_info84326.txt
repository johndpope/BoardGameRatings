			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody knows that the world is full of stupid people. Stupid people make messes. Sometimes these messes are the walking, talking kind and sometimes not so much. Either way, messes attract attention, the wrong kind of attention. That is where you come in; you clean up the mess that stupid people leave behind. Big Tony&amp;rsquo;s stripper ex-girlfriend is about to turn State&amp;rsquo;s Evidence and she needs to vanish. The Judge&amp;rsquo;s son parties a little too hard and now he has a cold corpse of a hot young co-ed cooling in his tub. Alberto&amp;rsquo;s reaction when he found out his bookkeeper was skimming off the top was understandable, but now he has brains all over the kitchen and the lunch crowd coming in two hours. He calls you. You know how to handle it. If it takes an hour with a sniper rifle or an hour with a wet-dry vac you get the job done. This 4 page PDF is an easy-to-integrate PC class and just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world and gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
