							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Giant Intergalactic Electronic Game Book</name>
									
			<description>From Back Cover - &amp;quot;Six great games packed into one giant book. Press the buttons and move your space travelers along the game paths in an all-out race to be the first one home! With six giant games to choose from, you can play them all in a row, or pick your favorites and play them over and over again!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collection of 6 original roll and move games laid out in a large book that unfolds to about 24&amp;quot;x36&amp;quot; of each game. &lt;br/&gt;The games are 'Space Drain', 'Deep Freeze', 'Space Splash', 'Intergalactic Games', 'Air Lock', and 'Zoom'.&lt;br/&gt;The rolling is handled by an electronic device attached to the book. Players push a button and the device makes sounds and gives a number, color, or symbol depending on the game being played. In one game the device will give additional information to the player on whether a door is locked or unlocked. The game also comes with 4 little space aliens to represent the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
