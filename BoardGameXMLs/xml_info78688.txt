							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Avoid the 10!</name>
									
			<description>A dice game in which you roll 5 dice three times, setting one aside each time, trying to get the highest score possible.  If your total is over 10, then you get points worth the difference between your score and 10.  However, if your total is less than 10, you get points equal to three times the difference between your total and 10.  If your total is 10, you are out of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there's one more twist: of the five dice, two are normal dice marked 1-6, two are trick dice marked with three 2s and three 6s, and the last die has a 5 on every face.  This contributes to some interesting strategies as you try to maximize your points but avoid the dreaded 10!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to reach 99 points exactly wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
