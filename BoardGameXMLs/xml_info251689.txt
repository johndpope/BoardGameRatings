			<description>Each team receives a deck with an agreed-upon number of cards. A team member draws a card that contains a category and a number of clues related to the category. The card is handed unseen to the other team, and a player from that team reads the category and the clues, one at a time. The clues re-write sayings, titles, events, objects, etc. using synonyms. The team whose member drew the card tries to figure out the original wording of all the clues within 30 seconds. If the team succeeds, the card is discarded. The first team to run out of cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
