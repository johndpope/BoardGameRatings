							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">How to Play a Great Cleric</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cleric is someone in service of a higher power, a god, a force of nature, an ideal. What vision do we summon when clergy becomes the topic? Is it an old man in brown robes with a ring of hair around a bald patch atop his head that spends his life in cloistered prayer? What about the merry Friar Tuck from Robin's band of thieves that never met a bottle he didn't warm up to? For some, the cleric is simply the white collared man in black that sermons over his flock like a shepherd to the lamb on Sundays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter what or who you think of as the cleric you can be certain that you haven't thought of everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This great guide won't tell you everything you need to play a great cleric, but it will help you to get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
