							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bible Bingo</name>
									
			<description>A religious take on the Bingo type of game. The game for the youngest in the family is straight Bingo, although adults should make sure the children understand the scripture references on their bingo card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game for older children requires them to name a verse or story from the bible relating to the colour they draw. If other players have that colour and can name another verse or story reference, they too can cover the square on their bingo card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all versions, the first to create a line of five covered squares, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
