			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fallen statue of Thorgar, Giant King of old, marks the beginning of the High Pass. If the Sultan's scouts are correct, here lies the way to Harbinger Peak&amp;hellip;and Jotunnborg, ancient city of the giants. Jotunnborg was destroyed long ago, but the giants have returned to rebuild their infamous fortress!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The giants of Jotunnborg have made war not only with the desert land of Kashiba, but with her neighbors as well. The giants have gathered to their side all manner of wicked creatures and launch raids every fortnight, taking hundreds of slaves and leaving razed towns in their wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emissaries from neighboring lands have made it known to the Sultan that either his Majesty will take care of the giants - or they will. And once their armies are on Kashibian soil, then what?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So his Majesty called on you, heroes of legend, to come to Kashiba in her hour of need. The Sultan's army cannot root out this threat; they are trained for desert warfare against bandits and such. It is upon you to bring justice to the monsters who dwell upon the mountain. Ensure Jotunnborg is never rebuilt. At stake is not just Kashiba, but the peace of the whole region!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
