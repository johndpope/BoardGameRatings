			<description>Jewel Quest is a 'match 3' puzzle played on an 8 X 8 grid filled with various tokens, eg. Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, Gold Coins, and Skulls. The player may swap any 2 adjacent tiles, as long as it results in making 3 or more of a kind in a row or column. When this occurs, those tiles disappear and tiles above fall into the gaps. If this results in another 3 of a kind in a row, then these disappear etc until a stable situation is reached. Again the player may swap another 2 adjacent tiles etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jewel Quest has 180 levels and is set within the Mayan culture. There are 36 grids and they are played through, in succession, five times, with each play-through adding a new level of difficulty. During the first run-through, &amp;quot;Explorer,&amp;quot; the player is given pieces of storyline in the form of &amp;quot;journal entries&amp;quot; to read after completing each grid, with an additional snippet before the beginning of each level. After playing the 36th grid, the totem &amp;quot;speaks&amp;quot; as well there being a written blurb. After the &amp;quot;Explorer&amp;quot; level, new information is given only at the end of the 36th level, and once after playing the 1-2 grid during the second run-through. All other &amp;quot;journal entries&amp;quot; are quotes or sayings to encourage the player. Likewise, if the player fails to complete a level within the time frame, encouraging quotes will be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jewel Quest&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
