			<description>Once upon a time, there were two very tricky turtles who organized a great race to find out which of the two was the fastest, but how to make a good competition if both do not stop cheating? The PROBABILITIES may be on your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be use in 2 ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) INTERACTIVE STORY&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the interactive story is to introduce the child to the concept of PROBABILITY. Reading the story and completing all of the activities included on it is mandatory before moving onto the TWO TURTLES RACE. This is required in order for the child to get acquainted with probabilities, and therefore is capable of making decisions based on them. We recommend that the parents or teacher of the child guides them during the reading of the story and the activities included in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B) TWO TURTLES RACE (this is the game):&lt;br/&gt;This is a game in which only two participants will use practically the concepts learnt in the interactive story. They will develop their abilities of decision making based on probabilities, logical thinking, resource management, and strategic thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 kind of dice in the game:&lt;br/&gt;a)  3 faces in each of the 2 colors&lt;br/&gt;b) 2 faces of one color and 4 of the other&lt;br/&gt;c) all faces of one color&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn the kid is allow to roll an &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; dice, and he must advance the turtle of the corresponding color. But he is also allowed to spend coins to buy a b or c dice, which is used and returned. &lt;br/&gt;They gain more coins by stepping in some spaces of the track.&lt;br/&gt;The firs turtle to cross the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 storybook.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3 trackboardpieces.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 1 finish line boardpiece.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 5 dice &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 2 turtle tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 12 turtlecoins.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 2 &amp;ldquo;cheatsheet&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; manual.&lt;br/&gt;THIS DIDACTIC MATERIAL ALLOWS STUDENTS TO DEVELOP:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Making decisions based on probabilities&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Logical Thinking&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Resource management&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Strategic Thinking.&lt;br/&gt;Probabilities are a topic that is present in our everyday lives, and which is very importantwhen it comes to making decisions. However, it is very common that children have difficulty grasping the concept when it is introduced in school.&lt;br/&gt;Tricky Turtles explains in simple and accessible terms what probabilities are, and it gives children the opportunity of experimenting with them in a fun and practical way.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other products, the Langley Didactic Material has been designed primarily for teaching purposes, which makes it a fun and captivating tool.
