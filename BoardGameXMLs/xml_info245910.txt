							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jeopardy! 2nd Edition</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game for the PlayStation console has 4,200 questions on subjects banal and baffling. Based on the popular TV game show, Jeopardy! 2nd Edition pits you against some advanced computer opponents in competition toward the tough Double Jeopardy bonus round. If you're not up for the pressure, you can play without opponents. Or for an extra challenge, you can try the Tournament of Champions mode. The game even includes audio and video Daily Doubles, where players listen to and watch clues for point prizes of varying amounts. To better simulate the experience of being a Jeopardy! challenger, the makers have included two sample qualifying exams (what, did you think they let just anyone on the show?) and behind-the-scenes video of the actual game-show studio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
