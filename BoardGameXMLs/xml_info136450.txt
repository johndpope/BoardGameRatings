							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stimulating Simulations</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collection of ten simulation-style games written in BASIC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art Auction: One buys and sells paintings to make a maximum profit. This is a fast simulation and does not require extra materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Chase: A monster is chasing a victim in a cage. The victim must elude the monster for ten moves to survive. It is a fairly quick simulation that doesn't require too much thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost Treasure: A map of an island that contains treasure is presented. The adventurer travels over different terrain with a compass that isn't very accurate in an attempt to find the treasure. This is a short simulation that requires about 15 moves. A map is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gone Fishing: The objective is to catch a lot of fish during a fishing trip. Half of the catch spoils if the time limit is exceeded, time is lost in a storm, and the boat sinks if it is guided off of the map. There are also sea gulls and sharks to watch. A chart is needed to keep track of good fishing spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Flight: The task is to deliver medical supplies to a distant planet while trying to stay on course without running out of fuel. Graph paper is required to plot the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forest Fire: The objective is to subdue a forest fire with chemicals and backfires. Because the output is a 9x9 grid, a fast baud rate to the terminal is desirable. The success of a firefighter is based on the time needed to control the fire and completely extinguish it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nautical Navigation: This simulation requires the navigation of a sailboat to three different islands, using a radio direction finder. The wind direction is an important variable. Graph paper, protractor and ruler are needed to plot the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Business Management: In this simulation, raw materials are brought and finished products are produced and sold. The cost of materials and production and the selling price vary each month. The objective is to maximize the profits. No extra materials are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rare Birds: This is a bird watching simulation. The objective is to identify as many different birds as possible. A record of those identified is helpful and a bird watching chart is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diamond Thief: One assumes the role of a detective in this simulation. A thief has just stolen a diamond from a museum. Five suspects must be questioned to determine the thief. A floor plan of the museum and a chart indicating suspects and times is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
