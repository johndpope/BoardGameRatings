			<description>Swarm, a game loosely based on the hierarchy of bees, is a simple yet very deep abstract strategy game for two players. The game play is somewhat like a cross between Go, Chess and Backgammon. Players may make multiple moves per turn (up to 12 when using dice). There are two ways to win the game. Players may move their opponent's pieces as well as their own. Players can re-claim captured pieces (when playing with dice). The game can also be played without dice as a pure abstract strategy game - suited to advanced players who are interested in a deeper more serious game. The depth in the game is partly due to the multiple move paradigm which means that the first players first turn has more than 10 million possibilities. See &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.swarmboardgame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.swarmboardgame.com&lt;/a&gt; for further details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
