							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elf Bowling</name>
									
			<description>In Elf Bowling, Santa Claus gets revenge on his striking elf employees by using them as bowling pins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the elves say phrases such as &amp;quot;Is that all the balls you got, Santa?&amp;quot; when the player misses their first spare opportunity or &amp;quot;Gutter ball!&amp;quot; in a silly-sounding voice when a ball is rolled into the gutter. Other potential distractions for the user are a deer that walks up along the bowling lane that you can &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; with your bowling ball if you press the right buttons, a frog wearing a Santa hat hopping back and forth across the player's field of vision (resembling Kalvin Kroaker from Frogapult, also made by Nstorm) if you hit him with the bowling ball his body is hauled away from the screen by a bird from Frogapult, a white rabbit that also jumps and defecates across the bowling lane, the elves mooning Santa (asking &amp;quot;who's your daddy&amp;quot; as they do it). Both during the game and after a game finishes, the elves do a dance, shouting &amp;quot;Elf elf, baby!&amp;quot; in reference to Vanilla Ice's song &amp;quot;Ice Ice Baby&amp;quot;. One of the elves randomly moons the bowler (Santa). The elves can also randomly move out of the way of the ball, and one elf can be decapitated by the pin setter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Elf Bowling&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
