							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bollywood Game</name>
									
			<description>The Bollywood Game is a typical Bollywood movie turned into a strategic and competitive card game, for everyone. Take this filmy journey as your friends turn foes, your romance is put to the test and you gotta fight for what is right at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are able to keep track of each of their attribute points (Strength, Charm and Kindness) To prove your skills you must earn points for each of the three attributes. Points start at 0 and will evolve throughout the game. While players get ready to play, a Hero or Heroine card is laid down on the table &amp;ndash; this card becomes the object of affection for all players. Each of these Hero or Heroine cards have attribute points, and  once these points are met by a player, he or she can play the Happy Ending card and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once players decide which Hero or Heroine will be on the table as the goal of the game, the remaining Hero and Heroine cards are put aside and no longer a part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;Action Cards, Actor Cards, Song Cards and Counter Attack Cards are shuffled and SIX CARDS are then distributed to each player, and cannot be displayed to anyone.  &lt;br/&gt;The remaining cards become the game deck and will be put face down on the table. This is the deck players will draw cards from in order to advance in the game.  &lt;br/&gt;During his turn, a player can play any card he has in hands. His turn will finish when the player discards all the cards he wishes from his hand to the &amp;lsquo;discard deck&amp;rsquo; next to the original &amp;lsquo;playing deck&amp;rsquo;. Cards will be face up on the &amp;lsquo;dicard deck&amp;rsquo;. &lt;br/&gt;The player can also finish his turn by simply choosing to &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo; without discarding any cards during his turn. But the player cannot end his turn with more than 3 cards in his hand, if a player has more than 3 cards in hand at the end of his turn he must choose a remaining card to be discarded. &lt;br/&gt;All the cards used during a turn (i.e.: Actor Cards, Song Cards, Counter Attack Cards) will be discarded to the &amp;lsquo;discard deck&amp;rsquo; as well. &lt;br/&gt;After all players complete their turns, the first player will draw as many cards as necessary from the playing deck until that player has 6 cards in hand&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
