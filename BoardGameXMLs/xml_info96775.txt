							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mini-Motocross Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A relatively abstract game but still intensely exciting form of Motocross.&amp;quot; - from the rules.&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to create their rider by comparing each roll to the Preparation Chart. 5 rolls are needed per rider, giving him Basic Speed, Skill Rating, Block Ability, Control Rating and Stamina Factor. These five abilities are tested at different times during the race. It is a race game but has no board, laps are recorded on paper. The winner is the first rider to complete a set number of laps.&lt;br/&gt;First published in Games Unlimited's Random fanzine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
