			<description>Thanks to ebayer  gljacobsct for info on this game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Touchdown from Milton Bradley (There is a NAVY Pennant on the game board but the box title is simply Touchdown)  comes with 1 spinner dial numbered 1 to 6, one head linesmen piece and 1 Milton Bradley Football Playing board.. Players spin the dial to kick off. After placing the ball on a square according to directions in squares one to six, the head linesman piece is placed 20 squares ahead of the ball. Each square represent &amp;frac12; a yard with the object being to gain 10 yards or twenty squares within 4 spins. If a player should not succeed in advancing the ball 10 yards in 4 downs, the opponent takes possession of the ball. If the ball lands upon a square marked &amp;ldquo;opponent offside&amp;rdquo; no count of that down is taken. Should the ball land for two successive spins upon &amp;ldquo;forward pass incomplete&amp;quot; within a period of 4 downs the spinner is penalized 5 yards or 10 squares. The squares of the game have results in them which direct the person spinning the spinner to go to different squares on the board which might add yards or cause a fumble or score a touchdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
