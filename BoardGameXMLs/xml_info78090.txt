			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grouped with the Super Scope light gun, Super Scope 6 featured a total of 6 games presented in a Carnival / Arcade like style. The player is prompted to select either Blastris or Lazer Blazer, each selection has a grouping of three games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blastris:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blastris A has the player playing a Tetris like game on its side. The player is able to shoot blocks to reduce their size in order to form complete vertical columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blastris B is more akin to games like Columns where the player is attempting to match colors in rows, columns or at diagonals. Shooting most blocks will change the order of the colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mole Patrol is a whack-a-mole like game in which the player tries to shoot as many moles within a time limit as possible, while avoiding the red moles. Mole Patrol can be played in multiple stages or just a single stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lazer Blazer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intercept has the player shooting down missiles of various sizes (to indicated distance from the player) before they reach the other side of the screen. This is also the only 2 player game available. Getting hit 5 times will end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engage has the player shooting down planes and missiles as if they are on a plane. The player must also be quick as the plane they are on will run out of fuel if the player takes too long. Getting hit 5 times or running out of fuel will end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confront has the player shooting down planes and missiles again, only this time they are not restricted by ammo or fuel. Getting hit 5 times will end the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
