							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mastermind&#039;s Workshop</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;New Year, New Challenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year the greatest gnome tinkerer, Mastermind, takes on a new apprentice. Becoming this apprentice is a most coveted position, bringing with it the chance to learn skills and techniques that most only dream of; not to mention the prestigious work afterward. You will play as an up-and-coming gnomish tinkerer fighting for your place as Mastermind&amp;rsquo;s prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; at this year&amp;rsquo;s competition. Mastermind chooses this apprentice each year by their ability to finish a single task. It will be your job to destroy a Masterbot; a steamwork contraption Mastermind has designed and built to attack your workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a game board, a player placard for tracking resources, a gnome character, and a starter bot they can build to help defend their workshop from Masterminds Masterbot.  &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns playing their characters and Mastermind. On Mastermind&amp;rsquo;s turn all the players decide the actions of the Masterbot attacking the player to their left , while the players attempt to defend their workshop from destruction. On the players turn dice are rolled to gather resources. Bots are then bought, scrapped, or built. If a bot has been built, the player then has the option to attack and try to take out Mastermind&amp;rsquo;s machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must succeed in destroying their assigned Masterbot before the competition can destroy theirs. Sounds easy enough, but the other competitors will try to sabotage you at every turn even while trying to destroy their Masterbots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
