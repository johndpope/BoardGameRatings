			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulse is the winning entry among Brazilian submissions to Game Chef 2013, and was declared World Champion over the other winners in different languages (Italian, French, English). It is not a typical RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulse is a story game in which players are time investigators. They create a map of ripples of past events, asking questions about the scenes they create, and then the others give their versions about it. The story is told backwards, and scenes they created previously start making more sense as they go deeper and deeper into details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
