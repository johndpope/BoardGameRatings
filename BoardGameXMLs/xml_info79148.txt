			<description>&amp;quot;Solstice: The Quest for the Staff of Demnos is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System created by Software Creations Ltd. and heavily influenced by Ultimate Play The Game's Knight Lore and Pentagram. Its theme music was scored by composer Tim Follin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must control a wizard by the name of Shadax and navigate through a maze of isometric rooms in search of the six pieces of the Staff of Demnos, which is in the possession of the evil wizard Huguenor (named after the game's original creator Michael Huguenor). The non-linear adventure game does not include a set path the player must follow, however specific items must be collected before Shadax can advance to the next portion of the dungeon. Shadax can jump, pick up objects and use various potions, but must generally employ evasion as a primary defense tactic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player solves puzzles in each room they either obtain a specific item needed or advance to the next room in order to progress further. While doing this, the player must avoid traps such as pitfalls, spiked floors and monsters (such as slimes and trolls) which are lurking within the rooms. Most enemies should be avoided, but occasionally some are incorporated into that room's puzzle.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Solstice: The Quest for the Staff of Demnos , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
