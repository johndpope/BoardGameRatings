			<description>Finish the game with the highest credit score and most money, while navigating through life's twists and turns, and avoiding foreclosure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique feature of ForeclosureOpoly is that there are 18 Trivia spaces on the board. When you answer the trivia questions correctly, your credit score increases and you earn cash. Challenge your knowledge. When you answer the trivia questions incorrectly, your credit score drops and you must pay a penalty to the bank. If you don't have enough money to pay your yearly mortgage payment (every time you pass Home) YOU LAND IN FORECLOSURE. That's when staying in the game really gets tough!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the smart, savvy and educated can stay out of foreclosure...or GET OUT OF FORECLOSURE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
