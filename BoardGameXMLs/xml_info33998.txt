			<description>Raketny Kreyser: Tactical Naval Combat, 1975-1999, is a game simulation of tactical naval warfare as it might occur in the late 1970's thru the 1990's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The naval and/or naval air forces of the U.S., the U.S.S.R., the U.K., the P.R.C., Canada, Turkey, Greece, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, W.Germany, E.Germany, Poland, Finland, Iraq, Iran, N.Korea, S.Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Italy, India, and France are represented by their major combatants and aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher referred to this as &amp;ldquo;A broad spectrum survey of the naval and naval air units that would be engaged in any major world conflict from now until the turn of the century. Three groups of scenarios (Gulfs and Straits, Coastal Seas, Open Ocean) depict likely places of conflict and participants. Silhouette type counters cover the major combatants of over a dozen nations. Back printing has been used to conceal a unit&amp;rsquo;s identity and attack values. Surface effect ships and semi-submerged platforms depict future naval trends. Ranged attacks, air detection zones, NTDS, and&lt;br/&gt;optional rules covering weather in all the world&amp;rsquo;s oceans and systems reliability allow players to realistically simulate modern naval combat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer noted: &amp;quot;This one was supposed to be the simple game of the three for that year. It was, and was perhaps too simple. With only air and surface elements represented, it was a clean and fast game of modern naval combat, but not the full story. It was fast and violent though, and sold out quickly. We redid the concept (much more to my satisfaction) some years later with Battle Stations.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raketny Kreyser is the rarest of the Simulation Canada board games; only 550 were printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Turn: 12 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 1 nautical mile / 1.8 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Individual ships or three aircraft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 18&amp;quot; featureless blue mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (255 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 12-page Raketny Kreyser rules booklet (5.5&amp;quot;x8.5&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
