			<description>A bluffing card game for 3-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players secretly choose role cards and play as disease causing agents.  Players bluff and try to play cards to change the moisture and temperature conditions in the body.  When a player believes conditions are right, he plays an infection card to take over the body and win the game.  Penalties and rewards come with the bluffing system so that it is in players' best interest to bluff and call out other players' bluffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming to Kickstarter summer 2016!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
