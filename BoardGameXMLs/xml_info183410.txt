			<description>Focus On Your Karma Path And Collect Elemental Matches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can travel down life through good deeds or bad deeds, but karma will follow you either way. In Move Master, your best tactic is to collect that bad karma now and give it to your opponents to get the win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 3rd entry into the Karma Crystals game collection adds the use of elemental shards with move shards to gain movement and 12 new monster elemental cards for your collector&amp;rsquo;s deck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is to gain as many moves forward down the karma path, collect elemental shards and be nice to other opponents so they don&amp;rsquo;t pass their Karma Crystals to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll dice to work with the various monster elemental cards - monsters are the good guys and help you win! Determine how many karma moves you score per roll and collect your karma move shards. Your move match also earns you an elemental shard, but if you get more of one type, you get to pass a Karma Crystal to another player. Your opponents also get Karma Crystals through a no-match roll, and you will get those too! When you get 11 or more karma moves, that triggers the end the game and the winner is determined at the end of that round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the unique dice matching game mechanic, a unique auto player system is also used to facilitate up to EIGHT total players per game. The game also provides an easy way to track multiple game wins for playoffs in case you have more than 15 to 20 minutes to play. No paper score cards and pencil needed - just move and elemental shards, and of course, Karma Crystals to track and build your score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
