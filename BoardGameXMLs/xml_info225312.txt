			<description>This is a roll-and-move game published to mark the U.S. entry into World War I. It allows up to six players, each representing an arm of the U.S. forces: Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Marine Corps, Engineers and Aviation Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has a circular track and six spokes leading inward to the center of the board. Each player starts on the space representing the headquarters of his branch (Boston, Portland, Savannah, Charleston, Norfolk or New York), and must complete a circuit of the board &amp;quot;Dodging Submarines&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon return to base, he then heads inwards on a spoke, along spaces marked: In France; On Wotan Line; In Belgium; Before the Rhine; Across the Rhine; Through Germany; Before Berlin; and finally the central space In Berlin, with a caricature of Kaiser Wilhelm. The winner is the first to reach the center circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board indicates &amp;quot;Patent pending&amp;quot; but does not name a publisher or copyright holder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
