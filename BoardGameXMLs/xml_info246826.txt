			<description>Add another survivor to your future scenarios with this Kickstarter Exclusive Lori Grimes miniature, 15 card survivor deck and survivor sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there were any one word to sum up Lori Grimes, it would be selfess. In the show, she doesn't hesitate to put others before herself. Accordingly, in The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary Lori plays best as a support player, with her selfless attitude reflected in her Survivor Cards and the frequency with which she doles out Ability Tokens. Her character ability &amp;quot;Voice of Reason&amp;quot; allows a player with one of her ability tokens to spend it to reveal a card in their hand to the rest of the group during the Approach Planning phase. This allows for greater group coordination and can result in the Leader making a better approach choice for the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lori's ability tokens can prevent situations in which the leader role keeps getting passed after each turn due to defiant card choices by the rest of the group. Lori makes an excellent addition to any group and can be a clutch player when avoiding stress becomes critical during a scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
