			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planet Of The Apes for the Atari 2600 was scheduled to be released in 1983 by 20th Century Fox games. Unfortunately, the designer (there was only one in those days) quit the company before the game was completed. A few months later Fox closed its game division and immediately halted all games in development. PotA was tossed into a mislabeled box and placed in storage. Thus it was many years before the game was not only rediscovered but also correctly identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes on the role of astronaut Taylor (from the 1968 movie) and retraces his journey. You begin in an ape-filled forest screen that essentially recreates the famous hunt scene from the film. If you're touched by a gorilla or orangutan you are captured and thrown into a cage in Ape City. Beyond these screens is the Forbidden Zone which is a series of desert and cave screens. If you find the right path you end up on a flashing screen with a half buried Statue of Liberty where you receive various bonus points and then start again in the forest on a higher difficulty level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game was never completed it is certainly at a very playable development stage and fans still speculate what the final version would have included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
