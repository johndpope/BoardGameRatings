			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends are created by circumstances, not born to hovels with dirt floors. Champions train their entire lives for one single opportunity to stand in the stead of another, to pit their might against the best of another culture. Conquerors destroy civilizations and butcher the weak, rewriting history after the fact to show themselves as liberators. Heroes do not begin life in tiny villages with muddy streets where the stench of goats and sheep permeate the air and lofty goals of men are to feed their families through the winter. Albrim looked forward to a simple life but events came that he could not avoid. His innocence is swept away as the actions of a single day alter his viewpoint, his morals, and his beliefs. He must make a choice and all that he loves is stripped away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
