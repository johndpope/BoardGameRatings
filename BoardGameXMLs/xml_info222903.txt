							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower Collapse</name>
									
			<description>Wobbly tower contains a variety of colorful columns and rings, and one special game dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your skills and start playing the crazy column game! Roll the dice to see what color column you have to add to the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns, each player rolls the dice to see what color column they have to add to the wobbly tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time there&amp;rsquo;s six columns added you have to add a ring on top of it, but you can add the columns close together to make it more difficult for the next player. But watch out! The player who makes the tower collapse is out of the game. Continue until one player remains and they are the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
