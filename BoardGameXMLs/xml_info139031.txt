							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fool the Farmer</name>
									
			<description>Game from The Beezer Book, 1976.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to reach the apple store first.&lt;br/&gt;Any number of players can play. All you need are a dice and some counters. Throw the dice before the game. The one who throws the lowest number is Farmer.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets two throws at the start except Farmer. He throws last and only gets one throw.&lt;br/&gt;If Farmer lands on a square with a player on it that person is caught and is out of the game. If a player lands on Farmer&amp;rsquo;s square, Farmer loses one turn.&lt;br/&gt;The penalties in square D and square I apply to Farmer only. The penalties in square 2 and square 14 do not apply to Farmer. Players must throw the exact number to finish on 35.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
