			<description>A Sports Drama Storygame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this roleplaying game you and some friends are going to work semi-cooperatively to get an all-star ball player through the most difficult, and maybe the most defining day of their life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young at Heart does not concern itself with simulating the game of baseball. Instead, it focuses on getting into the headspace of the pitcher and what they are going through on the mound in order to keep throwing that ball, and throwing it well. What do they think about? How does it feel? Where does their inner strength come from?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you experience the inner struggles of this individual, know that you&amp;rsquo;ll also be carving out a future for them as well as creating their past memories. Collaboratively, you&amp;rsquo;ll be defining the moments of a person who has given their life to a game they&amp;rsquo;ve played ever since they first put on a glove and began to play catch. All in order to see where they end up after one of the hardest days of their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
