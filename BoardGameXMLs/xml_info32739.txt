							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game: The Gaming</name>
									
			<description>Game: the Gaming is a non-collectible card game for two to six players in which you play some of the Big RPG Companies, all struggling to churn out new product and rake in as much profit as you can from rehashed old concepts and tired system mechanics. The trick is to latch onto hot new concepts and milk them for all they're worth before the ever-fickle target audience (predominantly males age 12-22) either turn to the next new thing or have to find a real job and move out of mom's basement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G:tG is a general spoof of the entire Gaming industry, and should be taken entirely for the good-hearted fun that it is (especially by any of the aforementioned Big Gaming Companies who may have Big Legal Teams...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
