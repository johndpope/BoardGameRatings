			<description>A card game collection for children that contains 3 different little games/activities that are all played with the same set of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are printed on both sides - orange on one, purple on the other. The orange side usually shows two animal heads (sometimes more), the purple side always six animal heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game is a simple picture dominoes variant. Players put their cards next to one with a matching animal head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main game, &amp;quot;Schnabel und Schnauze&amp;quot; is played using the purple side of the cards. Each player draws three cards. A starting card is placed and then players take turns. On your turn, you can either draw a card (hand limit is 4), add a card (cards are all placed in longitudinal direction) next to another so that a row of identical animal heads results, or put a card ON another without completely covering it. Players earn points for making rows of the same animal longer. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third variant is &amp;quot;Zoo-M&amp;quot;, in which the purple side of the cards is used in a puzzle of 3x4, 4x5 or 6x6 cards. At the edges, the animals have to match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 36 cards, printed on both sides&lt;br/&gt;- 2 cards that contain the instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
