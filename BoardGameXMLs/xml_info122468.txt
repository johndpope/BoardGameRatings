			<description>Tamagotchi: Party On!, known in Japan as Tamagotchi's Sparkling President, is a video game in the Tamagotchi series for the Wii. The game was released in the United States on May 29, 2007 by Namco Bandai. In Japan, the game was released as a launch title. The Game Was Only In The Tamagotchi Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the other Tamagotchi games, this is composed of mini games in which players compete. The mini games, like Driving and Watering plants, have rewards at the end depending on how well the minigame was cleared. The player uses different Tamagotchi characters like Mimitchi, Violetchi, Kuchipatchi etc. It is basically a Tamagotchi party game made to fit in with the wii capabilities, similar to the Mario Party games. It also has games in which the player tries to get &amp;quot;Gotchi&amp;quot;, Tamagotchi cash. The player uses this cash to buy items to customize his or her headquarters. The player can play as the Tamagotchi characters, such as Mametchi and Kutchipatchi. The player can unlock other characters while playing. There are always 4 players in the game. If there are less than 4 people playing, the CPU will play. Like most games, the player can set its level easy, medium, or hard. The game is a series of elections, set by the player, that determine who will be the next president of Tamaworld. Apart from this, the player can also play the minigames separately to practice his or her skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tamagotchi: Party On!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
