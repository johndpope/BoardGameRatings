							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stories and songs can do more than entertain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Properly told stories can unite a community, allow you to share experiences, and convey lessons and wisdom. Likewise, songs can uplift one&amp;rsquo;s soul and inspire others to perform great deeds, or they can fill one&amp;rsquo;s heart with despair or dread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether by book or word you&amp;rsquo;ve learned your share of both over the years, like the difference between a puca and a kelpie, The Three Songs of Erui, how sunlight affects the trolls of the Hagswood, The Barghest of Ulfstir, dwarven smith-chants, and the bleak poetry of the Silverbough elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you know there&amp;rsquo;s more out there, much forgotten or yet to be told, and you yearn to find or write them yourself. Just think what you could learn, what they could teach, and who they could inspire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn't your exactly your &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; bard. Yeah, you know a lot of songs and stories, but you aren't going to be capering about combat strumming a lute, instantly singing wounds closed, or shouting people to death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your songs have power to be sure&amp;mdash;draw in everyone's attention, put people to sleep (intentionally, mind you), cause animals to let you by unhindered (or possibly befriend you), and eventually instill entire crowds with hope or fear&amp;mdash;it's just that they aren't going to be handy once swords are drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thankfully you don't have to rely on your music to get by: you can bolster your allies with encouraging words, try talking your way out of a fight, pick up on clues that others would overlook, or just charge screaming into the fray, axe swinging. It all depends on the story you want to write.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the rest of our playbooks, this product is two files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a digest-sized, 15-page book laid out Dungeon World-style. It comes with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The bard (huzzah!), complete with 20 advanced moves that let you focus on your music, social, observational, or supporting talents, or swordplay.&lt;br/&gt;     A page that talks about various instruments, and expands on the default selection.&lt;br/&gt;     A pair of magic items: the dancing sword and electric axe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other is a 2-page, letter-sized character sheet for you to print out and use at the table. As with our other playbooks, there are some custom graphics to spice it up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
