			<description>The DC Universe Miniature Game is a tabletop skirmish game, pitting teams of exquisitely detailed miniature superheroes and villains against each other in exciting contests of strategy and might! Based on the epic, bestselling DC Universe, this game includes many of the well-loved characters that have thrilled comic book fans for generations.These mighty &lt;br/&gt;heroes and their arch nemeses can now assemble at your call, ready to save the world&amp;hellip; or destroy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the DC Universe Miniature Game, you and your friends collect a set of beautiful miniatures of your favorite DC heroes and villains, bring them to life by painting them, and then use them as playing pieces in an exciting multi-faceted, three-dimensional tactical game. You will be weaving your own stories, worthy of the greatest comic book sagas. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned veteran of tabletop miniature games, or a new recruit to this rewarding hobby, you&amp;rsquo;ll soon be controlling your own super-team, and battling for control of Metropolis, the Earth at large, or even the entire galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DC Universe Miniature Game is designed for two or more players, with each taking control &lt;br/&gt;of a number of finely detailed miniatures, representing their faction, or team. The miniatures are in essence playing pieces, much like those you&amp;rsquo;d find in a board game. But unlike most board games, a miniature game doesn&amp;rsquo;t take place on a readily defined board, but rather the players take an active role in designing their own custom gaming area, usually on a tabletop &lt;br/&gt;populated by scratch-built scenery. The rules use a sophisticated system of power counters &lt;br/&gt;and unique character abilities, allowing you to move your models freely and utilize a large &lt;br/&gt;range of skills and powers to give you a tactical edge over your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequence of Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually &lt;br/&gt;up to the character&amp;rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This &lt;br/&gt;stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &amp;ndash; you might go first this round, but end up &lt;br/&gt;going last in the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &amp;ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and &lt;br/&gt;resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single &lt;br/&gt;model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act &lt;br/&gt;have done so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &amp;lsquo;tidying up&amp;rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&amp;rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been &lt;br/&gt;removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the starter set:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the incarnation of Batman, Superman &amp;amp; Wonder Woman from the DC cinematic Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can take to the streets of Gotham, Metropolis or even Themyscira with the DC Miniatures game. Take control of Henry Cavill's Superman, Ben Affleck's Batman or Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and take on DC villains or recreate the fight scenes from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This blister contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 3 metal miniatures and stat cards for the miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1x Batman&lt;br/&gt;    1x Superman&lt;br/&gt;    1x Wonder Woman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
