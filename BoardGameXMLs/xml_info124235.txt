Super's control had dissapered so that new opportunities became available for mechs. New sectors were opened. After the Reformation (the process which has much to do with the Beholder) mechs changed greatly. Many of the old clans dissapered. Their goals sank into oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;New organizations with the fifth gemeration mechs in chief are mighty formations of mechs with definite strategy and great aim. Alternative interests caused war which aim was at annihilation of the enemy. The opportunity to take control of the resources allowed strong organizations to destroy the weak ones with the help of economic strategy.&lt;br/&gt;Equilibrium has been established temporarily. Nobody could turn to account this situation. That's why the Reckoners decided to set out in search of the first fifth generation mech. All the mechs knew that the first fifth generation mech is unsurpassed warrior who can resist strong clans on its own. But nobody knew what has happen to him and where he was at the moment. The Reckoners found out that he can be returned to the Range. The chosen mech managed to find him and bring him back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
