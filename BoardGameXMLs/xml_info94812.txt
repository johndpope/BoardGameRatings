							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Taiji by Nestor Romeral Andres</name>
									
			<description>TAIJI is a Chinese term that means &amp;quot;Great Duality&amp;quot;. TAIJI represents the fight of Good vs. Evil, Light vs. Dark, Yin vs. Yang. But Yin and Yang are indivisible! That's why both players use the same indivisible &amp;quot;dual&amp;quot; pieces. These pieces are called TAIJITU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing TAIJITU on the board, but be careful! The TAIJITU you place could be helping your opponent. The goal of the game is to get the highest score by summing up the largest group or groups of connected segments of your color or icon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taiji is quite simple to learn and fast to play, but challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. Now available for all of Apple's iOS devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Nestor Romeral Andres&lt;br/&gt;Developed for iOS by&lt;br/&gt;Dmitry Shulga &amp;amp; Andrey Matveev&lt;br/&gt;Artwork by Matthew Silbur &amp;amp; W. David MacKenzie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
