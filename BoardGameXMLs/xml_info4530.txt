			<description>From the rules...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Idea of the game:  &lt;br/&gt;Oh, if only I were richer. Oh, if only I could find the right one for me. Oh, what destiny do the stars hold for me. Which path should I take? This one or that? Or, is an even balance the path to eternal happiness?  &lt;br/&gt;In Life is Money, each player has the option of playing points in different areas of life. However, as in real life, most decisions are influenced by the actions of others.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game:  &lt;br/&gt;To gain as many points as possible (varies according to the number of players) in the different areas of life. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to earn and spend money to gain victory points in various areas of life (Work, Education, Relationships, Spiritual Well-being, Status Symbols). You need to balance your &amp;quot;investments&amp;quot; in order to maximize your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
