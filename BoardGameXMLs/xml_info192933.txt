			<description>Two to four players can play the game,using the city plan set out in four colours with a detailed street map. Each player is given five companies which have to be established in the city.&lt;br/&gt;But competition is keen. Every player must try to establish his company as close to the city centre as is possible. Space is limited and the fight for the best location is tough.&lt;br/&gt;Once a company has been established on the map, the four colour places worth seeing on the back of the company logos may be exposed.&lt;br/&gt;Thus,while playing the game,one becomes familiar with the sights of the city.&lt;br/&gt;The player who makes the least compromises is named the most successful businessman in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents:&lt;br/&gt;City Plan Map board&lt;br/&gt;80 tiles in four colours&lt;br/&gt;8 playing pieces&lt;br/&gt;3 dice&lt;br/&gt;Rules and information booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
