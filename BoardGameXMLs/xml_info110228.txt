			<description>Subtitle:&lt;br/&gt;A quick start guide to Neoclassical Geek Revival&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;So you or a friend of yours is looking to play a game of Neoclassical Geek Revival and don&amp;rsquo;t feel like thumbing through 110 pages to get the feel? Fret no more! This quick start guide is intended to get you playing in just a few minutes, providing you have played some sort of role-playing game before and have a printed character sheet in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;This whole guide will be written informally as if you are sitting down at the table right now and have 10 minutes to hit the ground running. Thus you will lose much of the choice and understanding available to someone who has read the full rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
