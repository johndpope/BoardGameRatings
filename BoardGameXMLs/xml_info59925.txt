			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;Be the first to feed your farm animal in this noisy game of animal sounds and counting!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme: Each player moves around the farm collecting food for a specific animal and talking to other animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: Collect six pieces of food in your wheelbarrow and return the wheelbarrow to your animal's stall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:  On a player's turn he rolls two 6-sided dice.  The player then has up to four choices on how to move his wheelbarrow around the circular board: by the amount shown on either die, by the sum of the dice, or by the difference between the dice.  Every time the player lands on a wheelbarrow space he may add another piece of food to his wheelbarrow.  The first player to fill his wheelbarrow and return to his animal's stall wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, every time the player passes another player he must make his own animal's sound.  Whenever he passes an animal shown on the board he must make its sound.  If a player fails to make the correct animal sound he must return a piece of food to the stockpile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box recommends ages 6 and up, but the gameplay seems more suited for ages 3-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: The game board and other pieces are all of cardboard construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
