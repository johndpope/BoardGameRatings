			<description>Party game for two teams competing against each other.&lt;br/&gt;The game shares its name with the Dutch version of Family Feud, but the game elements have only vague resemblance to that game.&lt;br/&gt;Each game is played in five rounds, varying from a round that plays like Taboo to a round that plays like Time's up.&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored for answering quiz questions (none of them in the style of 5 tegen 5 the tv show). First team to get to 50 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
