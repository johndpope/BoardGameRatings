							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zed&#039;s Party</name>
									
			<description>ZED'S PARTY is an amazingly inventive and unusual game. HAVE YOU BEEN INVITED? Mime, Song, Dance and Drama make this an interactive and highly fun game.  For any number of people from 4 up to 24, the game includes balloons, question cards and a full colour playing board. The inventor/designer of this game is Zed Rodgers, the actor/writer from London, UK. The game only had one production run despite it being described by some as the best and most versatile board game in the world. One of the directors of Zed'n'Co Games Ltd, went bankrupt from his other business and could not put money in for the second run, so a second director pulled out leaving Zed with no finances for a second run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
