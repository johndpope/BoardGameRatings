							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Reaper; OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Just Play Everything</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earliest form of Necromancy refuses to die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discarded scraps of souls have been piling up in heaps since the dawn of time, and, long before magic was codified in the way we understand it today, some of the first true necromancers just so happened to notice that they were up to their knees in these catatonic bits and pieces of what used to be people like them. Calling themselves reapers, these necromancers found ways to coax scraps of soul back together, to give lost souls a new lease on life, and to grant these aggregate beings a means of interacting with the world once more. Necromancy, and the rest of magic, has since moved on from what is now considered a product of the formative, dark age of magic, but certain circles still remember its power, and with every advance the rest of the world makes, the reaper gains a new tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've all been there. You play a rogue for a few sessions, then the rogue gets boring, and you want to try a new character, but the narrative demands that you remain what you are and now you've gone and made friction in the game group. For all those suffering altaholics out there, Interjection Games is proud to present the reaper, a blank slate base class with versatility at its core. By herself, a reaper is more-or-less a commoner, but she slowly nurtures a group of soulsown, each of which allows her to act like a totally different class when the two of them are bound together. Trying another character is just a binary swap away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The combination of tricks from a wide variety of base classes makes classes on the lower end of the power spectrum, such as rogue, monk (sans archetypes), and fighter more-or-less totally obsolete with a reaper in play. This does not make the reaper itself overpowered&amp;minus; the class is still strictly less powerful than any full caster on the books and fits somewhere around the power level of a well-built bard&amp;minus; but rather highlights some of the issues inherent in the original source material when it was penned a decade-and-a-half ago. Still, the reaper has an enormous footprint and the average power level of games using it will probably increase now that the various low-tier &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; classes have been ousted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The reaper base class&lt;br/&gt;    Well over 10,000 words of talents in four subtypes: arcane, divine, martial, and primal&lt;br/&gt;    No feats and no archetypes - the reaper's very design has it vacuum up character concepts from all extant crunch canon; it really doesn't need them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
