			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tasked with ending a conflict between neighboring Orcs and Dwarves, The party finds themselves stonewalled when a dozen Kobolds seemingly conquer the Dwarven city of Dun Boldar! Accompanied by a mysterious demon and an oddly pale little Girl, the Kobolds seem happy to rule over their new kingdom and its odd collection of Dwarf-shaped statues. With the lives of ten thousand Dwarves at stake, the Party must solve the mystery of the Kobolds and their mysterious guests, while fending off mad fairies, running odd errands, all while trying to stay on their feet as the city is rocked by earthquakes! Who is Staxx the Demon? Is Hena more than the cute girl she appears to be? And why does that statue look so much like the Dwarven Leader? Find the answers on &amp;ldquo;The Day the Kobolds ruled the world!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
