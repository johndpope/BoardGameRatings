							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pocahontas Electronic Talking Board Game</name>
									
			<description>From the description on the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Actual voices and sound effects from the movie direct game play and guide Pocahontas through the Enchanted Glade towards Captain John Smith. Try to be the first to bring the two together, with help from your animal friends... but watch out for ruthless Governor Ratcliffe!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features a keyboard device that the children press to generate the voices and sound effects. There is also a colorful 3-D playing surface plus some character stands representing the Indian maiden and the explorer. Movement is determined by a spinner. Designed for kids ages 3 to 6 years old with no reading required to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
