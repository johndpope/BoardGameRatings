			<description>It is the dawn of the 22nd century on the third planet from the sun. Humanity, broken free from its eschatological thralls, now watches as a lone boy stands before it. Within his hands, he controls the power of Mephistopheles &amp;ndash; a force which can breathe life into that which has none. Animated machines devour the helpless; buildings shower the streets with storms of glass; cups, trains, bridges, whole towns &amp;ndash; the remnants of civilization are transformed into bloodthirsty beasts whose only purpose is to wield the hammer of judgment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boy&amp;rsquo;s name is Faust, and he will not stop until he has cleansed the planet of humankind and claimed it as his own. Centuries have passed since his advent, and the world now holds its breath as the End of Days draws ever closer. Yet hope is not lost. Hidden among humanity&amp;rsquo;s last remaining survivors, an elite unit of specially trained ninja known as Moondivers have been lying in wait for orders from their Shogun to embark on one final mission to reclaim the planet. Today, those orders arrived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Diver Moon Diver]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
