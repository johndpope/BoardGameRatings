			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Murq Thendival (better known as &amp;ldquo;Murq the devious&amp;rdquo;) was at one time a wizard known and hated in Veluna City. Suspected of having dealings with Temple of Elemental Evil during its first heyday, the mage built his laboratory-tower in a forested area of the Lortmils, which he warded with killing fogs and mists. He was also known to have humanoids of varying types as troops who would deal with any interlopers who managed to make their way past the wizard&amp;rsquo;s vaporous barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, Murq realized that his possible alliance with the temple was on shaky ground, since divinations revealed that the governments of Furyondy, Veluna and Verbobonc were preparing to move in force against it. Rather then fall with his erstwhile &amp;ldquo;allies&amp;rdquo; when his dealings were discovered, Murq set out to gain personal power in another way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters level 5-7&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
