			<description>May 1995 - This set, on the whole, is my personal favorite.  While it's got lots of power, that isn't the reason.  This booster add no new concepts.  Instead, it took the under developed concepts in the game, and expanded to make it playable with inventive powers.  Artifacts were made for many worlds that had few, rule cards had a rarity less than full rares, we found holdings for any world, all champions got better powers, and Dark Sun finally had enough realms to be a viable theme.  This was also the first of two sets that had only 20 chase instead of 25.  However, it was also a set that started using only 1 rare per pack.  Landmark Cards: Wand of Orcus (#1); Obsidian Man of Urik (#14); Rod of 7 Parts (#21-27); Bag of Holding (#28); Temporal Stasis (#53); Deflection (#54); Korgunard the Avangion (#75); Drawmij (#85); Ur Draxa (#91); Anchient Kalidnay (#92); Onad the Weasel (c#6); Young Strahd (c#8); Amulet of Spell Protection (c#17); and the Dragon Font (c#20).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
