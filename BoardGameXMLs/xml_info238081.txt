			<description>Aisha is a middle aged halfling witch. She used to have a coven of 5 other witches, but only she remains. The coven is now infested by insectoids and she has locked herself in the supply room. There are not many options left, but making a suicide run isn&amp;rsquo;t high on her list. She has limited supplies and is hoping for a miracle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By nature she is an extrovert and a fatalist, but possesses a strong charisma. She is not a loner, though all witches tend to limit their associations with the mundane world. In her youth she was a house slave of a human family in the metropolis of Gory, and she hated every moment of it. Witches always focus their powers on one aspect of magic or another; hers being transmutation and transference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grotto is a lush underground cave heated by a hot spring. It&amp;rsquo;s limestone walls sheltered the coven for centuries, but now the insectoids have burrowed their way in, and it&amp;rsquo;s usefulness to Aisha has passed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero: Aisha, the Uncanny Shapeshifter. Including custom hero deck, shields, and stat sheet.&lt;br/&gt;    A new type of enemy: The Tharnix.&lt;br/&gt;    Full sized double-sided map board.&lt;br/&gt;    Standalone campaign of 5 scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;    4 extra treasure cards by guest designers.&lt;br/&gt;    Special wound card designed by Tristan Hall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
