							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Marvel Comics Super-Heroes Game</name>
									
			<description>The goal of the game is to reach Mehisto at the center of the game board and defeat him. The movement is determined by the spinner. The playing pieces have two sides, the costumed hero and his alter ego (for instance Spider-Man and Peter Parker). While in their secret identity the players are safe from attack and can move into position. To attack Mephisto they have to change into their superhero identities. On the Zoom Spaces the heroes get to collect Power Cards to use in the fight against Mephisto.  If a Superhero succesfully attacks Mephisto, he gets a Talisman Card. The first Player who gets 3 Talisman Cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
