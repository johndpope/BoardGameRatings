			<description>Spectacular real-time strategy gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Engage in massive, full 3D RTS battles across vast landscapes. The enemy is everywhere: he roams the lands, scours the seas and infests the skies, but you have at your disposal units that can take on any threat. Build factories, gather resources, construct armies and reap victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become the dragon&lt;br/&gt;As if legions of diverse war machines weren't enough to turn the tide, you have the ability to turn into a dragon and support your troops in combat! Blast through the air empowered by your trusty jetpack and have at the enemy. Breath fire to destroy; cast fog to confuse; charm to subvert. These and many other skills are at your disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research new technologies and magic&lt;br/&gt;You may come from humble beginnings, but as new territories are conquered and tribute flows in, your economy booms and you can invest in new technological and magical upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plan your conquest&lt;br/&gt;Move your armies across the turn-based world map and decide how to improve the lands under your rule. Will you concentrate on gold revenue, for instance, or the increase of military output? Weigh one benefit against the other and keep the long term in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play your cards right&lt;br/&gt;Story decisions earn you cards that when played wisely can influence politics, strengthen your military, bolster your economy and weaken your opponents. Sometimes the winner is simply the one with the ace up his sleeve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single player, multiplayer and co-op modes&lt;br/&gt;Play the story-driven single player campaign, test your mettle against other Dragon Knights, online or local via LAN. Start your own custom multiplayer campaign with or against a friend. Or duke it out on a skirmish map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
