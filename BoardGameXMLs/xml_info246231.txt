							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King&#039;s Ransom</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A demon's foul curse has condemned a king (who thought himself capable of striking a bargain with immortals) to an eternal half-existence in the five levels of the undead.  The very gold coins the king had people put to death to possess now hold the only means of his escape.  Help the reformed king collect these coins while jumping from moving level to moving level, carefully leaping over all obstacles encountered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included is the short story, &amp;quot;The Thirteenth King&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
