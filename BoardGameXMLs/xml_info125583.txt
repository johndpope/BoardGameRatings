			<description>Plasmaworm is an easy to play - but hard to master - arcade game for all ages. It is a modern relative of early computer games such as Snake, TRON Light Cycles and a rare gem called Pizza Worm (DOS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full game includes 20 different levels of increasing difficulty, playable in single player as well as two-player modes. You can also create your own levels and music using the built-in editors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasmaworm was designed by Richard Carlson, Iikka Keranen and Phosphorous, sometimes referred to as Digital Eel. The final version of Plasmaworm is 1.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
