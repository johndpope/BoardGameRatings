			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reversi is a late nineteenth century board game also known as Othello. This major game of strategy can be played at nine levels of difficulty from novice to expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reversi is an implementation of the classic board game of the same name (also known as &amp;quot;Othello&amp;quot;). In Reversi, players alternate in playing stones in their own colour onto a grid. If Player A is able to place a stone such that a straight line of Player B's stones are enclosed at either end by a stone of Player A's, then all the intervening stones are flipped to Player A's colour. The game ends when the board is full, or both players pass. The aim of the game is to have more of your coloured stones on the board at the end of the game than your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally released for ZX81 (with a 16k RAM pack) it was subsequently upgraded and released for the ZX Spectrum (it would run on the 16K version of the Spectrum).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows single player against the AI, or two player. It also allows the starting position of the stones to be edited. During, or at the end of a game, a recording of the game can be played back. The player(s) can rewind the game to any point and carry on playing from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also facilities to print the current board position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
