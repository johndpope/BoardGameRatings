			<description>From the Inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the pilot of one of the most advanced aeroplanes ever made - the &amp;quot;Spitfire&amp;quot;. Your Spitfire base is being attacked by the enemy, in an attempt to destroy your force's supply of aeroplanes. Your mission is to destroy as many of their rocket installation camps as possible, while at the same time fighting off their air attack. Can you protect your base and fight off the air-onslaught, without using all of your fuel into the bargain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your service is counting on you!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Fast and furious flight action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Destroy enemy installations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Avoid ground to air rockets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Complete your mission before your fuel tanks run out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally previewed in magazines as a full price release in 1987 (e.g. Your Sinclair, Nov 87). However it was only eventually released on Elite's budget label Encore in 1989.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spectrum and Amstrad versions are slightly different to the C64 version. In the Spectrum and Amstrad versions the player can eject (though this still results in the loss of a life). Also in the C64 version your aircraft is destroyed by flying into the ground, which is not the case in the Spectrum and Amstrad versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
