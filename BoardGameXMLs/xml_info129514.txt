							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for Supremacy</name>
									
			<description>There is a battle waging for control of Centropolia, a city full of HEROES and VILLAINS. The mayor watches anxiously as 64 unique characters strategically attack, defend, and use special powers to claim victory. WHICH SIDE WILL YOU TAKE?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this card game, you choose to defend the innocent or side with evil in a struggle that stretches to every corner of the city. The outcome depends on your ability to strategize against your opponent. There are several paths to victory, but only one side will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to attack your opponents and attain a specified number of Victory Points, which you earn each time a character survives a round. Players draw from a deck of attack cards and prepare strikes by playing three cards of the same attack type: brutal, elemental, science, or stealth. Players may also attempt to thwart enemy attacks with shield cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engage in a back-and-forth style of attacks and take advantage of character strengths, weaknesses, and special powers. Use attack cards to prepare damaging strikes and eliminate your opponents before they eliminate you. There are thousands of possible HERO-VILLAIN combinations so that each match is fresh and competitive. The game rules are easy to learn, but the strategy you devise is limitless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
