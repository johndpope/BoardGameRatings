			<description>Trail of the Brotherhood is an adventure game with a deductive element set in the world of H.P. Lovecraft in the 1920s as the Investigative player teams work as a group to discover the Old One the Sorcerer players is working to summon. In a race against time the Investigators will span the globe seeking to uncover clues, attacking cults that have joined The Brotherhood, and working to obtain the keystone magical item required for the final ceremony.  Will they succeed in this desperate quest, or will the Sorcerer player prevail, joining cults together to create the ritual&amp;rsquo;s power while wielding the required magic item to open the gate and wake the Old One they worship from slumber?  &lt;br/&gt; Trail of the Brotherhood is a game for 2 &amp;ndash; 5 players designed by Richard Launius and published by EOS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
