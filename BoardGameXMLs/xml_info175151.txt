			<description>Space Monsters is a solitaire patience game in which you want to throw out all the monsters in a deck out to space where they belong. Powerful monsters can use abilities to try you patience. They can spawn more monsters and hide other monsters forcing you to try and find them again. In general, monsters mess up your progress!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good thing you have your crew! Using your crew members special abilities, avoid monster penalties, uncover hidden monsters, and hunt for monsters you haven't found yet. Not all of your crew has special abilities though, so you need to keep them out of harm's way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Space Monsters, the goal is to throw out all the monsters in space, and keep your crew out of it. Do you have the patience for it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
