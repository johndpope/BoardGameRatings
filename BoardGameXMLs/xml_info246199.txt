							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 (And More) Female Manx First Names</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Isle of Man is an island located in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. A small island, with a population much less than 100,000, it is now a British Crown dependency, but has been in the past a Norwegian and a Scottish possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manx, or Manx Gaelic, is related to both Scottish and Irish Gaelic, and is a Celtic language, and is still spoken today, though few people speak it, and it is one whose existence is supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has 100 different Manx female first names suitable for players and NPCs in a Celtic-inspired region. The names have details on their meanings and other notes, as well as alternative spellings, should either of these be known. Together with the alternative spellings, there are more than the 100 specific names designated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
