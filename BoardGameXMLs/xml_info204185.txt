			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notakto is a misere 3-in-a-row game for two players. It's played on the squares of a finite number of initially empty 3x3 boards. All pieces are exactly the same and are shared by both players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A board is dead if it contains at least one set of three stones in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A board that is not dead is alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player must place a piece on an empty square of a living board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all boards are dead, the player who made the last placement loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
