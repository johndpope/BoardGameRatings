			<description>Set in the Golden Age of organized crime, players head rival crime families attempting to gain control of organized crime in the city.  In the vein of Citadels, deceive your opponents and deduce their strategy as you gain wealth and respect in your rise to power. Plot and alter your own strategy as the game unfolds and as fortunes change hands quickly and unexpectedly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players select characters through a secret draft.  After all players have selected a character, they take their turns in order depending on the character they have chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first part of each player's turn, they will use their character's tactic to their advantage to either earn cash, to take cash from their opponents, or to derail their opponent's progress in some way.  Each character has his own unique tactic.  As the game progresses, bluffing and deduction become increasingly important to gain an advantage over your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second part of the player's turn, each will have a choice of three different illegal operations to perform, and may perform any one of the three before ending their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the required level of respect wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
