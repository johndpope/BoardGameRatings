							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cadence: Road Racing Championship</name>
									
			<description>Cadence is a 2 player biking microgame in which players are professional cycle racers going head to head on a race circuit. Racers use their stamina, shift gears, make use of abilities like 'drafting' and 'sprinting' and strive to reach to the finish line first. The game makes use of unique mechanics like card interlocking, sliding and rotating cards, 3D like vertically folded racer cards to fit a fairly complex but tactical game in just 18 cards. The race is played on a track made up of 6 'track cards' which are either flat sections or climbs and descends of different gradients. Double sided track cards allow for a second more difficult track to be made from the backs of the cards giving replay ability to the game. There are 2 racers to chose from while they each have their own special abilities the other one does not have. You can play a big game of 3 laps or a short filler of 1 lap, so immerse yourself in the world of bike racing, micro style!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
