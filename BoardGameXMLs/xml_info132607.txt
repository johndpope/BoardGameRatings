			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only have we discovered life &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot;, they've discovered us, and... they don't like us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terran defense systems have developed modular multi-pilot mechanical avatars whose individual assets contribute to a greater whole, combining to form custom defense solutions as Earth (and its colonies) prepare to defend themselves from alien forces. These avatars are collectively known as &amp;quot;The Gestalt&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play cooperatively or competitively as you develop individual Gestalt Components, and try to build the defenders needed to protect your colony. Unlock available technology in the face of impending danger. Stave off menacing alien threats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gestalt is a worker placement game, where players (cooperatively or competitively) assign workers to tasks to build Gestalt Mechs.  Each piece of the mech provides a number of resources or attributes.  Once a mech is ready, you assign those mechs to face an incoming threat.  The resources provided by the components is spent, or lost, and some parts will need to be replaced before the next battle. Undefeated threats can destroy parts of the board, cutting you off from valuable resources, so build quickly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
