			<description>Creatures from outer space have arrived on Earth and they want to communicate with us, but they need to learn our language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Sblap, you have to say words so that the aliens can learn to communicate. This game requires speed, a sharp eye, creativity and memory. Is so appropriate to train memory, attention and creativity capacities and also communication and social skills needed in any social context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Deal all the cards among the players more or less evenly. It doesn't matter if a given player receives an extra card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Each player will form a stack of cards in front of him/her. Cards must be placed face down so that no one can see them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The player with the strangest face begins, by taking a card and placing it face up in the middle of the table, within reach of all the players. Clockwise, each player will take a card and place it in the central stack. The moment two cards showing the same alien or the same letter coincide, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and the fastest in doing so must shout out a word beginning with the letter on the covered card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, he/she must take all the cards from the central stack and, mockingly, distribute them how he/she chooses among the remaining players. This player will place a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The cards that players receive are incorporated to their stack of cards at the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The game continues in the same way: the moment two aliens or letters coincide again, any player can cover the central stack with his/her hand and, at that moment, he/she must shout out the preceding word and add a new one beginning with the letter on the card that he/she has just been covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progressively, a word sequence will be formed that must be memorized. If a mistake is made while shouting out the word sequence or if a word is invalid because of a spelling mistake or if he/she has covered the central deck when two cards do not match, the player receives the central stack of cards and places a new card in the central deck to continue the game. The existing word sequence is eliminated and begins to reform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. The first player to get rid of all of his/her cards wins the game.    &lt;br/&gt;Variations of the game: play using not just real words but also words in other languages, invented words or sounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
