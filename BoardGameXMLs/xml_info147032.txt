			<description>Life&amp;rsquo;s a Beach is a tactical game in which you try to corner the market for deckchairs on your local beach. Families of varying size and requirements will visit the beach and you will have to compete for their custom. Where is the best place to pitch your umbrella? Should you move your boat further along the coast? Do you want to erect your windbreak now or later? Or will you resort to other tactics, such as collapsing and removing your rival's beach furniture? And don&amp;rsquo;t forget to use that space you reserved early with your towel...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is simple. On your turn you either player 2 cards or draw 2 cards. If you play two identical cards, you can take their common action three times. If you play two different cards, you can take their respectives actions once each. Or you can discard any two cards to take any one action of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions include: pitching, moving, or erecting a deckchair, umbrella, windbreak, or boat; collapsing or removing a rival's deckchair, umbrella, windbreak, or boat; walking a family across the beach; or placing your towel down to reserve that space for later use. The play who manages these actions best wilns the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
