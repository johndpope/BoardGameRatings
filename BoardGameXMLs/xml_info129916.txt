			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dog House Gang offers a special introductory adventure for Wild West roleplayin' using the Savage Worlds system  -- Buckshots: Johnny Comes Marching Home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, usually, we like to whet your appetite by providin' a short synopsis of the contents. In this case, if we serve up much more than a nibble, well, we'd be givin' away the farm, so to speak. So iffin' you don't mind, we'll just say that our heroes are returning home after an extended absence (the War as it were), but they must meet one more challenge before they can rest their weary bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 44-page Savaged adventure features five full-scale Scenes, along with six major NPCs and some scattergun-fodder mooks. While Johnny is intended for 4-8 characters of Novice rank who are just beginnin' their wild west adventurin', this Buckshot also comes loaded with ideas for scalin' the adventure to handle various character levels and numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Johnny Comes Marching Home is the second of a line of Buckshots adventures fit for any Wild West campaign.
