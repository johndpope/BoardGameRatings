							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thirty Years War</name>
									
			<description>This is a very small, very inexpensive ($1.79) wargame covering the whole of the Thirty Years War. The three players represent Austria, Sweden, and the Palatinate. Production, political influence, and status are all kept on a small record sheet. The map and counters are made of paper. Victory is determined by victory points based on captured cities and aggregate political influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously published on a shoestring, there's enough meaty game play here to have warranted a more substantial treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
