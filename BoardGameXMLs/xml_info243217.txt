			<description>This game claims to be the funniest game in the world. Two players try to move 4 pawns from the base of the board beyond the dark spot between the snake heads. pawns that actually get on the dark spot have to begin anew. Movement is determined b a die. If the roll of the die shows a result that allows a pawn to get on the dark spot, it has to be used for this pawn. The small black dots (crossroads) can be occupied by any number of pawns of the same color. If a pawn gets on a crossroad, that is occupid by one or more pawns of the other color, the other pawns have to go back to the next crossroads behind them. If a pawn has the opportunity to reach a crossroads, it has to do that. The first player to get all 4 pawns off the game board beyond the dark spot wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
