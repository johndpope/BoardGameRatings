							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Højhus - Dybt at falde</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost nothing ever happens on the roof - perhaps the caretaker has an occasional errand, or maybe the window washers show up to clean the top courses.  But today, it's not quite so boring.  Today, four people have gone to the roof.  They don't know each other, and they never scheduled a meeting.  But, they have a mission.  A final decision has been made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life is nothing for them. It must be over now. Out to the edge and then jump into the depths. Suffer the momentary pain, and then the liberating darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of them expected anything but solitude.  All thought they'd be alone.  But they're not...  And so the question now is: who should jump first?  Does someone want the spotlight?  And... is everyone... safe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
