			<description>See molecules take shape before your eyes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player builds the model of the molecule represented on the molecule card which he has drawn.  The playing pieces are moved around the board from the starting square by die roll, in the direction of the player's choice.  In each case, the action on the space is taken, allowing players to obtain atoms or bonds, discard components, or draw individual or collective event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has anybody made one of the target molecules?  The first player to finish has the right to compare his molecule with the ones listed on the objective card.  If none of the target molecules has been constructed, he is in a position to create mischief for the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Paraphrased from the back of the box.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
