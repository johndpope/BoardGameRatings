			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The space colonists are in mortal danger: the super-computer Cray 5 has suffered a malfunction after a collision with a meteorite and is shutting down the atmospheric processors. Only you can enter the administration complex, fight off the hordes of robotic guards, find the switches powering Cray 5 and shut them all down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cray 5 is a side-view action game. The player controls a colonist armed with a laser and using a jetpack to move around the different screens. In addition to the many enemies and traps, there are locked doors which can be opened by specific keys. Since only one key can be carried at a time, the player must carefully manage her use of keys, as well as keep an eye on the timer. There are also energy station to heal the characters and teleporters to move from an area to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
