			<description>Dexterity is a unique word game - colourful, classic and above all, skill-testing.  The play is unlike any other word game.  In Dexterity, your ability to form interesting, unique and provocative words and to play intelligently is highlighted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique scoring system rewards your level of achievement each round.  The more challenges you are able to meet each round, the higher your score.  Try it and see if you've got what it takes to be top notch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main object is to score the most points by skillfully forming words which your opponent(s) cannot break (i.e. change into a new word) while at the same time, cleverly breaking words belonging to your opponent(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Words which cannot be broken, that is, changed into new words, are called Unbreakable Words.
