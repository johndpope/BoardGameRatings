			<description>From box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conceived and designed by Garry Kitchen.&lt;br/&gt;For one Crimebuster at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Flash!  Harry Hooligan, notorious con-artist, thief and all-around-not-a-nice-person, has escaped!!  He is now at large and in the vicinity of Southwick's Emporium.  At this moment, Hooligan is failing every attempt to end his felonious freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;On the scene is Keystone Kelly, the pride of the men in blue.  Officer Kelly, what's it like in there?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, 'tis a cryin' shame!  Shenanigans like ya wouldn't believe!  Dastardly deeds that defy description!  That rogue is hurlin' everything in reach!  Shopping carts, biplanes, beachballs -- everything but cathedral radios.  LOOK OUT!  It's a cathedral radio!!  Gotta bo!  I mean to recover the loot and bust that brute!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Will that double-dyed hoodlum keep Keystone in triple trouble, or will YOU help the greatest gumshoe going catch that no good galoot??  Grab your billyclubs and joysticks!  It's curtains now, Hooligan!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From instruction manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Officer Kelly reporting for duty.  Leaping Leprechauns!!  If it isn't Harry Hooligan ... up to his old shenanigans.  That blunderous hoodlum is robbing Southwick's.  And on a Sunday at that!  C'mon then ... lend a hand.  We've got to catch the krook, recover the loot and be careful to boot!  Listen up!  Don't get KO'd by wild shopping carts, beachballs or biplanes.  And get moving!  There's not a moment to lose!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Activision catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Garry Kitchen to floor you.  Start with one greedy burglar.  Next, put him in &amp;quot;Burglar-Heaven,&amp;quot; in this case, a large, metropolitan department store.  He starts swiping things, of course.  But wait, you're the blue clad, perplexed policeman with a bowler had assigned to stop him.  From floor to floor, up and down escalators and elevators, the stumbling, bumbling, fumbling, chase is on.  For people who love video games, this is exactly the right department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
