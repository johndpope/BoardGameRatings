			<description>This is a game a lot like the game 'Hera and Zeus' but you use playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;  Each player receives 9 cards to start off the top of the draw deck. They are placed in front of themselves in a row, upside down, making sure that there is a gap between the two rows.&lt;br/&gt;  During the game, battles take place to see what cards get removed and which don't (higher cards beat the lower cards(except '2' beats 'ace', seeing as nothing else does!)).&lt;br/&gt;  You can have up to five rows by nine columns. This creates a reserves system. That creates a bluff mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;  The game ends when two jacks, or the jack of hearts is destroyed by the opposing player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a 1 player version, where there is a default of nine cards placed alternately face up and face down. You do this as well, but yours are all face up. The rules are now the same, except for some other things, that are mentioned in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
