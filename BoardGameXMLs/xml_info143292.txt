			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRIDGE CHALLENGER is designed for all bridge players from novices to experts who would like to practice and improve their play. Since a standard game of contract bridge requires four players, it is difficult to study the game on your own time under realistic conditions. With BRIDGE CHALLENGER, you and the dummy play as the declaring team against the computer, which plays a skillful defense. The program will deal hands at random according to your specifications for high card points. You can then rotate the hands to play North, South, East or West. At the end of the deal all four hands are displayed, and you can replay your hand now that the cards are known, shuffle only defense-hands, or move on to another deal. The computer keeps track of all four hands and displays them in standard bridge form on the screen. You can stop and examine the previous trick at any point, or review all thirteen tricks at the end of a deal. You can save deals on cassette and reload them for later play. You don't even need a deck of cards to practice your game with BRIDGE CHALLENGER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
