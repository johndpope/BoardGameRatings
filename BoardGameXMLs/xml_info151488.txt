							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ethermancer: An &quot;Eldritch&quot; Reboot</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Warlock for the Pathfinder generation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be rather unsettling to learn that our infinite universe is but one of many, a miniscule dot on the roadmap of creation. These universes follow vastly different laws of physics and are prone to annihilating each other if they should ever touch. Though these events do happen, they are quite rare thanks to a weightless and almost completely elastic extrauniversal fluid known as the ether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some puny and insignificant organic creatures who find themselves attuned to this background noise of the multiverse, this infinite source of energy that surrounds them and suffuses the void beyond the edge of everything. Finding they have the ability to communicate with the extrauniversal fluid and to draw from its raw, shapeless energy to do as they will, these ethermancers tend to fall into two camps. Some believe that the universe chose them to carry its greatest gift and use it to protect this tiny speck of creation. Others feel it is a perfect excuse to lord it over everyone. Given humanoid nature, the latter tends to be far more common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end result of three months of development, the ethermancer base class takes equal parts Douglas Adams and H. P. Lovecraft to produce an &amp;ldquo;all day long&amp;rdquo; spellcaster class with a cosmic flavor. The spiritual successor to the warlock base class of the 3.5 days, the ethermancer seeks to have improved playability by offering the ability to mix and match spell effects to make custom evocations on the fly. Whereas the warlock simply blasted, the ethermancer can ask, &amp;ldquo;How hard?&amp;rdquo; Thanks to the advent of a spell point pool, players must choose whether or not to spend more than they will regenerate next turn. Incredibly potent effects are indeed possible, but firing them off without a care in the world will reduce the player to single-target ranged touch attacks in a hurry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplayers will be pleased to find that their character's personality and character development feeds directly back into the base class. Through the Multiuniversal Philosophy class feature, players decide how their character views their great gift and receives corresponding abilities that feed directly into the character's capstone. Further, the Aberrant Form and Aberrant Physiology class features highlight how the ethermancer's craft slowly twists his body. Is it worth it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Favored Class options for all common races, as well as most featured races&lt;br/&gt;     Innovative spell point system allows for a spellcaster balanced like a martial class with the ability to &amp;ldquo;burst&amp;rdquo; like a classic spellcaster&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for detecting ethermagic, countering ethermagic, and qualifying for classic arcane spellcaster prestige classes as an ethermancer&lt;br/&gt;     140 spells, or &amp;ldquo;manifestations&amp;rdquo;, in five schools, or &amp;ldquo;etherhearts&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;         lesser blast &amp;ndash; low cost, moderate damage evocation&lt;br/&gt;         greater blast &amp;ndash; high cost, high damage evocation&lt;br/&gt;         alteration &amp;ndash; defensive spells for self only&lt;br/&gt;         bestow &amp;ndash; defensive and offensive spells for anyone but the caster&lt;br/&gt;         genesis &amp;ndash; permanent creation of objects from pure energy&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     13 feats&lt;br/&gt;     Limited internal linking and bookmarking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
