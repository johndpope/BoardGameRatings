			<description>From the Designer's own description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Tiltyard is a sort of multi-round trick taking game, somewhat like a cross between the Sedma Group and a beating game. The game is themed around jousting events (the lance, the axe, and the sword) so there are three rounds with two &amp;quot;passes&amp;quot; each. One player leads a card and the other must play a higher card of the same colour, or a matching card of the opposite colour, or pass. If they play a card, then the trick continues and the other player faces the same three options. This continues until someone passes, the other player captures all of the cards played to the trick. At the start of the game, each player chooses 3 Royal Favours (court cards or Aces). These cards can be activated at the beginning of a round to impart a special ability to the owner (for instance, a Jack adds +1 to the value of all cards of its colour). They also determine which cards will be used for scoring your captured tricks: only cards of the majority colour within the 3 Royal Favours are counted.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play are the rules (PDF file) and a standard deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
