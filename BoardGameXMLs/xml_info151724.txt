							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delving Deeper: Paladin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paladins are a very rare type of fighter. These holy warriors dedicate all they have and all they are to living, supporting and defending all that is lawful and good. A paladin may serve one particular god, a pantheon of gods, or just the ideals of law and good. Many are part of a religious order of paladins that live and train in an almost monastic community. Other paladins are much more loosely affiliated, mentoring potential recruits individually and only gathering together when occasion calls for it...&lt;br/&gt; Inside you will find an optional Paladin class for Labyrinth Lord(TM) and other Basic Edition Fantasy games. It includes descriptions of abilities like Detect Evil, Divine Bonus to Saving Throws, Protection from Evil, Divine Healing, Turn Undead and optional Cleric Spell Casting at high levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
