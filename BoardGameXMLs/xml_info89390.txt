			<description>Guinness World Records DVD-Enn&amp;auml;tyspeli is a trivia game about world records. Players or teams are answering questions and for every right answer a chip is awarded, the first player or team to get 10 chips is the winner. Most of the questions are on the cards, but some of them come from the DVD, most of those have a video about a record attempt and the question is about the video. There are also challenges where two players go head to head in a simple task like listing names or drawing a house - the winner of the challenge recieves two chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains:&lt;br/&gt;-Game board&lt;br/&gt;-DVD&lt;br/&gt;-250 question cards&lt;br/&gt;-2 dice&lt;br/&gt;-2 pens&lt;br/&gt;-5 pawns&lt;br/&gt;-50 chips&lt;br/&gt;-2 straws&lt;br/&gt;-2 ping-pong balls&lt;br/&gt;-electric timer&lt;br/&gt;-rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
