			<description>Halali is a hunting/catching themed game from Swedish publisher Aristospel, in which the players tries to shoot or catch four (out of ten) domestic and/or international animals. According to the rules the game is intended for 4 or 5 players, but it is quite possible to be 2 or 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fairly simple roll-and-go dice game. On each single track one animal is possible to shoot or catch with the help of the dice. If successful - that is if the dice rolls exactly the numbers needed - the hunter is awarded an animal card with varying victory points. Whoever manages to collect the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since alla players is supposed to go on the same animal in the same order, animal for animal, it is teorethically possible that player one shoots all four selected animals and thereby win even before player two (not to mention players three, four or five!) has had a go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The animals and their value: Tiger (100), Elephant (75), Lion (50), Rhino (50), Capercaillie (40), Bear (30), Owl (30), Hyena (20), Crocodile (5) and Chimpanzee (5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game would probably be seen as politically incorrect nowadays and impossible to publish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
