							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Who: War Games</name>
									
			<description>War Games is a strategy board game based on the Doctor Who series of the same name, which originally aired in 1969. Players take the roles of War Lords, a race of aliens who have abducted human soldiers from across time in order to build an army to conquer the universe. One player controls the Doctor, who is striving to foil their plans. Players fight each other, capture territory, and form alliances through an engaging, card-based combat system that emphasizes skill and strategy over luck. Eventually though, the Time Lords have to be called in, and the game changes into a fast-paced capture the flag style race to get to the TARDIS and escape before they arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players take three actions by playing a card for each action. Playing cards in this way allows players to move, attack other generals and their bases, fortify their bases, or use strong utility actions or delayed tactical responses. The Doctor can influence zone bases to join the Resistance and otherwise interfere with the general's plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During play there are several War Chief cards that provide environmental effects when they are face-up. These cards become face-up or face-down due to actions in the game such as forcing another player to be your lieutenant or capturing zones. The game proceeds to the second phase when one player controls the majority of zones or all the War Chief cards are face-up or face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase of the game, action is faster, as each player plays one action at a time and moves, and doesn't draw any cards to replace their hand. Players fight over the key to the TARDIS and race to escape the world they're on before the Time Lords arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
