							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jungle vs Droids</name>
									
			<description>The Droids &amp;ndash; mechanical aliens from space&amp;mdash; have invaded the Jungle to destroy the magic crystals that the animals guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But are the animals cunning enough to defend their power source on their own?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they want to save their magical crystals, they need a real commander &amp;ndash; a strategist, who can see each of the 10 animal types&amp;rsquo; strengths and weaknesses. A commander who can choose animal units quickly and as efficiently to stop the hordes of space invaders. A commander like you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resisting the invasion won&amp;rsquo;t be a trot to the watering hole, as the animals like to say, because the enemy has 20 types of battle units. Fortunately, the residents of the Jungle can improve their skills as well as earn power-ups to boost their combat skills in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
