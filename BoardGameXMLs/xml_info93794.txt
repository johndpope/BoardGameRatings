			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MiniKnights is a micro-sized version of Modern Knights. Most of the rules have been hidden behind a curtain, and a few have been simplified (mainly combat effects like impairment from pain), but all the characters presented here were built with the full rules. The setting is your basic superhero world (the full rules go into more detail) with more of a focus on the &amp;ldquo;Silver Age&amp;rdquo; simplicity. What does &amp;ldquo;Silver Age&amp;rdquo; mean? Well, it means many things to many people, but in this case it means that while the characters have reasonably rich backgrounds, you can actually remember most of the important parts in their careers without resorting to a computerized database. In MiniKnights, you can play one of the Duotones, a pair of superheroes operating in Columbus, Ohio. Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for Origins, it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for the Duotones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
