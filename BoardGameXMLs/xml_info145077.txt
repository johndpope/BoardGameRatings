			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Espionage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Employer: Carlton Baker - Assistant Director of the FBI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: Washington DC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-three days ago, the FBI raided a nightclub in Los Angeles. The owner of this nightclub is Vladimir Birnkoff, a high-ranking soldier in the Russian Mafia. Birnkoff was not present at the time of the raid, but his younger brother Sergie was. Sergie has always been a hot head, pulled a gun and was killed by several FBI agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the help of spiritual contacts, we were informed that in the heat of his anger, Birnkoff hired a former NextWorld employee known only by the code name &amp;quot;The Jackal&amp;quot;. The Jackal's target: Carlton Baker, the Assistant Director of the FBI, and the man behind the raid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon obtaining this information, Orpheus Group immediately went to the FBI. Baker was obviously frightened by the information, and hired Orpheus Group to stop the rogue projector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
