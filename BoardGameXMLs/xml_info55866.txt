							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Desert Search</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere in the wind swept Nevada desert is the Morrow Project power station. Recon Team N-2 must find it and find it fast before it is captured by a mysterious group known only as Syen. To do this they must search some of the most inhospitable land in North America, sift through the rubble of the 20th century and fight on when all hope is gone. At stake is not only the first Morrow Project power station, but the lives of their comrades still asleep and defenseless before the coming onslaught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game package contains all of the information, maps and systems necessary for the Project Director to run this scenario. It includes information concerning new weapons, the V-150 TOW vehicle, details on the TOW weapons system, the power station, the all new Morrow Project Fast Attack Vehicle (FAV) and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
