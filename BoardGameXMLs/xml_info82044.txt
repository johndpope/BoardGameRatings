			<description>Bananan Ouji no Daibouken for Nintendo Entertainment System, is a 2D platform game that was released in Japan 12-20-91, by Takara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an Island Native, the Banana Prince is on a quest to retrieve the stolen weapons of the island; along the way he'll pick up companions and even appear on a game show, which allows you to warp to another level. Like Jack and the Beanstalk, he has with him a bag of seeds that allows him to grow a flower and climb it. There are also hidden platforms, and doors that can only be reached by collecting flower tokens (which allow him to grow a bigger flower).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Banana Prince&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
