							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fast &#039;n&#039; Furious College Football</name>
									
			<description>Fast-Action Games created many &amp;quot;quick-play&amp;quot; sports simulations where the outcome of a contest could be decided with just one or two dice rolls.  These games made it easy to play an entire series of games in a matter of just a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game covers college football.  Teams from the past (major conferences, minor divisions, even club teams--all the way back to the 1860s) were extensively researched to create ratings for just about any team a person would wish to play.  The game includes normalization factors so that a team from 1890 could effectively be pitted against a team from 1980.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
