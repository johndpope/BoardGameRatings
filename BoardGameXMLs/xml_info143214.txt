			<description>Domain is a tabletop card game for 2-4 players, or up to 8 players during team play matches. It focuses on a world building element, where all players contribute to an ever expanding playing field. Roads connect to Soul Wells, which are used to score the game and provide the magical energy players use to summon monsters or cast hexes. Players move along the system of rolls with a dice roll. Roads may also have other effects, such as reducing movement over harsh terrain, or increasing a player's draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summoned Monster cards may be stationed in a controlled Soul Well to guard them against other players, or left in a  player's hand, so that they may attempt to conquer other players' Soul Wells. So there is a strong balance between defending your territory, while having enough strength to expand into enemy territory as well. Hexes are used to manipulate the playing field, support combat or increase draw capacity.&lt;br/&gt; When combat does occur, it has been designed to be accessible and casual, in which battles may be resolved quickly and easily without complex counting or score keeping mechanisms. This keeps the focus of the game on strategic use of the world and unique card abilities to play to a Soul Well's power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By matching Soul Well or monster Domains with your Lord's (player token piece), a player can boost the power of his creatures, and make his territory more difficult to conquer, or activate specific Domain abilities for his monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An average game takes 30 minutes to an hour for 2 people and 1 hour to 3 for 4 players. It all depends on how players shape their gaming world :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
