							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RANDOMISE: Draw, act or describe your way to victory</name>
									
			<description>RANDOMISE is a mainstream, family-friendly party game that revolves around guessing random (silly) identities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It consists of 110 cards and is played with a minimum of four players in two teams (no maxiumum player number). Each turn, a player draws cards to get a random identity and must choose whether to draw (90 seconds), act (60 seconds) or describe (30 seconds) their identity to their team mates. They can also choose whether to take on an easy or hard identity (with more points on offer for hard identities). &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Maybe they'll become a ticklish turtle baking a cake, or a blushing robot scuba diving. With more than a million different identity combinations possible, every game is different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first team to score 30 points wins. And that's pretty much it - although there are a range of alternate gameplays that can be introduced later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
