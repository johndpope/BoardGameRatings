			<description>Waterloo is vaguely related to Stratego, in that each player moves pieces representing soldiers around the board, and that each piece has a value which can only be seen by the owner. However, this is more of a deduction game - when soldiers end up on the same space, instead of simply comparing values a complicated bidding process takes place which provides the players with information, which they have to use to guess the opposing piece's value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
