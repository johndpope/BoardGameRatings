			<description>Common Ground is a board game in which players or teams compete to come up with words from different categories that contain matching sequences of letters. The longer the sequence, the more you score. Here's a quick example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Category 1 = &amp;quot;Transportation&amp;quot; - Item 1 = &amp;quot;CAR&amp;quot;  &lt;br/&gt;Category 2 = &amp;quot;Vegetables&amp;quot; - Now try to think of a vegetable that contains &amp;quot;CAR&amp;quot;? If you said, &amp;quot;CARROT&amp;quot; you would score 3 points because C+A+R are 3 matching letters in sequence, common to both CAR and CARrot. If the Transportation Category item was AIRPLANE and you responded with the Vegetable - EGGPLANT, that would score 4 points because P+L+A+N are letters in sequence and in common to both airPLANe and eggPLANt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, one player turns over a category card and names 3 items from that category. After each player has written these items in the left column of their answer sheet, a second category card is revealed. All players then have one-and-a-half minutes to find Common Ground. The player with the highest score advances. During the game, players use strategic option cards to challenge their opponents and advance along the board toward victory, but get ready for instant verbal challenges that occur whenever landing on an opponent's space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
