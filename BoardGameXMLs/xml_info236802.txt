			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game Open Beta, players take on the role of individual samurai whose honor and loyalty will be put to the test. These samurai serve their lords as warriors, courtiers, priests, or monks and embark on adventures filled with drama, suspense, humor, romance, and horror. All the while, they must grapple with their human emotions and choose between following their heart&amp;rsquo;s desire or doing what society&amp;mdash;and the Code of Bushid≈ç&amp;mdash;demands of them. These personal stories of triumph and tragedy will reverberate across the Emerald Empire and shape the very future of Rokugan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game Open Beta will be available for free download soon. The beta will run for twelve weeks, giving players the oppurtunity [sic] to submit feedback about the upcoming Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game will contain rules for creating characters sworn to the service of the Great Clans and running game sessions filled with intrigue and conflict. A wide variety of skills, techniques, advantages, disadvantages, and more allow players to customize their character mechanically and narratively. Custom dice mechanics enable players to contribute to the unfolding story and decide whether their character succeeds, by how much, and how much it will cost them. And the fantastical feudal setting of Rokugan provides a rich tapestry of majesty and wonder where these stories can unfold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
