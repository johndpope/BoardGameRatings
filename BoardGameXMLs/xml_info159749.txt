							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Wall</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago, when it was erected, this wall was a formidable defense that kept the city behind it save from many attacks. These days, while still impressive, it has been surpassed by other fortifications. The wall is not nearly high enough to fend of determined attackers these days if they have at least rudimentary knowledge of siege tactics. As building a new wall would be a serious drain on the cities coffers the council has decided on another course of action. Instead of an expensive new wall they deepened and widened the moat at the wall's base. In another way the wall serves as well today as it did when it was completed. It keeps the population inside under control and channels traffic through the few gates where it can be taxed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
