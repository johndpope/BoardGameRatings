			<description>Pondemonium is a free print'n'play fantasy wargame for two players, where frogs and turtles fight over the control of a Pond.&lt;br/&gt;The game Pondemonium is based on the Eureka Miniatures &amp;quot;Pond Wars&amp;quot; range.&lt;br/&gt;This ruleset adds various components (all free to download to print'n'play) that make the game similiar to classic boardgames, the player can either use the fantastic miniatures from Eureka or the print'n'play version of them.&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay revolves around the turtles and frogs armies: the first must defend the pond with its better defensive ability, while the second must surround the enemies and conquer the pond with its major number of troops and its mobility.&lt;br/&gt;The main mechanics of this game are: action points represented as cards, movement based on how much terrain is&lt;br/&gt;crossed, and d6 rolling for battling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;Since the beginning of time, the Dark Frond Swamp has been a theater for battles between Frogs and Turtles. While Turtles live in an empire based on manpower and industrial development, Frogs are ruled by an Evil King that assures the wellness of his reign through war and conquests. For ages Turtles were forced to rise the level of their military tactics to defend the borders from the brute force of the Frog army. Battle after battle, Turtle defenses weakened, giving Frogs a great opportunity. Now the Frog King is coming, with new technological warfare machines. The next assault could create a direct passage to the Turtle land. The time is right, and unexpected: Turtles are not warned about the Frogs arrival. Will the heroic captain Cracked Shell prevail even in this desperate battle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
