			<description>Yet another new take on the Prestel Art Game. &lt;br/&gt;Players spin a spinner and move around the game board. Depending on what field you are on, you will have to: &lt;br/&gt;- draw a picture yourself&lt;br/&gt;- look at a card with a painting, then turn it over and answer some questions about it from memory&lt;br/&gt;- do a pantomime. &lt;br/&gt;For each task that was fulfilled successfully, the player gets a jigsaw puzzle piece (there are some fields on which these can be lost as well). The first player to complete his/her puzzle is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though this shares a name with The Prestel Art Game, this is a separate and different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
