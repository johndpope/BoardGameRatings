			<description>In Soulfall, players lead their nomads across a barren landscape, saved from the brink of destruction by a collective of powerful Lords. Along the way, players can devote themselves to these Lords, build outposts, and gather shards, all while trying to prevent the other players from doing the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soulfall is a medium-light game that combines simple mechanisms, medium strategy, stunning artwork, clever card play, and a unique scoring system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kolossal Games Edition gives players a larger board to play on and some streamlined mechanisms that enhance the original 2015 release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
