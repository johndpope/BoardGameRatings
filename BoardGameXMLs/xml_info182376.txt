			<description>Kribbel-Krabbel, the crazy tile laying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from the back of the game box:&lt;br/&gt;Each Kribbel-Krabbel ant consists of 3 parts: head, belly and rear end. Each part has another colour. Sometimes the head is red, the belly yellow and the rear end green, sometimes the head is green, the belly red and the rear end yellow. But all ants have something in common: a stenciled out hole. either at the head, the belly or the rear end. The game is quickly understood: each ant must be laid on top of another ant, and in a way that through the hole the same colour is visible. For example: an ant has a red head, yellow belly and blue rear end. The hole is in the head section. You can put this ant on top of two kinds of other ants: either one with a red head heading in the same direction as the ant You are laying - or You change the direction of Your ant and lay it on top of an ant with a red rear section. &lt;br/&gt;Who is the first to lay all his ant cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
