			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Autocross Racing is a top-down retro-style racing game similar to classic Amiga games like Slicks, Nitro, Super Cars and Super Skidmarks etc.  The aim of the game is to unlock each successive track by finishing in the top 3 places of the previous race.  You will be able to race for the championship trophy on the last track when the previous 9 tracks have been unlocked.  Cash is earned as each race is completed and new cars will become available for purchase as each new track is unlocked.  Each successive car having superior performance than the previous.  In order to stand a fighting chance against the increasing levels of difficulty of the AI cars and tracks, you will need to upgrade your car at regular intervals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Muprhy: Game Design, Programming, Graphics, Sound Effects&lt;br/&gt;Dejan Subotin (Dafunk): Music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
