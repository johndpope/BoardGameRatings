			<description>Fou Raide is a party game that should awaken the craziest side of your players, only by reading the challenge cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hum a great song with crazy sounds, reproduce a fresco with fellow players, make faces, mime, your guests will be Fou Raide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A member of a team pick a card, reads the category aloud (Fresco, Mime, Humming, etc.), and attempt to have his team guess the answers before the timer runs out. If they succeed the team earn 3 points. If the timer run out, they player can reveal a hint from the card.
