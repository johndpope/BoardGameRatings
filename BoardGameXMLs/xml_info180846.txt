			<description>&amp;quot;Barnyard Blast: Swine of the Night is a 2D shooting game on Nintendo DS developed by Sanuk Games, and published by Bigben Interactive and Neko Entertainment in Europe, and DSI Games in America. It is a parodic tribute to famous old-school horror games from the 1980s such as Castlevania and Ghosts 'n Goblins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Robert Belmart, an anthropomorphic pig, through six 2D levels:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Night Walk in the Graveyard&lt;br/&gt;    The Ancient Castle Ruled by Darkness&lt;br/&gt;    The Volcano BBQ&lt;br/&gt;    The Swamp Full of Disgusting Creepy-Crawlies&lt;br/&gt;    The Forest in the Way&lt;br/&gt;    The Castle of Intolerable Pain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He faces diverse monsters, zombies, ghouls, and bosses. He equips with 4 weapons: a pistol, a shotgun, a slayer whip and a pack of dynamite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Halloween night, young piglet Cliffy Belmart is caught tee-peeing an ancient castle ruled by darkness, and swept inside by horrendous creatures. Instantly aware of the peril, his father Robert Belmart equips with a fully loaded gun and rushes to rescue his son. His interlucutors along the way give him a series of wrong leads, therefore leading him to travel through 6 different worlds before finally finding his son. Dialogs are packed with humor and references to famous videogame quotes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Barnyard Blast: Swine of the Night&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
