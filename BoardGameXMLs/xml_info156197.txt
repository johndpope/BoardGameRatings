			<description>In Babababa Burger, you are working in a busy burger shop.  In order to fill the orders, you'll need to collect the ingredients for making the perfect burger for each customer that comes into the shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four decks of ingredients: a red deck that includes beef patties and fried eggs, a yellow deck that includes chicken nuggets and french fries, a blue deck that includes pickles and cheese, and a green deck that includes tomatoes and onions.  All four decks also include buns.  You start the game with two food preparation areas and a card from each deck.  Three orders are turned up that can be filled.  A fourth order is turned up on top of the deck, this is a future order that will become available when one of the current orders is filled.  On your turn, you can play ingredients into your two food prep areas.  Then you place your worker token next to one of the four decks.  You draw two cards from that deck and place them under your token.  These cards can be taken when it is your turn again.  If someone also places their token next to the same deck, then you can take those cards at that time.  If at the end of your turn you have more than four cards in your hand, you have to trash ingredients until you are down to four cards.  Once cards are in the trash, you may also send your worker to get ingredients from the trash--with the added benefit that you get to choose which two cards from the trash you put under your token.  The game continues until one of the decks is exhausted.  Add up the total value of the orders each player has filled.  The player with the highest value wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
