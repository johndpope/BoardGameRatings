			<description>Can the robots collect enough crystals to escape planet Pook?&lt;br/&gt;The robot's ship has run out of fuel and crash landed on the mysterious planet of Pook. They need to collect enough crystals so they can leave. The only problem is the aliens that live there want the crystals for themselves and don't feel like sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape From Planet Pook has 4 game modes for up to 16 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Play as the robots (1-8 players), get enough crystals to escape the planet!&lt;br/&gt;    Play as the aliens (1-8 players), stop the robots from stealing all your crystals!&lt;br/&gt;    Play as aliens vs. robots (2-16 players), robots try to take crystals to their ship and the aliens try to take the crystals to their cave (they use them as night lights).&lt;br/&gt;    Play Crystalball! (2-16 players), a super cool sport played by the aliens and robots, just for fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape From Planet Pook features modular game tiles, awesome artwork, an easy to remember alien/robot A.I. (in the Aliens or Robots modes all the players play against the game and the A.I. controls the opposing models for you!). Each alien and robot has their own unique power as well! Escape From Planet Pook also features a bonus micro card deck as well, so you can play your favorite card games on the go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has many features and suggestions for scalable difficulty. Don't let the cute artwork fool you, this is a complete game (or complete set of 5+ games!). You can make this game easy enough for any kid to beat it or impossibly hard for an adult. Are you ready to explore the planet of Pook?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
