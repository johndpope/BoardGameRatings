							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return of the Cyberlich</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad Ideas Are Forever&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one of the brightest minds in Science is horribly wronged by the corporations that want to exploit his work, he goes back through his catlog of failures (most of them Major Malfunctions of the past), and combines them into a bad idea on legs.  The result?  A spree of serial killings the likes of which the world has never seen before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, the Major Malfunction is in the technology itself.  Sometimes, though, the technology works exactly as it is expected to - the malfunction is in the people who put it together to begin with, or worse, in the society that made them what they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring big guns and prepare to see some horrors; the Cyberlich is out there, and no one is safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be advised:  This book contains nudity and disturbing imagery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be material referenced from the supplements Bios Ex Nihilum and Inner Darkness as well.  We will also be revisiting the previous Major Malfunction titles; Major Malfunctions #1: Rogue Cyborg, Major Malfunctions #2: Mall of the Future, and Major Malfunctions #3: Labyrinth of the LIZARDROIDS.  We'll also revisit some of the material in Doctor Vore 2... if you're building an engine of revenge, you pull out ALL the stops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone does need to fix these problems, from time to time... that's why there are Player Characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
