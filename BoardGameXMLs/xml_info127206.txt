							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Tom</name>
									
			<description>A first introduction to calculations for very young children. The centerpiece of the game is a plastic octopus with two arms stretched out. Around it, fishes of various values (and weights) are placed. The active player picks a large bundle of fish and hangs it on one of the arms, then tries to find several individual fishes for the other arm. If successful, octopus Mr. Tom looks straight and the arms are balanced, if not, it is losing focus and balance. &lt;br/&gt;In the two player version, one child can pick one side and let the other player make the calculations for getting the octopus back into its balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
