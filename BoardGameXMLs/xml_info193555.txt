							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blocksmiths</name>
									
			<description>Blocksmithing is a noble art. Not just anybody can collect a raw block of wood or iron and, through much careful crafting (and a big hammer) create weapons fit for heroes, lordlings, and rangers of the wild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take on the roles of blocksmiths, competing to run the best blocksmith shop in town. Using a spin down die worker placement mechanic (no rolling of dice!), players are rewarded for careful planning. Hire additional workers to help around the shop. Manage your resources, as well as, your hand of action cards. Fulfill orders for customers and convert them to repeat buyers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blocksmiths is a euro game for 2-4 players, playable in 45-60 min.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
