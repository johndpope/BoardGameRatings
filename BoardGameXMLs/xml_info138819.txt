			<description>From the publisher's website: &lt;br/&gt;Man&amp;rsquo;s first encounter with the elves was the source of what historians would later call &amp;ldquo;the Great Forest Wars.&amp;rdquo; Lumber was essential to building the Kingdom of Men and when they reached the deep forests of the world, they found the elves waiting for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wars lasted an entire generation but eventually ended with the elves seeking peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They gave no mention as to why, but one hundred years later, their secret was out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elves were losing their souls.&lt;br/&gt;                                                            &amp;mdash;Donnington True, The History of the War of the Kingdoms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Known World, no story is more tragic than the Fall of the Elves. Once a great and powerful race, the elves have fallen into decadence and indulgence. But the key to their downfall was not their nature, it was mankind&amp;rsquo;s discovery of the Iron Curse&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy began as a series of articles in Kobold Quarterly Magazine reinventing the &amp;ldquo;standard races&amp;rdquo; in fantasy roleplaying. Now, those same articles have been expanded and revised (five times their original size!) and fit with the PATHFINDER Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fifth in the series&amp;ndash;Guardians of the Wood&amp;ndash;reveals the great and terrible story of the elves. How they rose to power, how they fell and how they may be redeemed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy: Elves: Guardians of the Wood includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    FULL COLOR AND FULLY ILLUSTRATED!&lt;br/&gt;    New Elf Racial Traits including the Tree-bound elf, the Iron-bound elf, and half-elves!&lt;br/&gt;    The terrible secret of the Iron Curse and the ever-present shadow of the Dark Elves!&lt;br/&gt;    New Archetypes including the elven druid, sorcerer, witch and summoner!&lt;br/&gt;    A New Prestige Class: the Heart-Bound!&lt;br/&gt;    New Feats and New Rules for Forest Favors!&lt;br/&gt;    And More!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
