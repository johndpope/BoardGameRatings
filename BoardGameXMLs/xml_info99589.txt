			<description>Our first adaptation, Dixit, is a Jean-Louis Roubira game, published by Libellud and internationally multi-awarded. Dixit is a game for 3 to 6 players. The principle being to confront your own way of thinking with the other players' by giving them a clue, neither too precise nor too vague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 6 cards in his deck. The first player (the storyteller) selects one and gives a clue reflecting his perception of the picture. Each other players chooses a card they think matches best the given clue, then all cards are revealed. The goal of the game is to find which card had been chosent by the storyteller, without falling in the traps set by the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several gaming modes are offered, allowing the widest amount of freedom. Dixit is a multiplayer game, and can be played sitting round a table, either remotely. A solo tutorial mode help discovering the game's principles and interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
