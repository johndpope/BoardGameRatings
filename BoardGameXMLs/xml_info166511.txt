			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        'Not tonight, sorry.'&lt;br/&gt;        'Sorry, I'm busy.'&lt;br/&gt;        'I've got a big project at work.'&lt;br/&gt;        'Can't this weekend. It's my little one's birthday.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How often have we heard, or said, something similar to the above?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, even that is better than moving to a new area and not having anyone to play with. Which happened to me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I thought my roleplaying days were finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was wrong; I found a new way to roleplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I discovered solo roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo roleplaying is a way to roleplay when you are unable to roleplay with mates. It can't take the place of time around the table, but solo roleplaying gives you a deep roleplaying experience, one that requires only yourself. The only excuses you'll hear are the ones you bring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three key elements to exploring solo roleplaying:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Know Roleplaying&lt;br/&gt;     Know Thy Self&lt;br/&gt;     Know Thy Toolbox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this guide I'll help you explore all three and give you guidelines on how to start roleplaying alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
