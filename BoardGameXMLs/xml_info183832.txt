			<description>From the introduction:'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles for the Galactic Empire is a two-player game. Players attempt to outwit and outplay their opponent to achieve victory by scoring Chaos points. Chaos points are scored through control of the six regions in the sector. Control of the regions is determined by skillful deployment of space fleets, play of action chits, and tactical choices during combat. Players build their fleets choosing among six types with varying capabilities including military, morphogenetic (ability to convert opposing forces to the friendly side), and deployment/movement options. They pick chits randomly from 5 categories to enhance movement, tactical and build abilities, recruit special units, and disrupt opponent's plans.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
