			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirty Aces is a tabletop roleplaying game about a group of wanderers, vagabonds, ne'er-do-wells, and unlikely heroes who are bound together by fate/Karma/ka - whatever you call it. They only have each other to trust, with the whims of the world set against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are these wanderers? Where are they passing through? What is biting at their heels?
