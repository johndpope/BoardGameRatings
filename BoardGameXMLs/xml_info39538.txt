			<description>Zombies Want Fluffy&amp;trade; is an exciting two-player head-to-head board game where shambling undead horrors meet Fluffy, the adorable family dog. Each game takes 20 to 60 minutes to play, and features a tense, surprise-filled chase mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story thus far... Fluffy has had a lot to drink and is looking to &amp;ldquo;visit&amp;rdquo; a tree on his way home late one night. And he&amp;rsquo;s found his mark -- a beautiful, secluded tree right there in the back corner of the cemetery. Unbeknownst to poor Fluffy, the cemetery is filled with man-eating, er..., dog-eating zombies who just woke up for a midnight snack. Fluffy is gonna be that snack if the shambling menaces having anything to say about it. Can you help Fluffy race to freedom (and relief!) before his bladder explodes or he becomes zombie chow?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A serious game is at the heart of this absurd premise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
