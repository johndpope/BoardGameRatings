			<description>The legend of the flying canoe (La l&amp;eacute;gende de&lt;br/&gt;la chasse-galerie) involves transporting explorers, lumbermen, and trappers from the wilderness to their homes to see their sweethearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses this legend as a unique mechanic. Players fill their canoes with wares to trade to Indians in the territories for fur. When they are ready, or their canoe is full, they travel to a fort or a town to sell their furs at the current price. Because of the hazards involved in wilderness travel, it can behoove the explorer to fly the canoe back home. Flying is not without its perils, though, as the canoe may tip and the canoe's contents be lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game involves action points (you have three to do with as you choose), smart card play (cards determine movement, crew, and other special abilities), and smart trading (what goods do I take to trade to the Indians?).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
