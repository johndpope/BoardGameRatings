			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a board game with a story that goes along with it. Six teenagers dare each other to stay overnight in the spooky Dread House in their neighborhood. And in this game, the house really is haunted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dread House is a horror game for spooky children and brave adults. It's a role-playing board game in which you play teenagers who've dared each other to spend the night in Dread House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will run home to their mommy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What thing yet lives in the mansion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the sunrise ever come?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only you can answer these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PDF will come with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Rule Book;&lt;br/&gt;     Six Character Sheets;&lt;br/&gt;     Six Monster Sheets;&lt;br/&gt;     Six Monster Cards;&lt;br/&gt;     A deck of 22 Spooky Events;&lt;br/&gt;     A deck of 22 Useful Items;&lt;br/&gt;     And a map of Dread House (in three parts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some assembly and a Jenga set required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the teens explore the house, the players draw cards and describe to each other spooky things the characters see and useful things they discover. Each teen has special abilities that can help them explore and help each other stand up to the Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teenagers are scared by many things in the house. When their character is scared, the players pull blocks from a Tower of blocks to see if their character stays in the Dread House. If the Tower falls when someone pulls, that person gets to play a Monster in the house who scares the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If half the kids get scared away, the Monsters win and the teens have to try another time to prove their bravery. But if the card for the Sunrise is found while enough kids are still in the house, they have made it through the night!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
