							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iskelm√§: Parhaita Kotimaisia</name>
									
			<description>A Finnish pop music trivia game, produced in co-operation with the radio network Iskelm&amp;auml;. Mechanics are very similar to Trivial Pursuit but as an added extra the game comes with a CD with 150 song samples; before advancing to the central circle and winning the game, a player must listen to and correctly identify at least one song. (If a CD player is not available, a player that lands in the CD circle can freely choose the category of a question.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The categories of the questions are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Songs&lt;br/&gt;2) Lyrics&lt;br/&gt;3) Artists, bands, lyricists, miscellaneous&lt;br/&gt;4) Years, competitions, charts&lt;br/&gt;5) CD (samples)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game designer is uncredited, but the questions have been compiled by Pekka Nieminen and the music is by Studio Tauko/Yrj&amp;ouml; Buckbee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: &amp;quot;Iskelm&amp;auml;&amp;quot; does not have a direct translation in English but the German term &amp;quot;Schlager&amp;quot; has broadly the same meaning. A good example is Eurovision which is often described as a schlager competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
