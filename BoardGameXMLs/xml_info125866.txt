							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Awesome Possum</name>
									
			<description>Awesome Possum is a press your luck game where players are possums trying to cross the highway to save their possum babies. Each turn players decide whether to attempt a crossing or go home with the babies they've already rescued. If they decide to cross the road, they choose which section of the road they want to cross. After all players have chosen a section of road, those sections are revealed to see if they were successful. Successful crossings allow them to rescue more possum babies. Unsuccessful crossings send the possum back home until next round. Play continues until all possum babies have been rescued or all possums have gone home. The winner is the possum with the highest score, 2pts for each of their own baby possums and 1pt for each of an opponent's baby possums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
