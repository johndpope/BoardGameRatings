							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The AD&amp;D Guide to Highlander</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is immortal. Born in the highlands of Greyhawk 400 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;He is not alone. There are others like him; some good some evil.&lt;br/&gt;For centuries he has battled the forces of darkness with holy ground his only refuge. He cannot die unless you take his head and with it his power. In the end there can be only one. He is Ducan McCloud the highlander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fan-created sourcebook suggests a game-specific implementation method for adapting the Highlander media franchise to the tabletop.  The page count noted here is an approximation based on porting the ASCII document to a letter-sized word processor document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
