			<description>Time to travel the animal kingdom in Reise ins Tierreich &amp;ndash; after all, that's what the name of the game means!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each start the game on a different continent with one animal card from that continent in hand. One additional card from each continent is revealed, while the remaining cards are placed in decks near their continents, with the back of each card showing the name and image of an animal while that animal's stats are hidden on the other side of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player rolls the two number dice (with values 1-3) and moves spaces equal to one of the dice or the sum of the dice. A player can use ships or planes to move from one continent to another, with a ship moving her to an adjacent continent and a plane moving her to any continent (after first moving three spots on the runway).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes an action where she ends her turn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Qwiz - The player rolls the size (large or small) and topic (weight, age, size, number of young) dice, then selects which of the three top animal cards for that continent best match the values rolled, such as &amp;quot;Which of these three lives the longest?&amp;quot; If correct, the player keeps the card and adds it to her hand; if not, she returns all three cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Match - The player names one of the topic categories and largest or smallest, then each player reveals a card in their hands. Whichever player or players have the best showing in this challenge receive an animal card from the continent where they are currently located. The winner(s) place the winning card on the table, putting it out of play until after the next match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; National Park - The player can swap a card in hand with any of the cards by the side of the game board. She places her card face-down in the display and adds the other card to her hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first collects one animal card from each of the six continents while also having one animal of each of the five types (mammal, amphibian, reptile, bird, fish) wins the game. For a shorter game, the only winning requirement is to have one card from each continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
