							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Geographica: Plain &amp; Desert</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;200 monsters from the flatlands and dunes, compiled from over twenty sources, including over 93 classic 3.0 monsters updated for a 3.5 game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster Geographica books compile 200 monsters of specific terrains into one inexpensive resource. Collected from over 20 different sources, Monster Geographica books also provide an extensive array of challenge ratings and concepts. Due to its organization, Monster Geographica is an ideal monster supplement for random encounters, adventure building, and campaign design. Unlike other monster books, Monster Geographica organizes monsters by challenge rating. Building a CR 5 encounter? All CR 5 monsters are right next to each other; no need to flip back and forth between a CR table and the monsters? stat blocks. Need a random encounter level 7? Again, all CR 7 monsters are right next to each other. Don't see one you like? Flip to the CR 5 monsters and pick two. We also include an alphabetical table of contents with a listing of creatures by type and subtype (also arranged by challenge rating), making Monster Geographica books easy to use from many different approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
