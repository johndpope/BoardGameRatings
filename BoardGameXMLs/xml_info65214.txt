							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Abductee</name>
									
			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How they do it is as big a mystery as why they do it. But there is no doubt that it happens. There is always the white light. Sometimes, you vaguely remember dream-like images of small beings with large black eyes, staring at you, probing you. They never leave any evidence of their comings and goings, save for the fact that every time you lose hours or days of your life. But why you? Why is it you they choose to abduct and what is their purpose?! Somehow, you must find an answer to these questions! (Or at the very least get them to drop you off at Disneyworld once in a while.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Advances: Alien Abductee is a Modern OGL advanced class that lets players create someone who has the dubious honor of being the target of alien abductions. While it is perfect for a campaign where characters know The Truth Is Out There, it is also the solution for the problem of what to do with a character when its player only occasionally attends a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With strange visitors from another planet beaming the character hither and yon (thanks to the class ability &amp;quot;Missing Time&amp;quot;), GMs will never have to do back-flips to work in the character ever again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
