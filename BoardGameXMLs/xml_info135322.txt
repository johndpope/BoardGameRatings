			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bass Tour is a very detailed fishing simulator for DOS.  The player views a fishing area from above, with their cyan boat controllable through the arrow keys or the mouse.  There are competitive modes, in which the player must catch enough sizable fish in a particular amount of time, or practice modes where the maps may be explored without penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is detailed enough to force the player to put on a life jacket and lift the anchor before rowing or running the motor.  A vast array of rods and bait are available and work better in particular locations on the map which the fisher will discover.  Among many other things, the aerator must be managed in the live well, gas and battery power must be conserved, and fish can be kept or thrown back all at the player's discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
