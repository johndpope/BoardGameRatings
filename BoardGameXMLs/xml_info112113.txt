			<description>The motionless voyage...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interior and exterior worlds are made of hidden things - some are magnificent, others are frightening - all of them, in some way, are worth discovering. Is it your new life that is starting, or your proximity to the river? As you descend the mountain on the road to the capital, your vision clears little by little. For the first time, you are able to face your past, as well as your future. What do they have in store for you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
