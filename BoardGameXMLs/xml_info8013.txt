			<description>The board is set up as a football pitch with numbers 1-11 on the pitch and 3 trophies to one side.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to win as many trophies as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the players alternate and roll 2 die and then can cover the appropriate number on the pitch with a counter, or place 1 counter on a space of one of the numbers rolled.&lt;br/&gt;If no numbers are available you forfeit that go.&lt;br/&gt;A double six allows you to cover a trophy, but only if you already have position 9 covered on the field.&lt;br/&gt;Players may opt to keep a six thrown and only use the other die. They will then only use 1 die for future throws until they throw another 6 and win a trophy. They can then throw both die on their subsequent turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
