			<description>Sturdy Birdy - Roll the dice! Strike a pose! Find the perfect balance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reggie the Pigeon dreams of life in the circus as a high wire acrobat. (Sadly, Reggie's flight abilities have never taken off.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reggie needs your help to perfect 12 poses to land the high wire balancing, birdseed providing job he's always dreamed of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do that players must master 12 unique poses and be the first to make it to the end of the line. Ahh... 12 poses can't be so tough you say. Wait until you add counting spectators, flapping wings and a few choruses of &amp;quot;tweety, tweet, tweet&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strength, balance, counting, and determination all come into play as players attempt to master 12 different poses. On a player's turn they roll the dice to determine how long they must hold a pose and where on their body they must balance a bean bag while holding that pose. The first player to make their way through all of the poses wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No reading required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains: 12 large Reggie the Pigeon Pose Cards, 12 card stands, 4 seed bags, 2 foam dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
