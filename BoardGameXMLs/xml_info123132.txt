			<description>A game that combines a drinking game with top trumps. After winning a hand (as in top trumps) the winner also has to take a drink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pit their selected characters against each other on qualities such as 'Favourite tipple' and 'Special skills' to determine points scored, with losers downing their respective drinks and a special forfeit forcing them to drink the 'Dirty Pint' (when players draw a hand all the drinks are poured into one glass, the 'Dirty Pint').&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;33 playing cards feature a charismatic illustration of a variety of parodies of notoriously drinkers, such as the WAG, Abby Goodnight, and Prime Minister, Wineston Burphill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
