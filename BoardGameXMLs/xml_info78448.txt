It has eight playable characters, each with his own special move. The game's full title is Tag Team Match M.U.S.C.L.E.. The game was followed by a 1987 Japan-only sequel for the Famicom Disk System titled, Kinnikuman: Kinniku Ōkurai Sōdatsusen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Singles mode (one on one bout) Two-on-Two tag team wrestling match.
