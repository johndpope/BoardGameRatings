			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Solo Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short adventure is designed to be run solo, or can also be used in a traditional Metamorphosis Alpha game. From the foreword by author James M. Ward:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have never written an MA adventure like this one before. In the fourth version of the MA rules I presented a storyline where the ship runs into an invisible asteroid filled with mushroom and crystal life forms. That storyline has always needed a transition piece that ties the starship Warden into the asteroid. This is that adventure. Take any of your characters from pure strain humans to androids or robots and introduce them to the little valley where the new hole in the ship is presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the unusual features of this product is that this game can be run solo. All you have to do is use a strong character and pay attention to the numbers and you can test out the adventure all by yourself. You can then turn around and run it for any number of friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
