			<description>&amp;quot;Balls of Steel is a pinball computer game developed by Wildfire Studios and released on December 12, 1997. It is the only title to be published under the Pinball Wizards label, a division of Apogee Software (today known as 3D Realms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's original box art showed a female hand holding a large pair of pinballs, above the phrase, &amp;quot;Come play with our balls.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's realistic physics and highly interactive and imaginative tables have been lauded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game was originally released, it was possible to upload high scores to the WorldScores server, for a global ranking. This feature has since been discontinued.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Balls of Steel (computer game), available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
