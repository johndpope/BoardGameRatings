							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maelstrom Gothic</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maelstrom was one of the classic Roleplaying games of the 1980&amp;rsquo;s, innovative in design and setting alike, and was rewritten and revised as Maelstrom Domesday in 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maelstrom Gothic is a game of supernatural investigation in Victorian England. Tired of the humdrum life and enervated by a strange event, the characters are tasked with looking into reports of ghosts and poltergeists, faeries and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lifepath system creates characters that are both deep and yet competent for the tasks ahead. Rewritten and expanded rules provide fast and flexible gameplay whilst still covering most in-play situations. The original Maelstrom free-form magic system allows a magical character to accomplish almost anything...at a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This core book also includes a full guide to life in 1850 and two sample settings. There is enough in this one book for years of play and hundreds of adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So grab your dice, open this book and enter the world of Maelstrom Gothic...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
