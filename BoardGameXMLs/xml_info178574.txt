			<description>Children's game. The board represents a swimming pool. Before play starts, place the 25 tiles face-down, one in each square.&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a colour die and may take a face-down tile related to that column or row which matches the colour thrown. If you roll a 'white' then you may choose any colour. 13 of the 25 tiles have a rubber ring on them and twelve are without a ring. When the pool is 'empty', players count up their tiles with rings and the one with them most, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd game indicated in the rules is for older children. This time two colour dice are rolled together and draw the tile indicated by looking along a row indicated by one dice and also down the column indicated by the 2nd die. In addition, depending on the colours rolled, there are opportunities to give 'empty' tiles to other players or you may lose a tile you have previously taken. When all the tiles are taken, you add up your tiles with rings and subtract the tiles you have without rings. The highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
