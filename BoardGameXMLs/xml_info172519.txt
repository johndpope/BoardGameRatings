							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horrors of the Lifechain</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guide to the Known Galaxy (Otherverse Games,2008) was the first release for the Otherverse America Campaign Setting. This galaxy-spanning sourcebook introduced the Lifechain- a strange ecosystem binding an assortment of semi-divine, ultra-powerful creatures and dangerous predators to one another. Players could accept Lifechained feats to enter this ecosystem, gaining incredible powers, at the cost of heightened vulnerability to an assortment of truly terrifying monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrors of the Lifechain focuses on the Lifechain as a source of endless new threats for heroes to battle. It collects the revised Lifespawn originally presented in Dark Star Bestiary I &amp;amp; II, and returns them to their natural habitat: deep space of the Otherverse America campaign setting. It also pulls in a few beings from the well-received Space Monsters series of mini-bestiaries: the revamped Chyss work great as Nemesis-bloodline Lifespawn conquerors, and make Phallus Space that much more dangerous. Even better, tons of original new creations fill in the gaps left by the original Guide&amp;rsquo;s short bestiary. Future sourcebooks will continue the lengthy process of revising and expanding Guide to the Known Galaxy, focusing on heroic options for Lifechained player characters, new Lifechained feats, powers and talents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrors of the Lifechain can be incorporated in any sci-fi or modern horror campaign setting, but they are most effective in campaigns incorporating Lifechained feats and powers. Without the intimate, genetic level connection to Lifechain player characters, their allies and adversaries, these monsters lose much of their impact and become just another xeno-predator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
