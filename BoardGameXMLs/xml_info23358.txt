			<description>&amp;quot;The winners blast off for Earth below, the loser doesn't get to go.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a circular molded plastic gameboard about 12&amp;quot; diameter which resembles the lunar surface and is raised on 'legs'.  There are four craters in the surface, one for each player.  The center is dominated by a plastic rocket which locks into the gameboard mechanism, effectively creating a platform beneath each crater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with the full complement of five plastic astronauts of their selected color.  Players place one of their astronauts on the platform in the nearest crater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A marble is spun around the rim of the circular gameboard; when it loses velocity it drops into one of a series of colored depressions which circle the board just inside the marble track.  The player controlling the astronauts corresponding to the colored depression that the marble stops in must quickly grab the central rocket &amp;amp; remove it from the board.  This causes the platforms beneath the craters to move aside and the astronauts to fall through the board. Players must attempt to catch their astronauts before they fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any astronauts that fall through the board are given to the player who removed the rocket.  The winner is the first player to get ten astronauts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting game in that four (and only four) players are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
