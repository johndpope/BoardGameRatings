							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dream Healers</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though often seen as a priestly order, the dream healers follow no set god. For them, the power of healing lies within the patient and their dreams. Able to enter another&amp;rsquo;s dreams, they guide their patients through past events, allowing them to relive them and heal many wounds that other healers cannot touch. The journey is not without risk, for the world within a dream becomes a new reality, and death there comes just as easily as in the waking world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dream Healers is an ebook detailing a drop-in organization for your Fantasy game, complete with history, tenets, organizational structures, ways of joining, and ready-to-use NPCs. It also includes the dream healer prestige class and two new magical items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
