			<description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new mayor in town! And he&amp;rsquo;s here to change things!&lt;br/&gt;On the order of the day: Privatise transports.&lt;br/&gt;He put together a team to redesign the city&amp;rsquo;s main lanes, and he now needs enterprising volunteers to achieve it. &lt;br/&gt;And they only got 4 years to do it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will represent the CEO of a Private Mass Transport company, trying to achieve high value for their shares in the stock market, and a healthy bank account. The City needs a new transport grid, either with Bus or Metro Lines.&lt;br/&gt;The players will achieve that by building segments of Transport Lines connecting the objectives as dictated by public surveys. Also, the City Hall will come up with special projects, which will be bided by the players.&lt;br/&gt;The game turns are split into Quarters (3 months), in which everyone does their actions. After all players had a turn, the Quarter advances, players receive profit (or not!), and the first player of the Quarter changes (so that everyone can have a quarter in which they are the first to build).&lt;br/&gt;After all Quarters are done, the Year advances and players tally up their accomplishments that year, which will directly impact their Stock Market EOY results.&lt;br/&gt;By the end of the fourth year, the city should be fully networked, and we&amp;rsquo;ll have a happy Mayor, ready to win the next elections. The player that had the most impact (somehow measured by the value of the shares), will be given the key to the city!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That easy?&lt;br/&gt;Not really. Not everything goes as planned, strange events occur, people lie, politicians cheat&amp;hellip;. &lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of every quarter something will happen that can change a smile into a frown. Or the other way around&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s also the Influence that such powerful transport tycoons (the players) will have on politics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows, sometime in four years, you might be the one smiling in front of the cameras holding a golden key to the city!&lt;br/&gt;Or you could be the one already planning for revenge&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either way, fun is coming your way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
