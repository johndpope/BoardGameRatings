			<description>Spred is a LOT derivative for Shibumi. It features a simple ball-removal game mechanism that makes loops impossible, but at the same time, produces potentially long games in a very small playing area. An average game lasts 45-50 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players (White and Black) start with a supply of 8 red balls each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board starts empty. Players take alternate turns placing a ball of their colour (White or Black, not red) on an empty position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, after a player's move, there is at least one straight line of three connected* balls (touching) of their colour (the lines can be orthogonal or across levels), the player does the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Chooses any of those lines of three.&lt;br/&gt;2. Removes the maximum number of movable balls from that line. This means that the player must find out the correct order to remove them so he removes the most. Balls may drop as a result of these removals.&lt;br/&gt;3. Places one RED ball of their supply on any of the empty spaces that composed the removed line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player runs out of red balls or there are no more available moves, whatever happens first. The player with less red balls in hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(*)- Note that flat diagonal lines are not connected!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
