			<description>On your turn you draw a card and read the question out loud. The correct answer is also printed on the card. Questions range from absurd to very difficult.  eg : &amp;quot;Why is a carrot orange and a tomato red?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What happens to the caffeine that 's extracted to create caffeine free coffee?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Each player writes an answer in secret on a piece of paper. The player who read the question writes down the correct answer in his own words. Answers are gathered, shuffled and numbered. The answers are read out loud and every player votes on what he thinks is the correct answer. The other players get a point if they guess the correct answer or if someone thought his or her wrong answer was right.&lt;br/&gt;The first player who reaches the end of the 20 step score track wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
