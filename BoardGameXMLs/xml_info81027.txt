			<description>In Animocity, players represent city planners planning a new city's layout. They'll have to wheel and deal to make sure their proposals for the city are the grandest of them all. Players also take on the role of contractor, supplying the project with the supplies necessary for construction. The competition will be fierce, but no player can go it alone. Opponents will need to use one another's supplies in order to finalize plans and earn points. Temporary cooperation will spurn heated rivals as players make and break promises along the way. Once the blueprint is finalized, the planner who shaped the city the most is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
