							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The 20th Century</name>
									
			<description>The 20th Century is regarded as the most glorious and most horrible century in the history of mankind. Never before were there as many world-changing inventions, never were the cruelties and crimes against mankind more horrible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game players have the chance to represent different &amp;quot;aspects&amp;quot;: Science, Culture, Politics, Religion, Industry and Military throughout the 100 years depicted in the game. Each of these aspects plays completely differently and has its own strategy.  &amp;quot;The 20th Century&amp;quot; is neither a war game nor an economic game - the road to victory includes careful timing of your aspect-related event cards, creating advances and influencing countries and wars. Historical events play a large role, also all wars and minor conflicts of the century are depicted. At many points in the game it is even possible for the players to change history. The game is equally suited for pro-gamers and casual gamers and is a fun way to get an overview over this fascinating period of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
