			<description>From the text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towering over the center of Pumpkin Town is the smoke-stack of Uncle Hieronymous's Yum-Yum Factory. Ominous, like a word left unspoken, this pumpkin-topped symbol of one town's struggle betrays the heart and soul of a tiny town's inner life, death, and unlife. You see the Pumpkinus Magnificatum at the top? Been there since I don't know when. We're mighty proud of that- the Pumpkintown monument, you might say. It descends slowly, ever-so-slowly as the calendar approaches October 31st. When the Pumpkinus Magnificatum touches the base of the pole, gateways open up and nightmare wagons are hitched up to go to the other place. Trick or Treat Day -- 10,000 ghosts- and all the residents of Pumpkin Town who can manage it make the trip- big-bag little-baggedly crossing to the other side. Its an evening's entertainment to be sure, but also it is the only thing that keeps this town going. You watch. You just wait and see. October'll be here soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an All-American Main Street kind of small town.. It might be Anytown, USA - nevermind the walking corpses in the streets and the suspicious stench of Smarties and Pixie Sticks that permeates the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
