			<description>Object of the game is to be the first to get rid of your cards by dressing Cleon, the chameleon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists 48 cards which can be either a head or body, or tail for 16 different chameleons. Each creature will be 2 colors (unique combination), but each of these colors will be found on other chameleons, in different combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early in the game, the dealer prepares a single chameleon, with elements of the same color, it raises the center of the table. The cards are then shuffled and the dealer deals eight cards to each participant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, the active player will try play one of his cards to replace a body part of the chameleon in the middle of the table. &lt;br/&gt;- this card must be the same body part as the removed card. &lt;br/&gt;- this card must have a color in common with one of the neighboring cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the active player can't play, he draws one card and passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player who gets rid of his cards first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
