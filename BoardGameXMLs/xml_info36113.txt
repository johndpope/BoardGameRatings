			<description>&amp;ldquo;Space empires against each other and the bug threat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is randomly constructed, drawn on a piece of paper. Each player selects a starting world for his empire. A random number of worlds (1-6) are infected by Bug units, which reproduce and spread to other worlds. The players each start with one frigate, one freighter, ten troops, six food units, and six machinery units. Agricultural worlds provide one food unit per turn. Industrial worlds convert one food unit to one machinery unit each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has the most victory points after ten turns. Victory points are awarded at the end of each turn based on the types of worlds controlled, for each cruiser owned, and for having the longest trade route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
