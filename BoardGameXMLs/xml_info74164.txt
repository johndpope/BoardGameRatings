			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quiz game for people who just turned 30 and want to test their knowledge about the trendy things from their youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The saught person or term has to be described by everything you might imagine. Each correct guess allows you to move towards victory but beware the special spots on the board which forces you to use only your hands and feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation of the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you remember Tamagotchis, Techno, Beverly Hills and the Spice Girls? Very well because those things have to be explained in a creative way! How? At the beginning it doesn't care how, you may use words, your hands, your feet or a pen or whatever. &lt;br/&gt;Whoever's guess is correct advances on the scoring board fast than the others. &lt;br/&gt;Tension or even more fun is achieved by reaching spots fields on the board. The allowed ways of explaining are reduced to a minimum.&lt;br/&gt;Due to two different playing modes it is possible to play the game with younger people. Join us on a time travel and play with your past!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
