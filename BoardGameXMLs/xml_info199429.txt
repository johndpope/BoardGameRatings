			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gadzooks! Make sure November 5th goes with a bang!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The day: November 5th 1605.&lt;br/&gt;The place: The Houses of Parliament.&lt;br/&gt;The plot: The destruction of the King and his Parliament.&lt;br/&gt;You must help Guy Fawkes rewrite history and be successful in his attempts to get rid of King and Parliament. Like the original attempt it is fraught with danger, with bats, devils and beasties to hamper your fiendish attempt to fulfil your dastardly plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To succeed you must blow up the Houses of Parliament. To accomplish this you must collect the special firework hidden in one of the rooms and take it to the room where all the barrels are stored. When the firework is lit, the game is completed. Guy will need his sticks of dynamite to blow up the building, but can use them to kill the creatures that roam around. There are more sticks lying around, but Guy runs the risk of losing lives collecting them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIREWORKS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fireworks strewn around are for Guy's use, but there are not man and some perform special effects. Indiscriminate use of fireworks can make it impossible to get to the outer reaches of the building, thus completing the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
