			<description>Grand Piquet 2nd Edition - Many changes were made for this new edition of Grand Piquet.  The Army commander now plays a more pivotal role in the command and control of a Corps.  These formations no longer move whenever or wherever they wish.    A D12 is now the basis for all initiative rolls, which effectively eliminates the need for phases, as well as mitigates the wild swings in initiative.    The Sequence decks have been radically altered. Now there are Action cards, by type of unit [e.g. Infantry Action card], whereby there is much greater flexibility in actions taken by units.  Also, the basic Sequence deck is now made up of 20 cards, instead of 28.  The combat system is based primarily on Target type, so there are fewer modifiers to calculate. The basic concept of &amp;ldquo;chipping&amp;rdquo; within the morale system is intact, yet there is no need to keep track of morale chips. Unit / sub unit designations are determined by numbers of men and not by regiment.  Players determine the size and make up of a unit, thereby effectively tailoring each Command Group to a particular situation or task.  These are but a few of the changes that have been made. &lt;br/&gt;It is hoped that this new edition will keep the flavor and excitement of the original, while improving the mechanics, which will give a more fluid, less static feel to the game.  One final comment that deserves remembering:  Piquet is an innovative system designed to give players the opportunity to make command decisions based upon finite resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
