			<description>This rare McLoughlin Brothers card game is undated, but the style of the box (fancy embossed gold lettering and borders on a pebbled maroon cardboard box) is very similar to that of an 1890s Logomachy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of 54 cards, divided into 18 books of three. Each book has cards labelled A, B and C. The A cards bear the first two lines of a limerick. The B cards have the last line of the limerick. And the C cards bear the middle two lines of the limerick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt an equal number of cards, and immediately set aside any complete books. On their turn, players may either try to force a card on another player or obtain a card. To force a card, a player must hold and A or B card or both, but not the C. He calls out the letter and number of his card(s), reads the line(s) on them, and the player with the C card must respond. The first player then hands his card(s) to the C player. To obtain a card, a player with a C card asks a particular player for the name and number of another card in that book. If successful, he receives it and gets another turn; if not his turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete books are set aside as they are formed, and the first player to get rid of all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
