			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Damsel in Distress!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young mother of royal blood has been kidnapped from the village of Buckshire, in the Kingdom of Elleron! In this age of chivalry, the quest to save a young woman from evil demons is the highest honor, the highest responsiblity a hero can ask for!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the trail of her abductors through the forest, into the outlands between planes and to the Inn of Limbus. The inn serves as a portal to the lower planes, it is also ruled by a mysterious deity called The Neutrality. The inn is also a place of sanctuary where all races of beings are safe from others, unless the Neutrality of Limbus is violated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigate and find the clues to where she has been taken and why. Explore the dungeon and sewers below the inn, where anything goes and danger lurks around every dark, dank corner. Levels 8-12 of a variety of classes are best suited for this 56 page adventure. The NPC and monster appendix adds twenty more pages at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
