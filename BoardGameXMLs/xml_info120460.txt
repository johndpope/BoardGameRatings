			<description>Legends of Valour is a role-playing video game. The game is coded by Paul Woakes, that also made The Mercenary-series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is seen in first-person perspective, being one of the first RPG games (after Ultima Underworld) to use a smooth-scrolling three-dimensional environment engine in the style of Wolfenstein 3D. The game also features a point-and-click interface, an either automated or realtime combat, and day/night cycle. The game's system is quite complex and realistic for its time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a walled capital city called Mitteldorf, where the player can explore the streets, buildings and a massive network of dungeons and sewers connected through a natural cave system, while completing various missions given by its numerous citizens, all while looking for his/her missing cousin Sven (named Gareth in the early version), which is the starting point of the game's main quest (to restore the king to power and slay an evil demon). Mitteldorf is over a squared mile in size and among its many building are several taverns, hostels, shops, guilds, temples, prisons as well as other places of interest (well over 100 locations in total). The guilds and temples offer the player career paths with unique missions; through the game, the player's character can even become a vampire or a werewolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Legends of Valour,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
