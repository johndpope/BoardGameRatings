							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monstrous Feats!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters are the principal challenge PCs face in their adventuring careers. Whether they are the monsters populating a dangerous dungeon, encountered in the wild wilderness, or the mastermind villains behind nefarious schemes, monsters are the staple of any fantasy game. Monsters possess a wide range of eclectic and extraordinary abilities, from the feared vampiric energy drain, to the weakening touch of the shadow. In the pages of this product you will find 48 feats that enhance these fearsome abilities of monsters, allowing them to enhance their abilities and use them more effectively against the PCs in any DM&amp;rsquo;s campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats in this book allow you to create wild vampires that not only drain your energy but also drain your spells and use them against you, great trampling beasts that can scatter opponents that stand in their path in all directions, and creatures that have evolved powerful defences against the powerful turning power of clerics. With these feats, each creature has honed its traditional abilities into devastating attacks and powerful defences. Your monsters won&amp;rsquo;t be the same again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
