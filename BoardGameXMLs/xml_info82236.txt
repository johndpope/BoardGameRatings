			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy and action RPG hybrid based on Koei&amp;rsquo;s Dynasty Warriors series. The storyline is based on &amp;ldquo;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&amp;rdquo; novel, and follows the three main factions of Wu, Shu, and Wei after the fall of the Han Dynasty in ancient China. Gameplay allows the player to choose one of 13 heroes from the time period and has them fight their way through hordes of enemy soldiers to complete objectives and defeat officers. Unlike the Dynasty Warriors series, the overmap is grid-based. The player moves around the grid map until they encounter an enemy unit, upon which a combat screen is brought up. The player has three types of attacks which can reduce enemy health, and once combat is resolved the overmap is changed to reflect the result. To make up for the reduced character roster from other games in the franchise, Dynasty Warriors Advance includes an extended weapon system for the player to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
