			<description>&amp;quot;White Album (ホワイトアルバム, Howaito Arubamu)  is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Leaf, and was originally released on May 1, 1998 for the PC as a CD-ROM. A PlayStation 3 version published by Aquaplus  with several modification and a sequel to the original visual novel, titled White Album 2: Introductory Chapter, were announced to be released in Winter 2009. The gameplay in White Album follows a linear plot line, which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Album has received several transitions to other media. A manga adaptation illustrated by Japanese illustrator Chako Abeno began serialization in the shōnen magazine Dengeki Daioh in August 2008. It was followed by an anime adaptation produced by Seven Arcs, which began broadcast in Japan on January 3, 2009.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;White Album (visual novel)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
