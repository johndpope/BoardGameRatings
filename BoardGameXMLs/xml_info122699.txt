			<description>From Wikipedia: Route-16 (ルート16) is an arcade game released by Tehkan and Sun Electronics in 1981. The game was licensed to Centuri for distribution in the United States. It was also ported to the Emerson Arcadia 2001. A racing game where the main character is the greed. Several cars battle each other on maze-like rooms trying to get the money bags and avoiding the dangers. In this game, everybody cares just about the money, showing that the money is the &amp;quot;route&amp;quot; of all evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a car which must explore a maze divided into sixteen rooms. He or she must get all the money bags while avoiding the opposite cars and trying not to run out of fuel. Every time the player goes out of a room, a map is showed, indicating the position of every car and all the money bags. There are also flags that can be driven over to invert the roles, so the player can crash the opposite cars and stop them for a few seconds, while getting bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Route-16 (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
