							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">When Giraffes Attack!</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nyambe-tanda &amp;mdash; the Land of the Overpower &amp;mdash; is a vast continent of exotic creatures and wide expanses, where ancestor orisha cry for brave tribal warriors to carve out the hearts of foul mchawi wizards, and where dragon-blooded sei sorcerers once joined the fierce Amazons of Nibomay in the bloody Rebelling Time to win their freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;West of Nyambe&amp;rsquo;s Giko Taaba mountain range lies the tUbI grassland, a nearly featureless expanse of savannah broken only by the occasional watering hole or tree. The grasses in the tUbI reach as tall as six feet in the most wild of regions, and provide sustenance to a tremendous variety of animals, such as wildebeest and gazelle, upon which the fearsome lion-centaurs called the entare prey. The only people who regularly brave the tUbI are those of the nomadic Shombe tribe, and even they take pains to avoid the entare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the party travels through this grassland, they occasionally hear a strange whistling sound off in the distance. Eventually, the party catches sight of a gigantic tree in the distance, hundreds of feet in height. Before they can react to the sight, a nearby group of giraffes suddenly flies into a berserk rage and charges the party!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: This originally appeared in Game Trade Magazine and is now available separately on the Atlas Games website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
