			<description>The Cornish word for 'square', for 2 to many more players where the winner is the first player to complete a circuit of their score card, called their &amp;lsquo;Table card&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game the players men are called Dan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sets themselves are made up of either:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a (A) set; Red, Yellow, Blue &amp;amp; Purple cards; Or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a (B) set; Black, White, Green &amp;amp; Brown cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore with the adding together of further sets, e.g. 2 (A) sets, this would be a 2 to 4 player game with up to twenty-four Dan per player; or with the adding together of an (A) &amp;amp; a (B) set this would give a game for 2 to 8 players, with up to 12 Dan per player: Etc. There is no limit to how many sets can be added together to make a bigger and bigger game! Cracking. Recommended Ages 9+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
