			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sony PlayStation version of Doom was a conversion of The Ultimate Doom and Doom II by Williams Entertainment and ran with a modified version of the Doom engine used in the Atari Jaguar port.ultiplayer was unusual in that splitscreen was unavailable; two consoles had to be linked together instead. This made the multiplayer truer to the original, but it was done at the sacrifice of accessibility. Presumably two players (or more) running on one console would reduce the speed of the game dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Doom on the PlayStation used the same engine and team who brought Doom onto the PlayStation. It included a mixture of 30 levels from Master Levels for Doom II (13 of 21 levels available), TNT: Evilution (11 of 32 levels available), and The Plutonia Experiment (6 of 32 levels available). The instruction booklet, however, erroneously states within that the game contains 30+ levels. Although the box does not mention the Master Levels, the back cover of the instructions indeed acknowledges their inclusion. Final Doom also has support for the PlayStation Mouse which the original Doom did not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
