							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Museum of Infamous Heroism</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nestled on the outskirts of a wealthy city district, this drab unassuming stone structure gives little outside indication of its contents. A bronze plaque above the double door entrance reads: &amp;ldquo;Museum of Infamous Heroism.&amp;rdquo; For over 35 years, curator Galdor Vorac has collected and preserved objects belonging to the most nefarious individuals throughout history. The museum is funded by donations from the city and from visitors. Vorac is the sole worker and proprietor and has committed all of the relics&amp;rsquo; histories to memory. On days of pleasant weather, the human curator can be seen in the museum&amp;rsquo;s small yard giving historical lectures or answering questions about his newest acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Museum of Infamous Heroism is a 9-page ebook detailing a drop-in location for your fantasy game. It includes a general overview of the location, and area-by-area descriptions of the museum, its contents and curator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
