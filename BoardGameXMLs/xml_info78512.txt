			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set 6 years after the Huffman Conflict of the original Front Mission, Front Mission 4 drops you in the year 2096 in the middle of a brewing political conflict.  The story switches you back-and-forth between two point-of-view storylines which really fleshes out the background characters and villains.  Story aside, the main part of the game to love is the battle mechs, called Wanzers, that you purchase, outfit, and then pilot onto the battlefield.  Each piece of your Wanzer has strengths, limitation, and weight, all of which must be balanced if you are to have any chance at victory in the battles ahead.  On top of customizing your Wanzer, you also update your pilots with their own set of skills that will aid them on the battlefield.  Battles take place in a turn-based 3D grid, and range from moderately challenging to downright frustrating at times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Front Mission 4 was released for the Playstation 2 in the US in 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
