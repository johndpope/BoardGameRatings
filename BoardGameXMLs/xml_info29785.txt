			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Wizards of the Vicious Circle is a two-player game as clever and original as any you will see. Strategy goes beyond moving pieces as players try to out-guess which three of five creatures the opponent will initially deploy, and where. The other two creatures become reinforcements later in the game. The vicious circle (how each of the five pieces can capture only one of the opponent's) interacts with board terrain and initial deployments to make each game uniquely interesting and intriguing.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
