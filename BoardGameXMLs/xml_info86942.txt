			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;An adaptation of the Fading Suns setting for the Savage Worlds system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more than two years I spent making this adaptation of the &amp;quot;best sci-fi setting ever&amp;quot;. Relax - it's a joke (may be). Fading Suns is really one of my favored settings, at the same shelf with 7th Sea and Deadlands. But, for my sorrow, the original VPS system- oh, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about one of the worst role playing engine I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, for more than two years I was making this adaptation. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s already the third edition of the rules, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a conversion- some setting elements were changed to be more in line with &amp;quot;FFF&amp;quot; concept. The two previous &amp;quot;editions&amp;quot; were partially in Russian language; this one goes totally in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is still not finished, as I hope the history of this great setting is not yet ended. With time I&amp;rsquo;ll put some new content in this adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
