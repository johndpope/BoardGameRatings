							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kindred Spirits on the Roof</name>
									
			<description>Kokonotsuboshi Girls' Academy of Commerce, a school built on the site of an old castle, known as &amp;quot;Shirojo.&amp;quot; Toomi Yuna spends her time here on her own, until one day her lunch on the roof is suddenly interrupted by a pair of ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enoki Sachi, who died in an accident before the war, and Nagatani Megumi, who died of illness thirty years ago. These &amp;quot;kindred spirits&amp;quot; died with unrequited feelings in their hearts, met, and fell in love. They hold an ardent wish to experience their &amp;quot;first time&amp;quot; together before their eternal rest.&lt;br/&gt;...But they don't know how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two haunting spirits enlist Yuna to help them foster more &amp;quot;yuri&amp;quot; couples at the school, to assist girls struggling with their hidden feelings, and with the hope that their successes will help them glean the insight they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
