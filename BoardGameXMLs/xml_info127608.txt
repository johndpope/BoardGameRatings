			<description>Ghosts in the Grid is a 2 to 4 player card game, with the flexibility to combine two or more games to increase complexity and/or numbers of players. Create the &amp;ldquo;Grid&amp;rdquo; by arranging 35 random square tiles to create the playing field, play cards to advance your &amp;ldquo;Ghost&amp;rdquo; or thwart opposing players by hacking them with &amp;ldquo;Virus&amp;rdquo; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to retrieve the Data from the Central Node at all costs! Escape with it before opposing players hack your Ghost and the System assimilates you. Each player begins on opposite corners of the assembled Grid. You play Ghost cards on yourself to move towards the center and attempt to retrieve the Data, or put a stop to other players getting to the object by playing Virus cards on them. If you have too many Virus cards on your Command Row mat at once, you will be Assimilated and will have to start over again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you think you have what it takes? Prepare yourself with Ghosts in the Grid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 4 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Scale: Each player represents a Ghost attempting to retrieve the Data (center tile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
