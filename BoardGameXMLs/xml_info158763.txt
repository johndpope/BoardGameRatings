			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generic Pulp Barbarian style Encounter and Event Tables&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the Cataclysm rocked the world. Atlantis and Lemuria sank, and the Pictish Islands were heaved up to form the mountain peaks of a new continent. Sections of the Thurian Continent vanished under the waves, or sinking, formed great inland lakes and seas. Volcanoes broke forth and terrific earthquakes shook down the shining cities of the empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whole nations were blotted out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;~Robert E. Howard, Excerpt from The Hyborean Age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add exciting content to any barbarian campaign where other worldly demons, wizards, and a prehistoric landscape challenge heroic barbarians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you a fan of barbarian fiction, in the vein of Kull and Conan?
