			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reliance on mundane equipment in 5th edition fantasy games is more important than ever. Magical items are rare, and most characters rely on unenchanted equipment for a large portion of their adventuring career. As such, there exists a gap between mundane items and magical equivalents. In the past, this gap was filled with higher quality items, but the 5th edition fantasy rules choose not to include rules for such items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple +1 bonus to various statistics is not enough, as the current edition has shifted away from throwing a numeric bonus at something to solve a problem or fill a niche. Instead, this product presents you with a dynamic system for items of higher quality that feel like magic without actually doing anything supernatural. Swing an expertly balanced ancestral sword forged by a race synonymous with quality craftsmanship. Use disposable artisan quality tools to improve your success rate. Wear excellent accessories that highlight your ability to smooth talk and impress. These are not items of magic, but of equipment of quality!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
