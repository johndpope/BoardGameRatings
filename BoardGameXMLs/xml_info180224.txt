			<description>Greatest of All Mountains is a competitive Mountain building card game for 2-5 players that can be played in 45-90 minutes. The game currently includes nearly 160 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents a mountain which is vying for the title of Greatest of All Mountains. To achieve this, players must acquire the most victory points in the three phases of the game, using various abilities and events to gain an advantage over the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In hopes of achieving the high honor of being named Greatest of All Mountains, each player must first form the terrain of their mountain. By adding slopes, lakes, cliffs and more to their mountain they craft the foundation of their strategy. Players may also compete to gain the all or nothing &amp;quot;Tallest Mountain&amp;quot; award for additional VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, players must build facilities on their terrain. This is where strategy becomes very important as the facilities built greatly effect how the next phase will play out. Build the best facilities on the faces of your mountain or choose to build sub-par facilities on your opponent's mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, each player must attract tourists to their mountain. The goal is to get tourists to your mountain's &amp;quot;Safe Zone&amp;quot; where they will be scored at the end of the game. Tourists frequently change hands, so players must employ a variety of strategies and abilities to make sure their tourists are safe from the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
