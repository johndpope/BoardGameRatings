			<description>RPG Excerpt:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is now 2085.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global population has grown beyond sustainable levels due to rampant advances in healthcare. As life expectancies grow longer and longer, resources become fewer and fewer. New population legislation forces everyone over the age of 35 to complete the Social Value Exam to determine how much they were worth to society. Unfortunately, the test strongly favors the young. Each year on their birthdays, those over the age of 35 must report to testing facilities with the previous year's passing test results and then test again. Those who fail are given one week to get their affairs in order and say their goodbyes before reporting to a government sponsored, privately operated euthanasia center. Those over thirty-five who can't prove they passed the SVE can legally be killed on sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have just received your failing test results. Are you going to turn yourself in and die peacefully in a Death Bed, or will you run and rage against the dying of the light?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's it going to be, old man?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
