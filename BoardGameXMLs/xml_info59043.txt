			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Step right up for some psionic support classes worth playing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By joining allies and even adversaries into a mental network, the Society Mind offers a host of new options to players who have a desire to play a support role while still having a wide variety of capabilities. Each day, choose your powers anew; but make them count, as your choices are limited. The Society Mind base class is one of the most original and unique new psionic classes since the introduction of the 3.5 psionics revision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Worldthought Medic, a variant on the society mind, provides healing support without shackling the character to only performing healing. The worldthought medic allows party members to access healing on their own through the worldthought network, rather than the medic having to initiate the heal. In addition, the worldthought medic is capable of stealing the life from enemies and using it to mend wounds, including his own. Later in his career, the worldthought medic can even kill creatures to suck their very life essence and transfer that energy to his network members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this supplement you will find the society mind and worldthought medic base classes in their entirety, four new prestige classes for use with these new classes, as well as a host of new feats, powers, and psionic items for characters to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Untapped Classes: Complete Society Mind combines all the material found in Untapped Classes: Society Mind, Untapped Classes: Worldthought Medic, Untapped Classes: Soulbinder, Untapped Classes: Life Leech, and Untapped Classes: Worldthought Adjuncts, as well as providing epic support for the worldthought medic. It is written by Jeremy Smith and Shane O'Connor, with the original society mind design by Brian Dupuis, Greg Jacob, and Michel Fiallo-Perez. Already purchased all of the above products?
