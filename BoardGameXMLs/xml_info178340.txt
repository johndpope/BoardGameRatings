			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orc in the Well is a roleplaying poem, which is played in 15 minutes. It can be played with two or more players. In the game, the players collaboratively tell a story about an orc who is in a well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published as a bonus game at the back of The Society of Dreamers. The designer of the game has also posted the (very short) rules to his blog (Norwegian Style).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
