			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the most labor-intensive and disruptive sorts of spells in the game are for sure the various levels of Summon Monster. As soon as they are cast, things grind to a halt as the proper stats are looked up, the appropriate Celestial or Fiendish template applied with all its various changes ... And that is assuming just one of it was summoned! And if the caster has the Augment Summoning feat as well, introducing more changes to the summoned monster's stats, well ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooper's Corrected Summon Monster solves these problems! Written by ENWorld staff reviewer and 3.5 rules guru John Cooper, this critical new series of books presents thoroughly revised and corrected stats for the creatures summoned by these spells. Features of Cooper's Corrected Summon Monster IV-VI include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Corrected stats for all the monsters from the v.3.5 SRD that appear in the lists for the first three levels of Summon Monster spells that address often-overlooked elements like skill synergy bonuses and size modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;     Application of the Celestial and Fiendish templates as appropriate, to include the addition of Skills and Feats to formerly non-intelligent monsters that gain Int scores as a result of these templates.&lt;br/&gt;     Full alternate stats for monsters to which the Augment Summoning feat has been applied, to include all necessary updates to stats like attack and saving throw bonuses and hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book and the series of which it is part are designed to be an invaluable resource for OGL game masters, players, and publishers alike. It is fully bookmarked and designed to be printer-friendly and easy-to-use. Make your game's monster better and get them into play faster with Cooper's Corrected Summon Monster  IV-VI!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
