			<description>The game board consists of (up to) 30 tiles which show corridors on 5x5 squares. The players try to get all their five playing pieces onto a treasure square, starting in different locations. The die determines the movement, but not by simply telling a player how far to move. Instead, each number on the die represents a certain movement pattern that the player has to execute with one of his/her pieces (i.e. move one square diagonally on a roll of a 2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
