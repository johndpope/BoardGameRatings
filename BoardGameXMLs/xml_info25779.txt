							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Celsius: Centigrade Thermometer Game</name>
									
			<description>Mr. Celsius is a game of mathematics involving addition of positive and negative numbers on the metric thermometer. Easier or more difficult games may be played using the OPTIONAL PLAY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 to Adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to reach +100C or -100C (on the board). Players accomplish this by throwing the dice, calculating their score, and moving their marble marker when appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is normally played starting at 0C and using both the positive and negative scales. Variants include using only the positive, or only the negative scales, starting at 90 and racing to zero or starting at 0C and racing to -100C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include a handy conversion chart, and some formulae to aid in playing, as well as providing the&lt;br/&gt;means to receive Bonus Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is copyright Communication Concept, Inc. 1976&lt;br/&gt;Mishawaka, Indiana 46544&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
