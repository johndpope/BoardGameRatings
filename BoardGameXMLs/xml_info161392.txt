			<description>From inside the game: &amp;quot;At last the grand old Army game of shooting dice (craps) has been lifted into respectability- to be enjoyed often when friends meet.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Checker Dice consists of 126 cards (the game calls them &amp;quot;checkers&amp;quot;) numbered from 2 to 12. The cards have pictures of die rolls, but the frequency of the numbers does not quite match the statistical likelihood of rolling those numbers on 2D6. For example, there are equal numbers of sixes, sevens, and eights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, players turn over cards and hope to get certain numbers and avoid others, just as in Craps. Once a card is turned over, it remains face up for the remainder the player's turn, which slightly affects the statistical probability of finding another card with the same number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
