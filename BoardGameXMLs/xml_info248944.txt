							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dullahan: Playable Race</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is brand new take on an old fantasy favourite creature the Dullahan, or as it is more commonly known in literature, The Headless Horseman. These fascinating creatures are already widely present in the many worlds of dungeons and dragons and can make for an epic boss fight. However this article flips the evil horseman idea on its head and lets you take the reins (so to speak) of creating your very own playable Dullahan as a new optional race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
