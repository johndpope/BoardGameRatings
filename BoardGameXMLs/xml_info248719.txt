			<description>A storytelling party game that encourages creative writing, inside jokes and laughter. Each player starts with a blank game sheet. Everyone completes the first starter sentence and folds over the top section to hide their response. Once all players have finished the game sheets are passed to the left. Once all sections have been completed, players take it in turns to read their unique story. There are no winners or losers. It's a fun game anyone can play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
