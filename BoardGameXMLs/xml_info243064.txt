			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old-School inspired fantasy adventure!&lt;br/&gt;Using the vs. M Engine created by Phillip Reed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Dragons is an old school inspired roleplaying game where you take on the persona of a Hero of the realm. You will delve through dungeons, fight monsters, defeat villains, and rescue damsels (or princes&amp;hellip; they need rescuing just as much as the ladies!) all for glory and treasure just like you did when you were a kid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difference here is that you will do it around a table with a bunch of like-minded friends using paper and cards and the most powerful weapon at your disposal&amp;hellip; your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;vs. Dragons is a complete roleplaying game using the vs. M Engine. Even novice gamers will have no problem creating interesting characters, learning the rules, and starting a game. All you need is paper, pencils, a deck of playing cards, and a few friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
