			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Arm and a Leg is a role playing game focused on combat and making every hit count. Long gone are the days of damage sponges and gone are the days of many worthless enemies. In this game you every move you make will have consequences and one hit could mean the difference between failure and success. The setting is a medieval town in which a great arena has been built and warriors from all over have come to test their might in combat. Will you be one to succeed in the arena and reach fame and fortune, or will you perish as many others have?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
