			<description>ZEFIX!-Memo is similar to Memory in that the game is played with tiles, which come in pairs, and on a turn a player flips two tiles &amp;ndash; keeping them if they match and returning them face-down if they don't. What's different is that the tile pairs don't have identical images, but rather one tile features a choice Bavarian insult and the other depicts this insult visually. When all the tiles have been collected, the game ends, and the player who made the most matches wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
