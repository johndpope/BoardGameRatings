							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Hunter 13: The Tile Game</name>
									
			<description>Japanese analog game developer Group SNE makes their popular horror themed tabletop RPG &amp;quot;Ghost Hunter&amp;quot; into a fine co-op tile laying board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this newly introduced rendition of the game, as a team, players explore a mysterious mansion to complete several missions ( long forgotten artifacts, monsters hard to beat, mysteries about the mansion, etc etc... ) which bundled scenarios task them. Players can move their chosen heroes ( each one gets uniquely powered and equipped ) up to two tiles. If there's no tile to move in, you may drawã€€as many tiles as you need from a stock for placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tile by tile, the mansion would gradually reveal itself to players. On their explorations, your heroes sustain mental/physical damages ( your  characters might go mad or die if it's too much to bear ), fight off some deadly monsters, and discover powerful artifacts to help your team keep on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
