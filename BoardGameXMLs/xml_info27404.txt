			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'RAISE THE FIREMAN AS HIGH AS HE WILL GO&lt;br/&gt;IN THE BALANCING GAME CALLED ... &lt;br/&gt;LOOK OUT BELOW'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Raise the fireman on his ladders - higher and higher and higher!  Then, try to lower him down to earn points. But, if the ladders start swaying and the fireman falls ... you better LOOK OUT BELOW!'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box measures 13&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; x 4&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a molded plastic, bucket-carrying fireman about 8&amp;quot; high who stands on a platform which accepts plastic ladders that are inserted from below.  There are six colorful 8&amp;quot; long ladders, restricting the how far the fireman can be raised.  A large circular plastic fire net 12&amp;quot; in diameter is used to catch the falling fireman.  A colorful spinner directs gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored for raising and lowering the fireman (i.e. adding &amp;amp; then removing ladders) without causing him to fall (10 points per ladder). The fireman must be balanced by holding the bottom ladder ONLY.  Points are also scored if the player holding the net catches the falling fireman (50 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach 150 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
