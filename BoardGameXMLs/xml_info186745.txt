			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Starlight have 9 to 12 Attributes:  Strength, Health, Endurance, Perception, Agility, Dexterity, Will, Intelligence, and Communicate are always used.  Fortune, Might, and Talent are optional Attributes to support various game options.  Attribute Points are purchased from a pool.  Characters then purchase Skills from a separate pool.  Some Skills have limited usefulness outside of a specialty area.  For actions, characters roll a pool of D6, with the number of dice determined by the Difficulty.  Characters must &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; their Skill.  The rules also present Powers, which are gained by super-heroes.  However, most Powers are more akin to the effects of magic spells in fantasy systems than the types of super-powers found in typical super-hero games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
