			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one is for four to six people, willing to get under one another's skin in repeated meetings for play. The procedures alternate between (1) action/adventure play, written to be multiple-input, highly-imaginative, and nigh-automatic; and (2) personal play, through solitary and later shared writing. It's for diarist, slashfic, and my-character's-head enthusiasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earliest playtesting should be &amp;ldquo;for love,&amp;rdquo; meaning, to discover whether the vision of the game and basics of play are actually as fun as we hope. I think it&amp;rsquo;s really important in this case for everyone to have read the whole text. It might also be a good idea for the organizer of the social get-together for play not to be the same person who&amp;rsquo;s acting as primary rules-presenter. I especially ask that we merely play and save discussion for later, and also that this text be treated only as a playtesting draft and not subjected to writing critique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
