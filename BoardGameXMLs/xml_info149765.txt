							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Family Feud (1987)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family Feud is a one or two player game based on the popular U.S. television show (called Family Fortunes in the U.K.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stays pretty true to the format of the television show. A game consists of four face-off rounds, Fathers, Mothers, Sister's, &amp;amp; Brothers with the winning team going into the Fast Money Round. All questions are of the 'We asked 100 people ...... and the top answers are on the board.', the teams then take turns to guess the top answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there's only one player then the computer plays as the opposing family, however if the computer wins they do not take part in the Fast Money Round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
