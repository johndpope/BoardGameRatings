			<description>In the survival game turned on its undead head Dead By Night, you are part of the legions that now hunt and stalk the remnants of humanity that survive in this shattered and ruined city. Each day still weakens you, and some mortals even attempt to hunt you down as you race against rival beings who are seeking the power to rule the night itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand management and consistent player interaction make this a fun and casual, yet deceptively strategic risk vs reward-style game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
