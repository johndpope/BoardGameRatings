Avoid getting eaten by the snake heads, and beware of the little heads which hatch out of the eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-release publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;The C64 version has been produced by Jamie Howard and is a faithful conversion of the original game with improved presentation and additional features for the Commodore 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Steve Wallis: Design, programming, graphics, sound (/MSX)&lt;br/&gt;Jamie Howard: Game coding, graphics, music, sound (C64)&lt;br/&gt;Steve Day: loading screen (C64)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
