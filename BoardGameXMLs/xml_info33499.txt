			<description>Powerbroker is similar to the Classic game Monopoly, but with several changes. In addition to buying and auctioning businesses, players may also place them Receivership, or take out a Loan against one. Players can attempt to Swindle each other out of owed patronage [i.e. rent]. Businesses under Receivership are vulnerable to be stolen in a Corporate Raid by other players, and those with loans can be lost in a Hostile Takeover. In addition to the spaces running around the outside of the board, players can enter the High Roller route, where both business cost and patronage is determined by the dice. The game ends when only one player remains, or after an agreed upon time.&lt;br/&gt;This game was published under different names including Bend's  Powerbroker  and Burbank's Powerbroker. Each business is named for an actual local business, who's name and contact information are listed on the rules sheet. Additionally the box states that proceeds benefit the local business community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
