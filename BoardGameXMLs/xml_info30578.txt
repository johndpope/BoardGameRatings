			<description>From the introduction of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship is a game of miniature battles fought between giant capital ships and their smaller escorts versus their enemies in the cold depths of space. Combat is intense and deadly, capturing the feel of starship combat in anime and science-fiction films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Starship! Is not one of hard-science, instead portraying the sci-fi we have come to know and love as portrayed on television and the movies. We have given the laws of physics and space a cursory nod, but eventually led them behind for the more enticing subjects of fun and playability. If you have any interest in the future and battling it out amongst the stars, then we know you will find Starship! An immensely enjoyable game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship! is a truely three dimensional space combat game that allows you to create any insterstellar battle you desire. Whether you want to use ships and races from an existing genre, or create your own, Starship! gives you everything you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Thrue 3D combat in a format that eliminates complicated mathematics and keeps play fast and full of action!&lt;br/&gt;    Ten different starships and star bases classes, from Corvette to the Superdreadnought!&lt;br/&gt;    Dozens of weapons systems and construction options!&lt;br/&gt;    Fighters, Mecha, Shuttles and Assault Pods!&lt;br/&gt;    Great for anime style space combat, or for recreating the battles of your favorite sci-fi book, movie or TV series!&lt;br/&gt;    True playability, no ponderous turns spent writing orders and performing incremental movement.
