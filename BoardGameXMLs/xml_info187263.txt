							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Damascus</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damascus is a story roleplaying game about aging heroes &amp;mdash; heroes who&amp;rsquo;ve been given one final shot at glory. But as they take up blades and banners for king and country, a question arises: who is the glory for? As the reality behind the legends blurs into the fading light of an age gone by, will the characters find their own sense of morality changed in a world of dead heroes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damascus is inspired by such works as The Aeneid, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Don Quixote, Hamlet, The Idiot, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Stranger, and any story about heroes who fight causes passionately, even if those battles need not be fought.&lt;br/&gt;Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game in the Protocol series is zero-prep for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. The Protocol Series requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
