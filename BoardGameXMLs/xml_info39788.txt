							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beo: The Living Water Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;lt;from the website  of Living Water Charitable Trust&amp;gt; Beo is a Gaelic word meaning &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;living&amp;quot;. It is also a unique environmental, educational board game, an exciting and fun way to learn more about the environmental issues facing the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was created to help people understand the solutions to our planet's ecological problems, and encourage us to act for a sustainable future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to show that cooperation and human values are essential to the solution of both local and global issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;Players are required to act together to keep the planet in a healthy state by solving environmental and social challenges, provided on game cards. Games are based on a global or regional map, and cover the full spectrum of water, air, soil, animal, human, forest and emotional issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dials on the board reflect the state of health of the planet, and the aim of the game is to maintain all dials in the healthy zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperation Not Competiton&lt;br/&gt;The teams race against time, not against each other. Only creativity, fun and good communication can help players keep the earth healthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beo creates opportunities for a new way of learning and interacting with each other, achieving integrated environmental education alongside group and personal development as participants discuss, co-operate and communicate in order to solve challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beo represents a realistic, positive approach to environmental issues, challenging our existing view of issues such as smog, floods, famine, and extinctions by offering solutions to the challenges that face us today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beo comes complete with 2 boards, one of the world (below) and the other of Scotland. (Alternative second boards for specific regions worldwide is planned for the near future.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are comprehensive instructions and a full glossary of terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of 1000 cards, 800 of which are for the adult version and 200 for the children's version, plus 7 wooden playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
