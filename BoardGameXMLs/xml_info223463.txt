							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Insidious Cloaker</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you try on clothing items found in a dungeon, and refuse to examining them closely, you may find a cloaker's eyes staring back at you. Seemingly evolved &amp;ndash; or perhaps engineered &amp;ndash; to resemble ordinary capes, these creatures wait until adventuring parties get close before unleashing a powerful sonic attack that leaves them disoriented. Some slave-based societies permanently leave their charges among cloakers to keep prisoners tame and submissive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet cloakers can still find ways to surprise experienced parties. The Insidious Cloaker has enhanced its powers to forge a psychic connection with a single target, guiding host as though it were its own body. Only a close examination of the victim's cloak can reveal the eyes which give its presence away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many bounties have been placed on rogue spellcasters over the years, only for their hunters to discover an Insidious Cloaker was the culprit &amp;ndash; usually after it had switched hosts and escaped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
