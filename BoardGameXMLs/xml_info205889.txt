			<description>Animals Frightening Night! Tortoise and Skunk is a mini-expansion for Animals Frightening Night! that replaces the geese tiles with a tortoise and a skunk. What do they do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Skunk &amp;mdash; In the Hiding Phase, after every player decides where to hide, the skunk may take their character token and activate their special ability. After doing so, whoever is hiding in the same place as the skunk must change their hiding place to another until the end of Morning Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Tortoise &amp;mdash; In Morning Phase, before any player activates their character's special ability, they may take their character token and activate their special ability. By doing so, they hide in their shell and cannot be eaten by the wolf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
