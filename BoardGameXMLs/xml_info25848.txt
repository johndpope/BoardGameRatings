			<description>Madelinette is a small, simple game of blockade, probably invented by J &amp;amp;  J Loader for their book, Making Board, Peg and Dice Games. There seems to be no reference to this game before the publishing of this book.  Two players strive on a board of seven points, each with three pieces, to block in their opponent's pieces so that the opponent cannot move.  Information on this game is sparse, as it is overshadowed by the similar-looking three men's morris, for which it is often mistaken.  A game board in the Hull and East Riding Museum, in Yorkshire, England, is often mistaken for this game in photographs but would rather seem to be an incomplete three men's morris board, this has been confirmed by the curator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
