			<description>A new town has recently been developed near your neighborhood, full of office towers, shopping malls and housing estates. Can you outbid the other tycoons and be the one to cash in on this prospering town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sold! is an extremely mean auction game where players vie for control over the new properties in town. Over a series of 25 rounds, players bid for coloured cubes which are used to exert influences over the sales of individual properties. Will you channel your financial might on the office towers? Or will you bet on monopolizing the retail scene? Only the most cunning and opportunistic businessman will stand a chance to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be wary though, there plenty of opportunities for your competitors to foil your most well laid plans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
