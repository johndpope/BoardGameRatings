			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past 9 years during the White Pine festival the small town of Haren&amp;rsquo;s Watch has been plagued by a wicked fey spirit known only as Mr. Grin. The creature and its fiendish little minions torment the town over the course of three nights, culminating in the kidnap and transmutation of one of the village children into a lifeless statue made entirely of coal. The party stumble upon the town while seeking shelter from a blizzard and find themselves caught up in events&lt;br/&gt;that will shape the future of Haren's Watch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ring Out, Wild Bells is a Christmas themed adventure for the 5th Edition of the World's Greatest Role-Playing Game!
