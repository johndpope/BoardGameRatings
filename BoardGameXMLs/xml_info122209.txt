			<description>Each player begins with their plane in the Boston airport.  The winner is the first plane to reach LA.  It is simple spin and move game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game doesn't seem to have been packaged in a box. The planes &amp;quot;snug&amp;quot; into tabs on the board, and the spinner is part of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules from the game board:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     At the begging of the race all planes are lined up at Boston airport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player selects the color plane or planes he wishes to race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player in turn spins and advances a plane one city according&lt;br/&gt;     to the color on which the spinner stops. Planes must move on their&lt;br/&gt;     own colored route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The first plane to reach Los Angeles Airport is the winner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
