							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tigele</name>
									
			<description>Tigele is the first volume of a 4 volume game/game system. Tigele like the other Volumes is a standalone game. Meaning as it comes out of the box,  it is a working game. Tigele may be added to other volumes as an expansion. Or the other volumes may be added to it, in part or whole, as expansions. Or this volume may be mixed with parts of the other volumes to form whole new games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tigele is a battle strategy game made up of 100 tiles comprised of 72 pictographs forming just several tile types. the game was played by a small community of individuals in the North west corner of Montana for almost 20 years. Slowly evolving into this publish version. (Long cold winters and beer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oddities of the game:&lt;br/&gt;1) We call the game a board game, even though it is a tile game; because, the tiles in part make up the playing area, a 10 X 10 layout of tile we call a field. The field is comprised of two opponents laid out in 10 X 5 (1/2 the field we call the courts). That area once established remains a constant grid for play throughout the game. Thus the tiles making a randomized board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) The tiles used above are the playing board and the playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) The game uses the relationships of one tiles to another as a mechanic to manipulate luck, and unforeseen or uncontrolled  events. This also encourages ever developing tactics and interpersonal strategies (more so when later volumes are played in concert with one another).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) The box instructions gives two player mode instruction. but the game plays up to 4 players in the Volume One level. The 3 and 4 player modes of play are suggested on our web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) The game was designed for two primary reasons. To help keep the designer brother out of trouble and as a model of one basic form of social political behavior...Don't ask me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Hard rules augmented with a few soft rules. the soft rules force personal interaction and create a fog of war atmosphere...again don't ask me...it just works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7) Players on your side of play may or may not really be playing on your side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8) The game uses its art as a fog of war mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9) The game has a slight learning curve; but the game is basic in  play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
