			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock Your Mythic Potential!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Legolas to Robin Hood, the fantasy genre is full of incredibly talented archers and the amazing stunts that they perform with their bows and arrows. If you felt that Mythic Adventures didn&amp;rsquo;t quite satiate your need for mythic levels of marksmanship, then this is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Mastery: Mythic Archery provides mythic characters with new options to improve their archery skills in three different ways. Included are nine new universal path abilities for mythic characters: six that are available to characters of any mythic tier, and three that are for characters of 3rd tier or above. The book also provides mythic upgrades for 7 archery-related feats, including Disrupting Shot, Focused Shot, and Precise Shot. Finally, the book introduces two new abilities for legendary items, a new type of magic item introduced in Mythic Adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re blackening the sky with arrows all by yourself, firing arrows which can calm or enrage the winds, delivering terrifyingly-close warning shots, or simply pinning your foes to nearby objects with your arrows, Mythic Mastery: Mythic Archery is full of ways to take your ranged combat skills to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
