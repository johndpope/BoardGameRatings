			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Myth: TFL is a unit-level RTS game that takes place in a fantasy medieval setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control soldiers, archers, molotov-throwing dwarves, and other fighters to defeat the undead armies of the Fallen Lords.  There are several types of friendly and enemy units, each with its own abilities, and the mission objectives vary from defending an area, to reaching a location on the map, to assassinating a key enemy figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Myth:TFL has no base construction or unit production elements.  Save scripted reinforcements, the forces you start with at the beginning of a level will have to last you to the end.  Additionally, the game was an early example of a fully 3-D environment, and terrain and weather effects play a key role in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a well-written single-player campaign, Myth featured multiplayer battles using Bungie's Bungie.net hosting service at no extra charge.  A variety of multiplayer maps and game modes contributed to Myth's success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
