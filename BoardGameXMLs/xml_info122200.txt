			<description>Maya the Bee is a jump'n'run game based on the popular TV series. The great visuals and the fun gameplay make this game a excellent choice. The adjustable difficulty settings make the quest an enjoyable experience for everyone.    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;Willie, Maya's best friend is missing. Help Maya to find her buddy through 16 vivid game areas in four worlds. Explore the bee-hive without being caught by the guard-bees. Walk the poppy fields, but beware of ants and hornets. Once you made it, you will have to travel across the pond, where you will encounter dragon flies and jumping and spitting fishes. The final location is the forest where mosquitos and termites are trying to stop you.        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;All of Maya's friends will help you throughout your journey. Cassandra the teacher, Flip the grasshopper, Alexander the mouse and Puck the house fly. Can you help Maya to find and rescue her friend Willie?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
