							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Abjurer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever think that tacking on specialist wizards to the wizard core class was kinda lame? Ever think that the specialists needed to be written up as their own distinct classes? Yeah, us too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Abjurer is the third offering in The Core Specialist Wizard series. Each product of the series will present a different specialist as its own core, 20-level class, with distinctive abilities. Other related materials, including feats, two prestige classes tied to the core specialist class, and a small offering of related magic items, are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within The Abjurer you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The abjurer core class. These specialists wizards excel at defense and protection.&lt;br/&gt;     The arcane guardian prestige class. Able to get the most defense out of abjuration spell with a lot less effort.&lt;br/&gt;     The planar exciser prestige class. A mix of the cleric and abjurer classes, they hunt down extraplanar creatures to banish or slay.&lt;br/&gt;     10 new feats with a focus on the abjurer.&lt;br/&gt;     3 new magic items, the shield of the planes, bastioned spellbook, and ointment of defense, and a new special ability for armor and shields, attack reflecting, and one for magic weapons, dismissal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
