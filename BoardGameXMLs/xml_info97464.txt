							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Master&#039;s Token Set: Scroll Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scrolls Expansion set contains more of the clever blank scroll tokens that allow you, with the use of a wet-erase marker, to track unique conditions and ongoing damage in your combats. There are 9 Ongoing Damage scrolls and 9 Status scrolls, each shaped so that they can rest against the base of miniatures, or they may be placed on corresponding character sheets and monster cards. The set also contains 2 different colored sets of Marked tokens for those combatants that have focused on their targets. Rounding out the set are 5 more Bloodied tokens and the new Burst Origin token for a total of 30 tokens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
