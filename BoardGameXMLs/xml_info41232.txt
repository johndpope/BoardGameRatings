			<description>This word card game has the uncommon feature that each card has two letters on it -- either one can be used to make a word.  (They are in opposite corners, but in each corner you see one letter, its value, and the letter in the opposite corner.)  Of the 105 cards, 8 of them have a are wild cards in one corner, and four are wild on both ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 8 cards, and the top card of the draw pile is used to start the discard pile.  In a turn, a player makes a word starting with either letter of the top discard, and using cards from his hand for the rest.  The letters' values -- ranging from 2 to 20 -- are added for the word's score, which is added to the player's total.  The word is then discarded, the player fills out their hand back to 8 from the draw pile, and the next player takes a turn, using the new top discard to start a word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pass if they cannot make a word from their hand.  The game ends when every player passes in turn, typically after the draw pile is exhausted.  The lower value of each card in hand is subtracted from the players' scores, and the highest total wins.  Optional rules allow bonus points for long words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
