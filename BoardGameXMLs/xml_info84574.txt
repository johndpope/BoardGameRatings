							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villains - The Brotherhood of Mahlik</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mahlik was a typical orphan at the Brotherhood of Penitent Grace, a monastic order who made their home in a monastery embedded in the foothills of the northern mountains. He was found crying for food in an alley in the nearby town, brought in from the rain, cleaned up, and given a name. The Brothers named him Mahlik, which they told him meant &amp;quot;Fortunate One.&amp;quot; They said they chose this name because he was found so young, before much in the way of tragedy could find him while he was alone and defenseless. He learned quickly the lessons they taught him; reading, figuring, critical thinking, and how to hold his tears when he was being whipped. They didn't try hard to teach him the latter - experience did that, as tears seemed to drive the whipkeepers into greater efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monks did not realize that another, more evil presence had taken notice of Mahlik. Soon they would learn to regret their sadistic teachings, and suffer cruelly beneath the yoke of a new master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brotherhood of Mahlik offers an in-depth look at the villainous npc 'Brother', as well as the evil presence that possesses him. In addtion detailed information is provided for the comrades and confidantes of Brother, as well as styles of speech and a sample map of the monastery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
