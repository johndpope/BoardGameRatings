			<description>This card game was included in two numbers of the Italian weekly comic-book &amp;quot;Topolino&amp;quot;, dedicated to Italian-made Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck's adventures.&lt;br/&gt;Later, Dal Negro reprinted the game adding a box for normal distribution on the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is presented as &amp;quot;collectible&amp;quot;, but it's composed only of two base decks; however, you can mix the decks following the composition rules to create new decks for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;The base game is for two players, but there's some advanced rules to play it up to six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game simulates a single day for Donald Duck. Each player in his turn has to play up to two cards in front of him or in front of the opponent in order to create problems that must be resolved in five different &amp;quot;areas&amp;quot; (house, Uncle Scrooge's money bin, 313 car, love, daily life).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are divided into:&lt;br/&gt;- event cards: played by the player in front of himself, used to increase the players score in the related area;&lt;br/&gt;- problem cards: played in front of the opponent, in order to create  a problem for that opponent in the related area;&lt;br/&gt;- solution cards: played in front of the player, used to resolve problems in the related area;&lt;br/&gt;- jella (unlucky) cards (broken mirror): played in front of the opponent, used to create a problem in a chosen area;&lt;br/&gt;- jolly cards (Huey, Dewey and Louie): played in front of the player, used to resolve a problem in a chosen area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has an event card in the top of each area, or when a player's deck is empty. Each player adds the score of the card on the top of each area; the one who has the greatest score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
