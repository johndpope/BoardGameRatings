			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All the tables you need to run combat for Basic and Expert adventures are included on this durable screen. &amp;quot;The Treasure of the Hideous One,&amp;quot; an Expert mini-adventure for character levels 4-7 is also included&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You're guiding your party through a dense swamp. Suddenly, the jaws of three large crocodiles snap menacingly. The fighter draws his sword, and the magic-user prepares to cast a spell. The crocodiles creep slowly closer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time out. You have to find the tables in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolving combat is just a dice roll away if you have the D&amp;amp;D Combat Shield. All the tables you need are included on this handy 3-panel screen: monster hit rolls, saving throws, armor class, variable weapon damage, and several others. Experience tables for each character class are also given. The Combat Shield also comes with an Expert Game mini-adventure: &amp;quot;The Treasure of the Hideous One&amp;quot;. The adventure features a ready-to-use treasure &amp;quot;map&amp;quot; that you may introduce into your campaign when your players find clues to a lost treasure. Several interesting &amp;quot;encounters&amp;quot; are thrown in, too, so you'll have plenty of chances to use the Combat Shield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three crocodiles? No problem!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item consists of a tri-fold DM screen for Basic and Expert games, and a separate 8-page adventure book inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
