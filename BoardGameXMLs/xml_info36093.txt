							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Devastators 3000</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;The high tech version of Devastators 2500. The larger Interstellar warships go by many categorical names: &lt;br/&gt;Dreadnaughts, Battlers, Star Cruisers, and of course, Devastators. Each player controls a Devastator, or ship, represented by his deck. Play pits Devastator vs Devastator. Run out your opponent&amp;rsquo;s deck to destroy his ship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck with over 100 cards. The object of the game is to destroy the opposing Devastator. The ships can move between short, medium, and long range. Attack cards may be played at the appropriate range. Devastators may also launch Fighter Squads or Nanotech Swarms which continue to fight the opposing ship until they are destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you inflict damage on an opposing ship, your opponent must discard a number of cards equal to the damage inflicted. When all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s cards are in his Destroyed discard pile, you have eliminated him from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
