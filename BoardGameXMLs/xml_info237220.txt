			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Man&amp;rsquo;s Hand is a tale of desperate gamblers and corrupt lawmen, of criminal subtlety and supernatural mystery. Characters begin at 1st level, and by the end of the campaign they should by 9th or 10th level. The ideal party size is four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, you can adjust the adventure&amp;rsquo;s difficulty by reducing or increasing the number of enemies present in a given encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Man&amp;rsquo;s Hand is set in the American Frontier circa 1872. The region, known as as Western Valley, is a fictional territory not intended to be a specific location. As such, there is no conflict with birthplace or recent places of living for the characters, Everyone arrives in Western Valley just the same, and are no culture is more foreign than any other. A combination of roads, railroads, and even a few rivers connect the various settlements of the valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode 3: Red Gulch or Bust.  By the time the party has returned from Waynoka Village to Snake&amp;rsquo;s bend, they should have only a few days until the Great Poker Championship in Red Gulch. Fortunately Red Gulch is less than a day away - thanks to the Western Valley Railroad that runs between the two cities.  The railroad trip to Red Gulch is frequented by civilians and dignitaries alike. Unfortunately this also draws the attention of thieves and bandits. Though short, the trek north will not be without danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Supplements. You can play this adventure with just the DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS basic rules and the Frontier campaign setting, which contains all the enemies and items not described in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
