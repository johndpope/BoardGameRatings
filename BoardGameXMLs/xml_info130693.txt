			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steampunk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steampunk is all about where technology was going in the 19th century and how it would change society. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that people had awesome looking clothing and took the time to put artistic flourish in their technology. In the nineteenth century there seemed to be more possible. Every inch of the globe was not documented by cameras on satellites. Electricity was still a primal force barely tamed that could work miracles. Steampunkfitters is about putting the pipes together. Connecting the people with the tech with the power of steam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steampunk is different things to different people. There is no one level of technology. There is no defined world that  tells us what proper steampunk is or how to identify when it has been done right or wrong. Because of that, Steampunkfitters doesn&amp;rsquo;t set down a single story for the players to follow but provides the tools to start a new world with each new group of characters.&lt;br/&gt;    We do know that steampunk involves Victorian design ascetics and combining technology that seemed like it would be right around the corner. Things like airships, clockwork men and perhaps even deathrays were thought to be the next step in technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why The Name Steampunkfitters?&lt;br/&gt;    A tradesman that works with steam pipes is called a steamfitter. In this game the players are putting together a story about the steam age with an emphasis on technology breaking through the culture of the day, thus the &amp;ldquo;punk&amp;rdquo;. Put it all together and you have Steampunkfitters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
