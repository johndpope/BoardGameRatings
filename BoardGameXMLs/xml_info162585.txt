			<description>Welcome to the exiting Formula &amp;micro; (micro) race, where the fastest cars and the best drivers compete for the world championship. In this game each player controls one racing car and tries to win the race against all the other players. But not only skilful driving will determine the winner, without a clever planning a player will not win this race. Should you upgrade the engine or the chassis of your car? And how much fuel will you fill in the tank before the race begins?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrapped in a tiny package Formula &amp;micro; offers many meaningful decisions, a fully customizable racing experience (from the car setup to the modular racing tracks) and plays usually in 10-30 minutes (depending on the number of players, the length of the track and the number of laps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cool Factors:&lt;br/&gt;- Modular racing tracks;&lt;br/&gt;- Fits in your pocket;&lt;br/&gt;- Customizable cars;&lt;br/&gt;- the family rules can be played with children aged 8 and up (or even younger, when your kids are already gamers) while the full version will challenge the gamer in you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
