			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special adventure at the very origins of humanity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W&amp;uuml;rm is a system-lite RPG set in the last period of the Ice Age 35,000 years ago. This is the first standalone adventure for your W&amp;uuml;rm game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are on a mission to source good quality flint when they discover a strange skull with huge canine teeth. From that moment on they are haunted by the Spirit of a long-dead feline, which gives them incredible powers. However, when they return to their camp, the PCs realize that they are all bringing bad luck to their families. Soon the whole clan &amp;ndash; or what&amp;rsquo;s left of it &amp;ndash; is begging them to go into exile and find a solution. What is this curse? What if the only people who could help them are the mysterious Bear-men that once lived in this area, before they were driven out long ago?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
