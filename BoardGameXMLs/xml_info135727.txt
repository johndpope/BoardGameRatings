			<description>Card game in 8 rounds with 7 trick-taking rounds and one competitive patience round. A standard deck playing card game is used but with a number of players different from 4, one or more cards are removed so the total numbers of cards is a multiple of numbers of players. The cards to be removed and the order of these are:&lt;br/&gt;2 of diamonds, 2 of hears, 2 of spades and 2 of clubs. In the first 7 trick-taking rounds Ace count as highest card and as lowest card in the 8th round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards are dealt out so each player and the player to the left for the dealer lead the round. The dealer changes clockwise for each round.&lt;br/&gt;Round 1 to 7 are played as normal trick taking without trump colour and each player must follow suit if possible. If a player has no cards in the suit led, a card of any other suit may be discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 1: Avoid tricks : -10 pts for each taken trick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 2: Avoid King of Diamonds : -50 pts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 3: Avoid Queens       : -25 pts for each Queen taken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 4: Avoid Hearts       : -10 pts for each Hearts taken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 5: Avoid Jacks           : -25 pts for each Jacks taken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 6 Variant: Avoid first, fifth and the last trick: -25 pts for each of first, fifth and last trick taken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 7: Most trick    : +10 for each trick taken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round 8: Competitive Patience: First card to be played must be a 7. If the leading player does not holds a 7 he must pass and&lt;br/&gt;the turn goes to the next player who also must pass if he does not hold a 7 etc.&lt;br/&gt;A player is not forced to play a seven hold in his hand after the first seven has been played.&lt;br/&gt;After the first 7 is played each player in turns lay down cards in incrementing or decrementing order around the 7 on the table (8 to king on the top and 6 to ace below the seven card). If a player is unable    to lay down a card he may pass.    For each pass a    player receive -10 pts.    When a player lay down his last    card the game is over and the remaining    players    receive    -5 pts for each    card they are holding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with    the most points    has won    the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
