			<description>A Board Game powered by a Decktet deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each have 6 tokens (or fewer with larger numbers of players) that match up to the suit of their choice and can move just one in each turn but using as many cards from their hand of 4 as they have in one suit. If it happens to match your suit you can take a new card instantly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race to the head of the snake, crown their token and then can gobble the other player's pieces on the way back to the tail. Players score at the end of the game according to the final positions of each of the pieces that they still have on the board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
