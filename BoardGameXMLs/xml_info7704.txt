			<description>This is a rather old Dutch party game. (No publication date is mentioned, but the language used is somewhat archaic).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move forward on a board. Every time they land on a space, they have to answer a question or perform a task. If they answer incorrectly, or fail to perform the task, they are moved back to their original space. The first player to reach the target space is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
