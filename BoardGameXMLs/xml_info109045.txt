			<description>Players represent taxi drivers and have to drive passengers through the city, earning money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player starts with a passenger card, which gives him an address where to pick up a passenger, and a destination, where that passenger wants to go. He then rolls the dice and moves his taxi on the mapboard to the given locations. On grey colored spaces, he has to discard one of his four petrol cans; if he discards the last, it's time to visit the petrol station for refuelling. On his moves, a player has to obey all traffic regulations like road signs, speed limits, pedestrian crossings, and so on. If he violates a rule, any other player may point that out and the offender has to pay him a fine of 20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After bringing a passenger to his destination, the player gets payed and draws another passenger card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The taxi driver who first collects the sum of 400 fares wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
