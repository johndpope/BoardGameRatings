			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your exploits as a Trancer Hunter have gotten the attention of the Council and they call you in to send you on a special mission. They tell you that David Singer, the notorious Trancer Boss has gone down the line to 1995 in order to build a Trancer army and take out the Council&amp;rsquo;s ancestors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t have much information on where he is, except that it is likely somewhere in L.A. and he has taken over a mostly unknown ancestor named Jesse Singer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You agree to take the job and they tell you that your ancestor, Daryl, was an almost identical match to you. In fact, he is so much like you that you will not have to roll any different stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After they send you down the line, they send you some boxes with the supplies that you will need: your weapons, two doses of time serum&amp;mdash;one to send Singer back up the line and one for yourself&amp;mdash;and a Ctrl-Z. The Ctrl-Z has one charge and will allow you to reroll any check or go back any one entry in the adventure and make a different choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
