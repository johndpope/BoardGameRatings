			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PixelJunk Shooter allows one or two players to jump in control of their own subterranean vehicle in the hopes of rescuing dozens of scientists who have become trapped underground.  The game is played out as a 2-D side-scroller in which the player uses his or her missiles to affect changes in the terrain that surround them to solve puzzles and ultimately reach each scientist.  Strategy must be used to solve each of the puzzles you'll come across in the various stages.  Ice, lava, and a black magnetic liquid can be released, moved, and otherwise manipulated to mix with each other for interesting results oftentimes creating a path to a previously unreachable area.  If too many of the scientist survivors are killed while you're trying to make your way to them, players are forced to retry the stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PixelJunk Shooter was released in 2009 on the Playstation Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
