			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are freely distributed as three downloadable PDF files of 20, 20, and 26 pages.  Characters have ten Statistics, including: Strength, Dexterity, Physique, Mental Agility, Intuition, Charisma, Resolve, Height, Weight, and Appearance.  Statistics have a numeric value ranging from 21-90.  The numeric value can be either randomly generated or purchased with a point allocation system.  Characters have Skill Bases which is a rating for a type of Skill.  The Skill Bases available to a character depend on culture and professional background.  Character development is handled through Statistic and Skill enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills are resolved using d100 and adding any bonuses.  However, the rules include several types of other rolls for specific situations or tasks and many of these vary in detail.  Combat is complex and involves numerous modifiers and special situations and maneuvers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
