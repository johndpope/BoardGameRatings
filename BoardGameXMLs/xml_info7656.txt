							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle Game</name>
									
			<description>The Battle Game was published by Tri-ang (a.k.a. Triang) at some time during the 1960s. Two players maneuver their soldiers to take over each other's territory. Pegs hold the soldiers in place on the massive (20&amp;quot; x 20&amp;quot; X ~8&amp;quot;) 3-D plastic game board. Die rolls and line of sight determine combat results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One unique, if somewhat destructive, aspect to this game is the provision made for land mines. Each player secretly positions two spring-driven &amp;quot;mines&amp;quot; under the board. When they deem the moment is right, they push a button on the &amp;quot;mine&amp;quot;, releasing the spring. This pushes a round disk up that, in theory, pushes the pegs up and scatters the affected soldiers. In practice, it tends to break the pegs on the soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
