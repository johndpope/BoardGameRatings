			<description>This is as simple as simple gets: perform your bizarre task, or take a drink. There are no neccesary to drink in that game actually. You should do tasks or refuse it. Each task gives you points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game progresses, some tasks become easier: &amp;laquo;send a text message to a phone number dictated to you by your friends&amp;raquo;; while others become more difficult: &amp;laquo;turn on your axis 10 times in 15 seconds&amp;raquo;. Beware of the polar bear &amp;mdash; if you draw this card, everyone will have to hide under the table. And after half an hour of this game, some players just might have to spend the night down there. A perfect game for a group of fun-loving friends on a cold winter evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when you see fifth bear card (from the main deck).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player with maximum score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
