							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poleis: Ancient Cities</name>
									
			<description>The poleis were the city-states of ancient Greece. Each state was like a political entity ruled by their own citizens. Your goal is to form the greatest Greek alliance, build wonders and be favored by deities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;POLIS CARDS, the backbone of the game, which provide resources, some abilities, Victory Points, trade routes, deity worshiping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WONDERS CARDS, which give Victory Points. These require certain resources and once build they belong to that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEITIES CARDS, give Victory Points. These require faith, they belong to the player that worships a certain deity the most - during turns these can switch among players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to win the most victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP:&lt;br/&gt;The deities and wonders cards are placed face up in the middle of the table. The starting player will get two polis cards, the rest will form the draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a round, a player, must draw until he has three cards in his hand. Then must choose one card and place it in front of him - once doing that he will acquire faith and resources symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He then checks if he meets any deity or wonder requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends with the cards passed to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;END OF GAME:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players have five polis cards in front of them, in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players add the Victory Points from Wonder Cards, Deities Cards, the longest trade route and any extra victory points from the polis cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
