			<description>This manual provides all the background and other information any Minbari ground commander needs! The book focuses on two of the most famous Minbari clans, the Windswords, who prefer armor, and Star Riders, who are heavy on the infantry. Includes army lists for both clans, as well as a variety of new vehicles including the new Heavy Assault Tank - so big it's a platoon unto itself! New weapons such as the molecular pulse cannon and neutron laser are also provided. New units include the Falsin Self-Propelled Artillery, Fire Sprite Scout Transport, Shyriech Main Battle Tank, Talishan Heavy Infantry Transport, and Tal'Horcon Air Defense Artillery. If you want to find out what makes the advanced Minbari armies to be feared throughout known space, check out this book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
