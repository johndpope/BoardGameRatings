			<description>Arena Football '95 is a canceled Atari Jaguar video game developed by V-Real Interactive. It was scheduled to be released sometime in 1995 but the project was halted as support for the Atari Jaguar console waned. The game would have been the first officially licensed indoor football game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was later cleared for release after Hasbro dropped licensing fees to the Atari Jaguar, and was available for sale by B&amp;amp;C ComputerVisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arena Football '95&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
