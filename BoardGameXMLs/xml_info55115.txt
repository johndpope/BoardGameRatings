							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Prophecy of Shardar</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Based on the Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure To Find A King by Bob Blake, The Prophecy of Shardar is and adventure module for characters level 4-7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Two centuries ago, the last emperor of the land was deposed in favor of a high council. Now, however, things are going badly, and a restless populace longs for the days of the ancient rule. The high council is floundering -- and the political situation is turning ugly.&lt;br/&gt;It was then that an obscure monastic order discovered a long-forgotten prophecy. When the land needs him most, a long-gone emperor will rise to restore order. You have been chosen to prove that this is the time of the prophecy, and to take the first steps toward returning the lost ruler to his throne. This adventure contains the first four rounds of the HackMaster Tournament of Champions that was originally run at the Origins 2004 convention, this adventure can be played alone or as a prequel to The Curse of Pen Griffen.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
