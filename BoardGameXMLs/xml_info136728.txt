			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenary, executioner, murderer ... there isn't an infamous title that Wolfgang hasn't taken to heart. His great physical prowess isn't the only reason that he has become part Gaul's personal forces. The blood of the Naga runs through his veins, making him able to poison his enemies with just a touch of his skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Azur Alliance Warrior &amp;mdash; Lv. 40&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poison Ramalen: Any unit that comes into contact with Wolfgang for the first time suffers Blind Lv2. Effect 14.&lt;br/&gt; Son of the Naga: Enemy units within Wolfgang's Control Zone suffer double damage due to the Poison state.&lt;br/&gt; Poisoned Weapons: If any attack made by Wolfgang causes damage, the target suffers Poison Lv 2. Effect 14.&lt;br/&gt; ooo &amp;mdash; Cupra (Ki, Attack)&lt;br/&gt; +4 Attack. If this attack causes damage, the effect of the Poison state is 16 instead of 14.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
