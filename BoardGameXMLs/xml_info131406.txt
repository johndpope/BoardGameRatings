							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">David Wolf: Secret Agent</name>
									
			<description>Plot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is David Wolf, a secret agent who must stop a criminal organization called Viper from using a stealth fighter to deliver a nuclear bomb to Washington, D.C. Several action scenes allow the player to attempt to perform various feats for David Wolf, such as flying a hang glider while shooting down enemies, racing down a highway while dueling with helicopters, or landing on an enemy parachutist or landing on top of a moving truck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cinematic game features digitized 3-D graphics. Players cannot select or influence the actors' dialogue, nor select actions for the hero to try to complete. There are only six areas within the game where the player actually can use the keyboard or joystick. The player uses a VCR interface to set options such as the difficulty of the action sequences, the text speed for the actors, and the detail of images on screen. Players can also select an arcade scene from the interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;David Wolf: Secret Agent&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
