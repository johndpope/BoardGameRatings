			<description>NCAA College Football 2K3 is the second American College Football game by Visual Concepts (the first being NCAA College Football 2K2: Road to the Rose Bowl for the Dreamcast).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cover athlete is former Nebraska Cornhuskers quarterback Eric Crouch. It  The game also has ESPN style game play, meaning at halftime it gives you a report on your game and others around the league. It includes an editable roster, but you cannot name the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are basic game modes such as the dynasty or jump in to a quick play. Dynasty is where you lead your team over the course of a year to the National Championship. Legacy mode is when you completely take over a team, control its recruiting classes, and remain a &amp;quot;Division 1&amp;quot; powerhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NCAA College Football 2K3&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
