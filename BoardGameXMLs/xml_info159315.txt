			<description>&lt;br/&gt;■Idea of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play Hunter cards (Grim Reaper, Angel, and Devil cards) to fight over Soul cards.&lt;br/&gt;Players fight over Soul cards on the table by playing Hunter cards from their hand. The player who has collected Soul cards of all 3 types, 3 Soul cards of the same type, or 5 Soul cards of any type wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;■How to play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a Hunter card from your hand face down on the Angel or Devil team side.&lt;br/&gt;After all players pass their turns or the maximum number of Hunter cards playable (as shown on the Soul card) are played, flip all played Hunter cards face up. &lt;br/&gt;Add the strength of the cards on each team side (Angel and Devil) to calculate the total strength of each team.&lt;br/&gt;The player who played the Hunter card with the lowest number in the team with higher strength shall receive the Soul card of that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;■Point&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you need to play a high-number card(s) to form a majority and a low-number card(s) to outdo other players in the majority.&lt;br/&gt;The point of this game lies on how you handle this dilemma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
