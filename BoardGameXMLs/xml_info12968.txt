			<description>This game represents an abstract confrontation between six powers taking place over the whole world. Players build units and leaders, and using an area movement system send them into battle by invading other countries. The game also uses ships for sea combat. They can also be used to control trade routes. The game is similar in scope to Risk, but is a lot more strategic due to the added complexities of leaders. The Advanced game also includes economic rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
