			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world-building is a useful skill, you don&amp;rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&amp;rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: Seven magic properties designed specifically for firearm weapons (from early firearms &amp;ndash; such as those highwaymen, musketeers, and pirates use &amp;ndash; to more advanced weapons appropriate in western or pulp-era campaigns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The properties included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Boomstick: You can deafen your foes.&lt;br/&gt;    Burrowing: Your bullets can deal long-term damage.&lt;br/&gt;    Dependable: Your firearm misfires less often and is more reliable than standard firearms.&lt;br/&gt;    Dimensional Capacity: Your firearm holds triple the weapon's normal capacity.&lt;br/&gt;    Entangling: Your firearm can entrap your foes.&lt;br/&gt;    Hot Lead: Attacks with your firearm deal fire damage.&lt;br/&gt;    Ricochet: Attacks with your firearm can hit more than one target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
