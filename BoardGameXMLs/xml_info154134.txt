							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Herbert West vs. the Zombies</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before there was George Romero, there was H.P. Lovecraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly 90 years ago, celebrated writer of the weird and terrifying Lovecraft unleashed his &amp;quot;Herbert West, Re-Animator&amp;quot; series of short stories upon the an unsuspecting world. In those tales, Lovecraft originated the now-standard flesh-rending zombie. This NUELOW Games scenario for ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters was inspired by Lovecraft's stories, and is a celebration of his blood-spattered gift to the horror genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Herbert West vs. the Zombies, West is once again restoring life to the dead with his Re-Agent... and once again, things go terribly wrong and he finds himself faced with a hoard of zombies bent on tearing him limb from limb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended for as many as four players, this supplement features statistics for Lovecraft's Herbert West and three different kinds of zombies, as well as new rules material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME TO THE BLOODIEST ROLF! SUPPLEMENT YET!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
