			<description>In the center of the universe there is a planet called Kionpa. It is here that the incarnated forces of Light and Darkness do eternal battle for the fate of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forces of the Light are represented by an army of Good folk, such as elves, dwarves, and the heroes of humanity, while the Dark brings an army of Evil beings such as goblins, wraiths, and demons. (If possible, in future expansions for the game there will be different armies for the Light and the Dark.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Kionpa is a strategic two player game that looks a bit like Chess at first glance, with each player having their army lined up on opposite sides of a gridded board. Each player will pick and move one of their pieces per turn, and each piece can only move within certain ranges and directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece also has unique abilities that are played through the use of cards and powered by energy they collect from certain squares in the middle of the board. These abilities range from unique ways to kill other pieces to abilities that can alter the landscape of the board, and some of them can be played defensively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
