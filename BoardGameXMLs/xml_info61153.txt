							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eco-Destiny</name>
									
			<description>An educational boardgame on the future of Earth's environment and the destiny of life in the next 100 years (from the box cover).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to have the most points but moving through a spiral of eco-impacts after rolling a dice.  These eco-impacts have either positive or negative impacts on the environment and the events all relate to one of ten environmental impact areas (land, population, climate, politics, energy, water etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced game adds secondary impacts and eco-events (again both positive and negative) to the game taking it away from just a straight game of chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get positive or negative points when double positive or negative events happen in the related environmental impact areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The level of detail about possible future environmental events makes this game's theme very strong and probably its strongest point.  It is great to read the 260 eco-event cards and consider if they have already happened or are still likely to since the game was published in 1993&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
