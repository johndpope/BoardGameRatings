			<description>The game is played in two games. train robbers and police.&lt;br/&gt;The train robbers have struck and gotten a large spoil of loot. Now they have to escape the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning the train robbers decide in which postbag the money is hidden and who is the chief robber. Out of that combination they make a secret codeword. Next to that they remove the clue card with the filled bag out of the pile of clue cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The police have to find the chief robber and the right postbag. they start on the police station on the board. The train robbers start with all the postbags on the railway bridge. They both move through the roll of the dice. The train robbers can seek refuge in their hideouts where they are safe from the police. Whoever steps onto one of the orange dots on the board can draw a clue card which can contain a clue for the police or an escape for the train robbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a policeman stops on a spot where there is a train robber he takes him straight to prison. There he can be interrogated. Each train robber can be asked only one question after being captured. The first captured robber gives up the codeword thus eliminating 2 of the 6 postbags and robbers. On each of the next arrests they can ask after one of the four traits with a does he have ...? yes/no question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The police have 30 minutes to find the right robber and postbag otherwise the train robbers have escaped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
