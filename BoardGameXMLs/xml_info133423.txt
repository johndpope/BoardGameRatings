			<description>Collect the most loops as you blast into space in this fun, counting and matching game! Choose a launch pad and blast into space collecting as many loop-the-loops as you can on the way! At the end of the game count the loops and the player with the most wins!  Develops counting and matching skills and encourages social interaction and turn taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a coloured launch pad base card. The rocket trail and rocket cards are spread, starry side down, on the table.&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and choosing a matching card from the table. The card is turned over and, if it is a rocket trail card, it is joined to the trail above their launch pad. Play passes to the next person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player turns over a card depicting a rocket, matching another player&amp;rsquo;s launch pad, the card is returned face down onto the table. The player then mixes the cards up shouting &amp;ldquo;Space shuffle!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;If a player turns over a card depicting a rocket of the same colour as their launch pad, they place the rocket at the top of their rocket trail and can no longer add rocket trail cards to their trail. The player can still turn over cards on their next turns, but they must place them to one side, out of the game, to prevent another player from picking them up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player turns over the rocket card that matches their launch pad before they have any rocket trail cards, the player can return it, face down, to the table. They then mix up the cards shouting &amp;ldquo;Space Shuffle!&amp;rdquo;. They wait until their next turn to pick up another card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player turns over a card depicting a rocket that matches another player&amp;rsquo;s launch pad and they have already added the rocket to the top of their own trail, they can place the rocket at the top of that player&amp;rsquo;s trail. The other player is thus prevented from adding further rocket trail cards to their trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the spinner points to a symbol and there are no matching cards left on the table, then play passes to the next player. Play continues until all players have rockets matching their launch pad at the top of their rocket trails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player then counts how many loop-the-loops they have and the player with the most, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
