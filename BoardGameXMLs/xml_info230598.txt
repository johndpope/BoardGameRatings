							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Doors to Find in a Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons have doors. They are used to block entrance to areas and keep them separate. They are quite an important element for splitting dungeons up, but they are often neglected. Often, all doors have a standard description, or sometimes no description, with only important doors being described otherwise. Which makes important doors easy to spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To further dress a dungeon and to make it more difficult for players to realise which doors are truly important, here are 100 different descriptions of doors. Some doors are not, strictly speaking, doors, and others no longer block passage due to damage. If a GM mixes up the descriptions a bit and uses other materials, even more doors can be described. Players will end up finding many doors that appear important, because they are described in detail, but are actually not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 2&amp;rdquo; thick wooden door is covered in paint which is now flaking off, revealing a pale yellowish wood beneath it. The door is flush to the wall with no visible doorframe around it and lacks hinges or a handle. It appears from the colour of the paint as if it was once painted to match the walls, in order to disguise its existence. The flaking paint means that this attempt at camouflage no longer works and suggests that the door has not been maintained in some&lt;br/&gt;time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover and one and a half pages the front matter and introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
