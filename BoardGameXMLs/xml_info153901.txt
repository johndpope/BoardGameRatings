			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for Victory Games&amp;trade; James Bond 007&amp;trade; roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is suitable for two or three rookie characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pavel Drakovic, a Bulgarian post doc student in Computer Science and Security at the University of Berlin have been trying to breach and hack several high profile institutions and computer systems around the world, including the M.I.6 Thames Building. His attempts put him on the radar for MI6, and they have closely followed his every step for the past year. He has been suspected to be a leading character in the internet organisation called Anonymous, but so far has no evidence of that been revealed other that he frequent the same chat rooms on the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During one of his break-ins, Pavel happened to find a back door in one of the systems designed for the security controls of athletes and officials for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games in London. The problem was that the backdoor was created by the Russian intelligence service FSB, as they do not trust the British to be capable of keeping terrorists of the grounds, and the Russians fear that Chechen terrorists would attack Russian athletes during the games, much like the attack in Munich in 1972.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When FSB realised that their backdoor was compromised, and probably could end up on some hacker black market, they decided to pick up Mr. Drakovic and bring him to Moscow using one of many ready to run plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What FSB was not aware of is that the backdoor they were using was put in place by the Chinese working for the North Koreans, one of several backdoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
