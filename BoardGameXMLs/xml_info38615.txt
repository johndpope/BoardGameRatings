							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Agincourt (1415 AD)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;In 1415 Henry V&amp;rsquo;s invasion of France wasn&amp;rsquo;t going well. His exhausted army desperately needed to get to the safety of Calais if they were to survive. The French were determined to prevent their escape.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A large French army intercepted the English and forced a battle. Henry deployed his army so that heavy woods would protect both of his flanks, forcing the French to attack across a narrow front, negating much of their manpower advantage. To make matters worse for the French heavy rains had reduced the battlefield to a muddy quagmire. As the ill-disciplined French advanced through the mud the deadly English archers shot them to pieces.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per stand. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Units portrayed in the game include commanders, mounted knights, crossbowmen, longbow men, and infantry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
