							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halloween Horrors</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's that time of year again. The nights grow longer, the days grow colder, children's thoughts turn to bags of candy, and the thoughts of a huge number of gamers turn toward horror. Maybe they're thinking fear, maybe gore, maybe just a few spooky tweaks, but many of them are thinking something along those lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halloween Horrors features new tricks and treats to plug into your games. New spells, new magic items, and of course new monsters. If you're a newcomer or infrequent visitor to horror, you don't need a whole book, just a few tools like these. And if you're a regular horror hound, odds are good you've already used a lot of your available library, and nothing is scarier than a threat your players haven't seen before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
