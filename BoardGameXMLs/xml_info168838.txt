							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dead Things: The Zombie Boardgame (Third Edition)</name>
									
			<description>The zombies are everywhere, they catch you by surprise and attach when you least expect it. By yourself you might be able to get through the crowd, but it's either all of you or none of you...that was the deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dead Things, the players need to work together to play against the game. Turn order and movement is controlled by a movement deck and the board is set up so that zombies appear in a programmed order, moving ahead of you if your characters move too slow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to find gas, and car keys and leave the board before the zombies overwhelm the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Things 3rd Edition is a board game that expands on the original Dead Things game. New maps, new challenges for 1-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
