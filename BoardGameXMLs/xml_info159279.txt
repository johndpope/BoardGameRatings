			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Yea I knows of a job for the likes of you&amp;quot; the bartender says as he wipes off the table. &amp;quot;This wizard who lives near the shore about two or three days ride lost somethin' he was expected on the ship The Intrepid. I hear he wants the cargo back and is willing to pay good coin for it to any who'd chance going into the Lake of Chaos.&amp;quot; A grizzled old man in the corner gasps and says &amp;ldquo;any would want to go into that sea gots to be crazy. Aye, that wizard is lookin' for some crazy people. That waters haunted by dead sailors&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Oh come on&amp;rdquo; Telkall the bartender continues &amp;quot;you know that&amp;rsquo;s just an old story to keep kids away from the water. I'm sure it&amp;rsquo;s going to be an easy job for the likes you. You all appear to be quite able to take care of yourself. Go down the coast road for about two days if yer on horses and you'll see a stone tower. Ask for Kresellus ... he's the one you'll be lookin' for. Oh, and tell him Wolfgar sent ya ... if you could.&amp;quot; Well things were getting boring at the Dead Orc Inn anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is for characters of 3rd-6th level which was made for the Filbar Campaign but is easily adaptable to any campaign and most systems!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
