			<description>Orem Trivia Challenge is a limited edition (only 1,000 copies printed) trivia game about the city of Orem, UT. Each player moves a peg around a colored circular grid and answers questions about Orem based on the color they landed on. If a question is answered successfully they get a ring of that color to put on the pawn. The first player to collect all six rings and return to the Orem Chamber of Commerce is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions range from Orem History and Geography (What lake does Orem Border) to Famous People in Orem (What is the name of Orem's Fire Prevention Clown? Cinderbritches.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
