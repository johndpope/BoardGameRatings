			<description>From the publisher, terra authentica:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are reliving the year 1821. In a small village in the sunny planes of the Valle Maggia in Tecino a notary just started reading the will of Francesco D'Alberti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D'Alberti had been known as a wealthy landowner. Everyone knew: The land was to be divided up between his four sons. In his will D'Alberti thought of rules which astonished all those present:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;My four sons shall, within 30 days, split up all fields and meadows amongst themselves in such a manner that they mark the beginning and the end of the area by placing as many Caracii as available on the land. All areas must ... [unreadable handwriting]. Before registration a land surveyor must confirm the adherence to this rule. After expiry all area not occupied shall be given to the community. I grant my sons ... [unreadable handwriting]. &amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All attending the ceremony asked themselves: What was the will of the late D'Alberti and how should the land be divided up?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
