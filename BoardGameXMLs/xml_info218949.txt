							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chez Geek: TableTalk Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>A promo Activity card for Chez Geek, featuring the web-series TableTop hosted by Wil Wheaton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of the card:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Activity (TV)&lt;br/&gt;- Slack 1&lt;br/&gt;- Cost 0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This week on TableTalk, we play a board game and I get pwned! Like always!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
