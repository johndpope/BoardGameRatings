							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Drew Pearson&#039;s Predict-a-Word</name>
									
			<description>Drew Pearson was a radio personality in the 1940s United States who had a segment on his show where he predicted upcoming events in politics and current affairs.  This game was apparently created to market the show through the public's association of Drew Pearson with predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by first spinning a spinner to decide which letter of the alphabet will go in the top left corner of a 5x5 square grid.  The players then, in turn, call a letter to fill in the rest of the grid, one letter at a time.  Each player has their own grid, and places the called letter on their grid without seeing where the calling player has placed theirs.  Hence the 'prediction' - players must 'predict' what word the calling player is trying to build in order to know where to place the letters being called.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a rule booklet including a list of helpful words, a spinner, and a pad of blank 5x5 charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
