			<description>Translated from the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the Diamond Dwarfs were expelled by the demonichordes from their native caves of Lorgolosch, they were looking for a new place to settle. Now they've chosen a historic valley in the Raschtulswall. However, the delegation which was sent out to Fasar to negotiate with the rulers there about details has disappeared without a trace. King Cendrasch asks the heroes to investigate the whereabouts of the matriarch Ingrascha and to bring the negotiations to a happy ending. On the way to Fasar dark powers interfere that are interested obviously in something that the heroes carry on themselves. And in the streets and palaces of the Tulamidian city with its numerous competing rulers it is difficult not to make enemies, but to find godless malefactors. As soon as this has happened, the trip goes to the Raschtulswall - and here some secrets wait for the heroes of which no mortal has heard in millenia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
