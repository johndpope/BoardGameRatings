							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Agravaineâ€™s Rest</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder Roleplaying Game GM&amp;rsquo;s Resource supplement by Colleen Simpson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agravaine&amp;rsquo;s Rest is the unlikely name for a haven of half-orcs and orcs, set at the mouth of a remote mountain pass. Flanked by steep cliffs and all but impenetrable mountains the Rest&amp;rsquo;s strategic location has brought both wealth and danger to its inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built around the crypt of a famed paladin crusader, the shadows lurking in the way station&amp;rsquo;s past, and the secrets prowling its doorstep, could lead to the downfall of this wilderness fortress. Days from the nearest village, and weeks from the nearest town, the Rest is known as a refuge. A destination for pilgrims and travellers alike, Agravaine&amp;rsquo;s Rest is the last chance for resupply before taking the pass leading through the mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
