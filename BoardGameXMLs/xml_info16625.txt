							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bio One</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Rules for exact hit location and damage determination; for use with gunpowder period man-to-man rules.&amp;quot; 12 page booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bio One was created in 1974 to incorporate a degree of realism into a field of wargaming which was sorely lacking. Bio One provides a complete and accurate system of damage location and effects for any gunpowder period of warfare. Bio One will prove an interesting addition to any set of man-to-man rules which uses gun fire . . . Bio One can be thought of as a flow-chart, each event follows a definite sequence, starting with a bullet being fired and ending with a wound of a certain degree of seriousness. This is determined by a combination of probability and chance.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
