			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game offers a vast range of options for characters of all classes. This is great when a player wants to explore variations on a theme, but it comes at a cost: the character options for each class have been published across many places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Books (hardcover compilations such as Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook&amp;trade; and Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Combat&amp;trade;, plus the various companions, adventures, and chronicles);&lt;br/&gt;    PDFs (from Paizo and from third-party publishers);&lt;br/&gt;    Websites, blogs, and other online sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be intimidating to new players, and inconvenient to experienced players. The Echelon Reference Series aims to make this easier for everyone by gather information for each class into a single book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echelon Reference Series: Fighter collects information about the fighter class. The fighter base class and fighter archetypes. Fighters don&amp;rsquo;t have class features to choose from such as rage powers, but they do get bonus combat feats every other level&amp;hellip; so this book has all of them that I could find. There are also over 80 stat blocks for NPCs of all levels and many races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the PRD-Only version, containing information from the PRD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
