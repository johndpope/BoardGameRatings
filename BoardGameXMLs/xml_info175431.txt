							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trojan Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Developed by University of Southern California Alumni, Trojan Challenge is a Monopoly-type game where players move around a track, landing on activity spaces which represents conferences, exhibits, performances, athletic contests and other events at the university.  When a player lands on an activity space, he may purchase that activity for the designated cost.  He may then purchase up to two upgrades (which are called &amp;quot;reserved tables,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;group reservations,&amp;quot; etc.) either immediately or on a later turn.  When other players land on these spaces, they must pay the owner the amount designated on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few extra wrinkles are added.  Detour spaces place a player onto an alternate track when they are landed on.  &amp;quot;Go Trojans Go!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;We Are SC&amp;quot; cards can give players extra money, take away money or offer other benefits or detriments.  Parking Lot spaces cause loss of a turn, and various other spaces may increase or decrease the player's money total.  Passing the start space, unlike in Monopoly, costs the player $600.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with $6000 each (tracked on paper--no paper money is included) and try to gain funds as they play.  Landing on other players' spaces forces a player to pay them a designated amount.  If a player cannot pay, he or she may sell any assets owned to other players or give them back to the bank for half value.  If still unable to pay in full, the player is out of the game.  The game can be played to one of three pre-agreed ending conditions--a time limit, until one or more player are eliminated or until only player is left.  The player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules allow a player to move another player back to the starting space by landing on their pawn and allow for discounted purchase of upgrades on spaces if matching sets are collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A metagame rule governs the use of a &amp;quot;Trojan Gold&amp;quot; space.  If a player lands on this space and agrees to donate a pre-determined amount of real (not in-game) money to the real University of Southern California, he or she gains an upgrade to place on any owned property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
