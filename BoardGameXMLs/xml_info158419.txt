							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paladins of Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;By the Right of Law and Good and this blessed sword!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world sharply divided by religious and elemental belief, where the origin of entire nations can be another world, who can be counted on, every time, to do what is right?  Paladins.  Shining examples of goodness and law, they can be depended upon to stand fast in the face of darkness and evil.  And on the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra, they are needed more than anywhere.  But are they all created equal, armored hulks with longswords and naive dispositions?  Not by a long shot... and what of those who oppose Law and Goodness, favorites of the Chaotic Evil Elemental Lords... the antipaladins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paladins of Porphyra is packed with playable power with the following-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     5 paladin archetypes, for lawful neutral and neutral good, as well as lawful good Gods of Porphyra, including Codionic Knights, Gyrfalcons, and Darksiege paladins&lt;br/&gt;     3 Oaths for oathbound paladins, such as oaths against anarchy, deforestation, and darkness&lt;br/&gt;     5 antipaladin oaths, pertaining to the New Gods and the foul Elemental Lords, including oaths of submersion and subterfuge, and the malborn and deathdancer antipaladin, 2 brand-new archetypes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge the heights of righteousness or plumb the depths of depravity with Paladins of Porphyra, available from Purple Duck Games today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
