							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Falling Off the Dragon: A Sidetrek</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So your players are still a little on the green side. They&amp;rsquo;ve heard about Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, and have never fully understood the power and nature, and frankly the pure danger of meeting up with a real dragon. They are untrained, a little on the reckless side, and determined to seek out a dragon&amp;rsquo;s treasure before they are ready for it. I say give it to them, and get prepared for the players to do a lot of yelling &amp;quot;Run away!&amp;quot; Sometimes players need to know that the world they live in isn&amp;rsquo;t a balanced place, and that there are dangers around the corner that could turn their characters into a fried pie. Falling off the Dragon does just that. With the rumor of a nearby Dragon hoard right from the earliest levels you can quickly establish that you have a dangerous world to contend with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enough adventure for an evening or two for 1st-2nd level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
