			<description>Flipped Progress is a game pre-developed as a Global Game Jam challenge of 2015 which the theme was &amp;quot;What do we do now?&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game players shall cooperate to balance the environment between nature and pollution, also, managing energy points which are required to perform actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, the board acts through a dice and the possible outcome is: nature grows, industries produce both energy and pollution, cities grow or finally new location tiles are placed. Players can shift the odds on their favor against the board by using a dice system in which faces can be changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile generates its own type of tokens and as they get filled up with these tokens they can or spread it to neighbor tiles or it's own tile is flipped to reveal an opposite aspect of itself, for example, woods can become a desert and a city can become ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a turn, players choose how to spend energy: changing the environment or generating progress.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, At the count of 5 progress points, the players wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
