			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sopwith Camel was a British single-seat biplane, introduced on the Western Front in 1917. It was a superlative fighter, credited with shooting down 1,294 enemy aircraft, more than any other Allied fighter. It also served as a ground-attack aircraft, especially near the end of the conflict. in the air-to-air role by newer fighters. In the hands of an experienced pilot, its maneuverability was unmatched by any contemporary aircraft. Major William Barker's Sopwith Camel became the most successful fighter aircraft in the history of the RAF. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
