			<description>Long way home is a game for 3 to 6 players about a drunk guy trying to get home. But, due to his drunkenness, he gets a lot of ideas. Some of them are good, some of them not so much. But all of them sound fun. At least to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a game players are playing as ideas in a drunk guys head. They are controlling him, and his actions, trying to achieve secret objectives. There are two types of objectives, big ones, that happen at the end of the game, and small ones that are scored when done. Big objectives are connected to finishing the game - Get home in time, Give wife flowers, sober up, or lose consciousness in bar, while small objectives are different, some logical (eat a hamburger, drink coffee), some irrational (punch person in bar), and some just plain crazy (eat a flower, punch a wall).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is print and play, and files and rules can be found in files section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
