			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dime Novels are back and this little gem is set in the wilds of Oconto County Wisconsin. &lt;br/&gt;Your Heroes find themselves trapped between the devil and a raging inferno of revenge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages ago, before the Old Ones fought their valiant battle in the Hunting Grounds; in the woods of northern Wisconsin a war was waged. The Menominee Indians were being threatened by the appearance of a terrible Manitou that lurked in these woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They called this fiend He Who Stalks the Pines. It would snatch women, children and braves alike as they&lt;br/&gt;walked in the woods. None were safe from its grasp and its grasp meant death. Nothing would appease the Manitou and its hunger increased with each victim. The people grew desperate and prayed for deliverance...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destined to become a classic, Beast of Fires' huge cast is a role player's heaven while harrowing your favorite heroes in a blazing hell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
