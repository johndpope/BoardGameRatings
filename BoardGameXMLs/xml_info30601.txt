							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DDR-Reise</name>
									
			<description>DDR-Reise is the same concept as Journey through Europe or Deutschlandreise. Players must optimize their route to visit places in the German Democratic Republic (GDR - DDR in German).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a home city and draws five cards for other cities that they must visit. The first player to visit all their cities and return home wins. There are 52 city-cards and 52 five cards with random encounters to deal with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as I know the game was available in West-Germany (also produced by a West-German company) during the short period following the initial opening of sections of the Berlin Wall in 1989 until the decision that the territory of the Republic would accede to the ambit of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990. As a result of the unification the German Democratic Republic officially ceased to exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
