			<description>The sliding cover of the game box contains a number band with characters 1 - 10. With this piece the players can measure reactions of other players in the game. One player holds the number band by the 10 and lets it fall while another player tries to catch it as fast as possible. The number where you caught the wooden piece is the number of small wooden sticks you get for the construction of a playing field. The player with the best reaction wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
