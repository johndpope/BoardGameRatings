			<description>From the back of the box to the Windows/Macintosh edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Journey into uncharted rainforests on an extraordinary quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amazon Trail II takes you deeper into the rainforest...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your adventures begin with a mysterious incident at the Museum of Ancient Art. Before you know it, you're headed up the Amazon River to hear a critical message from the Ancient Ones. But first you must prove yourself worthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiences along the way are wild - if you're not identifying poison dart frogs, you'll be escaping from dangerous conquistadors. You'll travel through time from as far back as the 1500s to interact with people who relate directly to the areas you explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3-D Amazon learning adventure is endlessly playable, and includes 3 levels of difficulty, 17 critical assignments, 4 skilled river guides, over 50 authentic characters, 101 types of fish and animals, and thousands of challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Benefits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Gain knowledge as you explore the habitats and wildlife of the rainforest&lt;br/&gt;     Learn about the Amazon's history, geography, and ecology&lt;br/&gt;     Interact with historically significant characters and events&lt;br/&gt;     Meet indigenous peoples and learn about their cultures&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
