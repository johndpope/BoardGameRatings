			<description>TennisMania simulates a tennis match with dice and cards for the individual players. Choose your favorite champion among the four available, studies the opponent's weaknesses, choose whether to play on the ground, grass or concrete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 1 tactical card and 10 actions cards (service, vol&amp;eacute;e, back, smash, etc) of his champion, then shuffle each deck of Reaction, Challenge and Event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before each match determine who goes first by rolling the D12. The person serving gets 3 ball cards, these determine which direction(or lane) you are attempting to hit the ball into. The other player gets two ball cards. Whoever is serving then chooses an Action card to attempt and rolls the D12. The card will tell you what each Die result will mean remembering to take into consideration any modifiers the tactics card grants you. You might fail by missing the ball, hitting the net, or even hitting it out on the opponents side. Or you might succeed by merely hitting it in, lobbing it in or ACE smashing it in. you then drag the Ball token to the appropriate spot on the board and the other player gets a chance to respond based on the type of success was achieved, attempting to hit it back in a similar manner. The Player go back and forth like this until some one misses or all 5 balls are used. Points are awarded the same way they are in real tennis and win conditions are also identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
