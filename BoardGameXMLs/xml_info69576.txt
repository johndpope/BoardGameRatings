			<description>Scoreboard Tennis is Inside Sports' latest addition to our Quick Play line of games.  All players are rated for each surface they played on, based on their real life performance.  With each season that is rated, any match-up can be replayed on your tabletop.  You can even replay entire Grand Slam tournaments.  Scoreboard Tennis offers two different quick play options.  You can choose to play a match either Set by Set or Game by Game with just a single roll of the dice determining the winner of the set or game.  Scoreboard Tennis is the perfect companion to Inside Sports' Inside Volley Tennis game.  With these two games combined, you have the option to play a match Set by Set, Game by Game, or Point by Point.  The choice is yours.  No other tennis game on the market offers this kind of versatility!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
