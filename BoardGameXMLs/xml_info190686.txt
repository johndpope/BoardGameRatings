							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anno Domini: Reisen und Verkehr</name>
									
			<description>Each Anno Domini game consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other. Anno Domini: Reisen und Verkehr contains historical events related to voyages of famous people, transport, traffic motorization, etc. Like all Anno Domini sets, this game can be played as a standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Anno Domini: Reisen und Verkehr, each player receives nine cards (or fewer, if you want the game to be shorter) and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player &amp;ndash; who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement &amp;ndash; receives three cards. The first player with no cards remaining in hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
