							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dr Blender&#039;s Lab</name>
									
			<description>Aha, there you are, my 2 - 4 assistants! I, the famous Dr Alfred Blender, require your presence in the genetics laboratory IMMEDIATELY. As you can see, I have accidentally mixed up all the creatures I was experimenting on, resulting in some truly abominable creations. It's up to you to put them back together for me! I don't want you working cooperatively, mind you, as that would be far too sensible. Instead, as a reward, the assistant who does the best job will NOT be used as a subject in my NEXT experiment, ha ha! NOW GET TO WORK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Blender's Lab is a hilarious mix and match card game in which players must put heads, torsos and legs together to create complete creatures. Block your opponents and steal their cards in order to make it in the cut-throat world of crazy genetic science!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
