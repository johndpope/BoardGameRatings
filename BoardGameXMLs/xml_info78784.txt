			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends is a stand-alone expansion for Dynasty Warriors 5.  While you cannot play in Musou mode or Free mode if you do not have the original DW5 disk, DW5: Xtreme Legends adds a few notable modes: Legend mode, Destiny mode, and Xtreme mode.&lt;br/&gt;Legend mode is a great collection of 18 previously-untold stories that put you in the shoes of each story's main character.&lt;br/&gt;Destiny mode lets you create a character and enlist in the service of one of the famous playable characters.  As you progress you are able to pour points into your skills and abilities which really allows you to hand-craft you warrior's skill-set.  Additionally, as you play through skirmishes, you will pick up weapons which you can change to in the set-up screen.&lt;br/&gt;Xtreme mode is a never-ending series of levels that allows you to make adjustments, purchases, and changes in between each skirmish in hopes of establishing and growing your own empire.  This mode is not for the faint-hearted however, you are never healed automatically in between these skirmishes!  You will have to purchase food to heal yourself as there will be no standard food/health drops in the skirmishes themselves.  Your money will be very precious however as you can also spend it to increase your abilities or recruit allies to go into battle with you.  This mode ends either when you die in battle, or if you choose to walk away from it all in between skirmishes, with your end score being posted on a top 10 list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynasty Warrios 5: Xtreme Legends was released for the PS2 in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
