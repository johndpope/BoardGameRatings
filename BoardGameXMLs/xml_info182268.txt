			<description>A party game where players take turns acting as judge by drawing a character card with image of a person and all other players play from their hand a description of that person and then the judge determines which player's card best fits or is most desired.  Similarity in game play to apples to apples and other games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DETAILED GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Everyone has 7 red assumption cards in hand. Assumptions cards have red backs, and simple text on the front. Some are ridiculous, some are serious.&lt;br/&gt;     Player A draws a black character card from the pile without looking, revealing it to everyone else. Closing your eyes works. Holding it to your forehead works. So does holding it out in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;     Everyone else plays a red assumption card from their hand about the revealed character by putting it face-down. Players draw a new assumption card from the red pile so everyone's hands contain 7 cards.&lt;br/&gt;     Player A, with the character card still a mystery, flips the played  assumptions cards one at a time, reading them aloud (and inherently drawing their own assumptions about the character they haven't seen yet). Then, FINNNALLLLY, they get to flip their character card. Lol.&lt;br/&gt;     Player A picks the assumption they think best fits the character. The person who played the chosen assumption is the winner, and keeps the character card, collecting it as a point earned.&lt;br/&gt;     That's it! Rotate Player A and repeat. The game ends when X points are reached, or Y time has passed (you make up these numbers), or everyone hates each other. Preferably, before this last one happens. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
