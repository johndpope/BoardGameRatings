			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;Of all the inhospitable domains in the RAVENLOFT campaign world, Bluetspur is the cruelest and most gruesome. Nothing grows in the endless night, and lightning periodically falls like rain. The only place to escape those storms is inside the mind flayers' complex under Mt. Makab, but that is the last place where any sane person would want to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Master Illithid has been hatching black plots by hatching vampiric mind flayers in his laboratories! His prodigies are horribly insane, but if he can complete his plans, he will achieve a new level of dark immortality. A pair of heroes has stolen the key to his success, but they have paid a heavy price for their bravery and are in desperate need of aid unlooked for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the Lord of the Realm watches over the proceedings and plays havoc with the wits of both sides, sapping strength and will with all-powerful thoughts of darkness. A party of adventurers will need all of their skills to escape this black domain without the loss of life, power, or sanity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 4 to 6 players, levels 12-15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
