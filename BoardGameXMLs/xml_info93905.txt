			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a long gap between issue 2 and issue 3 of Illusionist's Vision.  Issue 2 was out in July 1978, and Issue 3 was not published until 1979 (month uncertain).  The publication month for Illusionist's Vision 4 is listed as October which means that issue 3 probably came out late summer - July or August.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Front cover artwork by Michael Watts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Page 1...Editorial and Credits&lt;br/&gt;Page 2...Story (untitled short fiction)&lt;br/&gt;Page 5...The Mage's Sack (new D&amp;amp;D magic items)&lt;br/&gt;Page 7...The Keep of Quanol - complete AD&amp;amp;D dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;Page 16..The Monstermarch (new D&amp;amp;D monsters)&lt;br/&gt;Page 21..A Christmas Dungeon - complete AD&amp;amp;D dungeon featuring Santa and evil gnomes.*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An editor's note explains &amp;quot;As this issue has been so late in coming out we were intending to replace this Christmas Dungeon with something else, but everyone whom we mentioned the idea to strongly objected and insist that we leave it in.&amp;quot;  Given the problems between issue 2 and 3, which are described in the editorial as &amp;quot;the slight problem of running out of money after Issue 2&amp;quot;, it would have looked a bit odd publishing this item in the summer...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
