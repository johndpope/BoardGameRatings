			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purple Saturn Days are a futuristic version of the Olympic games. Quoting for the game manual: &amp;quot;The PURPLE SATURN DAY Games are held every Saturn year. Eight species take part, including humans (that's you!). The eight competitors are divided into four pairs. The two individuals of each pair compete against one another in four competitions. The winners of these quarter-finals go on to the semi-finals and then to the final. The outright winner receives a kiss from the Purple Saturn Queen!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different sports in PSD:&lt;br/&gt; - Ring Pursuit, a race in Saturn's asteroid rings. The player in the lead has to pass obstacles in a certain way (to the right of red obstacles, to the left of yellow ones) to score points.&lt;br/&gt; - Tronic slider, in which contestant must shoot at energy balls and pick up the fragments, while navigating around a space platform.&lt;br/&gt; - Brain Bowler, the puzzle part of the game, where the goal is to activate an android brain by guiding electric charges on a circuit to its memory banks. There are several components on the circuit that change the direction of electric charges, slow them or store them so a player can pick them up and drop them on another part of the circuit.&lt;br/&gt; - Time Jump, a contest to see how far in time one can jump. There are three arcade phases in which the player must shoot stars in order to capture them to fuel the time catapult. Once the stars have been collected, the catapult is fired and the winner declared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from the championship mode, the game includes a training mode for each of the four competitions and a biography of each of the computer opponents, detailing their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual for an Exxos game, the game manual contained an extensive backstory and the &amp;quot;official participant's guide&amp;quot;  (edited by the General Purple Saturn Day Committee), including recipes and prayers to Exxos for good luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
