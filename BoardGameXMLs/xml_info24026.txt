							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flower of Chivalry: A Guide to the Late Middle Ages</name>
									
			<description>Flower of Chivalry is an excellent source book for the miniatures gamer interested in English medieval warfare.  The book begins with 14 pages devoted to medieval weapons and armor, battle and siege tactics and heraldry.  Next the author provides a simple set of miniatures rules and army lists for gaming battles of the period.  The majority of the book is a set of battle scenarios from the Scottish Wars (late 1200's - 1350), the Hundred Years War (1350 - 1450) and the Wars of the Roses (1450 - 1500).  Each scenario has a map of the battlefield, lists of units, and special scenario rules.  (A solo scenario of the battle of Castillon is included.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The miniatures rules are designed for 1 unit = 5-800 men, 1&amp;quot; = 40 yds., and 1 turn = 20 minutes.  Conversion rules for Tactical, DBA, and WRG 7th edition are also included for those wishing to play with other rules sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
