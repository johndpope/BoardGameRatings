							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You Have to Burn the Rope</name>
									
			<description>You Have to Burn the Rope is a platform game in which the player must guide the character through a short level through which text on how to beat the game is clearly visible. At the end of the level, the player has a boss fight against the &amp;quot;Grinning Colossus&amp;quot;. To beat the boss, the player must jump to one of the torches on the wall and use it to burn the rope attaching a chandelier to the ceiling, dropping it on the boss. The character can throw axes which lower the Grinning Colossus' health bar. However, the health bar regenerates too fast for the player to completely drain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end there is a short section of credits which includes the all-original song &amp;quot;Now You're A Hero&amp;quot;, composed by Henrik N&amp;aring;mark. The entirety of the game is often shorter than the credits song itself, which runs for 2:13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the simplicity of the game, both a text and video walkthrough have been released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;You Have To Burn The Rope&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is widely considered both a satire on players who take beating games too seriously, as well as players who want their hands constantly held during games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
