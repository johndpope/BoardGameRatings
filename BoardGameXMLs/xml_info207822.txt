			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farce is an innovative new word game with an inventive step which creates new possibilities for players to outwit each other and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inventive step in Farce divides the English Language into 3 elements (3 types of card) so that multiple cards may be combined to create new and original witty sentences. This hasn&amp;rsquo;t been done before and is an original feature of Farce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farce cards contain fragments of comedy which have been designed to combine with other fragments to generate new and original witty sentences. For each round of Farce each player combines up to 12 cards (comprised of the 3 elements) to make a witty sentence which they then read out to the group. Players use their own creativity to produce something uniquely funny with their cards which they then share with the group. The player who gets the most laughs wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group decides on each round which player received the most laughs and awards a Farce Point. If there is any dispute then the dealer for that round has the final say. The dealer rotates after each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farce includes 22 Wild Cards which allow players to insert the name of a fellow player into their farcical sentence, and thereby direct their sentences at each other and make fun of each other. This makes the game all about the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Farce is aimed at players aged 17+ as the outputs of the game can include adult humour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of possible card permutations playable is virtually infinite. Players can always create something new with Farce, something original and funny which no one has ever heard before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
