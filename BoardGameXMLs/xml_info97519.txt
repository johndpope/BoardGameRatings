			<description>Fight for Life is a 3D polygon-based fighting game. The gameplay mechanics were very similar to Virtua Fighter's, but with two notable exceptions. First is that the player begins the game with no special moves. The player has the ability to &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; two special moves away from defeated opponents. In this way, the player is able to build a unique fighter.&lt;br/&gt;Second, unlike most if not all fighting games available at that time, fighters could actually maneuver in 3D. The characters accomplish this by sidestepping, allowing them to move around the arena in a counter-clockwise direction while still facing their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fight for Life (game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
