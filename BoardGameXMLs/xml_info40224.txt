							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Garden Plots</name>
									
			<description>Players try to develop their gardens starting with Garden Plot, Plant Food, and Water cards.  After these requirements are met, sets of flower cards may be sown.  Opponents can slow your progress by playing a Drought card on your garden, but you can counter with more Water or a Sprinkler System. The first player to sow 5 sets of flowers wins the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck contains three different cards for each flower (suit). The cards contain information such as botanical name, pronunciation, common name, horticultural information, and name derivation. The cards also depict quaint watercolors of each flower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information on the cards can also be used as a trivia game along with the included lists of Bonus Game questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
