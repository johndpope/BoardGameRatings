			<description>44 cards, in sets of 6 racehorses. There are also a number of special cards (Objection to Winner, that sort of thing). When a player is dealt his hand of three cards at the start, he must place a secret bet on which horse will win the race. These bets are written down and the paper folded. A horse wins the race when one player has collected a full set of that horse's cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
