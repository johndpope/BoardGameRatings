			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a system provided for players to design there own or modify existing martial art maneuvers. Players must always consult Game Masters before modifying or purchasing any custom maneuver. This plug-in will attempt to cover all possible types of HTH and melee combat but every case and nuance can not be addressed without writing a novel. Many of the premade maneuvers have been created by STUDiO187 and probably don&amp;rsquo;t exist but do reflect the concept of the art it&amp;rsquo;s self. As this is a free download we cannot take the time to do a modern martial art system complete with all the maneuvers it has. As there are over 300 schools of Wushu in China alone, each with their own nuances. However, this system should provide you with everything you need to develop a martial art intensive environment. At the end of this plug-in we list several links to credible and well-detailed martial art sights, should your gaming needs require more information. This system has been devised to accommodate and readily adapt new martial art information into the Fuzion system. So, even if you have developed your own new martial arts or if you have a character that wishes to do so, this is the system for you. Especially if you have recently downloaded Atomik Alienz and you wish to create an alien martial art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
