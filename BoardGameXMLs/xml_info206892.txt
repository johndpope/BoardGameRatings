							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dead Heir</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where there's a will, there's a way... and where there's a will, a gigantic manor house, acres of land and a large fortune, there's often a bunch of murder, too. The death of wealthy aristocrat and landowner William the Tryster has everyone in the kingdom talking, especially his many potential illegitimate offspring. The race is on to unravel the mystery and find the journal which will name the one true heir of this wealthy lord's worldly goods. But no one said the Middle Ages were easy - before the heir can claim her due, she must face wicked bandits, clever riddles, stinking passages, and, perhaps worst of all, her fellow would-be heirs. Some people would KILL to get their hands on a fortune like this...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
