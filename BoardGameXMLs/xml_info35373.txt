			<description>Bowl by Tudor has a dual action pin reset and an automatic Gravity Ball return. You rolled your ball on to a lane with pins that look just like a real bowling alley. The pins are numbered above the pin area so that you know which pins are left standing after a roll. The ball rolls back to you because the back of the pin area is raised a bit to force the ball back to you by gravity. At the end of a frame you push two tabs together to reset the pins. Game comes with a scorepad for keeping score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
