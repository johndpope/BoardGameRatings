			<description>Volume I in the Rage Series System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Rage is a science-fiction RPG set in the mid-22nd century.  Mankind has made its way to the stars having reverse-engineered alien technology discovered on Titan and Mars.  Alien races lurk in the darkness of space in the form of the Greys, the Daemon, the Deltrassi, Kudzu and the Pentarans.  Humanity itself has splintered as we have gone deeper into space and now the United Nations and the Alliance vie for authority over human colony worlds.  The Daemon seek to destroy all that is not of their kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can be Soldiers, Merchants, Pilots, Telepaths or Aristocrats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The packet is 53 pages and contains all of the details to create your own game from the ground up.  While designed as a stand alone game, it can be played interchangably with any game in the Rage Series so you can mix and match as you wish.  All that is required is a d20, pencil and paper you are ready to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
