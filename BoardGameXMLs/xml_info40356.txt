			<description>Las Vegas is a luck based game of betting and tile placement. The game consists of a board with two spinners a betting field for each player and a central board for placing your coulored chips. Initially you place your bet on your betting field. The first player then proceeds to spin both spinners. From the first he gets a colour and a number from the second just a number. The player now has the option to place his chip on one of the two numbered fields he spun inside the spinned colours area.&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to be the first player to connect four in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonal). This will net you 5 times your bet. If you have 3 in a row you get double all others loses the wagered amount. Then a new round starts.&lt;br/&gt;There are more additional rules for what happens if no 4 in a row can possibly be placed and for 500.- you can buy a dice roll which creates an additional number. Furthermore you can get jokers from spinning/dice rolling which allow free selection of the placing field.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 4 rounds of chip placement or after a set amount of cash has been earned what ever you decide at the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
