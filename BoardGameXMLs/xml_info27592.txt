			<description>1985-2005 in Finnish television there was a really popular show called Kymppitonni (~Tenthousand). In the show there were always five celebrity competitors who in turn got a word that was meant to be an answer to a question. The competitor now had to come up with an ideal question. If no-one else knew the answer or everybody else knew the answer the competitor would have got minus points for making a too hard or simple question. If only one of the others came up with the right answer both of these competitors would have got the maximum points and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In early nineties another show, Junnutonni (~Juniorthousand), was created to satisfy the needs of younger audience. Words were easier and a boardgame was also created a bit later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
