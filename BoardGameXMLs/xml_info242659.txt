			<description>Game-o-Rama is a boardgame themed around the annual gaming event held in Atlanta. This print-to-play version is available so gamers can learn the game in advance of the tournament to be held at the next Game-o-Rama (February 2018).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-o-Rama is a mancala-style game. Each player has their own board and on their turn they pick up all the pieces in a space and drop them one-per-space (in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction) and have an opportunity to score when the pieces in the last space match the icons on one of the cards each player gets. If they match exactly the player gets another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a relatively fast and simple to learn game that was called &amp;quot;surprisingly tricky&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not what we are looking for at this time&amp;quot; by a major boardgame publisher. You will need the cards and player boards to play. Chips, meeples, or cubes can be used for the pieces. A recommended color chart for each icon type is included. More information about the tournament is at the event site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
