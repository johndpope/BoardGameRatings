							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unofficial Dungeon Keeper Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So You Want to Become a Dungeon Keeper? Want to Create a Dark Underground Fortress and fill it with Wicked Minions? Want to Create an Evil Empire, bringing Chaos, Death and Destruction? Want to Bash pitiful, useless Heroes? Welcome to the Unofficial Dungeon Keeper Card Game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You've got lands (Rooms). You've got Creatures. You've got 20 LifePoints. Just like in magic. Different Rooms are needed to Summon more Creatures, or to research Spells or to build Artifacts, and in general to be more Powerful.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;But there's come the fun part. Creatures can't be anywhere: they must be In a Room. To represent this, you need to put your Creatures near the Rooms they're in. A creature in a Room can defend it, but cannot defend a different Room . . . So be wary not to expand your Dungeon too much, or you will be unable to defend it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Creature in a Room can also use the Room. So, for example, your Warlock in your Library will be able to research a Spell (or to defend the Library). If you want him to defend the Lair, instead, you can move him in the Lair (in the appropriate Turn Phase), but then he will be unable to research a Spell (as he need to be in the Library to do so).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You can win in two ways: 1) Kill the Avatar when he's attacking your Dungeon (The World Will Be Mine! Victory), 2) Kill the other Dark Lord (BWHAHA ! Victory).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
