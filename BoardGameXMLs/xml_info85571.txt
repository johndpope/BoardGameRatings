			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this third stand-alone installment of The Guild 2 you get to play in 15th century Venice. You have a selection of four new maps of Venice and Trieste area to choose from, and as in the previous games you get to create your own character. You choose your gender, your class among four different professions, set up shop, hire employees and get involved in trading. A successful career will give you the chance to improve your talents, become a rich Patrician, upgrade your estate and business and prevail over your rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continuation of your family into the next generation is also vital, thus creating a family and raising children is also a central aspect of the game. In the political part of the game you will have the chance to pursue your political aspirations by buying or gaining titles such as Mayor, Baron or Earl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
