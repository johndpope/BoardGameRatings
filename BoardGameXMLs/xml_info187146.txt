			<description>Author's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nickel &amp;amp; Dime is the RPG to play when you are asked, &amp;quot;What's a roleplaying game?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roleplayers are sometimes asked about their hobby.  Not every day, but it happens often enough that it&amp;rsquo;s handy to be able to give a five-minute demonstration that will hopefully pique the inquirer's interest for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nickel &amp;amp; Dime is just that: a demo game that&amp;rsquo;s a tiny example (just two pages!) of a traditional RPG.  It includes two five-minute encounters: run one, it's a nickel. Run them both, it's a dime!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, you need two coins of different values.  In these rules, the lesser value coin is called a nickel (5&amp;cent;) and the greater a dime (10&amp;cent;), but any two values will do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nickel &amp;amp; Dime: 1930s Pulp Adventure! is one of a series of different genres.  The more well-known a genre, the easier it is for a new player to &amp;quot;get into character.&amp;quot;  Everyone knows at least something about a fedora-wearing hero, and so is a good choice so that non-roleplayers can understand what an RPG is about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
