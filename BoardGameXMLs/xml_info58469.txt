			<description>The game consists of a kind of hungry clown with a spring. A player presses down the head which will suck on before being released after about 10 seconds, jump up and come down again. Between those movements, there is a gap between head and rest of the figurine. Players try to use the opportunity to throw in plastic fries (the gap is only open for a very brief moment). The first player to get rid of his or her fries is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
