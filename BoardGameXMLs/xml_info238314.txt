			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get lost in the decaying kingdom of Lady Sepa, goddess of the harvest...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For as long as the good people of Chult can remember Lady Sepa has visted them on the night of the final harvest. For the good she brings a tasty sweet, but for the wicked... She is decidely less kind. This year she has chosen the mayor of Mistvale, a small fishing villiage on the western coast of Chult, as her sacrifice, but the people fear their goddess has turned on them as the mayor could not be more of an upstanding citizen. When the search party didn't return after a week, they felt their fears had been confirmed. Now they're offering a farm and people to run it in addition to 100 platinum pieces for anyone who can save their mayor's life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 5th - 10th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
