							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fractured Soul</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Old-school platforming on two screens!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fractured Soul is a classic side-scrolling platform game with a twist: it is played across both &lt;br/&gt;screens at once! Created by platform gamers for platform gamers, and exclusively for 3DS, &lt;br/&gt;Fractured Soul literally adds a new dimension to this much-loved genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are forgotten. Stranded on an outpost in deep space, you remember nothing of who you are. All you know is that you are different. You are able to shift into a parallel dimension at will. The outpost has been invaded, and is now swarming with hostiles. Escape is imperative, and with danger on all sides, it is only your unique power that can give you a fighting chance...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KEY FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;- Double the action: Fractured Soul takes the classic, instantly familiar platform game and brings it to the next level with dual-screen gameplay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Online rankings for speed running: Compete against your friends and the world via Nintendo leaderboards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Gameplay variety: 5 major zones, each bringing a unique challenge to the second screen. Your dimension-shifting journey will take you underwater, through fierce winds, scorching heat and even inverse gravity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Hours of content: 30 levels across 5 zones, including both platforming and shoot-em-up game styles, as well as epic, dual-screen boss battles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Hardcore challenges: Unlock challenge levels, and test your skills to the limit!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
