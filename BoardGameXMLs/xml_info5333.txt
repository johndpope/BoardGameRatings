							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Invasion: Norway</name>
									
			<description>Invasion: Norway simulates this fascinating campaign using a streamlined version of the acclaimed Britain Stands Alone game system. Fully integrated land, air, and naval rules accurately portray the complex interplay of warfare in three dimension (land, sea and air) in a way that is easy to learn and play, and keeps both sides constantly involved in the game, because very action you take may be detected and reacted to by your opponent. Special rules are included to simulate such unique aspects of the campaign as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The effect of the severe Arctic winter &lt;br/&gt;    The haphazard mobilization of the Norwegian Army &lt;br/&gt;    The use of shipwrecked sailors as ground troops &lt;br/&gt;    The impact of die-hard Norwegian commanders &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features:&lt;br/&gt;Game counters portray the German, Norwegian, British, French and Polish armed forces as battalions and companies of ground units, and squadrons of aircraft, while naval units are either individual combat ships of cruiser size or larger, or groups of smaller vessels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variant rules that allow players to experiment with a broad range of ahistorical options including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A more aggressive British naval doctrine &lt;br/&gt;    Earlier Norwegian mobilization &lt;br/&gt;    More effective U-Boat attacks &lt;br/&gt;    A larger German fifth column in Norway &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed coverage or armor and artillery effect, paratroops, coast artillery, frozen lake airbases, and the special capabilities of ski troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 3 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 16 miles / 26 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Platoon to Battalion, Single Ships, and Air Squadrons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full-color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One 17 x 22&amp;quot; full-color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 32-page Invasion: Norway rulebook&lt;br/&gt;One 16-page Invasion: Norway QuickStart booklet&lt;br/&gt;One 12-page Invasion: Norway Scenario &amp;amp; Historical booklet&lt;br/&gt;Six single-side printed Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;One 10-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 2-10 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
