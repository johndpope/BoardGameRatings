							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Epic Feats &amp; Familiars</name>
									
			<description>Fron the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the appeal of RPG's is their linear nature. Rarely does a game &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; in the same sense as a board game or a card game. You continue to gain experience and progress until you reach higher levels. All the core classes top-out at 20th level, but if you wish to continue playing the same characters you then move into the Epic Level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I really enjoy playing Epic level campaigns. Why play a fourth level Dwarf Cleric when you can play a 25th level Paragon Doppelganger! (Yes, I actually did play &amp;quot;Queen Dopplepopolous&amp;quot; in our Epic campaign!) Sometimes it's great to put aside restrictions and notions of &amp;quot;balance&amp;quot; and let lose with some serious POWER GAMING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epic Feats &amp;amp; Familiars is designed to give players and GM's more options when playing an Epic Campaign. Included in this PDF are 21 new Feats (19 Epic and 2 pre-requisite feats) and a section on Epic Familiars. Now instead of a small cat or a bird, you can have a Roc or an Elder Earth Elemental as your faithfull companion and servant! Or if you prefer, you can imbue that faithful familiar that has stuck with you for so many levels with new Epic abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
