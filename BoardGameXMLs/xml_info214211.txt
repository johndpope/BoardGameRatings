			<description>The game Einstein: His Amazing Life and Incomparable Science focuses on simple rules and quick playability to create an accessible strategy game for gamers and non-gamers alike. While playing, the players take on the role of Albert Einstein during one of four periods of his life. Each Einstein has their own deck of inspiration cards based on the real happenings of his life: these inspirations give you simple theories to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Genius Expansion evolves the world of Einstein and provides an exciting step-up for more expert players. Leveraging the components in the base game, along with some new ones, the expansion layers on the kinds of strategic choices and player interactivity that hobby gamers love, with a new deck of cards to bring these mechanisms to life along with entirely new rules for taking your Einstein experience to the genius level! More specifically, with this expansion players now have:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Insight cards&lt;br/&gt;    Genius scoring cards&lt;br/&gt;    Prestige scoring that's broken into six categories: Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Philosophy, Major Theories, and Collaboration earned during the game&lt;br/&gt;    The opportunity to use inspirations and ideas played by both you and your opponents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
