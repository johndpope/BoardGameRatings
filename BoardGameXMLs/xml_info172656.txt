							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Upstairs</name>
									
			<description>Upstairs is an exciting, tactical race for the entire family. Two to four players take control of one first-class secret agent each (m/w ^^). Your group entered the base camp of the evil dude, but instead of the villain all you find in the basement is a giant bomb. To make matters worse, there is no easy way out  the janitor has locked all the doors shut. The only escape route is via the roof. But there is no need to be afraid, because just like in every good action movie, the bomb will only explode when the (first) agent is taking off with the helicopter. Good for him, bad for the rest that is left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upstairs - A game ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;for a gang of up to four friends, where the one that comes second is the first to lose the game. So you all better hurry up, and race as fast as possible through the labyrinthine high-rise building, just to be the lucky, or in fact the only survivor. Upstairs is an excellent racing game with a great charm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Upstairs, the 9 playing cards make up the high-rise building, from which the players have to escape. Not only do they have to run through the labyrinthine base, but also to dodge the extremely aggressive guards, who in the harder gaming variant can end the life of an agent faster than he would have liked. Winner is the first player to reach the roof. Only then will the jump  naturally, and befittingly, in slow-motion - succeed in the nick of time, with the agent grabbing the skids of the descending helicopter, carried off to the next hotel, where wine, women and song are waiting for our hero. The short playing time of around 15 to 20 minutes makes Upstairs the perfect warm-up game for any games meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
