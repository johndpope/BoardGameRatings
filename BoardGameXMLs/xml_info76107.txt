			<description>Nestortiles DUEL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Nestortiles game for 2 players by N&amp;eacute;stor Romeral Andr&amp;eacute;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nestortiles DUEL is a dice building and dice combat game for 2 players. You&amp;rsquo;ll need one set of Nestortiles in order to play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEFINITIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of a tile is the number of pips on that tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETUP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place all the Nestortiles face-down in the middle of the playing surface (drawing area) and shuffle them.&lt;br/&gt;If this is the first game, the starting player is determined randomly. If not, the player that lost the previous game starts.&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in 2 phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DICE BUILDING PHASE &amp;mdash; This phase is played in turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you must do one of these two things:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Draw a tile from the drawing area and place it face-up before you or...&lt;br/&gt;     Discard one of your tiles face-down (first show it to the other player) and draw as many tiles from the drawing area as the value of the discarded tile (You can't draw the discarded tile itself). The value of the discarded tile must be lower than the number of tiles left on the drawing area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, after drawing the tiles, you have 6 or more tiles, you must build a die. To do this, choose 6 of your tiles and assemble them into a die, and discard the rest face-down to the drawing area.&lt;br/&gt;If the drawing area has no tiles left, the dice building phase ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMBAT PHASE &amp;mdash; Before this phase starts, 9 or 10 dice should have been built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players roll their dice at once (try not to mix them).&lt;br/&gt;Now, for each of the 10 colors, do the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sum up the total value rolled for that color for each player. The player with the highest sum for that color gets 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;     In case of a tie, no points are scored for that color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score after the 10 colors have been checked is the winner. In case of a tie, the player with the highest total sum (pips rolled on all dice) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VARIANT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discarded tiles are placed face-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
