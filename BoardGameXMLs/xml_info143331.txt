			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until they go to school, children think that learning is fun, not work. Is this the reason that they learn so much faster in the early years? Play is natural learning. And learning is great play. With these games children teach each other the alphabet, addition and subtraction, recognition of letters and words, even art as they play with patterns on the screen. The games are written for ages four to six. The author has a degree in education, with graduate study in child development and counseling, plus a wide variety of teaching experience in industry, the military, public and private schools, and churches. If you have children, and you also have a TRS-80, then you should have Nine Games for Pre-School Children. All nine games and the menu are in the computer at one time, and the children will quickly learn to select the one they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
