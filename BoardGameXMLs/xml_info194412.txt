			<description>Players in Spirot play pixellated cards from their hands in order to create sequences of three cards that have the same color (or all different colors) as well as the same pixel pattern (or all different pixel patterns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up, place the nine board cards in a 3x3 grid, shuffle the spirot cards, and deal six cards to each player. Reveal spirot cards from the top of the deck until you find a matching image card that can cover each of the four corners of the board card. Each spirot card has one of the nine images on the board cards, with this image in one of three colors and one of three pixel patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, place a spirot card from your hand onto a board card. If you create a sequence, you score one point, then take another turn. If you don't create a sequence, your turn ends. At the end of your turn, refill your hand to six cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once someone has five points, complete the round so that everyone has had the same number of turns. Whoever has the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
