			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color battlemap of an Old Mine exterior .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want these prospectors dead before they file their claim at the Assay Office. We then file the claim in the name of the Syver Mining and Railroad Company and bleed the mine and stream dry of silver and gold.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Joe Syver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Mine is a single exterior map of an abandoned mining site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Mine is intended for use in fantasy, western, or low tech modern settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skeletons in the Desert: Mining prospectors found a great spot to panhandle for gold in a small stream and a cave for silver. After collecting their fill, they packed their gear and rested for the night. The next day they were gonna head for Syverfall and file a claim at the Assay Office to the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for the two prospectors, Joe Syver sent out assassins to kill the prospectors and steal the fundaments in the middle of the night. Syver filed his own claim to the territory and bled it dry. He abandoned the mine for newer areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the group might be led to the area in search of water in the desert, finding a small stream. Investigation of the area finds mostly old mining and panhandling tools but also two skeletons in the desert. If they go to the nearby town and talk with the sheriff and deputy they find out about the mysterious disappearance of prospectors a few months back. Josey has a grudge against Syver and may hire them to try to find evidence of Syver wrongdoing. If they can find the killers of the prospectors, they may be able to interrogate them and get the information they need to bring Joe Syver and his company down. Finding the group sifting through the area, Joe Syver sends his assassins to attack them the next time they return to the Old Mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
