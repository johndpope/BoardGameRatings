			<description>Players each pick a card with several possible categories, and select one that becomes their &amp;quot;category&amp;quot; for the game.  Before the game is announced, the players go around twice to say what their category is, after which everyone's responsibility is to remember everyone else's categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the main phase of the game, cards numbered one to eight are dealt out to each player.  Whenever a card JUST placed from the deck matches one on the table, the two players whose stacks have the matching numbers go head to head: whoever says something from the other person's category first wins both cards (each category member may only be used once).  There are also a small number of &amp;quot;Rambo&amp;quot; cards, which when played start an all-player race to say the &amp;quot;Rambo&amp;quot; player's category first (including that player).  The winner of the Rambo round gets the Rambo card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various other rules to ensure that no players reveal others' categories, help other players, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
