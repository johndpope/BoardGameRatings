			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alignment can be problematic, to say the least. Some people get it almost intuitively, some people have a hard time wrapping their heads around it. A lot of players love it, and some choose to ignore it. Part of the issue is that in game systems that are otherwise clearly defined, alignment has always been &amp;ldquo;squishy&amp;rdquo;. It is largely subjective, and has no rigor around it at all. That leads to confusion, arguments, and even flame wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forager's Guild Guide to the Nine Alignments sets out to address those issues by adding some simple yet flexible mechanics. Should your lawful good paladin really be doing that? Would you chaotic neutral rogue truly be able to resist the temptation to steal that shiny object she covets? Now there's a way for gamemasters to steer players toward following the morals and ethics of their alignment without straightjacketing their character development, pidgeonholing them into stereotypes, or railroading them into specific courses of action. And everyone can still have fun while doing it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the concept of Fate aspects, The Forager's Guild Guide to the Nine Alignments is a cap system that works with nearly any roleplaying game system. Specific mechanics are detailed for systems grounded in the core d20 mechanic, but the ideas are easily adaptable to the game of your choice.
