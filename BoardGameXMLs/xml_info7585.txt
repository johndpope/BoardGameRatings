			<description>Hill Billy Times is an auto racing game with a twist. The object of the game is not necessarily to win, but to finish the race with the most money. It also has a set of scrap metal race cars which the game designer notes, &amp;quot;should be completely clean, but we cannot guarantee that they are sterile.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include the game board and rules (German), 30 game cards, five cars, and game money (approximately 160 chips in four colors, worth varying numbers of points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bid for starting position, then draw cards to dictate movement. Each card has various hazards listed. The active player shows their card to everyone, then secretly picks a set of results and writes it down. The opponents pay insurance based on what hazards they think will be on the active player's selected option. The active player then reveals their choice and moves based on the option chosen. If the opponents did not insure themselves against the hazards that appear, the active player collects money from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race ends when the racers clear one of the two rows containing stacks of bonus money out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
