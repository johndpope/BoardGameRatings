							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunting the Wyrd</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wyrd, the Tarasin Force-users who turned to the Dark Side and who have perverted the powers of nature to help them defeat their opponents, have become an increasing problem. Heroic volunteer groups have decided to do all they can to stop the Wyrd from harassing the residents of Cularin any longer. A number of locations have been uncovered where it is believed the Wyrd are hiding, massing for attack. The heroes of Cularin must decide &amp;mdash; is the element of surprise worth the risk of facing the Wyrd on their home turf? A Living Force adventure for mid- to high-level heroes (4th to 12th level). It would be best if the heroes had experienced the events of the scenario From The Trees, before playing this one. Players should also note that this scenario is a call for heroic volunteers, not paid mercenaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
