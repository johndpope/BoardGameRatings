			<description>The second that Malefix the Sorcerer goes away on a trip, his apprentices secretly explore his enormous book of magic spells! All of the pages are blank upon first glance, but soon enough the sorcerers put the pens to good use by starting to paint! The sorcerer's apprentices take turns guessing what is being painted. This is harder than it seems because the whole picture is covered up by bookmarks at the beginning, so the fastest and most imaginative apprentice will be the first one to guess the picture correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zauberer Malefix, the players paint a picture on their easel where the other players can't see it, then they take turns putting their pictures in the magic book while the other players have to guess what they have painted. This is harder than it seems because the whole picture is at first covered up by bookmarks. The bookmarks are gradually unfolded according to how the die is rolled. More and more bits of the picture become visible depending on the roll of the die. The first player to guess the picture correctly receives points, and the less of the picture they can see, the more points they earn. The aim of the game is to be the first player to score the required number of points depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
