							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ark</name>
									
			<description>This is a game for young children based on the story of Noah's Ark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four identical boards representing Noah's Ark. The interior of each Ark is divided into 20 squares and each square contains the picture of an animal. Each player is given one of these boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a bag full of animal picture tokens. During a player's turn the child will remove one token from the bag at random. If the token matches an image on the kid's Ark, the player places it in position. If it doesn't match, the child loses a turn and puts the token back in the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first child to fill an Ark wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for children 3 to 6 years old with no reading required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
