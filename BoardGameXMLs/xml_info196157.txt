							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pneumatic Hammers</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RED ALERT! The Lee Valley gold research base is under threat of destruction. The electrical power lever has broken off and there is no other way of switching off the plant's pneumatic hammers. The hammers were installed to hammer bridge pillars into the river bed. The continuous operation of the hammers is causing the rockface to crack and crumble into the valley floor, threatening the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red O'Blair, famous troubleshooter, is choppered in to save the day. Your job is to help Red cast a new lever, but the only available material is gold, which first has to be found. The gold nuggets have to be pure in quality and exact in quantity to make the required lever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multi-screen game where you have to guide Red through the steps of making the lever to switch off the pneumatic hammers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First you use a metal detector to find nuggets of gold, which must be extracted amid landslides. Then the player needs to jump across a river, avoiding the pneumatic hammers. The player then needs to separate out the pure nuggets of gold, and the correct quantity. The lever must then be cast, by keeping a furnace at the correct temperature. Finally the lever needs to be taken to the top floor to turn off the power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
