			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the dangers of having PCs go into a town for rest an relaxation is that the majority of the time you have no idea what should be there. Many PCs of course just want to go to the latest and greatest tavern for a barfight. But there are those out there that want to go shopping. Those are the ones that will ask the dreaded phrase &amp;quot;Whats on the shelves?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The City Guide Encounters series adds not only a location for use within the city, but fleshed out adventure encounters for use in a city campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The is a single location continuing in the same line as our other City Guide products. It contains enough detail to fill nearly a third of a normal City Guide product, for those interested in a even more fleshed out location than we normally provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 complete location&lt;br/&gt;     Over 15 NPCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
