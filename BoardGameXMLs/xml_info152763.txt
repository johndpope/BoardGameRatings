			<description>Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a tower with an funnel on top and two catapults. One player plays yellow, the other red. Both players now try to shoot their disks into the tower. The first player to sink his/her four disks wins the round, the first player to win three rounds or get four disks in a row is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack the tower&lt;br/&gt;With this intense version of the classic CONNECT 4 game, even the most confident players will be challenged.
