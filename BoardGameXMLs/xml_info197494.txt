							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witch-Hunt</name>
									
			<description>Dark clouds linger over the City, a storm is looming...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, a dark Witch hides deep within the City, hellbent on bringing it to its knees. But, all hope is not lost. A holy Inquisitor, attracted by the growing corruption, has secretly come to the City and decided to uproot the insidious evil. The storm will shortly break on the City and it will either wash away the swelling corruption or those standing in its way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fate of the City lays in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witch-Hunt is an asymmetric strategy card game for 2 players, where they command their minions on a randomly generated board to fulfill their victory conditions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Goal of the Witch is to corrupt the City. Every Building has a numeric resistance marker, and the Witch uses her Cultists to spread the corruption. If the corruption reaches this threshold, a building becomes corrupted. The Witch wins when all buildings are corrupted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Goal of the Inquisitor is to find and kill the Witch. Hunters interrogate Cultists and Investigate Buildings. The Inquisitor wins when he finds out the location of the Witch and moves a Hunter there to kill her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
