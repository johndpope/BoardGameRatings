							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Racing Line</name>
									
			<description>In The Racing Line you steer a car token around a course in a succession of straight lines. The length of those lines is determined by your current speed as measured on a special ruler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're limited in how much you can change your speed between turns so approaching corners can be very tricky unless you get them just right. &lt;br/&gt; The game also encourages you to pick-up various &amp;quot;Power-up&amp;quot; tokens scattered through the course:  Missiles, oil, nitro gas, emp bombs and more!Use these against your enemies, or just bump them off the track in your quest for victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
