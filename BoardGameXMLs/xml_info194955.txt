							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coal &amp; Parchment</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coal &amp;amp; Parchment is about dwarves writing letters to one another. In the Homes, quills and ink are rather rare commodities. However, paper isn&amp;rsquo;t too widely used and so stores remain generally well-stocked. Your average dwarf is too busy working or drinking or eating or chatting to write much - dwarves would just as soon go and visit their auntie as write her. The Keepers always write and have always written and will always write. It is the only way to keep down those many notions that parade through their minds all day long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
