							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perilous Pyramids</name>
									
			<description>Perilous Pyramids is a competitive multiplayer card game in which players assume the roles of archeologists each racing to the center chamber of a pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player builds their own side of the pyramid using ten face-down chamber cards. Players clear chambers by playing resource cards from their hand that meet or exceed the difficulty of the chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These same resource cards can be used to make the opponents' chambers even harder to overcome, swap revealed chamber cards, cancel a played card and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to clear their pyramid completely and clear the final central chamber wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play is fast and aggressive, as the game encourages players to sabotage the efforts of their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
