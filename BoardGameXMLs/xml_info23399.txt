							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sammakot satimessa</name>
									
			<description>Sammakot satimessa is Finnish for something like &amp;quot;Frogs in the Trap.&amp;quot; The idea of this game is to get four frogs that share a trait on the same line (orthogonally or diagonally) to score a point. It's a bit like Tic-tac-toe on a 4x4-grid. There's a possibility for double points if your frogs share two traits. It's also possible that more than one winning line is formed at same time. 5 points to win game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
