			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical Hits is a series of fantasy encounters created to be dropped into any existing campaign as an interesting diversion from the main storyline or played as a single evening's entertainment. This popular range of products provides DM and player alike with unusual and interesting, sometimes comical but always memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Haunting the heroes? journey is brought to an abrupt halt as a sudden dense and eerie mist descends upon the dangerous mountain road they follow. To press on further would be to invite disaster, but to camp in the open with such poor visibility is equally unappealing. As they pause to debate the way forward they see, looming in the mist, an impressive half-timbered coach house. Taking refuge in the gloomy building gets the PCs out of the inclement weather but into a world of mysteries and danger. Can the party discover the dark secrets of the Eagle's Nest, or must the ghosts that haunt the inn linger in torment further?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this, the largest Critical Hit to date, the players are faced with the tough challenge of two overlapping storylines and the DM is treated to a complete location and a cast of thousands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Level 5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
