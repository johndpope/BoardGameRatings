			<description>From the instruction book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;hot money... Will you be a saint or sinner?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to become the first player to reach THE TOP.  To get there you must make millions of $$$, run up hundreds of thousands in debt, and earn a glowing reputation while surviving all the dirty tricks and delaying tactics your opponents play against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two levels of play:&lt;br/&gt;   The Daily Grind (the outer board) where you must earn your fortune in Cold Cash and/or in Hot Money.&lt;br/&gt;      and&lt;br/&gt;   High Society (the inner board) where you earn your reputation by purchasing the Keys to Success&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Money is a roll and move game that uses two currencies, cold cash and hot money.  Hot money comes from various illicit activities, and must be laundered into cold cash before a player can enter High Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
