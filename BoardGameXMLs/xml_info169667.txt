							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Synonymy</name>
									
			<description>How can you go from a word like 'morbid' to a word like 'ecstatic'? Or from 'fastidious' to 'vigil'?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synonymy is a game of finding the paths between random words through their network of synonyms. By taking the synonym of a word, and then a synonym of that synonym, and so on, you can ultimately arrive at any other word in the English language. (Spanish, French, German and Japanese in the works!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swipe or press w,s,a,d on a keyboard to navigate through multiple pages of synonyms and to navigate through the menus of the game. On the bottom of the gameplay view, you will see the goal word beside markers that highlight what page you're currently on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
