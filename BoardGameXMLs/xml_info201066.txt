			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A School for Gifted Youth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shepherd Academy is a boarding school for Meta students on a large estate in San Francisco. Though the first class of students only included half a dozen members, more students have been added to the roster over the last several years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE VINDICATORS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the students and faculty of the Shepherd Academy are an elite group of individuals called the Vindicators; a group assigned to seek out new Metas at the guidance of Dean Shepherd. These Metas are invited to join the Academy if they choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dean Shepherd, himself a Meta, established the Academy at his own estate. A wealthy man, who studied genetics and physics in various colleges, he now seeks out new, young Metas in an attempt to help them understand who they are, and how to control their new, and dangerous powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
