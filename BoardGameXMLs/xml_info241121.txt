							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mainland</name>
									
			<description>Mainland is an easy-learning strategy game that is played with 2, 3 or 4 players. To secure the future of your clan in a new chaotic world, you must place your cards to create and expand territories. Your Mainland is your largest territory. To accumulate as many points as possible at the end of the game (and dominate the world) you must maximize your Mainland and try to include valuable cards. Therefore, the goal of the game is also to block the territorial expansion of your opponents and to prevent the development of their Mainland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
