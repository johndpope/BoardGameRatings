							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Very First Aleph-Bet Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Enjoy learning the aleph-bet as you race around the board!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must try and collect the 32 aleph-bet letter cards that are placed on the board. There is one landing space for each of the letters (as well as a few follow-the-instructions spaces). The first person to land on a given space takes the card for that letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the first players reaches the finish line. The winner is the player with the most number of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
