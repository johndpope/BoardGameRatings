			<description>Stacked is a trick-taking dexterity game that mixes the simplicity of Jenga-style tower-stacking with Tetris-like shapes with straightforward card play. The game lasts a number of rounds (typically two) or until a predetermined point total (typically 50).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start a round, after the cards are dealt, the oldest player calls a trick type by color or symbol, then counts down: &amp;quot;3, 2, 1, flip!&amp;quot; The player who reveals the highest card of the proper type wins that trick, takes the lead for the next trick, and gets to give their wooden piece that matches the image on their winning card to another player, who must then stack it on the tower for that trick's winner! All players other than the trick winner must also stack their own matching wooden piece on the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck contains two of each number, so watch out for ties because in that case both players play their own piece and nobody wins the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
