							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wonderluette</name>
									
			<description>Wonderluette  is a poker style card game that uses Aluette Card Game suits (Clubs, Coins, Cups, and Swords) and special action cards called Wonder Cards designed from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The game is to be played by 2 - 6 players and each round can take up to twenty minutes. The object of the game is to be the first player to get a Flush, thus winning the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the story goes, after the death of the Jabberwocky the residents of Wonderland had a lot of stress off their shoulders. The game was created by the Mad Hatter to give people something to do with their newly found recreational time. With this new lack of stress, they needed something to help become stressful again, this was the answer to that dilemma. After Alice's Adventure Underground, the Hatter decided to create the game using Aluette designs, that consists of no queen cards nor the suit of hearts. He thought this best since everyone was still getting over the events, but did like the idea of the added stress. Initially the game was designed for three rounds, but that did not deem stressful enough and has been increased to five rounds. The winner of the round is simply the first to get a Flush (cards with all matching suits), the player with the most wins in the five rounds--keeps the deck. Only one deck exists in Wonderland so this was the best way to ensure everyone could own a copy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Lewis Carroll may not have conceptualized this game in his works, we have taken it upon ourselves to do so. The majority of the cards in the game are traditional Poker Cards, the Action Cards include imagery from the original book and the artwork in the game is originally by Arthur Rackham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Cards are shuffled and scattered in a pool in the middle of the Tabletop.&lt;br/&gt;2. Each player grabs five cards from the pool.&lt;br/&gt;3. During their turn a player may use a Wonder Card or Discard a Card, then draw again from the pool.&lt;br/&gt;4. The object of the game is to get a flush, once someone gets a flush they win the round.&lt;br/&gt;5. The best of five rounds is declared the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
