			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth is in a panic!  Saucers are coming to open a new Peopleburger franchise!  Can you stop them?  Two levels of difficulty.  This one is simpler to play than [most games], with only one button to push.  But it's still quite a good challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will run in 8K on any OSI C1, C2 or C4 tape based computer.  Recorded twice on each tape; covered by a limited replacement warranty, return for replacement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed by Bob Retelle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
