							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scooby-Doo Mystery of the Fun Park Phantom</name>
									
			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Scooby and the gang need your help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shaggy, Velma, Fred, Daphne - and Scooby, of course - were on their way to visit Shaggy's uncle. But, as usual, they were side-tracked by a mystery. George and Betty Gob are about to be forced to shut down their amusement park for good - thanks to the Fun Park Phantom - a decidedly unfriendly character who has ruined their business by frightening away customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gang needs your help to sort through the possible suspects and trap the Phantom. This will be a test of your mystery-solving skills and your reflexes - that Phantom tends to chase anyone who starts getting too close to the truth. Be ready - for anything.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
