			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt; Until twenty years ago, the neighboring Singing Rock and Hiord clans got on tolerably well; well enough for the young Singing Rock woman, Estave, to marry Sarotar, her true love, and leave her birth clan to join him in the Hiord clan. Soon after that, relations between the two clans began to break down and the usual cycle of cattle raids became more vicious on both sides. Eventually, a feud was declared and the fyrds skirmished. In that first battle, Brol the farmer was killed. Dorasa, his wife, managed to have him resurrected but he had the Relife sickness. Brol turned to Humakt and became Mortality, Champion of the Singing Rock clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This episode was written to be played at conventions. It is intended for five or six pre-generated players and should take three to four hours to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
