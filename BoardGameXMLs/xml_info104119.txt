			<description>[from the introduction]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The late 2230&amp;rsquo;s and early 2240&amp;rsquo;s saw the institutionalization of raiders throughout the know galaxy. Human raider bands created shell corporations to, at one and the same time, conceal and support their activities. Within the League, these methods were sometimes adapted to the local politics. The Vree Guild of Salvage, once a respectable institution, has become a front for several pirate groups. Several Brakiri corporations, seeing the value in having a small military force whose activities they could plausibly deny, are believed to have created whole dummy divisions supporting the activity of raiders in exchange for occasional &amp;ldquo;favors&amp;rdquo; from those raiders. In contrast, raiders operating out of Drazi and Centauri space continue to follow their centuries old traditions of working on the fringes of society where they have long been accepted, if disreputable, institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
