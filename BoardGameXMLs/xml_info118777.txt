			<description>-An excerpt from the PROTEUS Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the last bastion of humanity, where Earth is but a distant memory. This world is known as Ad Tair. Here humanity is but one of many species struggling to survive. Races and civilizations are isolated from one another and most of the planet?s technology has been wiped out in a single cataclysmic event. The devastating effects of that horrible accident can still be seen. A dark billowing mass of swirling fog is all that can be seen of what was once Mt. McKenna. A secret project based there was responsible. Now another project is entering a critical phase. This long-forgotten secret could mean the destruction of this world ? or its salvation. The name of the project is PROTEUS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
