			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The otherwise peaceful village of Grackle&amp;rsquo;s Vale has been terrorized of late by a creature that has taken up lair in the nearby ruins of Reeker&amp;rsquo;s Keep. It is a Boarman, a foul lycanthrope said to haunt dark forests and murky mires, feared for its savagery and accursed tusks. At least a dozen people have gone missing after attempting to track the beast, the most recent being a Ranger of some renown. A reward of 1000 gold pieces has been offered to anyone willing to help free the community from the Boarman&amp;rsquo;s bloodlust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet is part of a series of supplements detailing the villages around the Bay of Spirits. The bay is located on the western edge of the Eastern Sea. Dotted with hamlets, villages and small towns, it is an excellent place for adventure and exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a region of sheer cliffs, forested mountains, dark gullies, and bottomless ravines. Settlements along the coast walk a thin line between land and sea, with farmers, fishermen, traders, and sellswords plying their trade alongside merchants, nobles, rogues, and adventurers. Each community contains colorful characters, detailed settings, and helpful tidbits to enhance any medieval fantasy game setting. Grackle&amp;rsquo;s Vale is the first of such communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
