			<description>This is a dexterity &amp;quot;aiming&amp;quot; game where you flip plastic/rubber cats to cause chain reactions.  It can be played solo, but it is intended to be played in a competition set-up with increasingly complex chain reaction set-ups.  While the game doesn't specify a maximum number of players, six is the highest number that would not have too much downtimes between plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
