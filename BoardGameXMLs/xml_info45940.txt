			<description>From the back of the 1st-edition (1986) box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you tired of your current small arms combat system? Tired of inconsistencies and rules that simply don't work? If so, we invite you to conduct a short test:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using your current small arms combat system, place the muzzle of a large caliber pistol between your character's eyes. Squeeze the trigger. Continue squeezing the trigger until he falls unconscious. Then have a friend put a band-aid over that nasty .45 caliber dent in his skull, and try not to get him shot too often in the week or two it takes to heal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, using Phoenix Command, place the same pistol in the same place. Squeeze the trigger. You now have a choice: you can either roll up a new character or rush the body to a very sophisticated medical facility and discover the joys of role-playing a vegetable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are nodding your head and smiling, and thinking that it would be nice to have a combat system that really works, welcome to Phoenix Command!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phoenix Command combines accurate simulation of gunshot wounds with detailed aiming and firing rules, and authentic modern weapon data to create a simple, fast-paced game with an incredibly realistic feel. Included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Modern Weapons, including over 140 of the latest:&lt;br/&gt;         Pistols and Sub-Machineguns (M92F, MAC10, AKR, MP5KA4, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;         Rifles and Machine Guns (M16A2, M249, AK74, G11, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;         Grenades and Explosives (M67, M26A2, RGD5, RKG3, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;         Grenade and Rocket Launchers (M79, M203, RPG7, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;         Shotguns (SPAS12, B4-B, CAWS, Mossberg Bullpup 500, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Body Armor and Cover&lt;br/&gt;     Medical Aid&lt;br/&gt;     Initiative and Morale&lt;br/&gt;     Knockout and Disabling Injuries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phoenix Command provides a challenging and satisfying playing experience as a table top wargame, a modular combat system for your own role-playing game or with any other Leading Edge Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
