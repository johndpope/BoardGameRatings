			<description>In Snapshot: 1969, a card-based storytelling game, the players all run the same character: the hero of a hippie adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, the players make up the hero by answering a series of questions: Is the hero male or female, how old is the hero, how is the hero's love life, what is the hero's darkest fear/greatest hope, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game host deals each player five cards, and the game will take the hero through five scenes. The cards contain a picture &amp;ndash; a snapshot, if you will &amp;ndash; from 1969. Each scene starts with a picture. The players play one card each and the host picks which one starts the scene. The player who laid down that card makes up a short story about what is going on. The other players may challenge this to change it or add to it. Once everyone has had a chance to add to the scene, the scene ends. The host awards the card to the player he found the most entertaining. The player with the most scenes wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
