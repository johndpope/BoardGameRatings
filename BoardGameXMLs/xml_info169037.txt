							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadowed Earth Veiled Supplements #02: The Realm of Lord Bane</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Castle of The Mountain, located in the realm of Lord Bane, is situated atop a large hill with a commanding view of the surrounding countryside. Accessible by a well-maintained path, it&amp;rsquo;s a formidable structure to gaze upon. The castle derives its name from being constructed using hard stone, a rarity in this land. The Mountain, as it&amp;rsquo;s often called, was constructed using a local, grey rock the now shows the scars of numerous assaults. Its outer wall protects a large central keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Realm of Lord Bane presents a mini-setting placed within Shadowed Earth, nominally during the Dark Ages in the decades leading up to The Fall. Lord Bane and those beneath him were once human, but a blessing (or a curse) has turned their deaths into an opportunity for near-immortality. The townsfolk of Undermount, within Lord Bane&amp;rsquo;s domain, must live with his ghastly soldiers and guards, possibly plotting a revolt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Realm of Lord Bane includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A look at Lord Bane&amp;rsquo;s realm and the town of Undermount.&lt;br/&gt;    Descriptions and stat blocks of Lord Bane&amp;rsquo;s allies, minions, and enemies.&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip; and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veiled Supplements #02: The Realm of Lord Bane is not a standalone game and requires the Entropic Gaming System core rulebook. Although designed to be used within a modern Shadowed Earth setting, such as Judgment Day, the OGL material can be used with any Entropic Gaming System product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
