			<description>Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou: Zukkoke Salary Man Hen (大爆笑!!人生劇場 〜ずっこけサラリーマン編〜 Chapter Workers Zukkoke Large Bursts of Laughter Theater Life) is a game in the Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou series. Players who play this game become white collar workers who must find a career. Eventually, they must balance work, leisure, and romance. Once the player has employment, he must raise his earning potential then he must find a mate to become his trophy wife or her trophy husband. Earning potential is raised by having nicer jewelry, a nicer house, and better quality items. Heterosexuality is the only option in this game and there are many corporations to impress in order to land that job. However, players can get promoted, demoted, or even fired by certain events on the board. Public relations and relations with the employer can be improved by playing golf at the country club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bakushou!!
