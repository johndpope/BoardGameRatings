			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After defeating Panthea, there is at last peace in Centopia &amp;mdash; at least until a circus island called Funtopia suddenly appears, with this place being run by a merry circus director named Rixel. The elves fear that Rixel is holding animals captive on his island, and they soon discover that the ringmaster has been sent by a powerful dark elf from Dystopia with orders to return a winged unicorn to Dystopia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mia and me: Einh&amp;ouml;rner in Gefahr, the young players must help Mia and her friends keep the unicorns from being captured by Rixel and banish the danger from Centopia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
