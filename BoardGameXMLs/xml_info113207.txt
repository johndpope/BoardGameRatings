			<description>This is a game which was produced when Denmark reached their first European championship (EM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to win the soccer match.&lt;br/&gt;The 2 players agree before the game how long they will play, and then try to move the ball in a position where they will be able to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a turn, rolling a dice. &lt;br/&gt;The player with the ball rolls 0,2, 4 or 6 enabling him to either move his players in position or dribbling with the ball (at double cost). After movement he will have to pass the ball at least one time (kicking it away if unable to reach a teammate). And of course score, should the opportunity arise.&lt;br/&gt;The player without the ball rolls 0,2,4,6 or freekick. He will try to block the way to his goal. If he rolls a freekick, he will get the ball and start his attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
