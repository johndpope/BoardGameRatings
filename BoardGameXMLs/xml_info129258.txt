			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspire Awe! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;101 Bard Feats offers you new options so that the vision you have of your master of lore and song can easily be obtained an explored. It offers support to all of the class archetypes from the Animal Speaker to the Street Performer. It also offers the options of gaining some these feats though the versatile performance class feature and making use of your rounds of bardic performance as an expendable resource, as well as expending upon the roll of bard beyond his role as artisan but embracing its role as a master of charm and lore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brought to you by the same designer of the critically acclaimed 1001 Spells and Feats 101, this product gives you a host of new choices to create the type of bard you want to play without breaking the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
