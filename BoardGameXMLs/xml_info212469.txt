			<description>ERRATA: Players can only buy one character per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE STORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infamous innkeeper has a curious grin on his face as he says &amp;ldquo;Friends,how good of you to visit Smuggler&amp;rsquo;s Cove inn again! I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy expanding here, let me show you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He opens a hatch behind the bar and urges you to step down a ladder into what you assume must be a secret room below. As you descend the ladder the scent of spices, perfume, and other exotic wares you can&amp;rsquo;t quite place greets you. The room is as exquisite in decoration as it is in fragrance, and inside is a group of a dozen or so outlandish individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;These are some of the friends I met while sailing the seven seas&amp;rdquo;,says the infamous innkeeper. &amp;ldquo;Like myself, each of them is uniquely skilled and they&amp;rsquo;ll gladly work for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But their trade doesn&amp;rsquo;t come cheap; it will cost you pepper...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIRING CHARACTERS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters can be bought for a single unit of pepper at Smuggler&amp;rsquo;s Cove during the harbor phase. Players may always look at the stack of available characters, and when they buy a character they may choose it from the stack themselves. Players may have any number of character cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TURNING CHARACTERS FACE-DOWN:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has a unique effect but only functions as long as it is face-up. Characters can be turned face-down in the following four ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1-When you board another players&amp;rsquo; ship with your crew and win, for each cargo of the losing player you decline to steal you may choose a character of that player and turn it face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-When you bombard another players&amp;rsquo; ship with your cannons and win, for each ship segment of the losing player you decline to damage you may choose a character of that player and turn it face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-&amp;lsquo;The Artful Assassin&amp;rsquo; can be used to turn a character of another player face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4-&amp;lsquo;The Sneaky Stowaway&amp;rsquo; has to be turned face-down when it is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TURNING CHARACTERS FACE-UP&lt;br/&gt;Face-down characters can be turned face-up again in the following three ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1-In the Republic you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-In the Orient you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-At Smuggler&amp;rsquo;s Cove you may turn all your characters face-up during your harbor phase if you have &amp;lsquo;The Infamous Innkeeper&amp;rsquo; and it is face-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
