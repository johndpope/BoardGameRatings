			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbio is a game where each player's groups of cells, or pieces, attempt to surround each other. It was inspired by the immune system's ability to surround pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players, Black and White, take turns to either place or move one of their pieces adjacent to another of their pieces, on an 8x8 board. In order to make a move, the players' formations of pieces must have an open space adjacent to them. The game ends when one player can no longer make a move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these rules, &amp;quot;adjacent&amp;quot; always means &amp;quot;orthogonally adjacent&amp;quot;. A body is an adjacent set of pieces of the same colour. A foreign body is an opponent's body. A body has freedom if at least one of its pieces is adjacent to an empty square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, Black pieces are placed on b6, b7, c7, f2, g2 and g3, and White pieces are placed on b3, b2, c2, f7, g7 and g6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must first move one of their bodies and then add a piece to the board adjacent to one of their bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement of a body involves taking a piece from the body and moving it to a different square adjacent to the body (including squares adjacent to the piece itself). A body cannot move unless it has freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A body's move may land on a foreign body piece, thus removing it from the board, if that foreign body has no freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player wins if their opponent cannot add a piece next turn. This will occur if the opponent has either no remaining pieces on the board or no remaining bodies with freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement rules result in a pseudopod-like movement which may split a body into two smaller bodies (meiosis). Conversely, movement may result in two or more bodies coalescing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players should strive to surround foreign bodies and eat them away while giving their own bodies as much freedom as possible. Keeping a foreign body surrounded ties up pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cycles are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
