			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies are back again! But this time in non-traditional surroundings - under the blue sky, covered with sunshine. They fly in planes and they are trying to destroy our world, so fight - Fight them all in your tiny airplane!&lt;br/&gt;The enemies will come in waves from the top of the screen, firing their weapons against you. They will have different shapes, power and speed. Nevertheless, - you&amp;rsquo;ll have to destroy the enemy pilots at any cost.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, when destroyed, they will leave behind a power-up,  which you may be lucky enough to catch and use. Some of them will improve your weapons, (you will momentarily be able to shoot backwards, in every direction - with double fire, etc.), others will improve your health, or wealth, and the stars will give you an extra life.&lt;br/&gt;From time to time, you will even have to beat a big, (Boss), four-engine airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
