							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Freedom City Street-Level Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds supplement offers players and Gamemasters a total of ten new ready-to-play archetypes for street-level (PL 6-8) games set in Freedom City. All archetypes include the full stats and backgrounds specific to Freedom City. Although designed specifically for Freedom City street-level games the archetypes are also useful for Gamemasters in need of some NPC street-level villains or heroes (for any level game) and for players and Gamemasters of the upcoming Hero High (where they can represent incoming Freshmen); just give them some appropriate names and backgrounds and they're ready to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The archetypes inside are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Armed Citizen - not going to wait on the heroes.&lt;br/&gt;     Da Sihing - Master Lee's top student.&lt;br/&gt;     Emerging Mutant - coming into one's powers isn't easy.&lt;br/&gt;     Enduring Guardian - truly going beyond the call of duty.&lt;br/&gt;     Farsider Emigrant - protecting his adopted home.&lt;br/&gt;     Field Researcher - archaeology in the World of Freedom is unlike anything else.&lt;br/&gt;     Superpowered Orphan - who did she get her powers from?&lt;br/&gt;     Technology Geek - makes use of thematic gadgets.&lt;br/&gt;     Transformed Bystander - an innocent bystander no longer.&lt;br/&gt;     Zoom Survivor - sometimes an overdose gives you superpowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
