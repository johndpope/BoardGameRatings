			<description>From Published Sources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freedom Leagues Sourcebook presents the details the Freedom Leagues, from its start as the Dawn League, through it&amp;rsquo;s transformation into the Reformation Coalition, before their final transformation in 1243. The Freedom Leagues is now the dominant interstellar polity in the Old Expanses and Diaspora sectors with outlying settlements stretching into the corewards edges of the adjoining Solomani Rim and Alpha Crucis sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a hundred years since the Third Imperium's self destructive &amp;ldquo;Final War&amp;rdquo; ended the Freedom Leagues are the heirs of the Star Viking&amp;rsquo;s violent smash and grab legacy. But their people&amp;rsquo;s dynamic diversity and ability to change gave way to more peaceful means of rebuilding after the darkness of Virus to stand today as a beacon of light in self-determination and self government by the people&amp;rsquo;s choice of its member worlds in the New Era 1248.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of the Freedom Leagues worlds involved not just those worlds the Hivers contacted in 1193, but other worlds with similar dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United Worlds Alliance to the spinward side of Diaspora and the Sons of Craig, the Star Empire of Solee, the Trade Union of Voskl, and the Covenant of Sufren, and the Diasporan Starfarer&amp;rsquo;s Mercantile Guild all had their dreams of how to rebuild civilization after the collapse. Some in 1248 remain allies; some that were once foes are now allies; and some former allies now stand against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freedom Leagues presents maps and UWP information for two full sectors, and the coreward edges of two more of this region. Contained within as well are the vessels that made flexible the ever changing needs of the Leagues as they charted their course into the New Era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
