			<description>Dragon's Hoard is a competitive dungeon crawling game for one to four players.  The catch is that the adventurers must exit the dungeon before time runs out, lest they be engulfed in darkness and perish.  The game is designed to use a standard piecepack and as many colors of Icehouse pieces as you have (at least four colors, though).  You should also have two opaque bags or cups out of which you will draw random Icehouse pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The piecepack tiles are set up to represent the area that the dungeon will occupy, and players explore that area, using Icehouse pieces to represent the dungeon's rooms, passages, treasures, and creatures as they are discovered.  The game's pace is set by a pre-determined, fixed number of turns; however, escaping the dungeon in time may be complicated by what you find along the way....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
