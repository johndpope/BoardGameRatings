			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a Blast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your grandpa just put your life savings into buying a small farm--a few acres for growing vegetables and raising horses, a place to get away from the battle of city life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the two of your settle in on the back porch, you notice a couple of small critters scurrying across the cornfield. Then you hear squeaks and squawks coming from the barn. Horror of horrors!  Your entire farm is infested with vermin determined to drive you away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to rid your farm of vermin by shooting targets in each of three areas: the barnyard, the cornfield, and the barn. You aim and shoot your light gun to hit static and moving targets on the screen. You have up to 40 bullets per screen, so aim accurately to avoid wasting precious ammunition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to advance through each area, you must achieve a certain percentage of shooting accuracy in that area. Each time you finish one area of the farm, your scores are displayed: your score for that screen, your bonus&lt;br/&gt;bullet score based on the number of spares, and your total game score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, you'll be given one of 13 possible target-shooting ranks, from Total Dud, the lowest, to Blaster, the highest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
