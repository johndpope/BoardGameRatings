			<description>This game's components are cards related to counties in England.  Cards list the towns in that particular county and a varying number of town cards (from two to seven) that include illustrations of the town on them and include interesting facts such as main industries, attractions, and population. The game was released in four series, each covering a different region of England:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1st Series: Northern&lt;br/&gt;     2nd Series: Midland&lt;br/&gt;     3rd Series: Eastern&lt;br/&gt;     4th Series: Southern&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to complete county sets by obtaining the set of relevant town cards.  The winner is the player who completes the greatest number of sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to Happy Families, also published by John Jaques of London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
