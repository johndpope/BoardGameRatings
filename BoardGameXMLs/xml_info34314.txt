			<description>A game played in England and Spain beginning in the thirteenth century. The game was played using the board and components from a Backgammon set, however three six-sided dice were required. All fifteen checkers were used, except the starting position is different than in backgammon - each player places two checkers on their first point and thirteen checkers on the  sixth point from the opponent's side of the board. The object of the game is to be the first player to move all of your pieces off the board. However, there is a sudden death rule: if a player throws a number on a die which cannot be played, that player immediately loses. The three dice could be combined for a single move or used separately for three different moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
