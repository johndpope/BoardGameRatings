			<description>This is a popular variation of Canasta invented during its craze of the 1940's and 50's.  As the official rules from the Association of American Playing Card Manufacturers says, &amp;quot;It offers wider melding opportunities than regular Canasta played with two packs, and is preferred by many players on that account.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major differences are: &lt;br/&gt;- Three packs are used rather than two.&lt;br/&gt;- Sequences of cards are allowed as valid melds (in addition to sets of the same rank).&lt;br/&gt;- Fifteen cards are dealt, instead of 11.&lt;br/&gt;- Two cards are drawn at a time, rather than one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are dedicated Samba decks published, some of which include the cards' scoring values on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
