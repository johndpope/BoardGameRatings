							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Q*bert Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the video game of the same name, this card game has you build the highest scoring pyramid.  Players have a hand of nine cards, draw a tenth, and then play one of their cards either on their movement pile, their pyramid, or an opponent's movement pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of cards, movement cards, pyramid cards, and a few special cards. The movement cards show one or more diagonal directions on the pyramid the player's Q*bert may travel on future turns.  Once a movement direction has been chosen on a previous turn, players may add cards to build a pyramid one card per turn. Players may also play movement cards on their opponent's movement pile to send that player's Q*bert in a less productive direction, or waste another turn to change direction again.  There are also special cards which stop your opponents movement, or put Coily, Q*bert's purple snake nemesis, around an opponent's pyramid.  There are also helpful cards that either move a Q*bert to the top of the pyramid, or to allow free movement on the pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The finished pyramid is made of staggered horizontal cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play movement cards to change their direction on the pyramid until one player finishes the completed layout, and scores 100 extra points.  All players total their points on their pyramid and the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
