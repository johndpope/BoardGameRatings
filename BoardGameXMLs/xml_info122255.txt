			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the celestial justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the angels &amp;amp; demons who investigate suicides, and the Eternals, who prosecute the deceased.&lt;br/&gt; These are their stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People die every day, thousands upon thousands of them; most of them find their own way to Heaven or Hell without any intercession needed, but a few end up in limbo because of the complex circumstances surrounding their deaths. When this happens, it requires the personal intervention of an angel and a demon to look into the circumstances of the deceased&amp;rsquo;s life &amp;amp; death and present their evidence to a celestial court which will decide the matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery of Life is a game for four players, played in two phases; in the first phase, 2 players take on the roles of the angel and demon investigating a death, while the other two play witnesses of varying types as required. In the second phase, the players swap roles as the case goes to court before the higher powers to determine whether the deceased&amp;rsquo;s soul should go to Heaven or Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play, you will need a bag of coins and the &amp;lsquo;Vices&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp; &amp;lsquo;Virtues&amp;rsquo; lists (presented at the end of the rules); you might also want a pencil and paper to make notes about the evidence that is unearthed during the investigation and the subsequent findings of the Celestial Court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
