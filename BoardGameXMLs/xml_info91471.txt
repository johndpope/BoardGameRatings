							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Contiguity Deluxe</name>
									
			<description>Contiguity Deluxe is inspired by the original Contiguity, but adds other elements to make for a deeper game. In this game, druid pieces and a variable set up are added. This was added as an additional game, instead of a replacement for Contiguity due to the compact nature of the rules to Contiguity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: The object of the game is to win the game by one of two ways. One way to win is by connecting all the pieces into one orthogonally connected contiguous group of pieces (all the pieces are connected to each other vertically and/or horizontally next to each other). The other way to win is by totally surrounding an opponent's druid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Game board (all spaces 1-30. Each number space of outer ring is divided up into four spaces)&lt;br/&gt;6 red disks(pawns), 6 white disks(pawns)&lt;br/&gt;1 red figure, 1 white figure (druids)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to win, connecting and surrounding. See below for details and configurations for each of these ways to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
