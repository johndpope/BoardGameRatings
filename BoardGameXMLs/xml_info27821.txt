			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Blackshirt, The Italian Invasion of Egypt, 1940, is a game covering Italy&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Egypt, before Rommel came to rescue them from their folly. This game uses an updated, and slightly expanded, version of the Bitter Victory game system: no CRT, buckets o&amp;rsquo; dice, and cards...a totally new approach to gaming battles that can be learned in five minutes and played in 2-3 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. BSO Games, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons). No CRTs, no siree!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don't &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; the game and they can be left out, if you&amp;rsquo;re so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in Reinforcements. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards, themselves, give the players &amp;quot;Opportunities&amp;quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&amp;rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing time for Blackshirthas averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 6 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game of Blackshirt includes Rules, one sheet of Mike Lemick&amp;rsquo;s colorful cut-and-paste counters, two small decks of cards, and a snappy Pascal da Silva map (in one piece!)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available in English or French&lt;br/&gt;1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)&lt;br/&gt;1 A3 map of Lybia and Egypt - 20 colored Opportunity Cards - 140 counters (NATO Symbols) -&lt;br/&gt;The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses the Same System As:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bitter Victory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplimented by: Blood &amp; Sand published by Worthington Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
