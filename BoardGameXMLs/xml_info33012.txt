			<description>This is an all metal game made in 1947 by B.B. Products of London, England. The gameboard is a simple spinning wheel mounted with six 'horses' and a removable 'post' which marks the winning finish line. The box itself is held together with rivets and it has an orange spinner which is not removable. The game is played by betting on the number of the horse you think will win. Each horse has different odds attached to the possibility of that horse winning the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
