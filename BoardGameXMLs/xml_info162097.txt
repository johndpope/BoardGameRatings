							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Mummies</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware the Wrath of the Mummy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps one of the first things that one thinks of when considering Egyptian settings is the mummy, one of the most iconic undead creatures in all of fantasy media. These bandage-wrapped guardians are often portrayed as being imbued with great power by their transformation. But in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, their low CR and simple stat-block prevent them from living up to the myths and legends that surround them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book introduces two new kinds of non-mythic mummies: the dry mummy, which forms naturally from those who die of exposure in the desert, and has the power to drain life-giving moisture from their victims, and the pitch mummy, a foul undead animated by black tar, whose creation was considered taboo even by those who extolled the virtues of creating normal mummies. In addition to the non-mythic versions, mythic versions of each of these creatures is provided as well, making it easy to use them in a wider variety of game styles and at a significant range of CRs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
