							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hellfrost Gazetteer</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRAVEL THE LANDS OF SNOW AND ICE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A world of adventure at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement for the Hellfrost setting details the entire continent of Rassilon. From the snow-shrouded wastes of the High Winterlands to the relatively warm hills of the southern Hearthlands, this book covers every realm and major settlement, plus numerous sites of adventure. A handy reference section provides the GM with information of how to construct his own steads, villages, and towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organized with the GM&amp;rsquo;s needs in mind, each realm covers basic socio-political information, important background, the nation&amp;rsquo;s government and military, adventure hooks, as well as notes on the geography and major locales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also covered in this volume are important organizations of less than savory reputation. Now your heroes can fight the cultists of the Ashen veil, who crave immortality through necromancy, defend remote settlements from the cannibalistic Cult of the Bear God, and confront the Seekers of the Black Key, who desire nothing less than to release the forces of the Abyss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hellfrost Gazetteer contains no rules information, making it a valuable resource regardless of your favored roleplaying system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hellfrost: Gazetteer is a core book in the epic Hellfrost setting for the award-winning Savage Worlds RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
