			<description>A gripping duel between two hungry crocodiles and a bold &amp;quot;oarsman&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player steers two green crocodiles, the other player owns a red rowing boat (wooden playing pieces). Both start opposite of each other in the middle of a 4 by 8 &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; board. The boat player secretly chooses one card (printed with the values 1 to 4) to select the column on the board he wishes to move to. The crocodile player has to guess this column and place his crocodiles on two spaces to block the boat. If the crocodile player was right, the boat has to retreat one row into the direction of &amp;quot;its&amp;quot; river bank, if the other player succeeded in choosing a crocodile-free space, he moves one step to the river bank of the other player.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever reaches the opposite bank first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;No tactics involved, just blind guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was available as a big box with nicely designed components first, later followed by a small version (1988) with tiny pieces and (flimsy) cardboard river (with lots of air in the box).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
