							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">7 Days a Skeptic</name>
									
			<description>7 Days a Skeptic takes place nearly four hundred years after the last installment, by which time mankind has begun to further explore the universe. The game chronicles the story of a veteran psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Somerset, and five others on board the spaceship Mephistopheles as they face the same mysterious entity that haunted the protagonists of the first game. By this time the events of the original game have become an urban myth and no-one knows what really happened back at DeFoe Manor. 7 Days a Skeptic draws several parallels with its predecessor, using elements such as dream sequences between each day as well as using similar plot revelations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created in 2004 with the Adventure Game Studio (AGS) engine. 7 Days has received numerous awards and good reviews as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Special Edition includes author commentary, a 'blooper reel' consisting of several scenes where the characters make mistakes as if they were actors forgetting their lines, and a menu option to view the easter egg scene that normally occurs when the standard edition is played on Croshaw's birthday. A new feature not present in the normal version is that you are warned via an on-screen message if your pursuer is going to appear in a room during the chase sequences. This SE also includes the music as midi files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chzo Mythos,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
