			<description>Resume from Japanese Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The idolm@ster is an &amp;quot;idol production simulation&amp;quot; arcade game from Namco (currently Bandai Namco Games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of a newly employed pop idol manager, chooses 1&amp;ndash;3 pop idol candidates to help, and the goal of the game is to get them to be as popular as possible (number of fans). The arcade machines all formed a network and there were rankings with which to compete with players around the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game brags cel-shaded full 3D, full voiced characters, customizable outfits and music, and the game became so popular that a number of music CDs, drama CDs, merchandise, and anime were produced, in the end created the brand &amp;quot;Project im@s&amp;quot; as the developper of the project (the arcade game credited &amp;quot;AMCG (Advanced Media Creation Girls) as the developper, and their logo still sits on the Xbox360 port).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was ported to Xbox360, PSP (Idolm@ster SP), Nintendo DS (Idolm@ster Dearly Stars). Due to hardware differences and game time reasons, there are certain game play differences between the various releases, but they are essentially the same game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xbox360 port took the Special Prize in the Japan Game Awards of 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xbox port was sequelled by the spinoff &amp;quot;Idol m@ster Live for you&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;THE_IDOLM@STER,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
