							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dilmun, the Islands of Dawn: Assault of the Black Ice</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, the islands of Dilmun were a paradise. Lying at the uttermost East, they basked in the life-giving light of the Dawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the Black Ice came. No one knows where they came from. Mysterious, insectoid creatures, they spread unearthly, chilling Black Ice as they assualted the islands of Dilmun. Paradise turned to war as the human inhabitants of Dilmun fought back, rising from their peaceful ways and forming armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it was no use. The armies of Dilmun were decimated by the Black Ice. Green verdure ran red with blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are among the last of those armies. It is up to you and your companions to stop the Black Ice before the green paradise of Dilmun is turned forever into a blackened, icy waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
