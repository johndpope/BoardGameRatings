			<description>Tigers to the Front! is a module set on the Eastern Front of World War II between June 23rd and June 28th   The scenarios primarily feature the German 121st infantry division and the 502nd Heavy Panzer Battalion as they defend against attacks by the Russian 1st Shock Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;22&amp;quot;x34&amp;quot; map&lt;br/&gt;10 scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tigers to the Front! is not a complete game. Ownership of Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1 from the ASL game system is required to play this module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May 2012- Panther Line is released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This update to Tigers to the Front includes new color die-cut counters, two additional scenarios, new art, the new layout, all errata input and the usual balance tweaks. The action brings you right into the turrets of the Pzkw VI Tigers of the 502 Schwere Panzer Abteilung, 94th Grenadier Regiment, and 1st Shock Army and other hard-fighting combat elements. You receive all the vehicles used in the scenarios in camo-colored editions, plus a new set of German MMC/SMC counters in new poses and uniforms&amp;mdash;to provide a unique Eastern Front gaming experience. &lt;br/&gt;The set includes 12 scenarios, a Special Rules booklet, two sheet of color die-cut counters (296 counters in all), and an historical map of the Panther Line positions. Ownership of Beyond ValorTM is required but owners of the recent CH Berlin release &amp;quot;Final Days&amp;quot; will have all of the Gun and infantry counters needed to play the scenarios in a 'CH only' counter presentation using the counters provided in ASLComp Panther Line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
