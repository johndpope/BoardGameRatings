							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meatbot Massacre</name>
									
			<description>From the designers' website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of the few ultra-violent psychos left on the planet. You and the other un-treatable freaks squeeze into the squishy cockpits of bio-engineered war machines to face each other in televised gladiatorial combat. You are a meat jock and this is Meatbot Massacre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meatbot Massacre is a tactical game designed by Greg Stolze (Hunter: the Reckoning, Unknown Armies, GODLIKE) with Daniel Solis (PUNK, Gears &amp;amp; Spears) to provide an optimal mix of game speed, ease of use, and tactical complexity. Meatbot Massacre uses an innovative dice mechanic in which your choice of die-type determines your actions. The dice do the talking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core mechanic takes only minutes to learn, but the tactics get more intricate as your meatbot rips power-ups from enemies and devours them. In other words, you can make the game as simple or as complex as you want: When you've mastered it at its simplest, you can crank it up without learning new mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can download the game for free at: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.danielsolis.com/meatbot/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.danielsolis.com/meatbot/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
