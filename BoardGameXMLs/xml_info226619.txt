			<description>In Medievalia, the highest and imposing magic tower of all Kingdom, players are Wizards apprentices who are beginning to master the technique of invoking creatures through magic portals.&lt;br/&gt;To win the struggle for the title of Lord of the Tower, apprentices will try to invoke bigger and bigger creatures. But to become a Invoker is not an easy task, it takes a lot of training, dedication and most of all, a lot of caution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medievalia is a Card Game for 2 to 6 players. Each turn players will get closer to clean their hand by trying to summon a bigger creature then the last one played, that's it, a higher numbered card. Once the common deck is all gone, the first player to successfully clean the hand, end the turn! But watch out for the Special Turn Rules and the End Game Rules given by Medievalia Tower! The better you use those rules to your favor the less points you lose. The winner is the player with the most points after the right number of turns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
