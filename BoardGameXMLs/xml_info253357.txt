							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oldskull Dungeon Tools</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last, the culmination of years of old school dungeon design ideas, at your fingertips &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important Note: This is a spreadsheet program, with a user&amp;rsquo;s manual. This utility is designed to work with a desktop computer, with Microsoft Excel installed and also a word processor (allowing you to paste data output into an easily printable format). If you are using a non-desktop system such as a phone or tablet, you may become frustrated by your inability to use this tool to 100% of its intended functionality. Compatibility with other spreadsheet programs is unfortunately not guaranteed. Please purchase this product only if you have a system that can handle the formatted data and generators in a manner that will be helpful to you. These systems have been specifically designed to fit the intended format. Thank you for your understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you love random tables but hate page flipping and dice rolling, the Oldskull Dungeon Tools are for you. This utility set features tens of thousands of random table results, pulled from the following 8 best-selling Castle Oldskull books:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Classic Dungeon Design Guide, Books 1, 2 &amp;amp; 3 (CDDG1-3)&lt;br/&gt;    The Oldskull Dungeon Bestiary (ODB1)&lt;br/&gt;    The Book of Dungeon Traps (BDT1)&lt;br/&gt;    1,000 Rooms of Chaos, Books 1 &amp;amp; 2 (ROC1-2)&lt;br/&gt;    333 Realms of Entropy (ROE1)&lt;br/&gt;    (With a few Easter eggs included from other books as well.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find fully automated randomizers for over 100 variables, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure names&lt;br/&gt;    Unique benefactors / quest givers&lt;br/&gt;    Quest and scenario types, with twists&lt;br/&gt;    City-to-dungeon modes of travel and wilderness encounters&lt;br/&gt;    Wilderness region themes (Realms of Entropy)&lt;br/&gt;    Dungeon names and level themes&lt;br/&gt;    Surface dungeon, castle, and ruin types (surrounds)&lt;br/&gt;    Dungeon construction and builder race ideas&lt;br/&gt;    Minor artifacts (Shards of Chaos)&lt;br/&gt;    Over 2,000 unique room themes (Rooms of Chaos)&lt;br/&gt;    A full random room generator, with over 1,000 detailed room types&lt;br/&gt;    Over 1,000 descriptor and adjective themes for further differentiation&lt;br/&gt;    Details on dungeon light, air currents, lifeforms, odors, and sounds&lt;br/&gt;    Furnishings and dungeon dressing&lt;br/&gt;    Unexpected features, cave features, rogue hideout features, and arcane features&lt;br/&gt;    Very large random systems for containers, pools, and shrines&lt;br/&gt;    Dead body and implement of torture generators&lt;br/&gt;    Door, corridor, stairway, and magical gateway creators&lt;br/&gt;    Special encounter types for barracks (minions), quarters (NPCs), prisoners, and ideas for Lovecraftian Abominations&lt;br/&gt;    Over 4,000 random monster lairs, including paired encounters (e.g., dark elves and giant spiders), with more to come&lt;br/&gt;    Hundreds of dungeon trap ideas, tiered by difficulty level&lt;br/&gt;    And more, with more content to come!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make the very most of this utility, you might want to own the 8 books mentioned above, but I&amp;rsquo;ve included enough information in the accompanying user&amp;rsquo;s manual that you should also be able to figure things out on your own. (Arising questions would be most fully answered by the 2,000+ pages of referenced books, as cited in this utility&amp;rsquo;s user manual.) Additional tool sets for the Game World Generator, Oldskull Adventure Generator, etc. will be programmed if this initial dungeon-themed offering is well received.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that this is not a traditional Castle Oldskull e-book. It is a spreadsheet software utility for rapid random generation, which has been written due to dozens of requests for quicker and more integrated result creation using the existing Castle Oldskull systems. If you do not yet have a basic level of proficiency in Microsoft Excel use and word processing, this product might frustrate you &amp;hellip; but the learning curve can be overcome. These tools have been requested by power users and have been scripted for that intended audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
