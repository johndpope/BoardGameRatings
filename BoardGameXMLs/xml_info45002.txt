			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;California, Here We Come!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1868, a massive earthquake dropped California into the sea, leaving behind a shattered landscape of water-filled channels and canyons. Soon after, the stunned survivors discovered a fortune in gold and the mysterious superfuel known as ghost rock in the fractured cliffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now everyone wants a piece of the Maze - the Union, the Rebels, the Mexicans, the French, even the Chinese. It's a free-for-all over ultimate control of the remnants of California, and the stakes are the highest, for whoever controls the Maze might just control the future of the Weird West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Maze boxed set contains everything you need to know about this blasted land, its occupants, and its deadly secrets. Visit the twisted back alleys of Shan Fan, where rival triads struggle for control. Travel the channels of the Maze itself, where miners toil away, hoping for that big strike. Walk the wide streets and avenues of the City of Lost Angels, where something sinister lurks beneath the city's ordered surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's everyone for themselves in the Maze. Finding a fortune here is easier than holding on to it, and the milk of human kindness is running mighty thin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Maze boxed set is crammed full of information and adventure. It includes a 128-page sourcebook (which gives posses and Marshals the lowdown on the Maze, the City of Lost Angels, the triads, and more), a 32-page, half-sized rulebook, explaining the ancient secrets of Kung-Fu, a 32-page, half-sized adventure book, a full-color poster-sized map of the Great Maze, and two full-color ship cards for use with your Deadlands miniatures (and suitable for use with Deadlands: The Great Rail Wars).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
