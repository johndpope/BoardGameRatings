			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators are exactly what their names suggests; they excel at searching for clues, finding patterns, profiling, and dealing with those they seek. The methods used by an investigator to thoroughly examine a crime scene or a subject are varied and from early on you must choose which path you will take. Will you be the analytical type which with your keen and knowledgeable mind you can reach accurate conclusions by using logic? Perhaps you will prefer a more intuitive path in which you gather clues and come to a verdict just by observing and remaining aware of your environment? Or will you be the enigmatic investigator equipped with an unnatural charm and eldritch knowledge gets what they want be it from a person or place? The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains two files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A 21 page playbook containing over 20 moves, some gear, and two compendium classes.&lt;br/&gt;    A two page character sheet for you to record your character's stats, gear, and moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
