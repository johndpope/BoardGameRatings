							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pyromancer</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have been called by many names. Scions of the inferno, masters of flame, maniacs and firestorm fanatics, they are all descriptions following in the charred wake of a pyromancer. Pyromancers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth the mighty ability to bend the power of fire to their will, be it for good or evil. Empowered, and sometimes consumed, by their innate powers, these arcane-touched spell casters endlessly indulge in and refine their dangerous abilities, gradually learning how to harness their skills and call forth ever greater power. Some pyromancers seek to control their abilities through discipline and study, others give in to their innate magic, letting its wild nature drive their lives into a fanaticism, often, with explosive results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
