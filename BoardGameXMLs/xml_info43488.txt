							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Life of the Party</name>
									
			<description>Life of the Party was designed for Gulf Games at the request of Jeanette Vander Ark, who was looking for a game that could be played by three players in five minutes, so as to allow her to place well in the friendliest person contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is themed, then, around mingling.  Players meet with various groups each turn; at the end of the game, the player who has met with the most people wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was &amp;quot;released&amp;quot; at Gulf Games 14, in the summer of 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
