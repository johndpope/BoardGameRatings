			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although mankind has set out to explore the final frontiers, he has yet to learn to leave his darkest impulses behind him. Even as he travels with amazing technological wonders, he still finds himself embroiled in travails of his own making. No matter what cosmic marvels he may see, he still finds himself grasping for the things he cannot have, and bringing difficulties upon himself and his fellow travellers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playset was designed to allow you to enjoy the wonders of Fiasco in deep space. Although it was geared primarily towards playing in the universe of one of the most well-known space opera franchises in history, care was taken to ensure that it could be easily used for most any star-travel setting you may wish to use. Certain settings will require that some of the options during set-up be avoided, but that will not be a problem, will it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
