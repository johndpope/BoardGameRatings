			<description>&amp;ldquo;Players assume the roles of certain lesser Demigods. Each demigod begins with a small band of worshipers. Gain power by building temples and helping your population grow. Crush your enemy&amp;rsquo;s populations with acts of god and the armies of the faithful. The last remaining immortal is the one true Deity. Objective: Destroy all of your opponent armies, populations, and temples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 10x10 or 12x12 hex map filled with terrain counters placed by random draw at the start of each game. A deck of Miracle Cards provides the players with the ability to either benefit their own forces or harm enemy forces. The number of Miracle Cards a player receives each turn depends on the number of temples controlled by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
