			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the fourth issue of HARPer&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar. I hope that you enjoy the things that I have for you this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally, I work up the articles in my spare time in between issues, but for this issue, most of this has been written in just the past few weeks, as getting Harp: Cyradon finished and released as really eaten up my time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you to whom I promised specific articles, I am sorry if I could not provide them in this issue. I will try to get them done before December rolls around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you who might be interested, I will shortly be compiling the first four issues of HARPer&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar along with Hack &amp;amp; Slash, and ICE will be making the compilation available as a print product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, that is all I really have to say at the moment, so until next time, I hope you have lots of fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
