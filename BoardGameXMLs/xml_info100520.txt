							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Johnny Platform&#039;s Biscuit Romp</name>
									
			<description>Play as Johnny Platform himself in this retro-styled platformer! Do death-defying double-jumps and solve puzzles in your quest to defeat the evil robot army&amp;hellip; and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to drink plenty of coffee along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JPBR started out as a DS homebrew game, and was later ported to Xbox Live Indie Games. Development time for both versions combined was around 2-3 weeks, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little rough around the edges but still plays nicely. The Xbox version comes with 5 extra levels, plus some re-ordering of the existing levels for difficulty balancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
