Level up and choose from an assortment of devastating hand-lobbed weaponry, including (but not limited to!): rockets, machine-gun grenades, laser beam grenades, suction grenades, mines, teleporters, holo-bait and bullet shields! also including rare powerups such as Fear, Bullet Time, Invincibility and Four-Times Damage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smash through practically infinite randomly generated spaceship designs, grab *all* the loot and kill anything that moves! PSC&amp;rsquo;s unique modern-retro flavour will take you back to the classics of old and smash you back to the present with a ka-boom!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PSC draws on many classics for inspiration: Alien Breed, Cannon Fodder, Chaos Engine, Gain Ground and even Worms, Toejam and Earl and Speedball 2.
