			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps you are one of many people who are displeased with the current state of affairs in the Dungeons and Dragons community.  There are countless books, the content of many of which are boring, bland, unresearched, unbalanced, annoying, or just plain bad.  Further, you might have noticed that there is a major imbalance between the classes.  Played optimally, those classes with full spellcasting outshine those without by a substantial margin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other problems might include the fact that undead aren't handled well (you can't stake vampires), feat chains don't work like they should, or whatever.  You've thrown up your hands, as there is just too much to fix to make D&amp;amp;D worth playing.  Or is there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This massive and impressive sourcebook provides extensive comments and variant rules for almost every aspect of the game.  It is presented in modular format, allowing interested persons to utilize the resource piecemeal (if so desired).  The major goal is to add continuity of concept and play to the standard game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note &amp;quot;Version 0.3&amp;quot; retained the &amp;quot;Version 0.2&amp;quot; notation on the title page (an error; the publication date on the title page is distinct and correct).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
