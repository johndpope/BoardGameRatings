							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Your Hometown Tycoon Game</name>
									
			<description>Your Hometown Tycoon Game, published by Fun &amp;amp; Games, offers up a gaming experience similar to, or perhaps simpler than monopoly and other basic roll-and-move/property accumulation type games.  Various editions exist each of which are marketed with a local context by including pictures, properties, and business names familiar to specific city (e.g. Madison, WI).  Each edition is identifiable not only by its contents, but also by paste-ups featuring a &amp;quot;hometown&amp;quot; applied to the box front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
