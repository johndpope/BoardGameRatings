			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in the shadows of the Colonies are many evil things. Monsters stalk the night, people swear oaths to dark powers, and Agents of the Occult &amp;amp; Supernatural work to harm all. One group feared and whispered about are Witches. Though some feel that the legends of Witches and Witchcraft are nothing more than just that, legends, some know the truth. Witches live and Witches desire to harm all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonial Gothic: Witchcraft is your guide to this threat. With new rules, and expanded background, this sourcebook is ready for you to add dark threats and vile creations in your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the new rules, included is an excerpt from one of the most important works in the history of Witchcraft: King James VI Daemonologie. Written to prove that witchcraft not only existed but thrived. Written in three parts, the work is a dialogue between two figures who discuss and debate not only the existence of Witches, but also of the influence Satan has on the world. When King James became King James I of a united Scotland and England, a new edition of his work was published in 1603.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New magic, new threats, and new ideas. Do you dare study a threat to the Colonies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
