							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shakhàn Book B: Establishing a Character</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Establishing a Character presents all of the rules involving character creation for the game.  As the rules are tightly integrated with the setting, many of the rules governing race, class, and skill selection include a large amount of setting detail.  Characters select a Species (Race), and then create Characteristic Scores (Ability Scores) by one of several methods.  Primary Characteristics (Strength, Agility, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Psychic Ability, Mystic Ability, Willpower (Morale), Vision, Hearing, Sense of Smell, Taste Sense, Touch Sense, and Physical Beauty) lead to several derived Characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social Class is determined and subsequently determines starting money, equipment, contacts, and other aspects (language, literacy, etc.).  Characters also select Professions and Skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
