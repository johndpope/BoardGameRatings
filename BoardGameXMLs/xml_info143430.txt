			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Indians are on the warpath! The Chief, along with 24 braves, is out to take the garrison at the fort, or at least to stop reinforcements from entering the stockade. The General, with his 14 troopers, is trying to relieve the garrison before the flag is captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player determines the scenario through placement of boulders that provide both shelter and obstacles. Favorite scenarios may be replayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction from SoftSide Magazine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A party of Pawnee warriors, including bowmen, horsemen, and braves armed with tomahawks are creeping up on Fort Varptr, death and destruction their sole aim. The nine troopers in the garrison are becoming edgy as they wait for General Cursor and his reinforcements to arrive. The general, along with the company flag and some 14 troopers, must pick their way through a boulder-strewn plain, dispatching Indians with reckless abandon whenever the opportunity presents itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warpath is a two-player wargame of strategy and skill. The Indians are trying to capture the fort, while Trooper the troopers are trying to prevent them from doing so, primarily through attrition. Should the reinforcements carry the flag into the garrison, the Indians will become disheartened and lose. On the other hand, should the Indians make it into the fort and slaughter the garrison, the troopers lose. Who will end up in the Happy Hunting Grounds? Boot up your disk and take to the WARPATH . ..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
