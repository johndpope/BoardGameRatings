							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Winter Mage: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another one came up today, to the top of your mountain. Another seeking to best december, to defy the bite of ice. Another who received it, in full. You are Winter - cold, uncaring, and untouchable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Winter Mage is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game, and the third of my Mage Revised series. The Mage is one of the most popular playbooks I have ever written, but it has its flaws - the class is too open ended, and is generally capable of solving problems on a larger scope than any other class can really confront. My solution was to pare down the class into multiple different classes, each built around a single Spell Focus. This class is a reimagining of a Mage with Spell Focus: The Winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Winter Mage is as hard as ice, as biting as the wind, and as distant as the snowy mountaintops. With your Chill stat, you have a second pool of hit points to draw from, equal to your full Constitution score. You can spend it to reduce damage, but you can also use it to freeze things in their place, coat them in frozen armor, or make a castle of ice to live in. Your affinity for cold extends to your ability to relate to others, though - you find you cannot commit to them as much as you'd like, and you keep them at arm's length. After all, your very touch can give them frostbite, which I'm sure your enemies will regret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
