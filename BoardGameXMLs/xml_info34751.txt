			<description>From the instructions: Fetch the Ink! was devised to give an entertaining insight into printshop routine, which can be pretty hectic at times! In view of the tight delivery deadlines involved there is often a fine line between human error and superhuman achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ink is a basic essential for printing, so the winner of the game is the player whose team is the first to reach the coveted ink buckets in the centre of the board.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts off at the printing press in the colored corresponding corner and strives to reach the matching ink bucket in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two circuits linked by four cross paths and a player must try to reach the colour spectrum via the line of squares in his or her colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
