			<description>Quinquereme is a light dice game loosely connected to the navies of ancient Rome. Each player has to complete twelve  scoring categories in any order, e.g. three of a kind for numbers 1 to 6, four of a kind or a straight of consecutive numbers. Dice may be rolled up to three times per turn. Scoring may vary, dependent on how many throws a player has already used during his/her turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three, four and five of a kind are referred as Triremes, Quadriremes and Quinqueremes. Players unable to assign their result to any of the available score categories have to 'sink' one of their ships (i.e. mark zero points in a category).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all categories have been filled, points are added and the player with the most points wins. &lt;br/&gt;The game uses standard six-sided dice with roman numerals from I to VI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
