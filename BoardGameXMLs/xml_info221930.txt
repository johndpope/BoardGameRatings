			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Love and Revenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eros (PL 10) is the divine offspring of Aphrodite and Ares. After the gods were banished from Olympus, Eros attempted to use his petrifying kiss on Hecate. She was too powerful, and he was turned into a marble statue which Hecate displayed in her throneroom as a warning to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, the statue of Eros crumbled, and at the same time, a young prophet resembling the God of Passion has been seen in the Olympian Realms giving praise to the Serpent God Apophis...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
