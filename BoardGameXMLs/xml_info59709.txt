			<description>The player to the left of the dealer starts by leading a card and the other players can play any card they please as following suit doesn't apply until the stock is exhausted. The play starts from the player sitting directly left of the dealer. Any card higher than the original lead card and in the same suit will win the trick and any trump card will win unless the lead card was also a trump and valued higher. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick after first drawing the top card of the stock. The other players each draws one card from the stock. Play continues with nine cards to a hand until the stock is exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the stock is finished, each player picks up his cards used to declare melds, and continue with the final stage of the game. The final eight tricks must follow suit and a player must play a winning card if he is able. If he has no cards of the particular suit he must play a trump, if he holds any, and attempt to win the trick. The cards played to each trick are gathered by the winner and placed face-down in a pile, from which tens and aces are counted as 'Brisques' and score ten points each at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
