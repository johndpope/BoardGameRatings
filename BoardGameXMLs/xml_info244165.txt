							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hocus &amp; Pocus: Duo of shock</name>
									
			<description>Blanche Snow is worried: her 7 cousins, who work in the H&amp;eacute;ho mine, have not returned from work ... She gives you the mission to find them. Fortunately, Mamypom, his magic mirror and your fabulous creatures will help you! Play the role of Hocus and Pocus, solve puzzles, choose the right paths, collect objects and stars, for the success of your mission!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hocus &amp;amp; Pocus is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
