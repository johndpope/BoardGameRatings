			<description>The proud sequel to the hit shooter Overkill!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overkill 2 is a gun centric shooter that follows in the success of the original Overkill.&lt;br/&gt;We've taken the original gameplay and took it to a whole new level with 3D features, new game mechanics and 3D weapons. No more enemies sliding onto the screen. Overkill 2 features fully animated 3D enemies that will show no mercy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BREATH-TAKING GUN UPGRADING!&lt;br/&gt;This is hard to describe with words. Once you get the chance to tap on the amazing 3D weapon models and toy with them, you will know what we mean. There are already over 30 beautifully rendered weapons and there will be more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW GAME MECHANICS&lt;br/&gt;Our fans and players of Overkill have always asked for health and armor upgrades. At Craneballs we listen and we deliver. Introducing combat equipment and armor and health boosting tactical items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW UNITS&lt;br/&gt;Of course all units in Overkill 2 are new. Strictly speaking though, we've introduced a completely new type of unit. Be ready to face the grenadiers! You are no longer the only one who can throw stun and flash grenades. Plus there are also the high explosive grenades falling on your head. Grenades can be shot midair, which adds yet another challenge to test how quick your reflexes truly are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GRAPHICS&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is always the key component to any successful game. We know that very well. But we also know that when you add graphics that are pleasure to look at, you improve the gameplay experience by thousands. Which is exactly what we did. Attention to the very last detail is what makes our games different. Check the screens for yourselves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
