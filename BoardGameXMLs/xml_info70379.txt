							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Experiment</name>
									
			<description>You regain consciousness in a small room - a cell. You have no memory - no past, no identity, not even a name you can remember. The door slides open, revealing a corridor. THE EXPERIMENT has begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cooperative, competitive and challenging experiment in psychology, trust, betrayal and survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are your friends?&lt;br/&gt;Who are your enemies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out as your work with and against other Subjects to find the exit and escape...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the experiment is to be the last player surviving or to complete a set of exit cards either by themselves or in groups to escape your captivity. Players do this by taking turns drawing cards and collecting weapons, defensive cards, action cards, or encounters which allow player to form groups. Groups can be done for mutual benefit or to attack and remove players. Actions will allow players to escape groups and/or attack. Game play is very fast as players start with no cards and take turns drawing one card from the deck. The game is suitable for 2 players, but gets better with 4 or more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/the-experiment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/the-experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
