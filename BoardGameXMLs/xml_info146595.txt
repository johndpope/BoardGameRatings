			<description>WarFields is a two player fantasy card game of warriors, summoners, beasts and undead. You'll build an army of the unique characters and progress across fields to meet your opponent head on. Break down your opponent's army and take down your opponent&amp;rsquo;s king before he takes out yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has four stages: Currency Stage, Build Stage, Move Stage, and Attack Stage. During the Currency Stage, you collect gold from workers and selling cards. Gold drives the game and is use throughout each turn. During the Build Stage, you use gold to add characters to your army or use powerful scrolls. During the Move Stage, you may choose to move your army closer to your opponent or farther away. Lastly during the Attack Stage, you attack you opponent's army with your unique army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to break through your opponent's army and take out their King. The first player to take out the opponent's King is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
