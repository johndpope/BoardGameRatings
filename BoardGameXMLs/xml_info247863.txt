			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dad dad! Somebody's lying there! There, at the water's edge! Do you think he's dead? See! See! Right there! He's right there!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ssh! Relax Dieter. You're completely ballistic. Hurry up and moor the boat, boy. We'll see if he's alive or not.  Maybe he has something of value...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fisherman and his son walked quickly toward the waterline.  A lot of beach trash washed up here.  Especially now, with the fall storms.  The storms that thrashed the small fishing villages until they seemed little more than ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hmm... he looks like a fine gentleman.  No fisherman. If Sigmar be with us, perhaps he'll have some gold on him.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dad! I think he's alive... see, he's moving! Oh! He looks strange... look at the clothes, and he's got pointy ears! Do you think he's a mutant? Or a chaos demon?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ssh, quiet! Dieter, run and fetch the constable.  Now, Dieter!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fisherman stood stiffly and stared at the distant figure.  His brow furrowed in recognition.  He paled and his hands began to shake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Manann grant us mercy. It's one of them...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
