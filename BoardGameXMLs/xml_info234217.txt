			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OMEGA File consists of a 22-page digest-sized booklet and five pull-out sheets. Four of the pull-outs are hex-grid maps. The fifth pull-out is a &amp;quot;corrigia and addentia&amp;quot; sheet that updates aspects of the adventure and adds to the original Merc - D.O.W. firing rules. The booklet includes stats for 36 NPC's and descriptions for dozens of rooms and locations involved in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The booklet states the adventure was designed (for?) and first used at Gencon South, Jacksonville Beach, 5-7 February 1982.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMEGA FILE. What is that? It is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O--Offensive&lt;br/&gt;M--Military&lt;br/&gt;E--Espionage&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;G--Guerilla&lt;br/&gt;A--Assault&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a governmental agency you will not find, one much more well-hidden than the CIA, or NSA, or ASI (Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency or Army Security and Intelligence). It recruits men from all walks of life and with all sorts of skills, but they all possess one common quality: They are all prior service military men from our government or another, and they are all loyal--to their paymaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OMEGA File is a document control system that insures the security of all cases and files that are in the &amp;quot;OPEN&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;UNSOLVED&amp;quot; drawers of intelligence agencies. These files are at their final destination: Here they will be solved or simply left to lie forgotten, but for this is the last extreme, the final bureau of a buracracy (sic), the ultimate resting place or solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission: Return THEODOR STEUBEN to custody of friendly forces to stand trial for offenses in violation of Geneva Convention and acts subversive to the peace and welfare of Africa by direct violation of the status quo. If possible, bring him back alive; if not, sanction him with extreme prejudice as a last resort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present Theodor Steuben is in the interior of &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; country at a secret training base on the shores of Lake Tekl'lii. The area is approachable by land, air or across the waters of the lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
