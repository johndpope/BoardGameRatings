			<description>In the near future, Psionics are among us. Their evil thoughts pulsate across time and space corrupting even the strongest minds. Players assume the role of Agent Cain, a powerful Psionic working for an elite government agency. As Cain, you strive for mastery of innate psychic &amp;ldquo;Talents&amp;rdquo; such as the ability to shoot fireballs or the power to summon hideous creatures. Using these &amp;ldquo;Talents&amp;rdquo; depletes both Health and Sanity, so players must walk a fine line to ensure that they don't lose their minds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
