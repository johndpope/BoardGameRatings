			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the planets, before the stars&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Before the galaxies, before the universe&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Before time began&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;Incomprehensibly powerful sentiences sought to dominate the preconceptual chaos of their existence and annihilate those that opposed their will.&lt;br/&gt;To the victor, the ultimate prize: creation itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Elementa, each player takes the role of one of these sentiences, aiming to defeat their opponent to ensure they are free to shape a universe to their own design. This is done by influencing the balance of the six elements in two distinct, but inextricably linked, theatres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first, representing the consciousnesses in conflict, enables players to infuse the elements with their raw power that can then be consumed, or nurtured, to determine the how the second proceeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That second environment is the domain of summoned, customised proxies - the elementals. Their power is governed by the first theatre and can be directly manipulated by players&amp;rsquo; evocations. Conflict between elementals may encourage one side to end hostilities and rethink their strategy in a new round, but the battle of wills is not infinite and it is only the player who succeeds at the pre-defined end of the contest that is victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
