			<description>It's the mid-1960s, and the Space Race is heating up. You are the launch commander of a mission to land on the Moon and, eventually, to colonize it. But your opponents want to plant their flags there first and claim the high ground as their own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns trying to &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot; a small pyramid into a Treehouse tube that is resting on its side. Each successful &amp;quot;landing&amp;quot; earns points for the launching player. The game ends when a player establishes a &amp;quot;colony&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cracks&amp;quot; the Moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moon Shot is a game of dexterous strategy for any number of players.  Full rules can be found on the Icehouse Games Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Moon_Shot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Moon_Shot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
