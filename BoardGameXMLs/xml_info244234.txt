			<description>This game is a reimplementation of the earlier version of Klunker.  Like the original, it shares features with the designer's earlier game, Bohnanza.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Klunker, players are collecting jewelry (instead of planting beans).  Instead of trading cards with each other, players put some of their jewels up for sale to the other players.  In doing so, a player hopes to attract buyers by selling jewels their opponents might want - along with others that they might rather not get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new version differs from the original in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A different mix of jewelry cards.&lt;br/&gt;     All jewel types are treated equally (in the original, converting necklaces to money was advantageous).&lt;br/&gt;     With 5 players, players start with more money but pay a per-round &amp;quot;luxury tax.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;     6-player rules are added in which players start with even more money but pay a higher tax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
