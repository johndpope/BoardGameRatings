			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the collapse of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the early 1900s, several splinter occult groups formed in London. One was the Lodge of the Pentagram, which held its meetings and ceremonies in property at Mortlake owned by the Elizabethan sorcerer Dr. John Dee. In 1915, one member of the Lodge, Ernest Smith, murdered six children to hide himself from a vengeful extradimensional horror. The Lodge was investigated by the police, and forced to disband for several years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario typically is distributed as a ZIP archive containing eleven RTF documents and seven COC scripted character documents.  Ten of the RTF documents are brief print-and-play components.  The main scenario file is fifteen pages in length.  The scenario was created for, and presented at, WarpCon X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is a loose sequel to Serene and Primal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
