							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</name>
									
			<description>In 1948, Parker Brothers indulged in a slight bit of overproduction when it introduced its version of the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer game. Two to four players compete at this spin-and-move race to the chimney.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two editions to this game. One is a standard long-box game with a traditional foldout game board, featuring flat plastic reindeer on wooden stands. The other edition features a 3-D rooftop game board that sits atop the game box, with holes in the roof to insert the plastic reindeer for movement. Both editions include a wooden nose for Rudolph to help a player in moving through the cloud spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3-D version also came with a Santa Claus sack of five jingle bells so that players could mark how many times they had won. I do not recall if the standard edition came with this sack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
