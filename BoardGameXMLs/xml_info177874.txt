			<description>Welcome to the complex world of plants. A place where thriving depends on strategy, tactics and maybe a tiny bit of luck .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plants compete to be the most successful wild plant. Players will be deciding how to use their resources to best support their plants'&lt;br/&gt;success in this game's environment. Conflict of Plants at its core is both an action selection and an area control game, but with a twist. The environment does not always favor the most abundant species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round excluding the first, the player with the fewest points swaps two on-map Non-White Tokens with those of the randomly-chosen icons. Each player, in turn order, sends their cubes to tiles have an icon that matches the icon played to their Player mat. Players then in turn perform one action each three times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player then places one Brown Token onto an empty corner of a tile in the map again matching an icon to what was played on their Player Mat. The map is then examined in order to award points and Brown Tokens. The players then balance each region by removing cubes from each tile until the number of Player Cubes in total is equal to or less than the region&amp;rsquo;s number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the players clean up their Player Mats to prepare for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
