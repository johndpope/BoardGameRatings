							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ipcress File</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;The IPCRESS File,&amp;rdquo; a board game issued in 1966 by Milton Bradley. Game No. 4643.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A espionage game modeled after the popular 1965 British espionage film &lt;br/&gt;starring Michael Caine as &amp;ldquo;Harry Palmer,&amp;rdquo; and Len Deighton&amp;rsquo;s 1962 novel, &amp;ldquo;The IPCRESS File.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Other actors and scenes are shown in a small collage.  &lt;br/&gt;The gameboard has a simple track and four well-drawn illustration scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movie was aimed at an adult audience, perhaps reaching some teenagers. &lt;br/&gt;The game is marked as 'from 10 to adult'. &lt;br/&gt;The game is incredibly simple and lacking in sustained interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a chasing game. &lt;br/&gt;Up to four players move around a board representative of scenes from the film. &lt;br/&gt;Players are given spy assignments, but one player secretly becomes a double agent. &lt;br/&gt;Those playing are required to solve their assignments so that they can identify the double agent. &lt;br/&gt;Any player who knows who the double agent is is then 'licensed to kill' the double agent and thereby win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a little dull; but as a marketing tie-in and ephemeral item, it has interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;content: &lt;br/&gt;1 board&lt;br/&gt;12 Classified cards&lt;br/&gt;12 Confidential cards&lt;br/&gt;four agent pawns consisting of a cardboard panel and plastic base &lt;br/&gt;two red-and-gold dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
