			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Setting for any game system and a mini-RPG, with stats for -U- the Game of Stories!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the universe, there are certain concepts that are eternal such as death, fire, hope, kindness, etc.. From the moment mankind put names to things, we began comparing them against each other. In these comparisons, we discovered that some things or people were the most powerful representative, or Epitomes, of these universal concepts. These Epitomes were granted powers over those concepts and had the ability to do amazing things with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1,000 AD, the Epitome of chaos found a way to disrupt the order of the universe, and suddenly random people were chosen to become Epitomes of the universal concepts. As they died, their power was transitioned to others, and the cycle has continued since then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this book, you'll find a complete Setting about the world of Epitomes and a customized copy of -U- Essentials which gives you everything (except 3 six-sided die) to begin playing in this strange parallel of our own world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
