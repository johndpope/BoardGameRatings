			<description>Malle Getallen (Crazy Numbers) is a Quartett with math exercises. The game is played with deck of cards, which is divided into sets of four cards, each with its own symbol. On each card, there is a math exercise (add or substract from 0 to 20).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with six cards. On his turn, a player may ask another player for a card with a specific symbol. If that player has that card, he reads the exercise out load. If the asking player gives the correct answer, he gains the card, and gets to go again. If he does not give the correct answer, or if the other player does not have the card that was asked for, the asking player gains the card from the deck, and his turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has collected a complete set of four cards, he sets them aside and gains one point. The game ends when all sets have been set aside; the player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
