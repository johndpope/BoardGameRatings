			<description>&amp;quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army (デビルサマナー 葛葉ライドウ対超力兵団, Debiru Samanā: Kuzunoha Raidō tai Chōriki Heidan, literally &amp;quot;Raidō Kuzunoha vs. The Super-Powered Army Corps&amp;quot;) is an action role-playing game in the Megami Tensei franchise published by Atlus for the PlayStation 2 in 2006. It differs from the two previous Devil Summoner titles (and most MegaTen games in general) in having real-time battles and a named protagonist and is first in the entire franchise to be set in the past - specifically the 1920s, wherein it deals with historical figures such as Grigori Rasputin in addition to the MegaTen series' traditional use of real-world mythological figures. Though somewhat criticised for being the shortest of recent Shin Megami Tensei games, it generally received favourable responses from players and reviewers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On July 30, 2008, it was announced that there would be a sequel titled Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon. Demon conversations make a comeback as well as Raidou being able to summon two demons simultaneously in battle. The limited edition will be packaged with a new version of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne titled Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax Chronicle Edition in which Raidou will appear. The game was released in Japan on October 23, 2008 and in North America on May 12, 2009.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Devil_Summoner:_Raidou_Kuzunoha_vs._The_Soulless_Army,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
