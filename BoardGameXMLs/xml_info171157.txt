							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In His Name / The Last Hallowed Place (HARP)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In His Name&lt;br/&gt;Pages: 159&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At His word, the world does tremble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veteran game designer Robert J Defendi brings you a world of darkness and danger, where a monolithic church has split into dozens of quarreling factions and holy war looms like a shadow. Here, strength and brutality win the day and only those with the most faith, honor, and courage can stand against the terrible tyranny of those who would enslave everyone of a different belief, a different philosophy, a different race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worse, it is a world infected by the very fabric of Hell itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Mortal Realm, God's word might arrive distant and thin, but it comes amplified through the throats of countless priests. It is written in the books of a legion of druids. It pounds in the conquering hooves of armies, and shines in the swords of zealots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word of God is still heard, and the world still trembles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Hallowed Place (Part 5 in The Moving Shadow)&lt;br/&gt;Pages: 46&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure that spans ten thousand years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the way the world ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party has failed. Morthorn trapped them in an Ulcer and while they escaped, now his trail has long gone cold. Can our heroes find and stop the fallen angel before he brings about his plan and starts the end of the world?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 15th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires the world's most popular roleplaying game to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
