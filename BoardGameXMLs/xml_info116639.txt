			<description>A promotional game from Quaker Oats, probably in the 1920's. Simple spin and move game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First you have to make a spinner yourself. Having done that, you have to spin a 1 before you can start moving along the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game at Home and, to win, you must advance to the Grocery Store. Along the way you must follow instructions. They are of the variety, 'Forget honey, go back to the start', that sort of thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, as usual in these basic games, you need to spin an exact number to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
