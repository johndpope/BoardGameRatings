			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;An Artifact for Dr. Storn? blends diplomacy and board-movement in an original way, creating an interstellar treasure hunt that appeals to both a childlike desire to collect nifty artifacts and a mature desire for strategy. Players are agents sent by different planetary governments to collect famous artifacts. Since some artifacts cannot be picked up unless you are carrying others, players constantly trade and steal artifacts. How should you balance trading for mutual benefit with hindering your opponents' progress? How can you time your interplanetary travel so you are carrying or steal the artifacts you need the moment you return to your home world? Should you abandon your main quest and search for the mysterious Book of Knowledge, that if correctly handled will allow a second player to claim victory?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
