			<description>The players have to move their four cubes from the diagonaly opposite corner to the nest of their color. Movement to a neighboring space is achieved by tilting the cube by 90 degree, thereby changing the Image on the top of the cube. The movement can be continued in a straight line as Long as thre are unoccupied spaces. If two cubes are sitting next to or pass each other, the stronger image kills the weeker one (hunter - Fox - weasel - chicken - frog - gnat). The strongest Image is the hunter but he can be killed by the weakest, which is the gnat. Killed cubes are removed from the game. Cubes that have entered their own nest must show the correct animal on top to be saved. A saved animal counts 3 points and the cubes on the board of the last player count 2 points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
