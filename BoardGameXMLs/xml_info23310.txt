			<description>With the exception of the Bible itself no ministry tool in the world compares to the Bible Trading Card Game. The Bible TCG is a one of a kind, STRATEGIC, interactive card game, devoted exclusively to God's word and provides players a Biblical lesson/experience unlike any other. Throughout the game, players discover the biblical lands, recreate biblical events like the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ, the missionary journeys of Paul, the baptism of the Ethiopian treasurer and many, many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card in the Bible TCG features one or more biblical verses. Players who choose to memorize the verses in their play decks will quickly discover they have a major advantage for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick up a Bible TCG deck today; then Pray,Read,Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
