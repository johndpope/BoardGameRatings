			<description>An 18 hole golf game featuring &amp;quot;The Best Of Dye&amp;quot;. This game is played on actually designed holes in the U.S. and Japan.  Fast moving, sometimes frustrating, but always fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each hole, select the club that will move you down the fairway and closest to the flag.  Each spin is considered one stroke.  As some clubs move you further than others, be sure to select your clubs wisely.  The LOWEST SCORE WINS the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
