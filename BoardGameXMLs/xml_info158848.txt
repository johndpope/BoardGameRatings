			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was intolerable, Earthpeople were paranoid. Every time a benevolent race from a nearby star system extended a tentative hand of friendship, Earth took it as an aggressive gesture and sent a fighting force to obliterate the whole lot of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the rest of the Universe was feeling sorely depleted and very angry. The time had come to do something. So, the remaining races of the Universe selected a single being to pilot a miniscule craft to Earth, destroy all Earth's command ships, annihilate their fighter and refuelling craft, erradicate every last Earthling, and above all have a jolly good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are this being, in this last, most ridiculously destructive battle of them all. You must singlehandedly put a stop to this star farce and save the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game designed and programmed by Laurent No&amp;eacute;l.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
