							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Death Town</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Death Town is a solo role playing game in the vein of the Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf books from the 80's. In it you take the role of possibly the last survivor of a zombie outbreak from the day before in Anytown, USA. As with all zombie outbreaks, it started slowly with one incident then quickly spread throughout the town. Not taking any chances with the horrors going on outside, you locked yourself in the basement to wait the nightmare out. With great haste you board up your basement window and barricade the door. You huddle in a dark corner, covered with a blanket, and listen to the screams of your neighbors and friends as you fall asleep...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
