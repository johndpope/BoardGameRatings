							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moltke-class Cruiser</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the third entry in our newest line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moltke-class cruiser is the largest ship in the Hub Federation navy and is currently the flagship of that force.  The ship is designed to destroy other large warships and act as a command ship for squadrons assigned to attack the fleets of other worlds if the need arises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moltke is an excellent ship for active navy campaigns, a perfect location for a diplomatic conference, a fearsome opponent or the ultimate warship to save the characters' lives if they are in peril.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 3: Moltke comes complete with beautiful views of the HFS Moltke and her sister ships: HFS Kitchener, HFS Wellington, and HFS Blucher.   The Moltke-class ship is shown with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy, and fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 3: Moltke also features deckplans for the ship's boat, the ship's fast launch and the Mercury-class fast packet boat as well as several NPCs and a wealth of adventure hooks!  Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, the Moltke could easily be used in any Traveller setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes our Hub Federation Marines recruiting poster by artist Bradley Warnes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
