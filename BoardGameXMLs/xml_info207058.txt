							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hellion</name>
									
			<description>It is a fusion of survival and space simulation genres that pits players against the deadly environment and one another. Survive the hard vacuum, extreme temperatures, deadly radiation and scavenge for basic resources like air, water, food and other items necessary for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The desolate wasteland of Hellion hides many secrets, but to uncover them you will need to leave the safety of your station. The small shuttle you have is not up to the task and if you are to have any chance of success you will need a real ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
