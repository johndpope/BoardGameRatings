			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A story-game about a monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;And even as its claws sunk into a man&amp;rsquo;s shoulders, even as it tore through yet another one of my friends, I looked at its red-rimmed eyes and just had to wonder: had it just been crying?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you are an adventurer&lt;br/&gt;You have been slaying the evils of the world for countless years. You&amp;rsquo;ve slain goblins and orcs before, and seen their green blood etched across the rocky ground. You&amp;rsquo;ve slain small dragons, and dodged their last breath of fire. You&amp;rsquo;ve slain enemies, and once or twice you&amp;rsquo;ve slain friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe you haven&amp;rsquo;t, and you are new to the world of heroism. Maybe your sword is still virgin steel, and you&amp;rsquo;ve never witnessed the agony of bloodshed. Maybe you are still hot for your first real hunt. Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t really know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing out here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless of your past, you are here now. You have been hired by the mayor of Joshuan to rid the forests of a deadly beast that has terrorized the town for months. You have been hired to kill a ferocious beast that you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of before. An owlbear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t live in Joshuan&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a charming community, it really is. But its important to always keep this in mind: You do not live in Joshuan, and the people you are adventuring with are not your friends. You have been assigned to an adventuring party with a bunch of strangers. These people are do-gooders, paid mercenaries, and militia members. You don&amp;rsquo;t know if they have families or live alone; whether they have jobs or are transient bums; whether they are poor or have overflowing coffers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;you aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to admit that to yourself every once in a while. Sometimes you do the wrong thing. When you&amp;rsquo;re a powerful, broad-shouldered warrior, a single mistake can leave quite a lot of impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to keep that in the back of your mind: You&amp;rsquo;ve done wrong before, and you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the bloodshed that can result. You don&amp;rsquo;t like doing the wrong thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
