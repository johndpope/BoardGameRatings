			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This storytelling game is constructed around a simple card game played with custom cards.  The game is distributed as a ZIP archive.  The game cards are distributed with the text game file as twenty separate PNG files (for print-and-play), and four PDN template files (so players can create their own cards, if desired).  Play proceeds in turns, as is typical in card games, and is completed in three rounds, with each round having a different game focus.  Each round takes about four or five minutes for each player.  Characters have shared goals and individual goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
