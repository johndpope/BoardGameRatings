							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Thumb</name>
									
			<description>This is a game meant for young children.  It consists of a board, some tiny poker-like chips, comical prosthetic thumbs, and plastic hammers.  The board is used to move the game along.  The object is to use your oversized thumb to trap the chips with your thumb and get them to your side of the board before your opponents whack the end of your thumb with the hammer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's sort of like a two handed version of Hungry, Hungry Hippos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two children can play, but it is best for four kids.  Generally, play devolves from using the board to just whacking thumbs and trying to capture chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
