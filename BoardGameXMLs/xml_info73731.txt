							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sneak&#039;s War</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;It has been two years since the cybernetic Toracs invaded. In two days they destroyed human civilization- breaking the strongest fronts of resistance and herding entire populations into their conversion centers to make us into more of them. All that remains of the human race now are the survivors who escaped through the cracks of mankind&amp;rsquo;s ruined civilization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there may yet be hope. Hidden away in the ruins of mankind are the keys to possible salvation. Experimental technologies, hidden superweapons, unexpectedly useful devices are all scattered across the globe. The only chance for the human survivors to evict the Toracs from their world is to find these devices and use them&amp;hellip; before the last scraps of humanity are wiped from the face of the Earth!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a one-to-four player hex and counter game set in the near future (2050 or so) where earth has been invaded by the &amp;quot;Toracs&amp;quot;. Initially the humans are weak- they cannot out run the Toracs and they certainly can't hope to fight them. Their only hope is to exploit the dim-witted intelligences of their converted brothers and sisters to evade total destruction. Only through surviving the Torac reactions to scavenge the ruins of their destroyed civilization can they hope to evict the invaders. They might find weapons, faster transportation, or even leftover superweapons from the 20th century in the form of nuclear devices. The best chance humanity has at removing the Torac (and winning the game) is to scavenge the ruins across the globe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, should the Torac annihilate the human presence on Earth, then their intention to convert Earth into their new homeworld will succeed unabated. For the survival of the human race, the Torac must be defeated!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an entry for the Sneaky Sci-Fi game contest.Until the files are approved, you can get the game on my deviantart account: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://norsehound.deviantart.com/#/d2sulo7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://norsehound.deviantart.com/#/d2sulo7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
