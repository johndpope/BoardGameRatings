							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Worlds Apart Suppliers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the more common GM duties in Worlds Apart is creating the inventory of suppliers from which the PCs buy or sell. Worlds Apart Suppliers exists to make that process as fast as possible, as well as to cover instances when the players surprise you by suddenly deciding to do some trading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you&amp;rsquo;ll find 36 different trade packages for standard goods and each island type. Using these packages, you can instantly determine what an individual supplier has available with a two rolls as opposed to several. This will speed play and allow you to do more with less planning. Additionally, three d66 tables list names, as well as the most prominent personal characteristic of the supplier, in case you need a quick NPC sketch if the players are interested in more than just buying goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
