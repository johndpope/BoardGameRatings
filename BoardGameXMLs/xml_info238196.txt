							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Obsidian Oni</name>
									
			<description>Obsidian Oni are fearsome creatures to behold. Their skin is the shimmering black obsidian of their namesake, and they wield heavy, spiked clubs in combat. It is said that they are children of the volcano; they erupted into the world amidst flames and smoke. And where they walk, the flames of battle follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who know the old magics of the Three Kingdoms can call the Obsidian Oni into service, binding them through ritual and sacrifice to a singular purpose. Those who are weak willed are sometimes consumed by the very Oni they seek to call. But if the need is great enough, they are worth the risk for their prowess in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obsidian Oni march across the battlefield, shrugging off arrows and calling down flames from the heavens on those who stand in their way. Men flee before them, and death is left in their wake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten Thunders Box Set, containing three 32mm 'heroic' scale miniatures made of high quality plastic. Will require some preparation and assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Obsidian Oni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stat Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Obsidian Oni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
