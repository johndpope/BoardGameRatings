			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the end of the 20th century, a group of people with super human powers (Fukatsu) has risen, engaging into battles to rule the world. In this game of power and conquest, terminate your opponents and gain enough glory points to become the master of the new world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player takes turn in Clockwise order, until one player successfully gathers 16 stars(points). On a player's turn, he takes one of the two options: (a) move his pawn one space and gather power cubes, or (b) consume power cubes to damage any targeted opposing player, which will collect stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I) MOVING AND COLLECTING POWER. The player MUST move one space in any of the SIX directions, and if landing on a space with a power cube, the player has three options: (a) collect 3 power cubes of the different color, (b) collect 2 power cubes of same color, (c) collect 1 power cube of any color. If the player lands on a EMPTY space, he MUST refills power cubes from the power-line by dropping ONE power cube into every empty space on the board, from TOP to BOTTOM and from LEFT to RIGHT. Optionally, before moving his pawn, the player can discard one power cube of any color in his possession, to JUMP ONE SPACE AHEAD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;II) ATTACKING and EARNING STARS. The player attacks by discarding a number of power cubes equivalent in color to another players STAR CARDS, beginning with CARD-STAR1. He may combine his power cubes together with POWER TECHNIQUES he has earned during the course of the game. If the player successfully fulfill the power cubes matching an opponent's STAR CARD, he discards those matching power cubes and the opponent will take DAMAGE based on the number of STARS in the card. A damage is taken by discarding power cubes of ANY COLOR from any of the 3 EXPERIENCE METER in the PLAYER BOARD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JUST BEFORE (I) or (II) , the player has the option to UPGRADE any of his 3 EXPERIENCE METER on his player board. To do so, he places any number of IDENTICAL COLOR CUBES into a METER of SIMILAR COLOR. If the METER wishing to upgrade is EMPTY, then any color can be added. The EXPERIENCE METER will allow the player to Learn up to 3 POWER TECHNIQUES, as well as giving bonus actions if reaching 100%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
