			<description>What Just Happened is a competitive/cooperative storytelling game, similar to Cards Against Humanity, for 3-6 players that takes 30-45 minutes to play. Each player picks a character, plays an item on a character, and then tells the story that they feel transpired using the cards in play. The catch? You only have 60 seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a points value that is based on how difficult the card is to use in a story with a little bias towards cards children can use. As each card is used, you &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot; it to denote that you have used that card in your story. At the end of your story you add up all the cards that you used correctly. The person with the most points each round wins the round. After you win 3 rounds you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
