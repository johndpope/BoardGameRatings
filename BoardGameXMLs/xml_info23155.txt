							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder on the Moon!</name>
									
			<description>The year is 2069 and we find ourselves on the Moon at the Honey-Lunar Hotel. The staff was preparing for one of the biggest weddings in the galaxy. Captain Quirk of the Starship, Booby-prize and Dr. Iownya Hypothesis, commander of Space Station #99 and formulator of the gravity enhancing drug, VIAGRAvity&amp;quot;, were to be married at midnight. This illustrious affair was to be witnessed by guests representing every planet of the solar system and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, but alas, just as the organ began piping out the wedding march, a scream was heard from the bride's dressing room. It appeared that the lovely Doctor had been vaporized and all that was left was her limp wedding gown strewn about the floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come join the guests - Stashyia Sputnik, Russian cosmonaut; Mr. Spook, Vulture warrior; Darth Viper, the &amp;quot;Galactical Exterminator&amp;quot;; R2DoubleD2, a well endowed android, Aurora Hoary Alice, member of the Moon's oldest profession and Dr. Pickacard, shady used flying saucer salesman - to name a few and help decipher who killed Iownya.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
