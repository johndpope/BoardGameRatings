							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">JAG-GER The Strategy Jigsaw Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;JAG-GER is the first true family game in years.  Children compete equally with adults.  The puzzles are hexagonal in shape and fit on a tray board.  The difficulty level of each board is determined by two factors: the number of pieces in a puzzle - 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 - and the difficulty of the puzzle picture - Levels 1-5, 5 being the most difficult.  Refill puzzles are available for all ages and skill levels.  With every purchase of a refill, JAG-GER is a new game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents listed as 54 score cards, 2 game boards. 2 puzzles (each are 100 pieces).  The box bottom of mine shows a beautiful mountain lake photo with flowers in the foreground and a photo of a Germanic/medieval looking building beside a canal with a covered bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
