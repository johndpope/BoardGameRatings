			<description>The players are students in an adult education course such as might be offered at the Learning Annex. They will learn how investments are affected by various political, environmental, world, and historical events. This board game is designed to be both entertaining and educational.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process of playing the game is more important than the actual monetary gain or loss at the end of the game. The player will look at the events and make predictions based on possible outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given various world events and investment climates, a player will be able to make profitable investment decisions as determined by his/her earnings at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most chips at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a board&lt;br/&gt;     Four pieces of different colors&lt;br/&gt;     One die with six sides.&lt;br/&gt;     Colored chips worth the following: 40 Blues, $10,000; 20 Reds, $5,000; 20 Greens, $1,000; and 20 Yellows, $100. &lt;br/&gt;     Event cards that provide two investment variables&lt;br/&gt;     An Investment Results sheet to determine how each player's investments faired.
