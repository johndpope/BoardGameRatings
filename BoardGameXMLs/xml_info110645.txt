			<description>The New Wireless Card Game - Quickly teaches you to read Morse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an older person's Snap variant. During the game you need to alike images and you need to know the Morse Code name for the letter (if that letter has a name identity). I think it probably dates from the 20's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who ends up with all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name was not made up by the publisher. It sounds as if it comes from a children's nursery rhyme, but it is the &amp;quot;conventional verbal representation of the dots and dashes of the Morse code&amp;quot; according to the OED. Troops were apparently taught to recognise whether a dot or a dash was being transmitted by the sound of the machine. A dot made an 'iddy' sound and a dash sounded like 'umpty'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
