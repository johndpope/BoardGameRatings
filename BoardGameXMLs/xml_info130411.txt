			<description>Over several centuries, four medieval kingdoms disputed the conquest of the Sagario castle, fighting in successive medieval battles. The cycle began every time a kingdom beat the other remaining three in a battle. This winning kingdom enjoyed only a short stay in the castle before the neighboring kingdoms attacked once again. This endless cycle repeated itself constantly &amp;mdash; until one day a monk known in the four kingdoms for his wisdom and pursuit of peace, while observing this absurd dynamic of endless battles, decided to end them by creating a board game with the following decree: &amp;quot;The kingdom that manages to capture all the knights of the neighboring kingdoms will be the owner of the Sagario.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sagario is played on a cross-form board made up of 212 boxes. The Sagario castle is placed in the center of the board game and is surrounded by four towers, which are the landmarks that delimit the territories of the four kingdoms: Sazio, Galia, Risko, and Orbis. Each of these kingdoms has an army of five soldiers and four knights as well as four assault towers to siege the castle. Each player must try to capture all the knights of the bordering kingdoms, at which point he now owns the castle and wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
