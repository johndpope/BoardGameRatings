			<description>Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There seems to be a lot going on down on the farm. The farmer accidentally left the barn door open and now the animals are all loose. With great difficulty he's managed to catch them all but now the barn is in uproar. Can you help sort the animals?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting memory game with lots of animals that can also be played with as a farm set once the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players mix up the 32 wooden animals (4 each of 8 different animals) and place them into the 8 barns. Players then take turns trying to find pairs of the animals, until all of the animals are matched. The player who found the most pairs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
