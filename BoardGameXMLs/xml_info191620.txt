							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brick &amp; Mortar: Last of the Independents</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brick &amp;amp; Mortar: Last of the Independents presents four pre-generated characters (two of which are required in every game; two of which are optional) and the framework of a scenario, though the details of the scenario are determined by the players.  The game does not use a game master.  Play proceeds in a formalized manner with each character having distinct skills, goals, and tendencies.  While much of the game is pre-determined by the rules, the players also can exercise substantive input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
