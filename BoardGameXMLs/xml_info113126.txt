							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Template: Comic Force Infused</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chosen agents of ancient alien races, mythological gods, or nigh-omnipotent cosmic entities; mighty champions gone wrong who -literally, in some cases sacrificed their souls to obtain still greater powers; mortal heroes transformed by contact with irresistible, unearthly energies that should have utterly annihilated them. All of these have been touched by cosmic forces, their already superhuman abilities augmented still further by energies beyond human understanding. Some such individuals may have been driven to wrest control of such titanic forces because of desperate needs or burning obsessions. Others seem to have been selected by fate, seemingly at random, to receive abilities that set them apart even from their superhuman peers. Regardless, all have emerged from their encounter with cosmic forces as something&amp;hellip;more. Even those who began as demigods, immortals, or extra-dimensional sorcerers have evolved past their former states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
