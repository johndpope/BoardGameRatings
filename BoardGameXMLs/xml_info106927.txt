			<description>From the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for HOT CHICKS: The RPG. You will need the core rulebook in order to play. As this is an adult supplement dealing with matters both sexual and horrific, you may also want a copy of our dark erotica supplement, Inner Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here we introduce you to the Sunny Rest Mental Care Facility, nestled in an out-of-the-way place within driving distance. We will give you an idea of what exactly goes on there, in narrative, show you the layout of the place, and give you information on what, precisely, is behind the happenings at the facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We include statistics for the NPCs involved, and finish up with some ideas for how the Sunny Rest Mental Care facility may factor in to your Hot Chicks campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By way of disclaimer: we at Dakkar Unlimited present this information strictly as a work of fiction meant for entertainment. In no way are we stating or even implying that mental care facilities run by competent mental health professionals are or may be havens for deviant sexual sadists working under the control of a horrific monster from the emptiness between the far stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we&amp;rsquo;re getting ahead of ourselves...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains adult content - nudity, strong language and extremely adult themes. Adult Readers Only, please!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
