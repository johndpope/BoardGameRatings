							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">L&#039;Histoire Romaine</name>
									
			<description>This is one of a series of four card games published in the 1700s in France known collectively as the &amp;quot;Cartes Historiques&amp;quot;. While the box is not dated, Hargrave's History dates the deck to 1760.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L'Histoire Romaine has a deck of 48 cards, numbered with Roman numerals, plus a card with rules of the game. The cards are printed on thick stock from wood blocks, with square corners and blank backs. At the top of each card is the name of an historical character and a circled portrait. Below the portrait, and taking up most of the card, is a biography of the individual. The box shows E. Jouy as the author of the biographies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seems to have been educational in nature, with the player drawing a card announcing its name, and the other player(s) having to come up with one or more relevant facts from the biography. Correct answers win the card, with the winner being the player who collects the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
