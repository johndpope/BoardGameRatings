							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blond He Was and Beautiful: The Battles of Benevento and Tagliacozzo</name>
									
			<description>Fourth entry in the Battles of Middle Ages series, featuring the battles of Benevento 1266 AD and Tagliacozzo 1268 AD, opposing the lasts of the Hohenstaufen against Charles of Anjou, champion of the Pope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles of the Middle Ages is an easy to learn war gaming system that recreates several of the most famous battles of the Medieval period of history, from the end of the Dark Ages to the dawning of Renaissance. These games are designed to be fast and furious, easy to learn, and to play but with enough historical research to make them true to the history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benevento, 1266&lt;br/&gt;The battle of Benevento is one of the most important battles of the long, vicious struggle of strength between the Papacy and the Ghibellin dynasty of the Hohenstaufen family. After the death of Frederic II, King of the Two Sicilies his bastard son, Manfredi d&amp;rsquo;Altavilla, raised an army against Pope Clement IV. After a fierce battle, Manfredi was defeated and died in battle. He was made immortal by Dante Alighieri, who put him in Purgatory and said of him &amp;ldquo;Biondo era, e bello, e di nobile aspetto&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tagliacozzo, 1268&lt;br/&gt;This battle may be considered the end of the Ghibellines, with the defeat of the last heir of the Hohenstaufen family, Conradin of Svabia. Similar to the earlier battle of Beneventor, it was mostly a clash of knights, resolved by the cunning of Charles of Anjou, who was not reluctant to sacrifice two-thirds of his army to surprise the Ghibellins who thought they had already won the battle before it was even fought (and acted accordingly).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally, available only as print &amp;amp; play through Wargamesdownloads.com.&lt;br/&gt;A second edition was published by High Flying Dice Games. The rules were extensively re-written for clarity and bring into compliance with the other games in the Battles of the Middle Ages Series. The Benevento game has a new variant scenario. In addition, the second edition features new artwork&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
