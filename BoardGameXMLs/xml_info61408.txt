			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something Stirs In The Icebarrier Mountains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joining a caravan as guards is a way to earn good money and see the world, though it is not without its risks. Having signed up as guards, the heroes are about to take part in a journey from the relative safety of the lands around Hellfrost Keep, home of the Hearth Knights, to the distant Saxa steads nestled in the forlorn Icebarrier Mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together the characters and the small band of heavily-armed frost dwarves travelling with the caravan must weather goblin attacks, for the fell creatures have stirred early this year and seem keen to make their presence felt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It becomes clear the goblins are not acting alone. Something more powerful is behind their attacks, something with grander plans than a few raids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow of Darkness can be played as a standalone adventure or as part one of a four-part mini-campaign arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes Figure Flats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
