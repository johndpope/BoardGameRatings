							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fist of the Dragon</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fist of the Dragon is a powerful mystical warrior who is able to channel the very fury of a dragon into his blows. In the Janus Horde, might makes right, and the strong rule; this has led a group of warriors to emulate one of the most mighty creatures of the world, Dragons. Blending the warrior lifestyle of their people with the consumption of dragon blood has led the Fists of the Dragon to embody the very nature of the Janus Horde with their raw magic and brutal strength. There are five different and distinct groups within the Fists of the Dragons. Each one of these factions is dedicated to a different color of the chromatic dragons. They do share one grander purpose, to become more like their mighty namesakes, the most powerful of single combatants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the information to play a Fist of the Dragon prestige class in your NeoExodus or other home setting.&lt;br/&gt;     All New Fist of the Dragon Feats including Damage Finesse and Full Thrust.&lt;br/&gt;     Plus Fist of the Dragon counters for miniature games.&lt;br/&gt;     Finally NeoExodus: A House Divided Initiative Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
