							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Slave&#039;s Vengeance - Act One</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said amongst the Oera'dim that vengeance is the only true justice, and that it is a gift best delivered up close and personal. For Braya'Traebor, a Hresh slave of House Traebor vengeance had become the sole purpose of his existence. Since leaving the Birthing Grounds of Gorgoroth he had come to realise that he was different from his fellow slaves for he was not content to endure a life of pain and privation. Indentured to House Traebor he had been put to work in the mines and had seen there the cruelty and malice of his Masters. In his mind he knew only hatred for those he served, and vowing that they should pay for their excesses he formulated a plan, one that would see him exact a terrible toll upon those who would enslave him. In the mines of his Masters he murdered his Overseers and sabotaged the devices and equipment that they valued far above the slaves that used them. He knew that he would be caught, but he also knew that such acts would label him as nuulwch, a worthless slave, and that he would be sent to the Maze as his punishment. Put into the Maze with other nuulwch he would be required to fight to the death for the pleasure of his House Masters. It was his intention however, to survive. He was not the same as other Oera'dim for he could not be content with servitude. He wanted freedom and he had a plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
