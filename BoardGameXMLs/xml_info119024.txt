							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stupid Fantasy Laws, Vol. 7</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While murder, rape, exploitation, theft, and abuse are certainly novel selections for crimes appropriately punished these infractions against society are rather&amp;hellip; well, terribly bland and a bit too straight to the point. So straight to the point, in fact, that any true, red blooded village wracked with superstitious idealizations should have little to fear from the threat of such obvious crimes. Real villages and communities need crimes rooted from pathetic inner fears. Real villages need stupid, oppressive laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this in mind we bring you yet another installment of the popular Stupid Fantasy Laws series. In this edition you will find well over a dozen new laws that are designed to hinder the characters as they attempt to interact with civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
