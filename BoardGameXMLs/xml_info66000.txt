							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1099: Domus clari Geminiani</name>
									
			<description>In 1099 started the construction of Duomo di Modena (Modena Cathedral) one of the greatest Italian example of Roman-Gothic architecture.&lt;br/&gt;Strongly acclaimed by citizens the construction was initially committed to the architect Lanfranco and the sculptor Wiligelmo and to the disciples of their schools.&lt;br/&gt;7 years later Saint Geminiano Memorabilia were moved from the old church to the new Cathedral, escorted by 6 miles guard and 12 cives guards to avoid thefts. In the following centuries the Cathedral construction was committed to Anselmo da Campione and his disciples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this card game is to retrace the stages of the construction trying to be the one to best contribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will use materials deck to build up the different part of the cathedral. Between the first and second stage of construction they need also to take part in the Memorabilia movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game wins an international competition held by Comune di Modena in 2008 for designing a game about Duomo di Modena construction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
