			<description>ColourCards (also known as ColoCards) is a game system. It consists of a deck of 100 unique coloured cards which are used to play many different games which are quick to learn and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards use five 'colours&amp;rsquo;: Red, Blue, Green, Black and White.  Each card has three &amp;lsquo;aspects&amp;rsquo;:  Word, Text and Background.  The Word is the name of one of the five colours, the Text of that word is written in one of the colours, and the Background of the card is in a different colour. Three different colours may feature in a card's aspects, but if the background or text is the same colour as the word, the card will only have two colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many different games that can be played with ColourCards.  These include ColourCall (spot which colour appears the most among a set of cards), ColourCount (write down how many times each colour appears among a set of cards), ColourSeek (deduce the aspects of a hidden card), ColourSet (find 2 cards with 5 colours), ColourPairs (find 2 cards with matching colours), ColourFind (a memory game of finding matching cards), ColourPerudo (a bluffing and guessing game where players challenge each other until only one remains), ColourFamilies (a cooperative game of making 'families' of 5 related cards), ColourCry (race against each other to put matches cards on top of each other to empty your hand), ColourSnap (a 2-player game of collecting your opponent's cards),  ColourSpeed (quickly say the colour of the writing - based on the Stroop test).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
