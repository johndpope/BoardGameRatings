			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure for Call of Cthulhu is set in the 1990s and is located in an isolated part of Georgia. However, with suitable modification it could be used in any isolated local in almost any time period. This adventure is primarily intended as an introductory adventure for a new group of characters. It is assumed that these individuals are not particularly familiar with strange and horrible things that are beyond the experience of the ordinary mass of humanity. At the same time, the adventure is somewhat dangerous and challenging. Hence it would be very suitable for a group of experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several (very minor) variations of this scenario exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
