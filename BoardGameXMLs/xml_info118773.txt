							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exit: Sing Sing</name>
									
			<description>You are a prisoner of the Sing Sing prison and your goal is to be first to break away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start from the cell in the center of the plate and try to win one of four outputs located at the four corners of the plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player draws a tile from the bag without looking and lays it on the board before placing his pawn onto it. So all players try to build their own path to the exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the route is convoluted and depends on the draw: unexpected directions. or different barriers: bars, fence, wall, reinforced door. They can also pick the tools they need to overcome these obstacles: lime, squeezed, chord and key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game of chance but where interactivity between players and tactics come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
