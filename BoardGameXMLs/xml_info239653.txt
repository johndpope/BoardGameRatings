							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Void Arcs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The massive Void Arcs ply the space lanes between the worlds of the Flame system, connecting societies and providing a means of trading and communication. Ancient vessels, some seemingly as old as human occupation of the Flame Worlds, these majestic and powerful vessels are the means by which agents of the Envoy travel in their hunt for Shadows. But these vessels are not simple ships or transports, they are idiosyncratic and individual as the Minds that control them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are detailed eleven Void Arcs and the Minds that control them, designed for Exilium but suitable for any science fiction roleplaying game where artifical intelligences control vast spacecraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By its nature Exilium is a mission-based roleplaying game, with separate missions being generally unconnected except by the presence of a Shadow. This can lead to a very &amp;lsquo;episodic&amp;rsquo; feel to games. Void Arcs are the means by which these missions are connected together, and can provide some colour to the game outside of the framework of hunting Shadows. This can provide some relief from the mission structure of Exilium and remind the Players that worlds exist outside of their hunt for Shadows at the behest of the Envoy. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible for the Fractal Mind that controls a Void Arc to become a Shadow, which would be very dangerous for those within it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the mission shard is system neutral so could be used for other science fiction roleplaying games, although some of the factions etc. are context specific for Exilium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
