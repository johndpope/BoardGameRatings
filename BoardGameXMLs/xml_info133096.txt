			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes rules supplements read like the world-setting bible of frustrated novelists. While solid world- building is a useful skill, you don&amp;rsquo;t always need four paragraphs of flavor text to tell you swords are cool, magic is power, shadows are scary, and orcs are savage. Sometimes a GM doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to slog through a page of history for every magic weapon. Sometimes all that&amp;rsquo;s needed are a few cool ideas, with just enough information to use them in a game. Sometimes, all you need are bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 With A Bullet Point is a line of very short, cheap PDFs each of which gives the bare bones of a set of related options. It may be five spells, six feats, eight magic weapon special abilities, or any other short set of related rules we can cram into about a page. Short and simple, these PDFs are for GMs and players who know how to integrate new ideas into their campaigns without any hand-holding, and just need fresh ideas and the rules to support them. No in-character fiction setting the game world. No charts and tables. No sidebars of explanations and optional rules. Just one sentence of explanation for the High Concept of the PDF, then bullet points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High Concept: Ten feats that allow spellcasters who focus on subschools of magic to have a slight advantage with all spells of that subschool, much as summoning specialists gain with Augment Summoning. This is the latest in a series of products to celebrate the &amp;quot;Summer of Bullets&amp;quot; event!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Calling: Your called allies gain some eldritch defenses.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Charm: Your charm spells give you greater control over your targets.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Compulsion: Your eldritch thralls are filled with additional power and verve.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Creation: The creatures and items you create are unusually robust.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Figment: Your illusionary allies are harder to hit, and can automatically change themselves to appear to ignore attacks that should bounce off their armor.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Glamer: Your illusions hold together briefly, even after the magic powering them ends or is disbelieved.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Healing: Your conjuration (healing) spells restore more damage than most.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Polymorph: Your transmutation (polymorph) spells can leave a few choice things unchanged.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Scrying: The sensors you create with your scrying spells are particularly powerful and subtle.&lt;br/&gt;    Augment Shadow: Your eldritch shadows are surprisingly real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
