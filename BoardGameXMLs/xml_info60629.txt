			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You know what they say about the best laid plans...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Havens series continues with Lords of the Manor, a 30 page supplement packed full of locales and NPCs for use in your fantasy d20-style/3.5 games.  Lords of the Manor presents 12 ready-to-use castles, keeps, and manor homes that can be dropped into almost any campaign.  With NPCs ranging from CR 1 all the way up to CR 35, DM's will find plenty of side quests, plot devices, and challenges for their players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Castles include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amberhurst Castle:  Located on the harbor of a thriving merchant town that trades in amber.  A perfect location and a congenial castellan make it ideal as a launch point for new campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barcelton Manor:  Having fallen into disrepair, a long lost heir seeks to restore it to its glory.  Plotting, greedy neighboring lords have other plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chelthenham Castle:  A powerful archduke and his wizardly younger wife command this mountain fortress.  Political intrigue abounds within the walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flemming House:  Once a private plantation, now a school for druids and nature-loving clerics and wizards to work together to study the natural world.  Nearby ruins and treant teachers makes this an interesting stop for nature-oriented players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howling Hall:  An abandoned tower deep in the forest, it is now home to a pack of werewolves and a ghost that still believes it is fighting off a vampire horde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Icewing Hall:  A frozen mountain castle that serves as home to a great wyrm dragon that is revered as a &amp;quot;dragon-god&amp;quot; by the barbaric tribes and loathed by other dragons...mostly because they didn&amp;rsquo;t come up with this scam first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lodentar Castle:  Like some indestructible remnant of old wars, Lodentar castle stands as a gateway between two once rival nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meadowbrook:  A gnomish concentric castle...we need say more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stonetalon Keep:  A solitary bastion of civilization in the middle of a desolate wasteland, stonetalon offers a welcome respite to weary adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trelorforge Keep:  This dwarven keep sits atop a rich iron mine, making it a source of steady income for the dwarves but also a potential target of greedy nobles that want to claim it for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vesterdrew Manor:  A pleasant farming community thrives thanks to the work of the Vesterdrew clan.  But all is not well as a son&amp;rsquo;s new wife brings political maneuverings to the once peaceful manor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Willow Keep Hill:  Once known as Hangman&amp;rsquo;s Hill, the hill is now the home of a peculiar wizard and his ogre butler.  A quiet neighbor according to the locals, except for the occasional &amp;quot;pet&amp;quot; escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Castle includes a detailed description along with history, important NPCs, and story seeds that can be used as plot devices or side quests.  These locales provide you with quick and easy information that allows you to offer a players a new level of detail and depth to your campaign without extra effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
