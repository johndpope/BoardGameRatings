							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Session Kits K1: Night at Fausen&#039;s Manor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up here in the mountains, the sun sets fast. The path has narrowed yet again as it diverts into this small slot valley. A gentle stream parallels the path; it&amp;rsquo;s pretty, but the smell of rotting vegetation dissuades from lingering long. In the lengthening shadows, birdsong seems oddly muted. As the forest clears a bit up ahead, a small manor upon a little pond comes into view. The birds have gone completely still.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;K1: Night at Fausen&amp;rsquo;s Manor is an investigative adventure designed for player characters around 3rd level. In it, the players will be wined, dined, then sent to investigate a heinous crime. The players have been invited by the reclusive Lord Fausen to dine with him and discuss a job; Fausen is troubled by odd bumps and sounds in the night, something has been interfering with his mail, and recently his butler, Grimly, has disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
