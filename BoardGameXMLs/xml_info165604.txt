			<description>The ultimate party game, Don&amp;rsquo;t Be a Loser was designed specifically for highly social situations.  It not only provides continual laughs and non-stop &amp;quot;smack talk&amp;quot;, but it also allows players to freely flow in and out as they wish without interrupting the game.  This flexibility, mixed with a uniquely interactive game play, make Don&amp;rsquo;t Be a Loser an absolute hit among the fun-loving party crowd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the Biggest Winner, but more importantly, to not be the Biggest Loser.  n order to advance down the board players compete in a wide variety of one-on-one challenges including physical challenges, Mathlete questions, Super Sleuth puzzles, acting challenges, creativity challenges and much more.  Other players are able to bet on which player they think will win, keeping everyone involved as much as they wish to be and making the competition to not be a Loser fierce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exciting twist: before starting the game players all decide on the penalty the Biggest Loser will pay.  It could be as simple as having to sing a silly song or to buy the next round of beverages, to more serious stakes such as the Biggest Loser having to wash the Biggest Winner&amp;rsquo;s car.  Needless to say, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a loser!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
