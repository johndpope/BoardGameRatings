			<description>This is a fan made stand alone game based on Smash Monster Rampage. Tokyo is invaded by bugs, mechs, ufos, aliens &amp;amp; gigantic monsters (kaiju). It's time for Earth Defence Force (E.D.F.) to defend the city. The map is divided into four sectors in which a player is assigned to defend one sector. It's a four players co-op game. You need to join other teams to defend Tokyo &amp;amp; rescue survivors. You must hurry! Giant bugs &amp;amp; mechs are all over the city. In additions, gigantic monsters (kaiju) &amp;amp; three huge motherships are on the way to destroy the city. You need to investigate each of the 30 buildings to rescue the survivors before it's too late. But beware!Some buildings are already overrun by aliens &amp;amp; bugs. You may found new bug hives &amp;amp; must destroy them to stop the swarms. The player who has most intact buildings left, saved most survivors &amp;amp; killed most aliens or monsters at game end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
