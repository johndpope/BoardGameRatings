							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dune RPG</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the DUNE RPG. This is intended as a classic pen and paper Role-Play for experienced gamers and fans of the original Dune Legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document probably violates several copyright laws, however, it is designed solely for the fans, as it was written by fans. This is a work of Fan-dom. I avoid the word Fiction because the aim of this project is to provide something as close to Frank Herbert&amp;rsquo;s original vision as possible. Most of the details within this document are from the &amp;ldquo;Dune Encyclopaedia&amp;rdquo; rather than the new preludes as it gives a better understanding of classic dune. Certain parts of the preludes have been included however. I have marked the sections accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is based on the &amp;ldquo;Legend of the Five Rings&amp;rdquo; Role-Play due to its simplicity and ease of modification. Fans of that system should find this document quite straightforward. Others may need a little time to get used to the idea but all information needed is included within this document. Further supplements detailing the &amp;ldquo;Ways&amp;rdquo; of the major factions can be found on the Dune RPG Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
