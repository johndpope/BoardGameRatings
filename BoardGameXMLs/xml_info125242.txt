							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Container Harbor</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invention of standardized steel containers meant a revolution for cargo shipping. But it were not only ships that changed due to this new method to store and transport cargo. The advent of the container changed the piers of harbors far and wide at least as much. For most goods there no longer was a need for warehouses or the likes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small segment of a pier is a fine example for these changes. A narrow walkway leads along its length well out of the way of the storage area. Slightly above this walkway and accessible through a number of iron ladders the container storage area stretches along the pier from one end to the other and even beyond that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here one container is stored next to the other in almost endless rows, with little space between them. And often enough each row is several containers high. Although the harbor is usually busy all day and night it is not advised to not visit it after nightfall unless you know where you are going and what you are doing as precious little illumination is provided by the scant few lamps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
