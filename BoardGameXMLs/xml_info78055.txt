			<description>From the official website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Victory is the long awaited sequel to Advance of the Reich, published over seven years ago. It is a tactical level computer wargame with scenarios ranging over the entire Eastern Front, 1943-45. The basic unit is the squad, but players can form units up to division level. With this game, the Squad Battles engine has received many upgrades and the level of detail has grown. The number of scenarios included in this title has almost tripled, as have the number of maps available for player use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
