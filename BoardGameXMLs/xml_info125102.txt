			<description>Having successfully graduated from the Academy of Assistants, Igor entered the service in the castle of Evil Professor Garriarti, who does cruel tests and experiments on human beings wishing to conquer the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Idolizing Professor, the young apprentice works hard and tries every way to help his master. But one day, cleaning up the laboratory, Igor falls under the action of laser-machines - after the &amp;quot;injury&amp;quot; Igor&amp;rsquo;s life changes dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The young apprentice realized that all the things taking place in the castle are terrible, and that he himself was just one of the experiments of Professor. Not wanting to be a &amp;quot;guinea pig&amp;quot; any more Igor decides to stop Evil Professor Garriarti anyway and cast him out of the castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watching the professor, Igor noticed that Garriarti loves to have things clean and tidy. The teacher has always chastised his assistant for keeping things in a mess, giving him extra assignments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on this observation, the apprentice starts working on a plan &amp;quot;Exile&amp;quot;, according to which Igor was going to irritate the professor until he himself did not leave the castle! In the course of the game you have to build a trap for the Evil Professor, moving items from one room of the castle to the others. For example, you can put a rat into the fridge or bring a terrible mess in the library, or just smear some ink on his teacher&amp;rsquo;s favorite painting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, you should remember that Igor can not turn up in front of Garriarti - the Evil Professor is looking for the rebellious pupil to punish him and to continue their vicious experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
