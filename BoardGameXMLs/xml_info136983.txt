							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">StarFighter Joystick</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The StarFighter Joystick was a smaller sibling to the widely popular joystick TAC-2 from the same manufacturer. In all aspects except the design of the very stick, it was similar to the equally smaller sibling &amp;quot;Slik Stik&amp;quot;, also by the same manufacturer; the Slik Stik had a pin with a ball on it, the Starfighter was merely a stick. Like the Slik-Stik, it had only 1 button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
