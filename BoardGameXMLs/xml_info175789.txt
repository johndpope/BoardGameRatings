							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Agaricath: Drow City</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable rpg battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl or skirmish game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset. The map is 50x50, equivalent to 25 of our standard 10x10 tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: An underground Drow city, deep within a cavern. Houses and shops are carved from the rock, stairs wind their way between levels and the area is lit by fungi and mysterious glows. A magic academy with lecture rooms and casting chambers sits on one side of a chasm, spanned by a pair of bridges. Sitting astride a large open area is a temple to a Spider Queen or demon, with a summoning circle and the home of a sacred spider. The Dark Elves that live in Agaricath also have an arena for combat - prisoners are held in one area before being made to fight agains terrifying creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uses: Taken prisoner by a Dark Elf, your party have become gladiators and must fight a giant centipede in the arena, infiltrate the temple of the Drow spider queen and fight the Drider that lives there, visit a Drow sorcerer at the Wizards Academy and consult them on an unholy ritual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridded map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi A4 pdf, with gridless map spread across 50 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;    250dpi full jpeg versions for VTT or poster printing (gridded and gridless)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Whilst the download looks large, it consists of several separate files - just download the versions you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on VTT use - we have deliberately kept the quality of the file high, and you may need to resize the jpeg for use in your VTT software. Keeping the file size and resolution high gives you the flexibility to use the map how you want - crop out a particular section or use the entire map, the choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
