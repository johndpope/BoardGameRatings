			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Familiars, a game about playing magical animals serving a Mistress or Master of magic. What are Familiars? They are animals who were formerly normal but who have been gifted with increased intelligence, capabilities, and toughness, as well as magical powers. Gaining sentience somewhere near a sorceror, or perhaps a group of witches, your character was filled with a need to help. They do not know why they suddenly feel this way, but they feel a loyalty to their master(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They also see things their master doesn't. That he is dealing with powers that could lead to his corruption destruction. The familiar feels the need to help their master with his goals, but at the same time, they feel a compulsion to stop their master from going too far. How do they help their master? How far will they go to stop him from destroying himself in his arrogance? Will their master ever stop dealing in dangerous magics?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
