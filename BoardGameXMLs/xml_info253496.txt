							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vikingr</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;n. Any of the Scandinavian pirates who plundered the coasts of Europe from the 8th to 10th centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vikings (as we now call them) have held a huge grip on the imaginations of writers, film makers and in fact everyone for many hundreds of years.  This makes the Vikings (or Vikingar as they were originally known) a rich source of inspiration for RPG's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people prefer a strictly historical game, others a semi-mystical game similar.  Yet others desire to run a game styled after Beowulf or maybe even a game set in a fairly standard fantasy world but in the northern &amp;quot;viking-like&amp;quot; regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever your preferred Viking game, this is the ruleset for you.  Based on the free D6 ruleset from West End Games, we give you all of the rules needed, Hero creation, Ships, Warbands, Gods, Omens and Runes, Scandinavian monsters and myths and much more.  Fast and cinematic, this game will see your Heroes pillaging, cleaving and rampaging in no time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
