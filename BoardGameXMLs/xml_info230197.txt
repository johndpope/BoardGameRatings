							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creature Card Catalogue: Brutal Beasts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beasts are among the most numerous of creatures in any bestiary, but while most creatures are familiar and recognizable, they need not be so! Fantastic beasts that have evolved side by side with dragons and manticores are sure to have a few tricks of their own. Our short and focused bestiary showcases such terrible beasts for use in your campaigns. Surprise your players with Brutal Beasts today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beasts within this tome are meant to represent new and interesting animals that could feasibly occupy a fantasy world. Though many real world beasts surely inhabit your world of choice, there is plenty of room for amazing new beasts that exhibit great strength or curious talents that make them tough or deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following beasts have been carefully considered not only for fighting prowess, but for their ability to thrive and compete in ecosystems that contain awful aberrations, deadly dragons, and magnificent monstrosities. These are Brutal Beasts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Creature Card Catalogue is a product line that brings you a set of 5th edition monsters printed on cardstock and ready to be hole-punched and collected in a 3-ring binder or simply used as a pdf. Each set presents a set of creatures marked by their type and keyed to colored symbols for easy reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
