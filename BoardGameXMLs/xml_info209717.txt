			<description>Aye is a cooperative pirate board game where the player will the crew of a ship under attack by a Kraken. One player will assume the role of captain and will be in charge of planning the round strategy, while the other players (the crew) will execute that strategy to try and complete four different missions: fire cannons, attack with swords, set sails and navigate away from the Kraken. As the mission unfolds, players will win and lose reputation and, if the captain's reputation is to low, crew members with high reputation will be able to declare a mutiny to nominate a new captain of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aye is a dice rolling game with a high social component and push-your-luck mechanics. It has 12 custom dice which are dealt by the captain to the players, who will roll them to complete the missions. But receiving damage and losing to much reputation can make you lose those dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
