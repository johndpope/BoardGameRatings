			<description>Just in time for the new movie, WizKids will release the Marvel Dice Masters:  Guardians of the Galaxy expansion, in April 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Packaged in random foil packs, the Guardians of the Galaxy set includes more than 30 characters such as Star-Lord, Rocket, Groot, Angela, Yondu, and Cosmo.  Each hero and villain appears as cards and dice in the game, with two cards and two dice included in each pack, including foil versions of every card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marvel Dice Masters:  Guardians of the Galaxy will be sold in 90-piece gravity feed displays.  The foil packs also have hang tabs for an alternative display option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Masters is a Quarriors!-style dice battle game designed by Michael Elliott and Eric M. Lang. In this game, each player fields one of the hero teams, with each hero being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of 15 dice, and a player can &amp;quot;purchase&amp;quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
