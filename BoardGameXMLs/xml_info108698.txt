							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">He&#039;s Out! The New Test Match Game</name>
									
			<description>The rules say &amp;quot;With this game it is possible to follow exactly the normal course of a test match from the selection of the teams down to the final bowling analysis&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a spinner mechanism which overlays 3 generic batting cards, allowing the player to simulate different quality batsmen and bowlers.&lt;br/&gt;A simple cricket game from the 20s, and one with some potential to modify if you put the effort in to create unique player discs for each batsman. The mechanism is similar to the one used in the classic Cadaco&amp;rsquo;s All Star Baseball, which was released 13 years after He&amp;rsquo;s Out. The game is endorsed by Wally Hammond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
