			<description>What is Chemistry: An Atom Building Game?&lt;br/&gt;Students compete to create the largest atom using their knowledge of chemistry in this exciting deck building game.  Each player starts out with a hydrogen atom and must answer a question based on chemistry to gain quarks.  The quarks are converted into one of three subatomic particles.  Players can use various discoveries in chemistry (i.e. Chemistry cards) to enhance their turn to gain more quarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for chemistry students and it is a fun and nontraditional way to review for tests.  So, if you want to be ready for your next chemistry test, play Chemistry: An Atom Building Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
