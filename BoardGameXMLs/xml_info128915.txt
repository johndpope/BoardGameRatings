							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paradox (fan expansion for Dominion)</name>
									
			<description>Paradox is a fan expansion for Dominion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wait, all of a sudden playing this card might help my opponent more? But yet, if they choose to let it help them, it will push me over the top to get an early Province lead. While not all cards involve decisions quite this Paradoxical, it was the driving inspiration for this Chapter to the Dominion Fan Universe. Consider printing this fan expansion if you are interested in:&lt;br/&gt;A) heightened player interaction;&lt;br/&gt;B) more variety in win conditions;&lt;br/&gt;C) additional powerful card combinations depending on setup;&lt;br/&gt;D) shifted timing, with once strong early game cards becoming strong only late game (in certain setups);&lt;br/&gt;E) non-obvious cards which involve more critical thinking than &amp;ldquo;do I have any actions left&amp;rdquo; to play;&lt;br/&gt;F) and just generally re-thinking how best to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New mechanics (and further exploration of existing mechanics) to accomplish this include:&lt;br/&gt;Curses &amp;ndash; A greater variety of curse cards, some of which you&amp;rsquo;ll actually want (in controlled quantities).&lt;br/&gt;Loops &amp;ndash; Sustain a card ability as long as you can meet the trigger.&lt;br/&gt;Vulnerability &amp;ndash; A new type of interaction with other players and increased occurrence of Attack &amp;ndash; Reaction plays.&lt;br/&gt;Guilds and Variant Rules &amp;ndash; New goals to aim for to mix up the rather abstract strive for victory point cards.&lt;br/&gt;Reaction cards &amp;ndash; A higher saturation than normal of reaction cards that respond to more than just attack cards. Some you may choose to reveal only at the right times they are triggered rather than at every opportunity. And others are simply beneficial to all, in a somewhat reverse attack fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;Total Expansion Size (with all options)&lt;br/&gt;587 cards &amp;ndash; 36 mats &amp;ndash; 46 tokens &amp;ndash; 1 rules document&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kingdom cards &amp;ndash; 404 cards (40 decks: 38 decks of 10 cards, + 2 Victory card decks of 12 cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other cards / components: optional (breakdown in rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
