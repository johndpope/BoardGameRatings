			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure anyone could have foreseen the changes. If they had, they would have surely tried something to save us. No, scrap that mankind had been warned over and over again that if we didn&amp;rsquo;t change our ways then the world would rise up and do its damnedest to take us down, but our fathers and their fathers were so blinded by greed that they ignored it all. Now look at us&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth. A green and blue planet teeming with life. Well, it was once anyway. These days it&amp;rsquo;s still teeming with life, human cockroaches packed into the remaining liveable pockets and metropolises scraping by an existence of sorts. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to work for one of the Corps, the UN or are one of the nouveau riche. As for green and blue? Well, if by green you mean grey and if by blue you mean brown... then yeah, I guess it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genesis Descent is a brand new setting using R. Talsorians Cyberpunk Interlock system. Life on Earth in 2054 is tough for many. Climate change and natural disasters have not only torn many from their usual way of life, but have also prompted conflict over scarce resources such as water in some areas. Meanwhile, technology brings more and more comfort to the privileged. Political and civil unrest, as well as outright war in some areas, has seen the geo-political landscape change. The empires of the late 20th and early 21st centuries are falling as new countries take advantage of the upheaval to assert their dominance. Amongst this turmoil, corporations have seized the initiative. In many areas, where governments don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources or stability to protect, treat or feed their citizens, corporations are the sole providers of law and infrastructure. America may have been the first country to send a man to the Moon, but it was a corporation that sent the first man to Mars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genesis Descent has three levels of play: Street, Company and Agent. Allowing players and Gamemasters to tailor the type of campaign they wish to play. From the ghettos and organized crime of shattered Los Angeles or London, through the halls of corporate-controlled states and their near orbit control centres, to UNIS Agents working tirelessly to assist governments and keep corporate power in check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genesis Descent is a dark, stark techno-thriller near-future setting where the world is falling apart as mankind reaches out to claim the stars...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyberpunk and the Interlock system are licensed from R. Talsorian Games, Inc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Publishers Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
