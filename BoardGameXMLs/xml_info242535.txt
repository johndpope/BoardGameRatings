							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stalingrad: An Empires of History Game</name>
									
			<description>The pivotal battle for the Soviets in WW2. After this battle the Germans would never again go on the offensive on the eastern front. Now you take the generals seat and try to do better than the historical outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stalingrad is a low priced 2 player strategy board game covering the epic battle between the German and Societ forces in and around the city of Stalingrad during WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On June 22, 1941, Germany and the Axis powers invaded the Soviet Union, quickly advancing deep into Soviet territory. The fighting in 41 culminated in a fierce Soviet counter attack on the outskirts of Moscow, which saved the city. Entering 42 Hitler and his commanders shifted the offensive south towards Stalingrad, breaking through the Soviet lines and threatening to cut off the oil rich Caucuses from the main soviet industrial areas. Stalingrad was the lynch pin to the defense of the Soviet south and the place Stalin had demanded the Russian people make a stand at all costs. The result was the bloodiest battle of WWII.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Stalingrad the game begins with the German drive on Stalingrad itself. Both players begin the game getting a fixed assortment of troop reinforcements, which later shifts to troop purchases as decided by the players. The battle consists of fighting up to and around Stalingrad and includes the northern Caucasus region, plus fighting inside the city itself on the more detailed city map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from GoB website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Compact Game Series&lt;br/&gt;SKU GUI8030&lt;br/&gt;Boxed, 4.5&amp;quot; x 5.75&amp;quot; x 1.5&amp;quot; game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty Level: Easy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contains:&lt;br/&gt;1 10&amp;quot;x15&amp;quot; full color map&lt;br/&gt;1 11&amp;quot;x17&amp;quot; full color map in 2 pieces&lt;br/&gt;1 D10 die&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;136 full color die cut units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
