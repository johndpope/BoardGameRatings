							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quatre-Bras, 16 June 1815</name>
									
			<description>Two days before Waterloo, the French left wing under Mashal Ney encountered Wellington's army at the crossroads of Quatre Bras. Unknown to Ney, he faced only a thin line of troops as the bulk of Wellington's army raced to the front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty, compounded by conflicting orders from Napoleon, delayed the French advance for several critical hours. Both sides need a quick victory to enable intervention, perhaps decisive, at Ligny, where Napoleon and Blucher have come to grips. Multiple strategy choices for both sides ensure an element of doubt. Two maps, three counter sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
