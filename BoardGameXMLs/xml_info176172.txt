							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Clockwork Armada</name>
									
			<description>Clockwork Armada is a naval miniatures game set in an alternate reality of flat worlds and pseudoscience, where ships sail on the upward rushing winds of space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes command of a fleet of warships from their chosen faction, choosing what specialized cruisers and escort squadrons to combine into a synergistic force. A unique flagship is chosen to lead each armada, providing it with special Directives to enhance the abilities of nearby ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of Clockwork Armada plays out in a continual rotation of alternating activations. Ships will board, ram, and fire at each other, using stat cards to keep track of the damage done to the different areas of a ship. A set of segmented Course Rulers is used to determine the maneuverability of lumbering capital ships and nimble corvettes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shared mission and individual objectives give each player multiple means of scoring enough victory points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
