			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trumped Up Cards exist to document the insanity of the 2016 campaign season. It's a fast-paced, satirical game where reality collides with absurdity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first person to be able to be able to spell V-O-T-E from the lettered quote cards they collected during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of ten phrase cards and will draw back up to ten after each round.  A player is selected to be the CEO for the round and they draw a quote card and read it to the players.  The quote is missing a phrase that will be filled in with a phrase card from each player.  Players select the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; phrase card from their hands for the current quote card and place the chosen phrase cards face down in a pile.  The CEO shuffles the submitted phrase cards and then reads the quote filled in with each phrase.  The CEO then decides which phrase &amp;quot;won&amp;quot; the round and the player that played the winning phrase collects the quote card.  Rotate the CEO position after each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are special phrase cards called Trump cards that give a player special powers and are usually played in combination with a phrase card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;lightweight&amp;quot; ending is optional and occurs when a majority of the players grow so depressed at the prospect of a real Trump presidency that they just start quietly sobbing.  When this happens, the player with the most quote cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
