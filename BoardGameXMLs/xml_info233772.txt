							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meeple Heist</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeple Heist is a game inspired by the so called &amp;quot;Heist Movies&amp;quot;, in which something of value has to be stolen by highly skilled individuals, with smart ideas, infiltration and great team work, usually not resorting to guns or violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, a brave team of meeple specialists will take the challenge to perform a great robbery in the Meeple Castle, a Casino controlled by the organized crime. Coincidently, though, more than one team is trying to pull this off at the same time - and maybe even with the same specialists!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, the meeples are not trustworthy and might be working for other parties (also know as other players). So, while trying to advance their own plan, players must take the challenge to discover which meeple works for whom, utilizing cunning, deduction and a bit of luck (yes, this is a dice game after all). The idea is to control your team with maximum efficiency, positioning them at the right place at the right time to execute your big plan and get away with as much money as possible from the Casino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will lead a charming but unreliable team of specialists: The Brain, The Face, The Muscle, The Eye, The Feet and The Fingers. In the end will you grab just a few coins or can ou pull off the most ambitious heist of all time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any case, just remember: don't trust the meeples!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
