			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure is designed for characters of virtually any background in the employ of a merchant company based in the Reavers' Deep sector. Characters should possess a mix of skills spanning many fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situation: Hopeless! Alone on an untamed world.... imprisoned by warrior Aslan .... the human expedition on Htalrea faces impossible odds as they strive to win free from their alien captors. It will take every bit of skill and luck the adventurers can muster to out fox the Aslan warriors and escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape is a folio adventure approved for use with Traveller, GDW's original role-playing game of Science-Fiction adventure in the far future. Written by J. Andrew Keith, Escape picks up where his earlier folio Trading Team (published by Marischal Adventures) left off.... and launches a new line of SEEKER folios that link together to form an ongoing Traveller campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
