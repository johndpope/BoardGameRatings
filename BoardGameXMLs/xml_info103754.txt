			<description>This game is actually in two parts which together make the whole game.&lt;br/&gt; In game 1 a team of 11 players is built up by moving round a 4 lane track in monopoly like manner, acting on the instructions on the square in which you land. At the start of each turn you decide which lane you will start your move in and if you are blocked by another player you stop in the square immediately behind him(thus giving a bit more control than in Monoply). The object is to built the best team of 11 players that you can.&lt;br/&gt; In game 2, using the team created in Game 1, you play soccer on a 22x16 pitch which is divided into 10 player areas corresponding to player positions. You move the ball by die throws which can be mitigated by skill cards obtained in game 1.&lt;br/&gt; The object is to score the most goals in a set time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
