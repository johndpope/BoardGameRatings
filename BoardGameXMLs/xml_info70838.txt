			<description>&amp;quot;The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery (also known as Gabriel Knight 2 or GK2) is a computer adventure game released by Sierra On-Line in 1995. Unlike the original Gabriel Knight released in 1993, The Beast Within was produced entirely in full motion video. The technology was popular at the time of the game's production with the recently introduced storage capabilities of CD-ROMs, but was expensive to produce and led to a linear storyline. The third Gabriel Knight game used a rendered 3D engine a few years later instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released for PC and Macintosh. The Macintosh version used a video player developed by Sierra instead of an off-the-shelf technology such as Quicktime, and had a tendency to crash or run slowly on 680x0 processors. There is an XP-compatible re-print on DVD with de-interlaced movies , but it is exclusive to the Italian market.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Beast_Within:_A_Gabriel_Knight_Mystery,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
