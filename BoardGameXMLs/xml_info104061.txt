							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War! Age of Imperialism</name>
									
			<description>War! Age of Imperialism is the computer version of the award winning board game. Up to 8 players vie to create the most powerful empire on Earth. Each player starts the game with several regions. They can add regions to their empire by convincing the native peoples to join the empire. Some native peoples are peaceful and will readily join the first great power to approach them. Other native peoples are warlike, often decorating their villages with the heads of unlucky imperial explorers! These regions may have to be taken by military force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a region has been acquired the player may then improve the region. Improvements include developing resources and constructing buildings. The empire gains wealth from these improvements. This wealth may then be invested in raising and equipping new armies and navies, further economic growth, education, construction, and technological advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology gives a player&amp;rsquo;s empire economic and military advantages over rival imperial powers. An empire may build a huge army, only to find that their musket-armed troops are defeated by a smaller, rifle-armed enemy army. Correctly spending the economic surpluses generated by booming industrialization is one of the most challenging parts of ruling a successful empire in the age of imperialism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Political considerations must not be ignored. Alliances with other imperial powers are sometimes necessary if smaller empires are to survive against larger stronger rivals. The challenge is knowing just when to abandon, or even attack, allies in order to profitably increase your own power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end, only the most powerful empire will win. Will you lead your empire to world domination?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
