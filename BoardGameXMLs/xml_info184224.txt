			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Pulp! is a roleplaying system that simulates the &amp;quot;two-fisted action&amp;quot; of pulp novels.  The rules are complete within themselves, but are a modified implementation Dilly Green Bean Games' The Basic System.  Some references to the source system appear in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have nine Attributes with an &amp;quot;average human&amp;quot; having a score of 10 in each.  Characters in the game have their scores determined by 3d6+2, giving them excellent performance.  Attributes are combined into secondary characteristics called Statistics.  Characters may also have legendary abilities, legendary faults, benefits, and/or legendary powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system also uses skills and task groups, with ability derived from Attributes.  Opposed actions are determined by combining a skill or task group performance level with a die roll and comparing the result to a target difficulty.  Characters take damage in combat, but usually suffer only knockout so they can try again later.  Characters advance in level by earning experience points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
