							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Speed Racer Collectable Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Hurtling down the track, careening around, over, and through the competition, Speed Racer is a natural behind the wheel. Born to race cars, Speed is aggressive, instinctive and, most of all, fearless. His only real competition is the memory of the brother he idolized - the legendary Rex Racer - whose death in a race has left behind a legacy that Speed is driven to fulfill. Playground Maniacs announces this brand-new Clear Card Game series featuring 130 game cards boasting stunning transparent technology and randomly inserted 'Glitter' chase cards. 5 cards per pack / 24 packs per box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbadges:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
