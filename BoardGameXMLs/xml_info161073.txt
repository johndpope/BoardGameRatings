							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Run</name>
									
			<description>Space Run is a PC game that mixes strategy and space ship construction in real time, borrowing certain mechanics from the &amp;ldquo;tower defense&amp;rdquo; system with numerous twists and hyper dynamic gameplay. Space Run is a nod to &amp;lsquo;80s science fiction and pays homage to many of its tropes and references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2525. You are Captain Buck Mann, a Space Runner whose job is to transport valuable cargo from one end of the galaxy to the other... and one thing&amp;rsquo;s for sure: it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a bumpy ride! Not only do the cosmic highways regularly pass through asteroid belts of all sizes, but they are also used by dangerous and unscrupulous pirates armed to the teeth, whose fighters and battle cruisers will make short work of your transport vessel if you&amp;rsquo;re totally unprepared.&lt;br/&gt;Fulfil your contracts with gusto and your reputation will soar, opening the doors to new clients and more demanding and hazardous assignments... but which will also be more lucrative! Unlock new modules for your ship or upgrade those you already own: laser turrets, missile launchers, shield generators, thrusters, power plants and other modules will allow you to adapt to new combat situations in mid-flight that arise on your travels. Build, recycle, repair and reposition the modules and improvise as best you can to deal with the multiple threats you will face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retry the first missions with the advanced modules you&amp;rsquo;ve just unlocked to improve your score, and challenge your friends to do better!&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher / Developer Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
