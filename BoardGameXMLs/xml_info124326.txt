			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small friendly tribe living on a frozen valley have fallen under attack by a great beast. A beast who seems intent on driving them from their home. Can a noble party of adventurers stop the marauding beast and determine its true motives before the Yu-Kur tribe leaves their ancestral hunting grounds forever?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yu-Kur tribe have shared a valley with another tribe, the Uu&amp;rsquo;lans, for generations. It is a rich, green valley in the summer, and plentiful hunting grounds for Woolly Beasts in the winter times. But recently the Uu&amp;rsquo;lan discovered gold in the great river. Worthless for tools, they use it for ornament. When ocean pirates, who trade with them in the winter months, saw this they became eager to drive the Yu-Kur from the valley and claim the rich gold fields for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
