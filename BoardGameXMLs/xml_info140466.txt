			<description>In CiRKiTRY, players have been invited to a local electronics competition. Your goal is to create a electronic circuit that uses all 5 of the following components: a Battery, a Resistor, an Inductor, a Capacitor, and an LED bulb. However, to make things more difficult, everyone will be competing on the same circuit board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns uncovering circuit board tiles and placing their electronic components along the conductive paths. But be careful! The Voltage on the Volt-a-Meter fluctuates as components are played. If the Voltage gets raised too high, you might cause a destructive power surge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use Solder pieces to create pathways and make new connections. Not all 5 of the electronic components need to be your own, and you can attempt to piggyback off of your opponents' placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CiRKiTRY does not require prior knowledge of electronic engineering to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
