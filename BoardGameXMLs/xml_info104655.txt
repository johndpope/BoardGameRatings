			<description>Ahhhh... it's a hot lazy summer in your little suburb of the world and you're eleven years old again! You've played with your friends and explored on your bike and you're old enough to get excited by the prospects of earning some money. You've got $0.25 burning a hole in your pocket and your mom even offers to give you a shiny silver dollar to invest in your scheme. You're starting a lemonade stand! You've got just one week until the Fourth of July and you want to earn as much as possible to blow all of your profits on smoke bombs, bottle rockets and even some M-80s this year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course some of your friends are copying your idea &amp;ndash; why do they always do that? It is going to be an epic battle for bragging rights and fireworks as you compete with one another to see who will have the most money at the end of the week!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lemonade Stand is played over seven turns (days), and each turn players start by turning over a forecast card which shows the weather forecast for the day along with number of customers and the price they will be willing to pay for each possible weather outcome. Players then place a 5, 10 or 15 cent price card down along with any signs or lemonade inventory they want to put out, all face down. All players reveal their cards at the same time and then a new forecast card is revealed which has an arrow pointing to one of five spots on the old forecast card, which determines which weather event occurred. Each player then collects money based on their price and # of glasses of lemonade invested versus the actual weather that happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money is gained or lost, and play continues for seven rounds. Most money wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
