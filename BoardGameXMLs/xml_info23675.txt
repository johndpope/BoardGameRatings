			<description>In the first of three rounds, players roll a 30-sided die to choose a set of nine letters.  They then have a limited amount of time to find pairs of synonyms, at least one of which is formed from the selected letters.  Word pairs which match those found by other players don't count, nor do any pairs which are voted down by the other players as not being true synonyms.  Bonus points are given for word pairs both of which are formed from the selected letters.  Then a new set of letters are chosen and a second round is played using antonyms, followed by a third round with homonyms.  High total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
