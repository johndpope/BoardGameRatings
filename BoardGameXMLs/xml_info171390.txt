							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American War of Independence: Campaign Set 3 â€“ Other Battles</name>
									
			<description>Nine battles of the early Revolutionary war using a common set of rules. Each battle includes its own specific rules page and map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles included in this set include White Marsh, Bennington, Princeton, Kettle Creek, Burgoynes Stand, Barren Hill, Brooklyn, the Clouds, and Springfield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their forces and attacking enemy units in order to achieve the specific objectives for a battle. One important difference to typical wargames is that before the moving player can attack, his units are subject to defensive fire from the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
