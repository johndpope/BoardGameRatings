							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UNO: Eragon</name>
									
			<description>Another Uno variation.  Relive the magical story of Eragon with 112 custom cards featuring Brom, Galbatorix, Arya and the rest of the epic cast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Zar&amp;rsquo;roc card and rule:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you play this card, you choose another player and view their entire hand. You can then take any card from the other player's hand and, in return, give them any card from your own hand. You choose the cards to be traded. You then determine the color to be played in the next round (any color including the color in play before the Zar'Roc card was laid down). The Zar'Roc card can be played as your last card allowing you to go out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
