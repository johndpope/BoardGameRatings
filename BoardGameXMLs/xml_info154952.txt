							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of the Fisherman&#039;s Wife</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb: It is Midsummer. On the morning three Fishermen leave for sea, their Wives mend their nets and spruce up their boats, and the Fishermen predict to their wives how their fishing trips will go. The couples exchange six words to weave a story to remember one another. While they are apart, the Fishermen and Wives catch the attention of otherworldly beings who try to seduce, possess, supplant, devour, or serve them. In turn, the Fishermen and Wives attempt to seduce, merge with, destroy, steal power from, or enslave the ghosts and demons who prey upon them. When the Fishermen and Wives reunite, some or all of them may not be what they seem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the Edo Period of Japanese folklore, this is a freeform larp where players are both the actors and audience. It is inspired by kabuki theatre, bunraku, ukiyo-e and shunga art (especially Hokusai's Dream of the Fisherman's Wife), and the game Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
