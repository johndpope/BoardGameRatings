Sixteen unique species with superior AI and a comprehensive Diplomatic system create a challenge for strategists that is not easily overcome! Full R&amp;amp;D trees take you through multiple eras and include technologies for your colonies and your fleets. The original Reach for the Stars is noted to have been a pioneer in 4x Space Strategy games. 4x Strategy refers to the four activities you perform, Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate. Reach for the Stars for Matrix Games has been reworked for greater stability and incorporates the final unreleased update to the 2000 release from Strategic Studies Group, the developers of the original and 2000 releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
