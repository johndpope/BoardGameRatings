			<description>The protagonist, Rau Utu, is known as a great warrior. Trained by his mentor and adopted father, Baumusu, he was taught stealth and extraordinary skill with his sword. He was also taught to help those in need rather than act as a mercenary. The games begins with Rau being asked a favor by the village tavern keeper, he says that bandits are keeping business away and asks Rau to look into it. After Rau takes care of the bandits his ability as a warrior spreads far and wide. This leads to a mysterious man showing up in the tavern and offers Rau money for his services. Despite the uneasy feeling that Rau has about the man he accepts his offer. Rau returns home from his job to find that he's been taken advantage of by the mysterious man and his village has been attacked and destroyed. His mentor and adopted father, Baumusu, tells him of his path in life and that Rua must find his sister who was taken during the attack on the village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Mark of Kri&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
