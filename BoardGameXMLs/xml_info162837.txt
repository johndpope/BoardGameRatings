							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombicide: Experience Deck</name>
									
			<description>The Experience Deck includes 110 cards and introduces the brand new Experience Mode into the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this mode, Survivors are able to gain extra Skills as they progress through the game, and when you play a subsequent mission with that same Survivor, he gets to start with the special skills he acquired previously!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing in Experience Mode, the first time your Survivor reaches a new Danger Level, he not only gains his normal Skill, but he also gets to choose any Experience Card and place it next to his dashboard. Each card grants the Survivor a particular Skill, usually associated with a specific weapon. When the Survivor reaches the next Danger Level, he gets to choose one of his normal Skills, and also one more Experience Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you start a new Mission with that same Survivor, your Equipment and Experience reset normally, but Experience Cards are only discarded if the Survivor is eliminated for good. The Survivor begins the mission with his Blue Level Skill, as well as all Skills granted by the Experience Cards he gained so far. As he gains experience again, he will not get more Experience Cards for reaching a Danger Level he's already reached before. However, if he reaches a level he had not reached in a previous mission, he again chooses a new Experience Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that, in a normal game, a Survivor can only accumulate a maximum of 3 Experience Cards (one for the first time he reaches Yellow, one for the first time he reaches Orange, and one for the first time he reaches Red). However, if you play in Ultrared Mode, you might be able to gain even more Experience Cards as you reach levels beyond Red!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play with Resurrection Mode, the Zombivor version retains all Experience Cards as long as you're not eliminated. However, in subsequent mission you'll have to start as a Zombivor to keep the Experience Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
