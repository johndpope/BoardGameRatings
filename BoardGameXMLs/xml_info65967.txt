							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Course au Fret</name>
									
			<description>French game from the 1980s. Each player represents a transportation company that drives on the roads of France (depicted on the board) with their truck. At the start of the game each player chooses his truck in his preferred color. Each color is linked to a regional department and the player will start in the capital of that department (Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Nice or Brest). Each player also receives a starting capital of 62000 French Franks. Then the players draw a card that indicated what good they have to transport, the weight and to which city. As a return they get a reward if they deliver the goods in time but the trucks can be delayed along the road and they have to stop for gas or food as well. The player with the most money at the end of the game is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
