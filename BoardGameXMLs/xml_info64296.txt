			<description>The players shall be able to identify how different situations affect the food, shelter, and clothing sources of a culture. The learner will determine if the situation applies to his/her culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A board game format allows the players to use the information in a hands on situation. Instead of just discussing how situations affect cultures and their basic supplies, they will use the information and create a discussion in a game situation. The board game provides a means for which the students will discuss the cultures and its components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learners will preserve their own culture as well as trade and have contact with other cultures. This board game allows students to get what is needed in his/her culture without destroying another culture. This game hopes to teach how cultures should work together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first culture to have 10 tokens in each category and 1 craft token from the other three cultures wins the game .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     a board.&lt;br/&gt;     50 situation cards.&lt;br/&gt;     4 culture cards&lt;br/&gt;     4 culture figures&lt;br/&gt;     Pinto beans as tokens for each category of housing, food, and clothing.&lt;br/&gt;     6 Red, 6 pink, 6 black, and 6 white beans to represent the craft tokens &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
