			<description>Successful spies rely on information from the well-informed circles of the underworld. All data can be important - if not immediately, then perhaps later. Therefore the secret agents have to connect to important informants and meet them regularly. So they need a secret weekly schedule. Which Agent shall obtain his information on Monday? Which informant is to visit on Tuesday? And on which day should the meeting with the agent codenamed PURPLE take place? The player, who can crack this puzzle first, will be the winner and has really earned to be named &amp;quot;Top Agent&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
