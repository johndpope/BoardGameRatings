							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carcassonne f체r 2</name>
									
			<description>Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &amp;quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&amp;quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carcassonne f&amp;uuml;r 2 is a two-player version of Carcassonne that comes in a metal box and contains 48 tiles and 12 meeples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
