			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Cornucopia of Cretinous and Corrupt Character Types for Convicts &amp;amp; Cthulhu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The early days of European settlement in Australia are marked by scarcity and resource shortages. However, there is one thing that the colonies never seemed to have had a short supply of &amp;hellip; and that&amp;rsquo;s colourful and roguish characters. Whether it was immoral ne&amp;rsquo;er do-wells, ruthless peddlers in vice, or persons of virtue who had fallen on hard times &amp;ndash; the early penal colonies seemed to be a magnet drawing such depraved and degenerate sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this colourful melting-pot of corruption would have been a hellish place to have lived, it makes for an incredibly diverse and flavourful setting for roleplaying games of dark horror and mystery. There is literally no iniquity that a Keeper might dream up &amp;ndash; whether murder, depravity, or cannibalism &amp;ndash; that wasn&amp;rsquo;t somehow present in the backgrounds or deeds of historical characters of this era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ticket of Leave #5 #5 is a double-size supplement which revisits the brief character creation rules described in the original Convicts &amp; Cthulhu book. Where the original book gave templates for 14 different investigator &amp;quot;occupations&amp;quot;, this list is here expanded to more than forty. New character types include wily indigenous &amp;quot;bush constables&amp;quot;, convicts with &amp;quot;gentlemanly&amp;quot; backgrounds, stoic explorers &amp;amp; surveyors, and profit-hungry commercial mariners ... just to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accompanying these diverse character creation templates are a set of historical sketches for real-world &amp;quot;average folk&amp;quot; who occupied those roles in the colonies. These are provided with complete game stats allowing them to become either drop-in NPCs for a Keeper's C&amp;amp;C game or ready-to-play player investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
