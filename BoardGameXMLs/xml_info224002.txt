							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bedlam Depths</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bedlam Depths is a small chunk of a much larger whole. It is a game created based off of Manastorm, and takes place in Manastorm&amp;rsquo;s world of Paragon. In Bedlam Depths, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play and explore the entirety of the cave system and kill the monsters and bosses that are indigenous to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bedlam Depths has all of the basic elements of Manastorm, but it is not recommended to use it as your rulebook, as it only contains a small portion of what you need to experience all of Manastorm or all of Paragon. You may craft your character based on whatever ideals you wish, and your alignment is irrelevant. In the eyes of the people, your reputation is the only thing you&amp;rsquo;ll be remembered by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
