			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before we were anything, we were nothing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before we were together, we were alone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before we were Rangers, we were Boughless&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world as we know it is an infinite forest, so dense that sun rarely pierces the canopy. Beasts and monsters lurk in the shadows, ready to eat anything even remotely unprepared. The only place that's safe is inside massive, city sized trees, each housing a unique civilization - The Boughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is, of course, unless you join The Rangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you do, you'll face down Ember-Hounds, teeth dripping with liquid fire, you'll learn the secrets of the Wilds, and how to survive, hell, even thrive among the Shadowless and the Howlers. You'll be called on to stop wars between Boughs, ambush Yix dealers peddling their enchanted drugs, solve mysteries of the endless Firmament deep underground, and explore the outer reaches of the Wastes. You'll see things you wouldn't imagine, you'll tell stories even we won't believe. It's not safe, it's not comfortable and you can't count on fame and riches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But we will remember you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boughs cry out, we answer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boughs is a campaign setting designed for the Dungeon World RPG system, but can function as a system agnostic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
