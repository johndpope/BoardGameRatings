			<description>A compilation of puzzle video games published and developed by Nintendo for the GameCube home video game console. It was released in Japan, and was intended to be released in North America and Europe until it was announced that it was cancelled in both regions. It contains three video games: Dr. Mario 64, an enhanced remake of Yoshi's Cookie, and an enhanced remake of Panel de Pon (the Japanese version of Tetris Attack).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remake of Panel de Pon is a recompiled version of the previously unreleased Panel de Pon 64. Features include updated graphics and sound, new characters, and the 3D game mode first seen in Pok&amp;eacute;mon Puzzle League. Because Pok&amp;eacute;mon Puzzle League was the only version of Panel de Pon 64 to be released, the games share the same gameplay structure in terms of sporting the all new modes, except for the addition of a four-player versus mode not available in Pok&amp;eacute;mon Puzzle League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nintendo Puzzle Collection&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
