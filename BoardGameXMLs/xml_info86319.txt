The management of the Chamber of Screams decided to reward the employees with a mini-Halloween celebration held during normal business hours in the employee break room. The Haunted House typically shut down each night for a brief time period so the employees could get a break and straighten up their haunted scenes. It was rumored that management probably did this so the line of customers outside would build up and The Chamber of Screams would look twice as popular. Regardless of the reason for the break, the employees looked forward to the upcoming treat during their next shift at work. The Halloween Celebration kicked off without a hitch as the frightening cast members piled into the employee break area and enjoyed delicious creepy appetizers and eerie drinks while quizzing each other on challenging spooky trivia. They played a few hilarious games such as So You Think You Can Dance, the Creepy Disguise Challenge and the Horrific Rap Contest and then mingled about as they caught up on the latest gossip about the haunted house employees. A delicious dinner was served while the celebrators played the amusing Marvelous Movie Challenge. After dinner, some of the cast members engaged in the Writers, Producers, Directors and Actors challenge as a select few filtered back towards their scary scenes in the haunted house to get ready for the reopen. Unexpectedly, the lights went out and within a few minutes...to everyone's horror...a dead body was discovered! The employees scrambled to figure out whodunit before the police arrived. During the intense investigation, the employees took a break from the stress of it all and had a blast with the What Scary Thing Am I game and the Boisterous Balloon Battle. One of the cast members called in a quick favor from a police officer that quickly lifted fingerprints off the murder weapon so the investigators could be sure of their opinions of whodunit. Once everyone was ready, they took turns accusing who they believed the murderer was. Then, one by one, each person confessed to their involvement, if any, and the murder confessed! After a crazy escape attempt, the employees topped off their Halloween Celebration with the Happy Halloween Memory Game, the Chamber of Screams Charades and the Frightening Film Festival. Overall, it was a night at the Chamber of Screams that absolutely nobody will ever forget!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
