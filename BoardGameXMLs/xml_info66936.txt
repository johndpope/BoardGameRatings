			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpaceWorks: FirstLight takes your players inside and outside the starship of their dreams! Why spend money on 2-D tiles when you can have WorldWorks renowned expertly textured modular floor tiles, 3-D walls and props. You're not limited to one ship design with static prop placement; with FirstLight you can create a starship of unlimited size and complexity. From hulking space Junkers , small renegade cargo ships, space stations, underground bases or even alpha complex the possibilities are endless. Stellar adventures await the brave and the greedy in this fully realized starship construction kit. The sky is no longer the limit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sliding Doors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ingenious and surprisingly simple sliding doors show open and closed-door states. All that's missing is that hiss of compressed air as the doors slide in and out of position!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concealment &amp;quot;Room Covers&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've included innovative room and corridor covers that allow you to conceal each area of your ship as the play evolves. Remove room covers one at a time tracking player's movements and hiding crucial plot points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Props Galore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only do we give you the foundations to create a gargantuan starship but we've loaded it with props. From crew quarter elements, bridge systems, computer terminals and exterior communications/ordinance props, it's all in here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corridor gutters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all miniatures are slim space starlets with no weapons. FirstLight takes into account that your minis may have gargantuan plasma rifles and other weapons which make moving in tight spaces an issue. We've created half-inch gutters on each side of the modular corridors to facilitate the weapon clad combat you are bound to enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpaceWorks: FirstLight Includes all of the Following&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* 3x5-inch room modules (combine to create larger rooms and superstructures)&lt;br/&gt;    * 4x6-inch room modules with windows (combine to create larger rooms and superstructures)&lt;br/&gt;    * 1-inch sliding doors&lt;br/&gt;    * 6-inch corridor modules (combine to create larger corridors and superstructures)&lt;br/&gt;    * 9-inch corridor modules (combine to create larger corridors and superstructures)&lt;br/&gt;    * Bridge w/seats and science platform w/console&lt;br/&gt;    * Main reactor core w/external engine nozzle heads&lt;br/&gt;    * Peacemaker plasma turrets w/ guns&lt;br/&gt;    * Detachable escape pod w/double seats and console&lt;br/&gt;    * Multipurpose tub room w/external sensor mount&lt;br/&gt;    * Multi-use detachable cargo bays w/2-inch sliding doors and 3-inch hinged door elements&lt;br/&gt;    * Communications Radar dish&lt;br/&gt;    * Versatile antennas&lt;br/&gt;    * 1-inch cargo containers&lt;br/&gt;    * 2-inch cargo containers&lt;br/&gt;    * 2-inch corridor consoles and substructures&lt;br/&gt;    * Crew bunks&lt;br/&gt;    * Crew galley&lt;br/&gt;    * Crew lockers&lt;br/&gt;    * Crew table&lt;br/&gt;    * Crew argonomic chairs&lt;br/&gt;    * Tech suit locker&lt;br/&gt;    * 5 unique computer console designs (2x 2 in high, 2x 1/2 in high, double sided)&lt;br/&gt;    * Airlock w/roof&lt;br/&gt;    * Exterior finishing edging&lt;br/&gt;    * Exterior hull plating and roofing for all sections&lt;br/&gt;    * ladder&lt;br/&gt;    * Wedge hull forms to create unique exterior designs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
