							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lingo Word Dice</name>
									
			<description>Not to be confused with the Lingo games which are played with pegs, cards or scrabble-like tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 25 letter dice are placed at random into the spaces of the grid. The 12 scoring pegs are placed in the holes in the corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns to think of words beginning with the letters showing on the tops of the dice in the grid &amp;amp; each time a player names an acceptable word they remove the appropriate die from the grid &amp;amp; keep it (for scoring at the end of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the highest number of points !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
