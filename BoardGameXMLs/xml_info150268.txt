			<description>Each player has a 3x3 board that he randomly fills with tiles, which have parts of words. The rest of the tiles are shuffled and one of them is turned face-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to make a word matching the tile to one or more of their tiles on the board. The fastest one takes the tile and removes the used tiles from his board. The one who clears the board first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
