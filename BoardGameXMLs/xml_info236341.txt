			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After dealing with the Lotheed family of Meratt County, the PCs head to the city of Yanmass to learn that an imperialist merchant has begun a political campaign against Princess Eutropia. In addition to this political struggle, the heroes discover that the city is plagued with other troubles, including increased threats from Qadiran bandits, the disappearance of skilled Taldan cavalry, a plague of disturbing nightmares, and the rise of a mysterious cult who worships a figure known as the Twilight Child. Can the adventurers unravel the mysteries and solve the city's problems while supporting their patron's push for the throne, or will they fall victim to knives in the dark?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Twilight Child is a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure for 7th-level characters. The adventure continues the War for the Crown Adventure Path, as players drag a once-grand nation kicking and screaming into the modern day, becoming legendary politicians, spymasters, and nobles in their own right. A selection of new monsters, a look into the enigmatic psychopomps, and a gazetteer of the city of Yanmass round out this volume of the Pathfinder Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
