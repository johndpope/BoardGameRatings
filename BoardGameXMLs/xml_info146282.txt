							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Defenders of the Realm: Minions Expansion â€“ Undead</name>
									
			<description>A set of minions sculpted to look like Skeletons and Nightmares for the Defenders of the Realm game.  These new minion pieces will replace the generic ones from the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Kickstarter: The Undead Minions are the most terrifying troops of the Dark Lord&amp;rsquo;s Army. The most numerous of the Undead Minions are the ferocious Skeleton Warriors raised from the dead by powerful necromancers, terrifying the inhabitants of the Realm as they march unceasingly toward Monarch City. Riding in support of the Undead Skeletons are terrifying Nightmares, heartless creatures raised from the underworld, riding flaming stallions as they terrorize the villages and cities throughout the Realm. The Undead Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Skeleton Warriors and 5 Nightmares, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
