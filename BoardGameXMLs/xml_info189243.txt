It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Entry #1532; Stage One: David Rothfelder; Stage Two: Joe Jeskiewicz; Stage Three: Aaron Kesher&lt;br/&gt;Stage One and Two Title: Waiting Room&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was, perhaps, inevitable: The world was murdered. And we now live in the ruins of that&lt;br/&gt;murder, its shadows affecting our every action and interaction. We continue to live, though our&lt;br/&gt;world is a grave. Sometimes, though, someone has a vision of something different, a clue to the&lt;br/&gt;unasked question, &amp;quot;How was it the world was killed?&amp;quot; This vision opens a door into the House&lt;br/&gt;of Fear, the House of Dust---the House of Hades.&lt;br/&gt;And once you've been a guest in that House, well, things will never be the same again...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
