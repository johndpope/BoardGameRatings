			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This spelling game features lively graphics and sprites.  It's also a clever teaching aid for parents, teachers, and students in which spelling lessons can be reviewed and then practiced.  Originally written for the TI-99/4A with Extended BASIC, there are also versions for the VIC and 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've ever played Hangman, you won't have any trouble learning Mystery Spell.  Although it's similar in concept, there's a twist.  Instead of a gallows, you'll see colorful balloons, flying blackbirds, cheerful music, and a happy face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery Spell was written by Doug Hapeman and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 40, September 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
