							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Honest Andy&#039;s Used Card Dealership</name>
									
			<description>A short two player card game designed for 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using 20 cards from a standard poker deck, players take turns trying to sell cards to each other and make a profit.  The player selling can put lower value cards up for sale, but they run the risk of getting caught and losing their honest reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player faces a small &amp;quot;Prisoner's Dilemma&amp;quot; choice each round.  The player selling tries to guess what cards the other player is likely to buy.  The player buying cards must decide if the other player is being honest or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
