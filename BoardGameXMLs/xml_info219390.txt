			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In honor of the lunar Chinese New Year, Skirmisher Publishing is proud to announce the release of &amp;ldquo;Fire Rooster: A Monster for 5th Edition&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire Roosters are elemental animals made of living metal that have glowing red metallic feathers, are studded with numerous small gems, and have low flames wreathing their bodies. Beyond the elemental planes that are their native homes, such creatures are most likely to be found in places like volcanoes and temple complexes of deities with which they are affiliated, where they typically serve as guardians or beloved pets. In cultures that observe the Lunar New Year and adhere to the Asian Zodiac, spellcasters often summon Fire Roosters to take part in annual celebrations, where they are displayed, doted on, fed treats, and directed to continuously set off pyrotechnics for the duration of their visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
