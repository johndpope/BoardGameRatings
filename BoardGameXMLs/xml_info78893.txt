							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Naval Campaigns:  Guadalcanal</name>
									
			<description>Following the HPS simulations Jutland  and Tsushima, the first and second installments of the &amp;quot;Naval Campaigns series,&amp;quot;  Guadalcanal builds on the REAL-TIME game engine that allows the player to play against the computer or against another player, or multiple players, online.  Guadalcanal is a tactical battle simulation which models the individual  ships and capabilities and includes the landmasses of the islands which provide for maneuver challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes shore data for the famous Iron Bottom Sound including Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and the surrounding islands. Land blocks both movement and line-of-sight.&lt;br/&gt;bullet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radar has been added to the Naval Campaigns game engine allowing ships equipped with radar to spot enemy ships not within the limits of visibility. &lt;br/&gt;bullet    Radar detection has also been added which allows ships so equipped to detect ships with radar. &lt;br/&gt;bullet    The game database includes all of the ships that participated in the historical battles around Guadalcanal including battleships, destroyers, and PT boats. It also includes several extra ships like the Japanese battleship Yamato.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
