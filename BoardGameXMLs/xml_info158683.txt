			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 5 level, Black and White Blueprint of a Space Station. It is 40 inches by 40 inches at its widest point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Hex, Square and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This space station is said to have a multitude of advanced systems. B.F.C., Alpha Core. I.S.C. These are mere buzzwords, but I want to know more. Infiltrate the vessel, learn its secrets, and bring them to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Space Station is a hand-drawn, black and white, blueprint style map. The product includes five internal levels and an outer platform level of a large spaceship or space station. The five internal levels are the bridge, security, medbay, officer level, and crew level. Each individual area in the spacecraft is labeled and includes hand-drawn objects signifying all of the furnishings in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spacecraft is designed for adaptability. You can exclude levels that you do not need or have no place on the spaceship or space station. You can also make the spaceship or space station larger by using levels twice or more. The officer level has enough rooms for 4 officers and the crew level has enough rooms for 48 crewmen. By using all the levels this means you have enough space for a crew of 52. But you can add additional crew and officer levels to increase the population of the spaceship or space station to the desired level. For example, a second officer and crew level added allows for a crew of 104 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spacecraft is intended for use in science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Steal the Star: The new space station is a technical marvel. A rival space company wants to know everything about the station, so they can copy its functions. They hire a group of infiltrators to enter the space station as tourists, sneak into critical areas, and steal as much information about the space station as possible. The infiltrators could be the PCs or they could be new officers working on the space station that need to stop the infiltrators instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But why stop at just the blueprints and schematics? When the infiltrators discover that the I.S.C. can be used to propel the space station, they decide to hijack the whole space station instead either for themselves or take to their employer! It is up to the officers on the ship to stop them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
