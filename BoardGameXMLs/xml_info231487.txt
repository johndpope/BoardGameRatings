			<description>In How Does Your Garden Grow?, players want to tend to their garden, avoid pests that will eat their crops, and plant one of each of the six fruits and vegetables in the game. Whoever does this first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, each player draws six seeds from the seed pouch at random and places them on front of the six slots on their 3D game board. On a turn, a player draws and reveals the top card. If it's a fruit or veggie and they have the matching colored seed, they can place this card in their game board in the slot next to the seed. If they lack this colored seed, they can swap one of their seeds with a seed drawn at random from the bag; if this now matches the card, they can plant it; otherwise they must discard the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players might also draw a &amp;quot;Pick it!&amp;quot; card that allows them to steal a card from another player's garden, a &amp;quot;Pest&amp;quot; card that eats one card in your garden, or a &amp;quot;Helper&amp;quot; card that allows you to draw two cards, after which you play both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players continue taking turns until one of them has all six fruits and veggies in their garden, winning the game instantly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
