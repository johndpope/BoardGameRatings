			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;TAKE COMMAND!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A time of chaos and confusion. A time of trials and troubles. A time colored in war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflicts continually rage across the Classic BattleTech universe. Raise your faction&amp;rsquo;s flag as you wage war across alien worlds for king and empire, seeking your place in legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos Campaign ebook is a free download, providing the core rules for the open-ended &amp;quot;track&amp;quot; campaign framework. This source enables gamemasters and players to use a variety of published tracks (such as those found in the Jihad Plot Sourcebooks of Blake Ascending, Jihad Hot Spots: 3072, and the Jihad Turning Points e-books) and combine it with forces of their own creation to play out pivotal moments in BattleTech history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each track that plugs into the Chaos Campaign rules system (there are no tracks found in this Chaos Campaign PDF) provides a back story that fits into the overall campaign plot. Likewise, each track is set up as a general framework to assist gamemasters and players in creating the opposing forces and adding other battlefield effects specific to that track. In addition, using the Warchest Point System, player groups may choose what direction the campaign takes. The Total Warfare core rulebook is required to use the Chaos Campaign. Tactical Operations and Strategic Operations are recommended for use with the Chaos Campaign.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
