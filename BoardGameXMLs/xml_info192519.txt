			<description>In After Days: Survival is Everything! each player takes the role of a pair of Post-Apocalyptic survivors working cooperatively with other players to provide for the group and deal with the threats arrayed against them. Each turn players send one of their two survivors, each has a specific ability, into harm's way to gather supplies by pulling three random dice and rolling them. Each dice has four possible resource outcomes: food, protection, shelter, and scrap which can be converted and used by certain Survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survivors must then nullify the threats arrayed against them such as devastating weather breakouts which cause a wound for each resource not met. Roving bands of marauders that continue to come back on subsequent turns if not dealt with swiftly. Finally, the risen dead refuse to go down until all of the dead have their resources met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To nullify threats Survivors must provide the resources required on each threat card either using rolled dice or Survivor card abilities. Deal with all the threats and take no wounds. Fail to deal with a threat and it injures one of your Survivors, which can cost you the game. Survive six turns with at least one Survivor still alive and you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each version of the game supports up to four players so feel free to combine two games to have up to eight players fight for their survival!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
