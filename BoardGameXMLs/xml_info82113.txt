			<description>Source: Shrapnel Games, Inc..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;winSPWW2, a game of Combined Arms Tactical Combat 1930-1946, is the latest and greatest version of what began as a classic super-mod for the classic SSI title, Steel Panthers 2: Modern Battles. Now completely updated to take advantage of the Windows operating system, winSPWW2 completely sheds its DOS roots and brings tactical turn-based strategy gamers one of the most rewarding and engrossing titles they'll ever play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;winSPWW2 is available as either a free download or as an enhanced CD edition. The core game remains the same in either version, but the CD edition provides a wealth of additional enhancements designed to improve your overall game experience, such as secure tournament play and a more robust map editor. Serious wargamers will definitely appreciate all the bonuses that the enhanced CD edition has to offer, but with hundreds of scenarios and a strong community, you can't go wrong with either edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
