							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Right to The White House</name>
									
			<description>Right to The White House is a comedic party game. Its cards are themed after the Republican 2016 primary debate. Each card includes a debate topic, a picture of a candidate, and a quote from a televised debate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's starting tableau consists of a draw deck, a discard pile, and a hand of seven cards for each player. Players compete to be the first to discard all their cards, similar to Uno or Skip-Bo. Play proceeds in turns around a circle. Each player must discard or draw one card on his or her turn. Players can only discard a card if the debate topic marked on it matches the topic of the card on the top of the discard pile. When one player discards all their cards, each remaining player accrues points based on the number of cards left in their hand. The game is then reset and continues for three more rounds (or until one player's score exceeds an agreed maximum score).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two special card types introduce a mechanic that requires all players to speak and act ultra-right wing at all times when playing. The Conservative Challenge cards allows one player to challenge another if they detect any behavior that is not sufficiently conservative (as judged by a vote of all other players). The loser of a Conservative Challenge must draw extra cards. A second special card, the Trump Card, allows players to automatically win any conservative challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
