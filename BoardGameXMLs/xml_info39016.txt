							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mardi Gras 3000</name>
									
			<description>Mardi Gras 3000 is a new CCG with a haunting atmosphere and lush, intelligent back story. Players strategically build a modular game board from randomly selected Terrain cards. Once the board is set, players move their customized character stacks to do battle, capture the Grail, and harness its power in a Cathedral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operating on the innovative Stacked system that allows players to build their characters from interchangeable, self-regulating, interactive cards, Mardi Gras 3000 has nearly endless variations in play; Neither the board nor the characters are ever the same.  The cards have holes in them and when stacked, allow, or disallow abilities to be in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to be a Terrapyre (children of fallen angels) or Celestial (four dimensional being) both fighting for the Holy Grail during the Neutral Hour on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
