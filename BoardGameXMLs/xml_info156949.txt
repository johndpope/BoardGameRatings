			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bombs fell. Billions died. Now you must pick up the pieces and rebuild this Broken Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Earth is an adventure setting that takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Earth. It deals with a small fraction of the world, what was once the northern Midwest of the United States, and a tiny bit of southern Central Canada. As an adventure setting, Broken Earth includes many compelling locations and adventures, but also gives the heroes freedom to explore the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book gives the GM everything you need to run a prolonged campaign in the Broken Earth setting, including locations, NPCs, plot points, mutant monsters, and a detailed first adventure that brings the party together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also contains everything in the Broken Earth Player's Guide. If you are a player in a Broken Earth campaign you might want to check out the Player's Guide instead. If you are a GM you should just get this book. You do NOT need both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
