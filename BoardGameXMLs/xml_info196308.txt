							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Limbo of the Lost</name>
									
			<description>Limbo of the Lost is a traditional point-and-click adventure game that follows the adventures of Benjamin Briggs, captain of the Mary Celeste, as he explores the depths of Limbo in the Keep of Lost Souls. It was the only game developed by Majestic Studios, a studio founded in 1993 and consisting of Steve Bovis, Tim Croucher and Laurence Francis. The studio initially aimed to bring back the graphical text adventure genre on the Atari ST, and later the Amiga 500, culminating in a demo shown at the ECTS in 1995. Due to sinking demand of these platforms, the game was instead redeveloped for the PC and released in March 2008. In June 2008, discovery of plagiarism in the game led to its withdrawal from sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbo_of_the_Lost Limbo of the Lost]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
