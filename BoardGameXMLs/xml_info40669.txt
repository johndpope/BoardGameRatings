			<description>[From the box back]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Time to throw your best combinations and shout out loud.  With a little strategy and luck, you'll be the first to get rid of all your cards to win this lively game of pivotal plays.  How many times can you Zap?  Is it time to Bam?  Can you plan ahead to Pow at just the right moment?  A game of cards never looked or sounded so fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;60 Cards&lt;br/&gt;3 Start Cards&lt;br/&gt;Rules of Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this simple card game, players take turns playing their cards to one of 3 piles, initially in the three suits of Zap, Bam and Pow.  When playing a card, it must match either suit or number of the card being played on, with a matching number switching the suit of the current pile and allowing the player to continue his turn.  The first player to play out all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
