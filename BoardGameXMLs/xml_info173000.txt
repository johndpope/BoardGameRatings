			<description>You take control of six cars with the aim of being the first to drive them across the city and park them in their designated bays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has six cars and a set amount of money. Each car has a traffic sign associated with it and they must be parked in the correct bay on the opposite side of the board from where they start.&lt;br/&gt; The board is in a grid with some squares being blank, others with a 'hazard' (where a fine must be paid), others redirect the player in a different direction and another square awards the player with money for good 'road craft' The first player to park their cars is the winner. Any player who becomes bankrupt automatically loses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
