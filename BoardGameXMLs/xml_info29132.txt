							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly: Turkish or Istanbul</name>
									
			<description>This is simply the Turkish version of Monopoly.  It is essentially the same as the standard Monopoly game and other variations, but in Turkish with the properties all being places in Istanbul.  In the current version, two of the railroads are replaced with ferry terminals.  The chance and community chest cards are apparently based on the British version and thus lack pictures aside from an arrow for advancing to Go and bars for going to jail.  They also differ slightly from the modern American cards and are closer to the older American version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
