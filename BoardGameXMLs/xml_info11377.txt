			<description>Void contains five two-player games and numerous solitaire puzzles.  The two-player games are: Void, Avoid, Row-of-Four, Null-and-Void, and Tic-Tac-Void.  Of these, the best is Null-and-Void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components include a small roll-up vinyl board with 16 circular spaces forming a 4x4 grid; eight yellow plastic discs and eight green plastic discs, and the box and rules.  Half of each color of the discs have a single arrow on them, and half have a double arrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avoid -- The object is to play the last piece. Played pieces point orthogonally or diagonally to another space. Single arrows point to spaces one spaces away and double arrows point to spaces two spaces away. After the first piece is played subsequent plays must be to a space which does not have a piece on the board pointing to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Null-and-Void -- Start by filling your half of the board with your pieces, alternating single and double arrows so that each type is diagonally adjacent to like pieces and orthogonally adjacent to the opposite type.  Remove one of your opponent's pieces from the game, and she does the same to you.  Take turns moving a piece into an adjacent void, pointing the arrow at an opponent's piece.  Double arrows point to pieces two spaces away.  Pieces may point orthogonally or diagonally.  Flip the piece pointed at: it's out of the game for this round.  The round ends when one player doesn't have a move.  At that point, score one point for the last player to make a legal move, flip all the pieces face up, and continue from that position.  Keep playing rounds until one player has six points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Row-of-Four -- 4 in a row Tic-tac-toe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Void -- The object is to play the last piece. Played pieces point orthogonally or diagonally to an empty space into which the next piece must be played. Single arrows point to spaces one spaces away and double arrows point to spaces two spaces away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tic-Tac-Void --&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
