			<description>An RPG for Kids and Adults&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goobles &amp;amp; Goblins is a pen-and-paper role-playing game for parents to play with their children, or for any adult to play with the kids in their life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young players will take on the role of courageous heroes as they embark on fantastic quests in a fantasy world filled with danger (and just a bit of silliness). The adult running the game becomes the Storyteller, guiding the creation of the game world and populating it with strange creatures, legendary treasures, and all manner of challenges for the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young heroes will need all of their Strength, Speed, and Smarts (as well as a healthy dose of imagination) in order to achieve their legendary destinies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
