			<description>WORD MOLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the Word Mole game is to form words using the letters in the garden. If you form a word using letters that are directly above, below, or beside each other in the garden, you receive new letters which you can use to form new words. Otherwise, holes appear in the garden, making it harder to form new words. You can replace a hole with a new letter by forming a word that uses a letter that is beside the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a single-player game, you complete a level by submitting enough words to reach the required point goal before the time expires. In a practice game, you have unlimited time to play a game. In a multiplayer game, you compete against other players to win awards for achievements such as submitting the longest word, or receiving the least number of holes.&lt;br/&gt; From the Game Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
