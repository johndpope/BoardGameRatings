							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spiro T. Agnew American History Challenge</name>
									
			<description>Long before trivia games were in vogue, Vice President Spiro Agnew lent his name to a trivia game based on United States history.  The game features question cards in five categories: Age of Exploration, Colonies &amp;amp; Independence, Expansion Westward, Industrialization, and 20th Century America, as well as bonus cards such as Sing-Along Cards and Recitation Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question cards contain five questions in increasing difficulty.  Answers are not verified unless someone challenges the responder, in which case the correct answer is looked up in the back of the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
