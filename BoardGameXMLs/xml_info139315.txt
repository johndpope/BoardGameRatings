							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nameless Nil, the Beggar of Self</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If 'to be or not to be' is the question, this is the wrong answer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dream, something can arise from nothing&amp;mdash;but what happens when that something doesn't want to go back? The bizarre almost-being called Nameless Nil is a disjointed accumulation of identity that shambles through the Tarnished Souk, begging for dreams and gobbling up stray items of power. Disturbingly, for a creature with dozens of faces it can wear, not a one feels like its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Game Masters with details on a mask-made moocher found amongst the Faces of the Tarnished Souk, ready for immediate use in any campaign&amp;mdash;but especially for use within the Coliseum Morpheuon. Each entry features ingenious stat-blocks from multiple OGL sources, history, motivation, secrets, and insight into the NPC&amp;rsquo;s most carefully guarded dreams, along with complete game statistics for low, middle, and high levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Nameless Nil, a hungry hobo with faces a-go-go&lt;br/&gt;    CR 21 Bloody maw half-construct horrifically overpowered hungry nightmare unfettered eidolon savant 10&lt;br/&gt;    CR 13 Half-construct horrifically overpowered hungry nightmare unfettered eidolon* savant 3&lt;br/&gt;    CR 6 Half-construct horrifically overpowered unfettered eidolon* savant 1&lt;br/&gt;    New magic items including biting belts, dangerously pointy robes, and the relic seven league boots&lt;br/&gt;    Using more wonderfully Horrifically Overpowered feats from the tricky devils at Super Genius Games!&lt;br/&gt;    And, featuring the ingenious savant class&amp;mdash;from the pages of Kobold Quarterly #18!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
