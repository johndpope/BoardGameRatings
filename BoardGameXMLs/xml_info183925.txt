			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not the continuation of Denizon's Folly.  That one is still in the works.  It's a Trap! is a encounter adventure where you will meet a troll named Kent who has a particular fondness for sheep, but not in the bad way.  And also included is a a god that would have been suitable for Petty Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure has a couple of Easter Eggs for one of my patrons out there.  I'm curious to see if that patron discovers them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map for this adventure was also a bit of an experiment.  I use white notecards to draw my maps on.  This time I used a beige colored notecard to see how it would interact with the colors.  It is a bit clumsy, but I can see how it would be effective in a badlands, scrub, wasteland type of areas.  I'll have to experiment more with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
