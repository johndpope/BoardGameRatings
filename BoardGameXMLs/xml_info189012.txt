							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&#039;Erets Campaign Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery in the Earliest and Most Epic of Ante-Deluvian Ages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before Conan ruled Aquilonia... Before Kull ruled Valusia... Before Elric ruled Melnibone... and even before Sauron ruled them all, there was 'Erets. It is the dawn of mankind. Magic is ruled by the Wizards of Daitya, and is usurped by the Sorcerers of Nod. The ancient gods of men live, eat and sleep in the cold north with their human subjects and Dwarven friends, battling serpent men and beast men who try to claim Vanaheim and Asgard for their own. Hell itself can be crossed by foot in the blasted lands of Acheron and Stygia, bordered by the River Styx. Great galleons climb the ether to the moon, and men can touch the astral plane at the edges of the world. The alien Eldar, with their Halfling kin, hide from man and Lemurian alike.  The giant Nephiyl, star-spawn of the Great Cthulhu, rule on land and in the sea. And beings completely alien and inimical to man dominate the land and seas of Mu to the far south. The world of 'Erets is classic Sword and Sorcery with just a hint of Epic Fantasy, as larger than life Heroes battle monsters and alien gods for man&amp;rsquo;s survival in his earliest days&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
