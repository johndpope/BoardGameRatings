							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Life: My Little Pony</name>
									
			<description>Spring had sprung in Equestria. As the days grew longer and the weather grew hotter, Princess Celestia realized it was getting closer and closer to the Summer Sun Celebration. But there was so much to prepare in Equestria! So, she did what any good leader would do: she delegated! And now you and your friends can play as Ponies as you help prepare Equestria for the party in My Little Pony Game of Life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Little Pony Game of Life sets players on a course preparing Equestria, but also learning the importance of friendship. You'll gain friends and earn Friendship Points, which will help you overcome obstacles, find supplies for the celebration, and get back to Ponyville in enough time to party down. Plus, you get four collectible Pony pieces, different from (but in the same scale as) the pieces in My Little Pony Monopoly (so all the Ponies can play together). My Little Pony Game of Life proves that the most important things in life are the friends you make along your journey through it. Awwww.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
