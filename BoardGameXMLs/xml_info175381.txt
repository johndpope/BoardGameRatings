							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: Pizza-Memo</name>
									
			<description>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles need their pizzas badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the 16 pizza pieces facedown and lay them in a 4x4 pattern facedown on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a Turtle board with its 9 matching counters. On his turn, a player turns pizza pieces face up as long as they all are matching. He stops after the first different piece and turns all pieces facedown. Then it's the next players turn. If a player happens to find all four pieces, he fills his Turtle board with four of his nine counters. The second completed pizza only nets three counters, the third two counters and the fourth and last pizza only one counter. When all four pizzas are found, the pieces are shuffled and placed anew. The first player to place all his nine counters on his turtle board wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
