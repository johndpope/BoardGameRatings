							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cosmic Intruders</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this real-time video game, you try to shoot down the space creatures before they get close enough to your ship to destroy it. There are different types of intruders, each having a different point value. If you don't get them in your laser sights, and shoot them down quickly, then they will grow so large that they will crash into your ship! Cosmic Intruders was written in machine language to provide high speed action and amazing sound effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the screen you will see three different zones. When an intruder is in the center zone, you may fire and destroy it. However, you may only fire when an asterisk appears in the left corner. After your laser is fired, it takes two seconds to recharge and for the asterisk to reappear. In the second zone you cannot hit an intruder but you are still in danger--the intruder may become very large and crash into you! The outside zone is the boundary in which the intruders are visible. It will usually be possible to recall an intruder that has recently moved off the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time remaining is displayed in the upper right, and the score is shown in the upper left. There are three different types of intruders, each having a different point value. These are the Z-shaped space probe, the triangular alien space ship, and the cosmic intruder himself. Each is worth a different amount of points. You will find that the aliens with higher point values are more difficult to destroy, while at the same time will move easily to destroy you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An asteroid sometimes appears. This huge mess of interstellar rock cannot be destroyed, but it is dangerous as it can crash into you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
