			<description>A card game of fantasy combat for two or more players. The game uses a deck with eight types of cards: Heroes, Weapons, Armor, Mounts, Armies, Actions, Traits, and Spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, the players draw hands of twelve cards. The players simultaneously play a meld of one hero and one other card from the other seven types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players then take turns activating cards in their meld. Depending on the type of card activated, this may allow players to add to their melds, to draw new cards from the deck, or to cause an opponent's card to be discarded. A player may also choose to pass rather than activating a card. If all of the players consecutively pass, the round ends and the winner of the round is determined based on the total force value of each player's meld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to win five rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer notes: &amp;quot;I was working on a Heroscape mod and this is where I wound up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
