							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">M4: Sherman Tank Simulator</name>
									
			<description>10 DECEMBER 1844: SOMEWHERE IN THE ARDENNES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pale dawn is just breaking over the distant tree-lined hills when your M4's radio receiver suddenly crackles to life: &amp;quot;Charlie two, Charlie two, this is Charlie one... Message... over.&amp;quot; Reaching down through the open turret hatch your gunner hits the transmit button. &amp;quot;Charlie two... You will proceed to and secure sector coordinates 5206... Confirm... over.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All five of you breath a collective sigh of relief. No mention of counter attack. No mention of Tigers nor Panthers on the prowl. While the other four members of your crew load and store a new supply of armor piercing shells , you hunker down in front of the transmitter and dial up the recon company four or five clicks down the road. &amp;quot;Recon One, wait... I got nothing to the North of you... I got light weapons, personnel carriers, trucks due East of your position...&amp;quot; No sweat. A quick glance at the map, a weather check with the Met office in Paris, and you are ready to go.  Sector 5206 reveals itself to be the village of St. Hubert, half a days drive to the East along pretty good roads. No need for air support today; no need to call in the artillery. You can handle the next few hours on your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Load a round of HE in the main gun, Harry we're moving out in five minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Gunner, Loader, Driver and Assistant clamber aboard and settle in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Driver due East.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The engines roar to life. The tank pivots out of it's hiding place in the tree-line. The familiar squeak of the track links lend a rhythmic  note to the motor's rumble as you move slowly down the road -- one day closer to Germany. One more day of trying to stay alive. One more day of never really knowing what lies ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is this a game? Was WWII... a game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Bomber author, Rene Vidmer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
