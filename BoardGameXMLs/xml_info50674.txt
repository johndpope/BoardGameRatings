							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Cthulhu</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For most people, the world appears to be a relatively safe place, filled with the usual problems associated with day to day living. There are no monsters beneath the bed, nothing waiting in the darkness...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But for others, there is the maddening truth; unimaginable horrors lurk in dark places beyond the world we know, horrific things who regard humanity as little more than cattle; insignificant creatures to be used and cast aside at their whim. Ever watchful, they seek to pry open the gates to this realm, to reclaim that which was once theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some, so-called enlightened individuals choose travel the dark paths, seeking to gain knowledge never intended for human eyes, seeking arcane tomes and malefic artifacts in hopes of knowing the unknowable, even at the cost of their sanity. Indeed, at the cost of their very lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For you, the choice is clear, the imperative undeniable. Seek out that which should not be. Stand ever vigilant against the horrors lurking in the dark. Walk in the shadows of Cthulhu, and perhaps, if you're lucky, you may survive, may even make a difference, though the cost might be more than you're prepared to pay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadows of Cthulhu makes use of the elegant True20 game system, providing you with everything you need to run a campaign series in deliciously maddening the world  inspired by the works of H.P Lovecraft!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
