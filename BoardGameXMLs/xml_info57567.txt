							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Academe Mentus</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file represents a radical new concept in 3.5 edition psionics, the total departure from the &amp;ldquo;spell look-alike&amp;rdquo; problems that has plagued them since their introduction during 3rd edition.&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find the core of a new psionics system that is not only stable and reliable, but also feels very different from magic. This is by far not a complete recap of psionics, but instead serves as a kind of player&amp;rsquo;s primer on them. Any player after reading this can make and play a balanced and flavorful psionic character. Any Game Master can handle the presence of psionics at his table without difficulty after doing the same. However, there ARE elements missing that would be necessary to fully incorporate psionics into a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;The missing elements will be released in the upcoming product Psionics Ascendant, also from DaemonEye publishing. That book will contain expansions on the items introduced in Academe Mentus, as well as (but not limited to) the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Psionic races, and how many races adapt to the existence of psionics.&lt;br/&gt;    More psionic prestige classes, including adaptations of all those released to date by DaemonEye Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;    More Psionic and Metapower feats, a well as more feats that affect them.&lt;br/&gt;    A new psionic item creation system, complete with random treasure tables.&lt;br/&gt;     Full adaptations of all psionic monsters previously covered by DaemonEye Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;     Several psionic organizations and civilizations.&lt;br/&gt;     A chapter on psionic theory.&lt;br/&gt;     A chapter discussing psionic campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;     Several example psionic NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
