			<description>The object of the game is to be the first to win three hands.  In each hand, players aim to play all of his/her cards before the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a plastic play mat.  It basically outlines where each player plays his/her cards and where the stockpile is placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to match the exact sum of the previous play with one or more cards from their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
