			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you want characters to react to the emotional impact of battle? Do you want them to run when it would be a good idea for them to run, for a change? If so, welcome to Shock &amp;amp; Awe! This set of rules is about morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've rebuilt morale from the ground up, adhering to the OGL system's logic to make a rules set that's easy to work with. Morale becomes a point system; stress depletes it and anything from flight to stirring speeches renews it. We call this ablative morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this in force, characters need more than a weapon and a steady hand. They need the will to fight - and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what you get: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     What Is Ablative Morale? We answer this with rules for morale hit dice, attacks and damage. &lt;br/&gt;     Morale Damage Types and Special Effects. Dread, terror, creature and energy types ? not all morale damage means the same thing. This includes guidelines for morale-affecting spells and FX. &lt;br/&gt;     New Feats and Optional Rules. This section includes new feats, talent tress and rules for propaganda campaigns and insanity. These guidelines let you connect the system to character creation and customize it for horror genre games. Unify combat morale with supernatural terror in one system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
