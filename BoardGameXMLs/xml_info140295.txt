							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tavern by the Sea (UK)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tavern by the Sea, by Ken St Andre and Andy R Holmes, is a mini solitaire adventure for use with the Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls role-playing system.It has been designed for use with version 7.5 of the rules but could be adapted for use with earlier editions. Because this is a Mini-Solo Dungeon, no acts of magic will be allowed by the players -- don't use wizards in this scenario. You may use any humanoid (except Fairies or Giants) of 3rd level or lower, but this is a good opportunity to create a new character at the start of this adventure.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hundred miles south of Knor lies the fishing village of Frargg, home to the infamous Seven Ayes Tavern. The Seven Ayes has become synonymous with all manner of seaside tavern life including brawling, sea shanties, gambling, ruffians and pirates. It is also a good place for adventures to begin, and to end. Step inside, where your next adventure awaits, but tread with care my friend, as danger lurks within and death could be just a moment away&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This special UK version of this solo features additional material as well as completely new artwork by Jeff Freels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
