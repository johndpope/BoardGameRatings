			<description>From &amp;quot;... and the sky full of dust&amp;quot; blog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure itself is loosely based on an adventure my dad ran for us back when I was a young lad. We fought the Greenies, got sick from radiation poisoning, and won in the end (I think we drove them off). I made them the focus of a story I wrote, where they were greatly enhanced by battle armour with missiles and machine guns, killing off characters al over the place. Happy memories :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
