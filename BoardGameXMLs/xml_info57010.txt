							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thief&#039;s Gold</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Governor Drunn tosses a handful of gold coins on the table in front of you. &amp;quot;This is what I'm talking about,&amp;quot; he huffs. The shining coins are stamped with the image of a hand in a sack, rather than the city's seal as you would have expected. &amp;quot;It's the bloody thieves and their damned guild that did it! They broke into the treasury a week ago and emptied it of every last gold coin. Then they re-minted it with their symbol and handed it out on the streets. We acted as quickly as we could and confiscated whatever stolen coin we could find, but it was impossible to get it all. To make matters worse, now people are using it as legal currency in the markets - the traders from outside the city don't know the difference. So now we look like the bad guys for taking people's money and the blasted thieves look like heroes - even though they've stolen the people's money from their government and handed out only a small fraction of it. &amp;quot;We've had problems with this guild before and have made efforts to shut it down. The City of Kaaliqar has even passed new laws with harsher penalties for guild-related crimes, but things have only gotten worse! Out own knights and guardsmen can do very little about the situation - no one will give out any information about the thieves or the gold. I'm relying on you to track down the thieves, capture them, and recover the stolen gold. &amp;quot;The thieves are passing out more gold every day - you must act quickly!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
