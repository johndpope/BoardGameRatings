			<description>Super Bases Loaded 2 (known in Japan as Super 3D Baseball -- not Super Professinal Baseball 2, which is a different game) is a Super NES baseball game. The game is the sixth overall installment of the Bases Loaded series, and second installment of the secondary series for the Super Nintendo's Super Bases Loaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battery backup allowed players to save several categories of statistics for all 14 teams in the two leagues and not just their own. The DSP chip allowed a rudimentary 3-D perspective for batting and sometimes infield play. When players swung, their own individual numbers appeared on the back of their jerseys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were seven teams each in the &amp;quot;Alpha League&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Omega League&amp;quot; that went by city names only, and often borrowed symbols from those of the original Super Bases Loaded. The nicknames in quotation marks are those of the original SBL teams for whom the symbols were based, but do not appear in the game. The Alpha League consisted of the Boston &amp;quot;Kings,&amp;quot; the Chicago &amp;quot;Lizards,&amp;quot; the Cleveland &amp;quot;Stars,&amp;quot; the Detroit &amp;quot;Storm,&amp;quot; the Kansas City &amp;quot;Tornadoes&amp;quot;, Oakland &amp;quot;Eagles&amp;quot;, and Seattle &amp;quot;Blue Wave&amp;quot;. The Omega League consisted of the Atlanta &amp;quot;Weasels,&amp;quot; Houston &amp;quot;Doves&amp;quot;, the Los Angeles &amp;quot;Cyclops,&amp;quot; the New York &amp;quot;Mercs,&amp;quot; Philadelphia &amp;quot;Bruins&amp;quot;, the Pittsburgh &amp;quot;Buzzards,&amp;quot; and the San Francisco &amp;quot;Amoebas.&amp;quot;  In addition, there were four edit teams: Urbana, Rockford, Peoria, and Aurora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Bases Loaded 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
