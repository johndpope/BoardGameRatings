			<description>In What Do You See? Colors, players choose face-down cards, trying to be the first to complete a set and win the game. There are three different ways to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Search and Match Colors - Each player takes a card marked with a colored star designating which color he or she will collect. Picture cards are placed face-up in the center of the table. Each player in turn takes a card to match their color. If the color matches, the player keeps the card. If not, he or she must put it back. Play continues until all players have six matched color cards. This game is for very young players, and is meant to teach color recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Seven That Match - This game is played similarly to Search and Match Colors. In this version, each player has two color cards to match. Cards are placed face down. Players pick one card at a time and try to match it to one of their cards. If it matches, the player keeps the card. If not, it goes back to the center face down. The first player to collect six cards matching the color of one of his or her star cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     What Color Do You See? - In this version, each player has a game board with spaces for eight different colors. All cards are placed face-down on the table. Players take turns choosing a face-down card. If the player doesn't yet have the color, he or she covers the corresponding space on his or her card. If he or she does have the color, the card goes back face down. In this version, there are also wild cards, which can be placed on any color. The first player to cover all colors on the card wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
