							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yakari: Das Kartenspiel</name>
									
			<description>Yakari and his friends have forgotten the time while playing, and the players have to help find them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is played using five decks of 22 cards: one deck for each player and one tribal deck. Each deck contains two types of cards:&lt;br/&gt;- Friend cards, which show one, two or three persons (Yakari or one of his friends)&lt;br/&gt;- Special cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games is played in rounds. At the start of the game, player shuffle the decks. Each player draws two cards from his own player deck. At the start of each round, the top card of the tribal deck is revealed. If it is a special card, some event is triggered. Otherwise, each player selects one of his cards to play and scores points depending on how many friends the played card shares with the tribal card. A player can also play one of his own special cards, which will also trigger some special effect: no player scores points, the player may retrieve on of his played cards, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all players are out of cards, or when the tribal deck runs out of cards. The player who has scored the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
