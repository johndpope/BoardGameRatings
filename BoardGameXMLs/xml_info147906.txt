			<description>In M&amp;auml;rchenball, the princesses have come from across the country to the fairy tale ball. Each princess wants to dance with Prince Charming, so he's a busy guy on the dance floor. Find your way into his arms, though, and you'll receive a star from him as a thank you. The first princess to collect four stars from Prince Charming has also won his heart &amp;mdash; and the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
