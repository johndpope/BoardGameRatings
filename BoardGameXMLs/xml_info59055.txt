							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Port Module Number One: Hotel Complex (PDF with Extras)</name>
									
			<description>User summary incorporating material from product introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product details some of the features that are found in the luxury hotels that might be visited on a variety of planets by Traveller adventures. These hotels are presented in a modular format. The number and type of accomodation floors, the exact entertainment facilities, and the overall size of each hotel can be varied according to the modules used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original 1981 box set contains five 17&amp;quot; by 22&amp;quot; 15mm floorplans and a 16-page booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2009 Electronic (PDF version) contains material from the original box set plus more material and maps from a second unpublished box set. The combined material from these two sets would be equivalent to the amount of material in earlier items in the Adventure class ship series with a total of thirteen flooplans. &lt;br/&gt;This is presented as two PDF files. The first contains the full text of the original Book from the box set plus the additional unpublished book, edited to include Deck Plan images within the text,  5.5&amp;quot; by 8.5&amp;quot; same as original books. (39 pages) The second is Deck Plans collected from original loose leaf sheets, plus additional unpublished designs, in an 8.5&amp;quot; by 11&amp;quot; format, half the size of the originals from the box set. (14 pages)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
