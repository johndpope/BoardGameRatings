			<description>Each player takes one surfer and places him in his Windsurfing School (Start). The dice are then thrown in turn. Each player moves his surfer forwards according to the number of spots on the dice. When a player stops on a particular picture space, he has to follow the instructions on that space (for example, miss a turn). If two surfers stop on the same space, the surfer who is already on the space has to move six spaces back. He need not follow the instructions on the space on which he finally stops!&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the Player who is the first to get back to the Surf School (Finish).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
