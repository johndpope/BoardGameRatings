			<description>&amp;ldquo;PREMISE: This plays like a cross between Chess and Backgammon. SET UP: Regular Chessboard and pieces plus two dice. OBJECT: Move all of your men to your opponents back row.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player rolls two dice to determine which pieces may be moved (a chart assigns each number on a d6 to one type of chess piece). Pieces may only be moved forward or sideways, not backward. However, a piece can only capture when it is moving forwards. When a piece is captured it is returned to the back row of the owning player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short-game variant provides that the game is won by the first player to move a King off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
