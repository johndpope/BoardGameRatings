							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fancy Nancy Hide &amp; Peek Game</name>
									
			<description>Help Nancy find all her fancy accessories in this 3D board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build Nancy's two story house, making eight rooms that Nancy has misplaced her 16 accessory pieces in the 24 possible places in the house. The accessories are round tokens that are randomly placed in 24 slots (three available in each room).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the 32 cards (two of each accessory) are shuffled and players take turns, drawing a card from the pile and attempting to location the making token, showing everyone the chosen token. If it matches the card, you keep the token and the card. If not, you put the token back, and put the card at the bottom of the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the card you draw is one someone has already matched, set it aside and draw again. The first player to find 4 accessories wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For younger players allow them to look at the tokens they are placing in the various slots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
