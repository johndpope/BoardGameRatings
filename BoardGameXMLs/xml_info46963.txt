			<description>&amp;quot;I Dadi, i Cavallier, l'Arme e gli Amori&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first supplement for &amp;quot;Orlando Furioso&amp;quot;, containing two complete adventures. The title &amp;quot;I Dadi, i Cavallier, l'Arme e gli Amori&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;I sing of dice and ladies, of love and arms&amp;quot;, after the first verse of the poem) is the name of a writing contest for the best adventure for &amp;quot;Orlando Furioso&amp;quot;. The first adventure in the book is the winner of the contest: &amp;quot;Per terre e per mari&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Along land and seas&amp;quot;) by Lorenzo Trenti, a humorous module for 3/5 characters. The players have to find a fabulous item that will heal King Charles, who has been stricken by a mysterious illness. Many adventures will have to be solved to be able to fulfil the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second adventure is &amp;quot;Orlando Errabondo&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Wandering Orlando&amp;quot;), by Gianluca Meluzzi who is one of the two authors of the game. The adventure, for 3/5 characters, starts just after the end of Ariosto's poem &amp;quot;Orlando Furioso&amp;quot;. The characters have to reach Orlando and convince him to come back to Paris, where the king is preparing the invasion of Spain. He disappeared when Astolfo came to the court and told that Angelica betrayed his husband Medoro and ran away with Ferra&amp;ugrave;. Orlando, blinded by jealousy, ran after her saying that if she has to fall in the arms of anybody who is not her husband, it has to be him. Many famous paladins and characters will be met by the players along the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
