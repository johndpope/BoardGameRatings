			<description>Solar will attempt to usher in a new style of card games with its almost unheard of game mechanics. The game will start with both players choosing who picks the first character, that person starts on defense, the other play, on offense. Then, they both take turns choosing characters until they both have 12 card decks to play with. Each character shall feature its own art work and class, as well as one, two, or three attacks to use while on offense,and one or two defense moves while on defense. At the beginning of each turn, both players draw 3 characters from the top of the deck, and put one on the battlefield, and the other two on the bottom of his/her deck. Then, the player on offense may use his characters attack skills on his/her opponent's characters. If the hit lands successfully, the character is defeated. The game is over,and the winner decided, when one player has lost all of his characters and is labeled the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
