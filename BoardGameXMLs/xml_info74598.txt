			<description>&amp;quot;Descent 3 is the third game in the line of Descent computer games, well known for the use of six degrees of freedom and true 3D rendering technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descent 3 constituted a major technical upgrade over its two predecessors, introducing many ground breaking graphical techniques like portal rendering, procedural texturing and advanced lighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues from Descent and Descent II. Descent 3 starts off right where the warp-core exploded in Descent II. You miraculously survived the incident, only to be left floating in space, unconscious, headed right towards a sun. A PTMC mining ship snatches you just in time, but not for free. At the price of saving your life, you now have to endure some of the same duties you had to do in the first two Descent adventures, but with a whole lot more going on. Eradicating enemy mining bots is one of your goals, but your mission also includes the investigation behind the virus causing the malfunction of the mining bots' AI.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Descent_3,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
