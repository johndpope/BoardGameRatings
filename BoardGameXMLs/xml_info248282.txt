							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pokémon Tabletop Adventures Player&#039;s Handbook SunMoon Update</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a world where many fantastic animals are able to be energized and stored nicely in a machine called a Pok&amp;eacute; Ball. These animals are called &amp;ldquo;pocket monsters,&amp;rdquo; or Pok&amp;eacute;mon for short, and they are carried as tools, friends and partners by Pok&amp;eacute;mon Trainers. Trainers have various skills and abilities each defined by a Train-er&amp;rsquo;s goal. There are Ace Trainers, who focus all of their energy into making their Pok&amp;eacute;mon the best fighters they can. Breeders, who raise Pok&amp;eacute;mon as if they are their own children and groom them up to be powerful. The Researcher gathers information and serves as a party&amp;rsquo;s go-to girl when they confront a creature they&amp;rsquo;ve never met. Rangers are nature guards who dedicate their life to the protection of a wild creature&amp;rsquo;s habitat while employing wilds in their feats. A Capture Specialist is a techie Trainer who can tweak equipment, including the Pok&amp;eacute; Ball to expand their collection. The Coordinator employs their Pok&amp;eacute;mon in Contests instead of battle as she shows off their beauty. Mystics use old magics to link themselves with Pok&amp;eacute;mon. Finally, the Psychic and Martial Artist get their hands dirty and fight the beasts with their own supernatural powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Trainer may explore the world and battle at Gyms to gather Badges which allow them entrance to the Pok&amp;eacute;mon League Championships. They may compete in Contests to enter Grand Festivals. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll uncover a secret plot to destroy the world and try to stop those who would use Pok&amp;eacute;mon for evil. They may be breeding the most powerful Pok&amp;eacute;mon as their goal. No matter the destination, Pok&amp;eacute;mon will be valuable allies and tools in your journeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
