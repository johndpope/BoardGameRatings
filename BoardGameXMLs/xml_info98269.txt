			<description>A card game for book lovers.&lt;br/&gt;Object of Game is to collect the most Literary Sets.&lt;br/&gt;There are 18 Literary Sets in the deck. Each Literary Set contains three cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Author Card includes the author's name, portrait and birth/death date.&lt;br/&gt;     Library Card includes 3 important books by the author.&lt;br/&gt;     Bio Card includes a piece of biographical info about the author.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player goes first by asking one of the other players if they have either an &amp;quot;Author Card,&amp;quot; a &amp;quot;Library Card&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Bio Card&amp;quot; for a specific author. For example, you might say, &amp;quot;Sara, do you have the Virginia Woolf Library Card?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If he/she has the card, he/she must give it to you. If the requested card completes a Literary Set, place the 3 cards face up on the table and request another card from any player.&lt;br/&gt;     If the player does not have the card you requested, pick the top card from the pile. If you pick the card you requested, show the group and place your Literary Set on the table.&lt;br/&gt;     If the card you pick does not complete a Literary Set, but is still the card you requested, show the group and place the card in your hand. Request another card from any player.&lt;br/&gt;     If you do not pick the card you requested, place the card in your hand and wait for your next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play moves to the right. The game ends when all the Literary Sets have been made. The player with the most sets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
