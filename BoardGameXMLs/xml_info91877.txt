			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bis Torquata or &amp;ldquo;Twice Adorned with the Torc&amp;rdquo; is suitable for beginning to intermediate personae. While it is designed to be a sequel to the events in The Pepper Merchant (see pp. 182-191 in the core Fvlminata: Armed with Lightning rulebook), Bis Torquata can be played as a stand-alone adventure or easily adapted into your ongoing campaign. During the course of the fabula, the personae will be exposed to various aspects of the Imperium and Roman society including the legions, auxiliary cavalry, the province of Hispania Tarraconensis, veneficae, chariot racing, gold mining and the overall Roman military strategy, especially the concept of divide and conquer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the title of the fabula refers to the largest auxiliary cavalry unit stationed in Hispania Tarraconensis, many of the plot elements and personae in this fabula are based on two sources: the true story of the rebellion of Sertorius in 674 AUC (80 BC) and the Japanese film Jigokumon. Sertorius, an Equestrian military officer and onetime mercenary leader in Mauretania, took command of Hispania by invitation of the Lusitani and anti-Sullan Roman exiles. Successive military defeats lost him the confidence of his followers and he was finally assassinated. Jigokumon or &amp;ldquo;Gate of Hell&amp;rdquo; is set in 12th century Japan and tells the story of a samurai, Moritoh, who falls in love with a married woman. If (or once) you have seen the film, you will notice certain similarities with Bis Torquata, such as escorting a carriage from a burning fortress, the betrayal of a brother and a staged horse race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
