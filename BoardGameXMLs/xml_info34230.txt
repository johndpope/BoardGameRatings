							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Divine Nuke Wrath</name>
									
			<description>A quick co-op / competitive game of anarchy and destruction for 3 to 4 demigods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A Divine Nuke Wrath board. (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * A Heaven board. (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * A Limbo board (with two regions: Step 1, and Step 2). (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * An Underworld board (with two regions: Styx and Underworld) (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * A homogeneous pool of neutral people pawns (64). (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * 4 homogeneous pools of follower pawns (50) with one hero token each, each pool distinct from the other. (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * A deck of Divine Action cards for each player. (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * A Divine Wrath chart. (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * A Disaster chart. (provided on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    * A divine favor totem.&lt;br/&gt;    * A bowl or other opaque container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of days draws near. The ruler of the Pantheon will be whomever has the most devout followers in Heaven. You&amp;rsquo;d like it to be you. Be careful, though! The God of the Underworld has always resented his (or her) position, and may try to subvert our followers to meet his own ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I hosted the &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s Make a Game&amp;rdquo; panel at ProtoCon 9 (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.protocon.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.protocon.com/&lt;/a&gt;) for the second year in a row this year. Last year&amp;rsquo;s panel resulted in Cetacean Ascension Moonbase 8 (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/25952&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/25952&lt;/a&gt;). This year&amp;rsquo;s brainstorming session started with the following premises:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Screw other players over, co-operative play, religion theme, quick pace, explosions, diceless, guns, apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;...and this is the game that came of it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/465/divine-nuke-wrath&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.invisible-city.com/play/465/divine-nuke-wrath&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
