			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Retrieval/Special&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: The Andromeda, Off the coast of Alaska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EMPLOYER: Aurora Borealis Luxury Tours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 hours ago the Luxury Liner &amp;quot;Andromeda&amp;quot; was rocked by an explosion from deep within engineering, 400 miles off the coast of Alaska, near the Aleutian islands. Shortly thereafter she began taking on water, but crewmembers managed to seal the lower decks. The explosion happened in the middle of a torrential rain storm, and so help was slow to arrive. When the Coast Guard finally did arrive, all but 26 passengers, and 3 crew were accounted for. Survivors were said to have heard &amp;quot;The Wailing of the dead&amp;quot; from behind the sealed pressure doors. No boats large enough to provide towing assistance or repairs are closer than 18 hours, and the ship is not expected to stay afloat for more than 12 hours. Aurora Borealis Luxury Tours has therefore decided to simply allow the boat to sink. This was one of their 3 largest cruise ships, and the financial damage done to the company is substantial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After receiving this mission request, Orpheus looked over the passenger list, and found one David Clarke, a board member for Terrel and Squib. Apparently he was discussing terms with a potential client. Very swanky. He was one of the 26 passengers not accounted for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
