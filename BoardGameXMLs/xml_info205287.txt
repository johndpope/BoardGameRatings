							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Apple Spinning Game</name>
									
			<description>This gorgeous 1940s game from All-Metal Products Co. is indeed made entirely of metal in the form of a hollow four-inch diameter apple. A metal post is mounted on the bottom of the apple inside, and a metal platter sits on top of the post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The platter is decorated with pictures of six different fruits: apples, bananas, grapes, pears, cherries and plums. The fruit segments are numbered 1 to 6 as well, and each segment has a small indentation near the center. There is a set of 12 cardboard tokens, two of each fruit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns dropping a small green marble onto the spinning platter and seeing where it comes to rest. They claim a corresponding token if still available. The winner is the first to accumulate an agreed number of tokens or number of points on the tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
