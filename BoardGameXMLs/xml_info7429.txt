			<description>&amp;quot;No need to reserve a tee off time. Enjoy Computer Golf -- at home. Here's all the fun of an afternoon on the course. Designed for two players, three or a foursome. Computer Golf loses your ball, gets you in and out of the woods, shoots a birdie, etc. All the fun and frustration of the real thing.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic Data Controls Corporation released a series of electronic board games under their &amp;quot;Computer Games&amp;quot; line, primarily consisting of two-player sports games. The games all used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a  game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
