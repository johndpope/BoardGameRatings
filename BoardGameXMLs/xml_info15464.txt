							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gum Guys</name>
									
			<description>In this bizarre game, you take a &amp;quot;Silly Putty&amp;quot; like substance and use a mold to shape it into a Gum Guy. Plastic feet, arms and a hook on the head are inserted into the Guy and you hang it from a bar at the back of a plastic desk (gum under the desk, get it?). On your turn, you roll a die which instructs you to either add (or remove) weights to yours, or your opponent's Guy. As weights are added, the Guys begin to stretch downwards. The player whose Guy hits the ground first loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
