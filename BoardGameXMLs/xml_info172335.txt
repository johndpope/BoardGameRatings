							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trip from New York to San Francisco</name>
									
			<description>An unusual board game based on the &amp;quot;new Union Pacific Railroad&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: be the first reaching space 45. Roll the die and move forward. If you land on one of the special spaces follow instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board shows forty five beautifully executed views of places along the Union Pacific route, starting with &amp;quot;Rail road depot in New York&amp;quot; and ending in &amp;quot;San Francisco, the metropolis of California&amp;quot;. Along the way, we have, among others, views of Pittsburgh, Omaha, &amp;quot;surprise by savage Indians&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;wild heard of buffalloes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;railroad bridge over the Platte river,&amp;quot; Cheyenne, Green River, Humboldt Valley, &amp;quot;Trukee&amp;quot; Valley, Sierra Nevada and Sacramento. The text is titled &amp;quot;Trip from New-York to San Francisco by the Union Pacific Rail Road. A new illustrated Travel-game with 45 stations, 1 dy, 12 cars and 12 numbers charts&amp;quot;. The text is written in German and English and explains the game and the views. The cover of the game box (19x24) has a lovely colored litho view of two women joining hands across the American Continent, one representing America and the other Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Trivia: It is very likely that this game was also sold by the on-train concessionaire (&amp;quot;news butchers&amp;quot;) on the trans-continental trains of the Union Pacific, just as promotional picture booklets were sold showing the scenic views along the route -- in other words, a tourist's memento).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
