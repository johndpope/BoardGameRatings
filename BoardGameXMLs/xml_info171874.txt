			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embrace Genetic Diversity!&lt;br/&gt;In the year 2100, humanity is remaking itself using mature biotechnology -- and creating new kinds of living things. Transhuman Space gamers have the option to play genetically edited human upgrades, enhanced or specialized parahumans, or completely synthetic bioroids. Even if they don't decide to tamper with genetics, they'll encounter plenty of modified beings walking down the street or flying spaceships.&lt;br/&gt;Transhuman Space: Bioroid Bazaar completes the job started in Transhuman Space: Changing Times of updating relevant game templates from earlier Transhuman Space supplements to GURPS Fourth Edition, this time covering the setting's genetic marvels and half-human monstrosities. It also gathers a couple of Fourth Edition templates from other supplements, and features a few new designs, including the disturbing Leonardo and Bingmayong bioroids and the tragic J7-S53 &amp;quot;upgrade.&amp;quot; In all, Bioroid Bazaar delivers:&lt;br/&gt;GURPS templates for over 20 human upgrades and parahumans.&lt;br/&gt;Over a dozen bioroid templates.&lt;br/&gt;Templates for six uplifted animals.&lt;br/&gt;Game insight into advantages and disadvantages, quirks and perks, features, and meta-traits of interest to biotechnological enthusiasts!&lt;br/&gt;From the ocean depths to the Arctic wastes, and outward from there to the &amp;quot;Flying Dome&amp;quot; of Luna City and comet herder ships in the Outer System, biotechnology is changing what it means to be human -- or more (or less) than human. Come, see what's on the market in the Bioroid Bazaar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
