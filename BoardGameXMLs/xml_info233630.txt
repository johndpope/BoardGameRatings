			<description>Goldr&amp;auml;uber is a fast, exciting, cooperative game with simple rules for 1-4 players, which are also understood by small treasure hunters from 8 years up. Thanks to the solo player variant a lonely brave miner can play Goldr&amp;auml;uber even if there are no other pitmen around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goldr&amp;auml;uber is a cooperative game in which the players try to find the legendary treasure of the mountain as well as a lost miner and bring it back to light. The mountain consists of 24 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players decide together from where they want to enter the mine. Alternating is diced and considered whether to turn over a face-down card, to move the pawn to an already-revealed card, or to chop a stone wall that blocks the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As if the way into the mountain was not already arduous enough, the guardian of the treasure can break down a gallery from time to time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only with courage, with the smart planning and the necessary little bit of luck the gold rushers can succeed in returning to daylight with their loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
