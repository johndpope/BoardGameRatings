							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Day of Manifest Misfortune</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A word of note: I am not a native speaker, so please check the preview to judge if my English meets your standards. As this title is Pay-what-you-want, it will show you the complete content of the product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is not fair. It is not even reasonable. It is something weird to pour over your players&amp;acute; characters, something to dowse them with near the end of the session. It will likely hit them like a lighting on a sunny day, and when it is over they will wonder what THIS was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may warn them, may have the local NPC explain to them that -today- is a day of Misfortune and one better stays at home and does nothing of importance (instead of venturing into the dungeon). Perhaps they will listen to the advice and just do so, in which case you as the GM are encouraged to run a session about them sitting in their room doing nothing. Life is unfair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Especially when it brings the Manifestation of Misfortune into play. This supplement includes it, the rules about how it comes into being, how it grows and how it will finally turn upon the characters. It includes Lamentations of the Flame Princess &amp;trade; compatible rules for summoning it as well. And it is upon you to decided what price you pay for it (Pay what you want, Karma is watching you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is an independent production by Gregorius21778 and is not affiliated with Lamentations of the Flame Princess. Lamentations of the Flame Princess is a registered trademark owned by James Edward Raggi IV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
