							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universe Gamesmaster&#039;s Screen</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is perhaps the only supplement produced for SPI's Universe game. (However, there are articles about Universe in Ares magazine.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gamesmaster's Screen (notice the unusual use of the term Gamesmaster's) is a four-fold, color item printed on heavy cardstock. It comes with all of the most commonly referred to charts, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also comes with a large saddle-stapled booklet that contains... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 System Logs&lt;br/&gt;     12 Environ Hex Maps&lt;br/&gt;     112 World Logs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no credits of any kind with this item. However, the cover is a version of John Pierard's cover for the original Universe book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
