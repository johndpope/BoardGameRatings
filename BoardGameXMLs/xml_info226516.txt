			<description>Burst My Bubble is a family strategy card game. The artwork creates a classic feel, like card games of the 70's. The goal is to score the most points by bursting soap bubbles to collect sets or surviving as the &amp;quot;Bubble Player&amp;quot;. A game typically plays in 45 minutes, but can be made longer or shorter by changing the victory point total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Multi Phase game. In the beginning you play in the Bubble Up Phase, which allows you to draw and play action cards. You are trying to improve your hand to build the most points in the next phase. If you feel like you have a chance to survive as the Bubble Player then Say &amp;quot;Burst&amp;quot; and bring the game into the Burst My Bubble phase (this is where the most points are accumulated).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
