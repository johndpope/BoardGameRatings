							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piggy Bank Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This card game is intended for 2 to 4 children ages 3 to 9.  The game can be played three different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. PIGGY BANK: The entire deck is dealt to all players.  Each turn a player turns over one card from his or her dealt pile.  A card showing a nickel or five pennies is &amp;quot;banked&amp;quot;.  Other cards are placed in the center of the table in the &amp;quot;till&amp;quot;.  When a player draws a card that will match a card in the &amp;quot;till&amp;quot; to make five cents, those two cards are &amp;quot;banked&amp;quot;.  Cards can only be &amp;quot;banked&amp;quot; in two (or one) card combinations.  The Silver Pig card is worth 10 cents -- two tricks.  The player with the most money wins the game and becomes the next dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. DIME BANK: Plays like &amp;quot;Piggy Bank&amp;quot; except that players &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; 10 cents instead of 5 cents, and the Silver Pig is worth 20 cents.  (It is unclear how to avoid the two-card limit in this version.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. CONCENTRATION: This version is similar to the game card game Memory.  It is for any number of players.  Players &amp;quot;bank&amp;quot; pairs to add up to either 10 cents or 5 cents.  A player's turn ends upon turning up the Silver Pig card.  The game ends when there are two cards left, and a player uncovers a five-cent card and then the Silver Pig; this combination is worth two tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
