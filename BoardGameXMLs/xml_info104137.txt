			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario focuses around the rivalries of three influential criminals. Each controls an element of the local criminal underworld. Each also has a cover, a false trade which he uses to conceal his illegitimate activities. For years, all three worked together and in fact, were good friends. Over time, they began to become suspicious and paranoid, each fearing the others would turn on him. Finally, one of them decided to hire professionals to eliminate the other two. The others heard of this, and each seeks hired killers of his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
