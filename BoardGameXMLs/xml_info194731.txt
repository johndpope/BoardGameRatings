			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pale Continent has a confusing and difficult publication history.  The author posted the game in a series of HTML entries on a personal site and linked to them from the competition forum.  Later, the game was pasted into the forum as text, though it retained various links to non-text game components, including the game board pieces.  These off-site links are no longer functional, leaving the game in a somewhat incomplete/unplayable state.  Also, some (minor) characters in the pasted text did not display correctly with the code set used on the forums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are powerful individuals from Africa who have traveled to a city at the site of present-day Rome to pursue various goals.  These goals may find the characters competing with each other.  Play involves constructing a random play map from tiles; characters and their various henchmen then are represented by individual chess pieces that are moved on the board following game rules.  Characters use a dice pool to resolve opposed actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
