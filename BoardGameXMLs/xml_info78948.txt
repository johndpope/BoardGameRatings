			<description>Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, additionally subtitled Elements on Xbox 360, is a first-person action game developed by Arkane Studios and Floodgate Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game emphasizes environmental combat, by way of using scripted traps  or terrain features. Actions include cutting ropes to release heavy objects, kicking enemies over a cliff or into a bed of spikes, and breaking support beams to collapse a structure and crush enemies underneath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies are generally difficult to kill in straightforward combat, although characters developed for this purpose may have an easier time. Characters with high stealth can sneak up behind enemies and perform a lethal backstab maneuver, while players skilled with a bow can use it to snipe enemies from a distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic spells can be used to damage the enemy, heal the player, or serve a number of utility purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player completes objectives throughout the game, Dark Messiah awards experience points that can be used to buy skills in one of three skill trees: Combat, Magic, and Miscellaneous. The Combat tree improves the power and efficiency of physical attacks. The Magic tree grants access to new spells. The Miscellaneous tree contains general improvements, including Stealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
