							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heavenly Host</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Greatest Good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Heavenly Host brings you a dozen and one celestial servants that bring down their beatific best from the realms empyreal and eternal, bringing justice like a flaming sword and righteousness like a mighty flowing river. These champions of all that is good and pure are a match and more for all the legions of the nether reaches of the planes, smiting demons, daemons, devils, and all their ilk with alacrity and elan, or living among mortals as watchful wardens ever ready to spring to the aid of the innocent. From CR 3 to 28, you'll find agathions and angels that wander the material world granting succor and companionship like the cassisian angel and the silvanshee and vulpinal agathions. You'll find celestial sentinels that guard the natural world and those that dwell therein like the avoral and cetaceal and the monadic and movanic devas, and wise counselors who look deeply into the hearts of mortals to lead them towards greater wisdom themselves, like the astral deva and the draconal, or bringing messages directly from the powers of good, like the planetars. Finally, you have the crusading swords of judgment, who destroy the wicked wherever they are found, like the proud leonals and the mighty solars. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the rhampholeal agathion are clever spies for the followers of the light, infiltrating and uncovering corrupt cabals and bringing them down from within. For mortals wishing to follow the path of purity, we also introduce a system of sacred feats, which a hero cannot simply gain but must be earned by dedication and devotion to holy vows in service of the better angels of her nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
