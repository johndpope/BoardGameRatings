							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sid &amp; Al&#039;s Incredible Toons</name>
									
			<description>This video game is designed with the same style as that of The Incredible Machine, except that the game took place on a cartoon stage instead of a laboratory. The game focuses on the humorous adventures of the game's two main characters, Sid E. Mouse and Al E. Cat, as each tries to make life unbearable for the other. It features 100 puzzles and an editor which allows the player to design his or her own puzzles. The main objective of the game is to finish a &amp;quot;puzzle-piece&amp;quot; photograph by completing each puzzle. When each puzzle (or level) is completed a missing piece on the photograph is replaced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sid &amp;amp; Al's Incredible Toons&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
