			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's Mud In Yer Eye!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actually, mud may be the least of your posse's problems when they're messing about on the mighty Mississippi River - especially near the mysterious mound city of Cahokia.&lt;br/&gt;This strange collection of earthen mounds near St. Louis, Missouri, has baffled the best archaeologists from Back East, the identity of its builders lost to the mists of time. It's a deserted city shunned by people and animals alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now, that is. Something odd is going on in Cahokia - something sinister. The mound city's ancient builders have returned from a journey that's taken them outside the boundaries of time itself - and they're not the friendly folks they used to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure for the Origins Award-winning Deadlands The Weird West roleplaying game pits your heroes against these ancient people and their mad plan to save the world from the horror of the Reckoning-by destroying it utterly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
