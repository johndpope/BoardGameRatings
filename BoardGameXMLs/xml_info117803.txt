			<description>Leap Frog! is a game for 2-4 players. In Leap Frog! each player takes control of a frog in a pond filled with lily pads of varying heights. Players then hop their frogs between lily pads in an attempt to eat a variety of different flies. At the end of the game, each player counts the point value of the flies his or her frog has eaten. The frog that has had the tastiest meal (scored the most points) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movement/hopping mechanic in Leap Frog! uses a small deck of cards, containing distance values between 1 and 4. In order to hop to a lily pad, a player must play a card from his hand equal to the distance of the jump. Leap Frog uses a simple, yet novel, system to determine jumping distance, which takes into account both the number of spaces and the height a frog must jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
