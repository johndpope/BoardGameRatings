			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time waits for no one. The Disciples of the Rapine Storm throw themselves with renewed fervor against the beleaguered troops holding the lines of the East. The New Earth Government desperately searches for a plan to drive the alien insects from their last bastion of safety.

Welcome to 2086.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover new breakthroughs that might give humanity a much needed edge - but at what cost?
