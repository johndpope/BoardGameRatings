			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;Come closer to the fire, child. Come closer, listen and I will tell you how we murdered the gods&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy began as a series of articles in Kobold Quarterly Magazine reinventing the &amp;ldquo;standard races&amp;rdquo; in fantasy roleplaying. Now, those same articles have been expanded and revised (five times their original size!) and fit with the PATHFINDER Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second in the series&amp;ndash;Children of Pain&amp;ndash;tackles the most set upon, abused and misunderstood race in all of fantasy literature: the orks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created for lives of evil, orks rose up and overthrew their gods. Now, they battle against what they were so they may forge their own destinies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No longer the &amp;ldquo;standard evil race,&amp;rdquo; orks have become something more. Taught that all life was pain and that only pain makes an ork great, they have embraced that philosophy, while at the same time, turning it into something greater. They are no longer the slaves of dark gods. They are orks. Free to choose. Free to make the world into a better place&amp;hellip; or rend it to shreds with their bloodlust and rage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wicked Fantasy: Children of Pain includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    FULL COLOR AND FULLY ILLUSTRATED!&lt;br/&gt;    New Ork Racial Traits&lt;br/&gt;    New Feats including Masochistic Feats and Reputation Feats&lt;br/&gt;    New Oracle Archetype: The Oracle of Blood&lt;br/&gt;    New Barbarian Archetype: The Gahthrak (God Eater)&lt;br/&gt;    New Bard Archetype: The Fala&lt;br/&gt;    Ork Blooding Rituals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
