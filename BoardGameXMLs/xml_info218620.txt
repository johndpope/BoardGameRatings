			<description>This is a lavishly illustrated German roll-and-move game from early in WWI that, possibly for the first time ever, showed the emerging role of aviation in naval warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall narrative of the 90 space inward spiral track is of navies grappling to find one another, with ships firing and sinking, distressed sailors being rescued, and even a school of fish watching a U-boat launching its &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; underwater, all culminating in a furious central battle scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, there are six panels showing aircraft in a reconnaissance role. Two of these are Zeppelin-style rigid airships, one is a somewhat Bleriot-like two-seat monoplane, and the remaining three are early seaplanes with floats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has no indication of the game's actual title, publisher or date. However, the seaplane pictures include one that appears to be a Friedrichshafen FF33, which had a unique tail shaped like a fletched arrow, and which first flew in 1914. Since this looks like the most modern aircraft shown, the game was probably published in 1915.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
