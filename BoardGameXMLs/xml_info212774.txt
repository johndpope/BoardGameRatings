			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A DramaSystem game of drugs, money and magic in the modern American southwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are borders everyone sees: the looming fence with its sporadic observation platforms, the tags claiming this block or that in the name of a local gang or drug cartel, and the wrought-iron fences surrounding gated communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are borders that are real only in our minds, like the imaginary lines that divide country from country, or one race from another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in this little southwestern town, another border reveals itself to those gifted with the power to see it: the veil between the worlds. Even today, the old ways of magic are still taught; spells, curses, visions and transformations are still practiced, and opposing clans are locked in a daily battle that no policia would ever understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Borders is based on DramaSystem by Robin D. Laws, and influenced by D. Vincent Baker's Apocalypse World engine. This Standalone Edition contains all you need to play (except 2 standard dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
