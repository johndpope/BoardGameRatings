			<description>Six ways to play! Learn shapes, colors, animals, beginning letter sounds, counting and addition!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Be the first player to shout &amp;quot;BINGO&amp;quot; by getting 4-in-a-row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game One: Color/Shape Match&lt;br/&gt;Use the spinner, and cards with shapes on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the shape and color to which the arrow points. For example, &amp;quot;Blue Star!&amp;quot;. Then all players search their cards for that color and shape. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling. For shorter games, just match colors or just match shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Two: Number Match&lt;br/&gt;Use the spinner, and cards with numbers on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the number to which the arrow points. For example, &amp;quot;number 9!&amp;quot;. Then all players search their cards for that number. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Three: Animal Match&lt;br/&gt;Use the spinner, and cards with animals on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and calling out the animal and color to which the arrow points. For example, &amp;quot;Purple Lion!&amp;quot;. Then all players search their cards for that color and animal. If they have a match, they cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling. For shorter games, just match animals. Or for a beginning letter challenge, instead of announcing the animal the caller says &amp;quot;the animal that begins with M&amp;quot;. Players then place Tad bingo chips on ALL animals on their cards that begin with M.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Four: Add-Up and Match&lt;br/&gt;Use the spinner with the addition equations, and cards with numbers on them. The youngest player begins by spinning the spinner and solves the equation to which the arrow points and calls out the answer. For example, if the spinner points to 9+1, then the player solves it and calls out 10. Then all players search for 10 and cover it with a Tad bingo chip. Play continues clockwise with each player taking a turn spinning and calling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning:&lt;br/&gt;A player wins when they get 4 Tad bingo chips in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row and they shout out &amp;quot;bingo&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
