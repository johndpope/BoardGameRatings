			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings, friend. Welcome to What The...?: The Wanderers Guild Guide to Absurd Monstrostiies. This book continues the Wanderers Guild Series, a collection of guidebooks designed to be of value to players and game masters alike. The books in the Wanderers Guild Series are unique in that they are presented exclusively from the viewpoint of an actual member of the Wanderers Guild, a fantasy league of explorers, adventurers, artists and academics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game stats for the d20 game system have been provided in relevant sidebars for each entry. Because the book is written from the points of various wanderers, no game terms have been used in the actual body of the text, allowing the book to be used as a prop during play. Simply cover the sidebars with a folded sheet of paper and the book can be read by players without concern that they will learn secret game information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
