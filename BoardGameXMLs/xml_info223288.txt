							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloodlines of Mysticism</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an Alpha distribution of a Narative-focused RPG powered by the Apocalypse World Engine and played with a deck of cards or Tarot deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most unique part of this game is the representation of experience as Karma Cards. When a test is failed, the player recieves a card which they can use to change their Fate during a later test, or spend to advance the abilities of their witch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently there are three fully realized Bloodlines: The Druidic Witch, Sister of Salem, and Voodo Priest, with six more Bloodlines ready to be written which will celebrate many cultures of witchdraft worldwide. Combine this with the three available Origins: Child Prodigy, Heirloom Mage, and Wildflower, and there should be enough in this content alone to play a fairly in-depth game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
