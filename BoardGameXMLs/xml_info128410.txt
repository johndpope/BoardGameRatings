			<description>This vintage dexterity game features two foam rubber volleyball athletes inside a vertical playing surface. Each player controls a &amp;quot;flipper&amp;quot; dial that moves his athlete under a plaxiglass shield. The volleyball is a plastic disc that is tossed back-and-forth under the plexiglass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The athletes are manipulated to catch or instantly return the white disc representing the ball. A dropped volleyball or a return that lands out of bounds scores a point for the other player. First player to five points is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the plastic volleyball court assembly, two plastic legs, and two discs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
