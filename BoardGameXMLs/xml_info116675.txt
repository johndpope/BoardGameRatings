			<description>As well as the usual seasonal data updates reflecting player movements and competition outcomes, this version of the game sees several new features introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, the game introduces two new divisions for the English leagues, the Conference North and Conference South, with up-to-date player statistics for these clubs. Also, for the PSP, numerous features have been introduced such as staff feedback on team selection, and team talks. A new Match Analysis tool has been added to the game which includes many stats for each team and player at the end of a match. A demo has been released on the PC and is available on the Championship Manager website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The layout and controls of the game, especially on the PlayStation Portable, have been made much more complicated since Championship Manager 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Championship Manager 2007&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
