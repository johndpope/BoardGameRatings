							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deacon</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deacon.  WWII vet, quiet, but fierce hero and mentor.  He has a history, yet unrevealed, with WatchGuard team lead Voyager and serves as the &amp;quot;grisly vet&amp;quot; of the group.  Deacon's shapeshifting and healing abilities are a tremendous asset, but his paternal nature toward the younger WG team members is equally vital -- albeit, he comes off as rather gruff... perhaps they will appreciate his experience and personality quirks as much as they value his abilities.  Perhaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
