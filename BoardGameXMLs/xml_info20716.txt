							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Complete Book of Games</name>
									
			<description>This is a very large book (900 pages) explaining rules to all kinds of games.  The first 300 pages are dedicated solely to card games.  The book then moves on to traditional board and dice games such as checkers, backgammon, and craps.  There are many word and guessing games.  Outdoor activities are also listed, including races, snow or water games, lawn games, and full-blown sports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideas for adults' get-togethers include quick-thinking contests and even dancing games.  The book details countless games for children, suitable for everyday play or social events such as birthday parties.  Some of the party games are geared toward specific holidays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This huge volume devotes one little paragraph to branded games such as Monopoly, Pit, and Flinch.  It only mentions that they exist, and require special equipment, which is purchased along with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although you'll find very familiar entries such as bridge, marbles, and baseball, many of the games are less known, or a variation on a more familiar idea.  Some of the names are intriguing in their own right.  Here's a sampling of names of the many games to learn:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Misery Nap&lt;br/&gt;Bierspiel&lt;br/&gt;Anti-nudist&lt;br/&gt;Hearts of Lettuce&lt;br/&gt;Skeegee-Weegee&lt;br/&gt;The G Man Never Takes His Ease&lt;br/&gt;Literary Salad&lt;br/&gt;Strawberries Without Cream&lt;br/&gt;Schnozzle Race&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
