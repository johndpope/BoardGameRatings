							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Missing Children of Triel</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small town of Triel is a lovely little growing place. A noble Elven family moved here years ago and spurred a growth that had never been seen, then one day, they disappeared. The only remnants of the family are the husk of a building left on the hill to the north side of town, and the farms that still operate in the city, pushing growth forward. Mysterious events had taken place years ago, then stopped with the disappearance of the royal family. Now they&amp;rsquo;ve begun again. With five local children missing, it&amp;rsquo;s the adventurer&amp;rsquo;s job to figure out where they&amp;rsquo;ve gone and who might be responsible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4-5 hour adventure for 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is distributed with separate image files (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
