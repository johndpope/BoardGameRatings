							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Social Engineering: Pulling Rank</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Show Them Who's Boss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Rank advantage looks wonderful on paper, it doesn't do much as written. To make an organization work for you, you need to buy it as a Patron. Even then, the benefits of a Patron are only slightly better defined than those of Rank &amp;ndash; and unlike Rank, Patrons come in just four levels (6 or less through 15 or less), making it hard to represent fine-grained hierarchies where seniority brings &amp;quot;pull.&amp;quot; Wouldn't it be nice to get the best of all worlds . . . not to mention more detail?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such is the mission of GURPS Social Engineering: Pulling Rank. It expands on the Pulling Rank rules first seen in GURPS Action 1: Heroes, adds the more nuanced reading of Rank found in GURPS Social Engineering, and delivers a system that lets you know the odds of using your Rank to summon a specific kind of assistance. Highlights include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Instructions for replacing organizational Patrons with Rank and associated advantages and Duties.&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for using Rank to make things happen, taking into account story, situation, and personal abilities.&lt;br/&gt;     Examples of specific aid &amp;ndash; from invitations to the ball, through being sprung from prison, to fire support.&lt;br/&gt;     Thoughts on Rank in the campaign: what kinds exist, how many levels PCs can buy, what it means for NPCs, supernatural varieties, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've always craved a campaign where the heroes work within the system, seeking believable social position rather than bigger and badder combat abilities, then GURPS Social Engineering: Pulling Rank is for you. Nothing makes promotion quite as attractive as knowing that it brings real power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
