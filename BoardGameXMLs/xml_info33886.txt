							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pontiki</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple race game for children, to be played with Pontikis, a collectible children's toy. As the player's move along the track, they gain, lose, and trade parts for their Pontikis. However, doing so seems to have no actual effect on whether or not a player wins, as the only victory condition is that a player's Pontiki be the first to reach the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game came with a set of four Pontiki figures. Since one can buy other figures as well, one could presumably play this game with any number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
