							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Five Minute Delivery: Hamlet #2 Fnurf</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Minute Delivery: Hamlet #2 Fnurf can be played as a stand-alone game or combined with Five Minute Delivery: Hamlet #1 Slurgo. Players take on the role of bundle deliverers in the goblin town of Goobliopolis. On a randomly constructed board, players listen to directions from the narrator on an MP3 as they try to deliver bundles to various locations. The locations are determined by Address Cards each player gets, and the routes are different based on the layout of the tiles that make up the town. Because the length of the game is determined by the MP3's that work with the game, it takes... five minutes to play. (The title seems obvious now, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?) The game is played in real time (meaning everybody plays at the same time with no turns). A variety of MP3&amp;rsquo;s give players different directions and (along with the random town layout) different play experiences every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
