			<description>Varuhuset (&amp;quot;The Department Store&amp;quot;) is a game simulating the excitement and everyday hardships of department store salesmen. Players try to rent different departments and disks within the department store at as favorably prices as possible, with the hope of making good commerce later on during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luck plays a part in this game, as prices for buying and selling is partially randomized through card drawing. Another important mechanic is the initial auctioning for renting the different departments, which then become the main source of income for the different players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the first two (!) players leave the department store; then the richest salesman win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
