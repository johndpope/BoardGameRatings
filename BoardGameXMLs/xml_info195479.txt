							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le due piramidi</name>
									
			<description>The old pharaoh Ah-ledria-anar is going to deal with Anubis and his kingdom, he already knows, will be disputed by his old sons Sa&amp;egrave;l-ke-speta and Esarian-ka-ora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Who will build me the best pyramid, following the absurd canons that soon I will tell you (apt to make work the little game that would avoid bloodshed in my people), he will be rewarded my throne and all the troubles associated with it!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be Sa&amp;egrave;l-ke-speta and Esarian-ka-ora and they will build their pyramid contending and placing, in each round, the 5 boulders that his father will provide them from his royal cave. When the pyramids are completed each candidate to the pharaohness will have to choose 2 colors and score them. The player with the highest score will, of course, win the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
