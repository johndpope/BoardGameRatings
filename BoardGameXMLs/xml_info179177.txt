			<description>Promotional Monopoly-style game featuring shops and services of Luxembourg. Instead of houses and hotels, there are card board markers which increase the rent to be paid. If you roll doubles, you draw 2 cards. If at least one of them mentions a  business (Monopoly: street) you already own, you are entitled to add the marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on an own business, you can create a &amp;quot;shopping center&amp;quot; by placing 3 of your owner cards (your choice!) together and paying the base rent of each. &lt;br/&gt;If you land on an own business, you may merge 2 of your own shopping centers by placing the cards together and paying each  shopping center's value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on another player's business, you must pay the rent. If the business is part of a shopping center, you must pay for all cards belonging to that shopping center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you land on an own business, you receive the &amp;quot;rent&amp;quot; from the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win if you own a certain number of markers, if your largest shopping center consist of a ceertain number of businesses or if all other players are bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;You can decide to stop the game after an agreed time. The player with the most markeers wins. There are 4 tie breakers mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
