			<description>This set of additional cards, published by VAIPA Express issue #1, allows you to add the troops of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB) into the U.S. Army. The 20,000 troops that Brazil sent to fight in Europe were completely integrated into the U.S. command structure.&lt;br/&gt;Early in the war Brazil was undecided to which side she would join - Axis or Allies? Both sides wooed her. However, by 1942 the U.S. and Brazilian navies were conducting joint naval and air patrols. This angered Hitler who ordered U-Boat attacks on Brazilian shipping. After a few high profile sinkings, the Brazilian public became enraged and Brazil declared war on Germany.&lt;br/&gt;Hitler was not impressed by this new threat. He was overheard to say that Brazil would actually send combat troops when &amp;quot;snakes began smoking pipes.&amp;quot; This inspired the FEB to begin calling themselves the SMOKING COBRAS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Up Front&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
