			<description>A Skin-crawling card game for 3-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have an infestation problem and the only way to deal with it is to give it to someone else!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Roaches! all players begin with a hand of cards representing their roach infestation.  By forming pairs they may discard these cards either to other players or to a central pile on the table.  By playing your cards on an opponent you can keep them from returning the favour, but by playing to the pile you can draw a special event card which may have the power to change the game ... because at any time you might just get stuck with every roach on the table!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is free for download at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
