			<description>It is summer time and a group of young teenagers is at a spooky camp. Jaime is the monitor at the camp that Zeca, Boc&amp;atilde;o, Frederico, Serena and Tati are spending their summer. All of them are kinda scared about the legend of the serial killer &amp;quot;Escalpo&amp;quot;, that supposedly chase intruders. They are about to find that the legend is actually very real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the game, each player will represent a character trying to run away from the scary killer, which will be controlled by a different player every round. Scape is a matter of life and death, but as in a horror movie, Escalpo seems to be omnipresent , and one thing is for sure: HEADS WILL ROLL!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players and killer choose actions among a pool of 5 different possible choices, which are the same 5 for every player. They may choose between &amp;quot;Caress in the Tent&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Meditating at the top of the mountain&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tell stories around the fire&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Buy food at the Vending Machine&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ride a Kayak&amp;quot;, those player that have chosen the same action as the killer are now hurt and give one of their life points to the killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of a turn, plauers will not retrieve their last played card. The killer, on the other hand, takes his played card back. Now he has all 5 action cards and players are down to 4 possible choices of action each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second turn o a round, the killer now chooses 2 of his 5 action cards, while players may try to survive with 1 out of their 4 cards. As it happened earlier, the players who play a action card that matches one of the action cards played by the killer, are now injured, and may handle one of theyr life points to the killer. The ones that managed to run, keep one their life point to theirself permanently, now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends after the third turn, in which the killer may choose 3 of his 5 possible actions and the players may play 1 of their 3 remaining actions. After the third turn, the player to the left of the killer, will now assume the killer and the Round will happen the same as the previous one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends ate the end of the round when every player have already played the killer once. The player with most life points, both surviving and killing, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portuguese:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;Eacute; f&amp;eacute;rias de ver&amp;atilde;o e uma turma de adolescentes est&amp;aacute; num acampamento de arrepiar. Jaime &amp;eacute; o monitor do acampamento onde Zeca, Boc&amp;atilde;o, Frederico, Tati e Serena passam f&amp;eacute;rias. L&amp;aacute;, todos est&amp;atilde;o com medo da lenda do assassino Escalpo, que supostamente persegue intrusos. Mal sabem eles que Escalpo n&amp;atilde;o &amp;eacute; um personagem fict&amp;iacute;cio, sua lenda &amp;eacute; absolutamente real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No jogo, cada jogador controlar&amp;aacute; um dos personagens tentando fugir das garras do assassino, que ser&amp;aacute; controlado por um jogador diferente a cada rodada. Fugir &amp;eacute; quest&amp;atilde;o de vida ou morte, mas como em todo filme de terror, Escalpo parece onipresente, e uma coisa &amp;eacute; certa: CABE&amp;Ccedil;AS V&amp;Atilde;O ROLAR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
