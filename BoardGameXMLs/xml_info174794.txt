							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minor Races: The Arient</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minor Races line details some of the many life form inhabiting your Science Fiction Traveller game. Unlike the Major Races who discovered Jump Drive technology and began exploring, the Minor Races have rarely ventured farther than a single system or planet. Of the numberless stars, planets and moons; many have hosted unique species and civilizations yet to be discovered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first race detailed in the line is The Arient. The Arient are a species of reclusive but arrogant psychics feared by the Imperium and Zhodani alike. They refuse to accept Imperial or Zhodani jurisdiction, and their home planet is Red Zoned by the TAS; though both the Imperium and the Zodanin have bases in system for opposing purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Imperium wishes to isolate the Arient, the Zhodani continually try to foster diplomatic contact without much success. The key to this frustration is one of Arient arrogance: the superior psions regard the Zhodani as too impure as a whole strata of Zhodani society lacks any psionic capability at all and their culture promotes the use of Psionics in their daily life, thus damaging its purity and the achievement of celestial openness. Nonetheless, the Zhodani are resolute, hoping to alter the Arient attitude and gain inroads. It is mainly through Zhodani merchants and government-supported &amp;quot;smugglers&amp;quot; that the Arient gain their off-world technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This eight page PDF gives players and GM's everything they need to add the Arient to your game including stats and description of the Arient home world, details about the race, Arient society, politics and religion, new skills and typical career paths. There are also player hints should a player wish to use the Arient race for his/her character in a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
