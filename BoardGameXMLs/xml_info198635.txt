			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasures to Warm a Hero's Heart!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasury of Winter brings you three dozen magical items ideal for any Pathfinder Roleplaying Game campaign but especially suited to adventures into the icy lands of the north, where frozen fey and winter witches rule a cold-hearted kingdom and seek to spread their wintry reach across this world and beyond. Even beyond the general themes of frost and fey, these treasures draw upon Russian myth, legend, and folk traditions, as befits a campaign where meeting Baba Yaga herself is a definite possibility, and where the veil between worlds dissolves to the point that heroes from a world of magic might venture forth to a war-torn world like our own on the trail of the queen of witches herself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tome contains treasures of great value to those braving the long cold polar night, like theradiant censer, foxfire stole, hoarfrost halter, and sledge of the great bear, as well as those who exult in wielding the fury of the fantastic frost for themselves, like thediamondice dagger, blizzard bottle, and hoarfrost halter. You will find items that draw deeply upon Slavic folklore, like the servant samovar, gorynych scale, bogatyr blade, and icon of timeless faith, alongside the curiously modern trappings where magic and the marvels of the modern age intersect, like the wire tangler, phosgene flail, invader's bugle, and pelisse of the light brigade. Even if your players just enjoy the wild whimsy of the winter wonderland, they will delight in treasures like the feyfrost brush, dancing reed flute, snowstone scepter, and many more they will find in the Treasury of Winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking for terrific treasures to reward your characters as they delve deep into frozen fortresses and master the endless ice, grab this 24-page product today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
