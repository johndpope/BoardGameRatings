							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Brain Gorger&#039;s Appetite</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 4 to 6 characters levels 1 to 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, the town of Ockney's Hold has always been a peaceful place- bordering on boring. The most interesting things going on in this frontier mining settlement include the annual livestock fair, the cost of spirits at its various inns, and speculation fueled by those same spirits as to what foul things are being dumped into the river by the ore refinery. Recently, however, the usually placid Baron Reinson has begun to act erratically, ignoring most of his counselors, giving more responsibility to his equally erratic chamberlain, and replacing key figures in Ockney's Hold with outsiders. With no clear answers as to what might be behind the baron's strange behavior, his last loyal counselor seeks out a band of adventurers to help. Will these brave heroes be able to get to the bottom of a widening conspiracy? And can they expose the terrible and unseen forces manipulating the baron in time to save Ockney's Hold?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
