			<description>Warpath covers the campaign for control of Indian Territory during the American Civil War. The map covers all of the ostensibly neutral Indian Territory, plus part of the neighboring Union and Confederate states. The playing area has spaces in lieu of hexes; each space is classified according to its dominant terrain which affects movement, combat, and supply. Some of the 204 counters represent the infantry and cavalry regiments and artillery batteries used by each player to create forces on the map. Each turn represents six months of real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action is driven by players alternately drawing campaign markers. Most markers enable the drawing player to conduct one or more operations, one operation being (1) moving and fighting with one force, (2) recruiting a unit, or (3) building a fort. Other markers allow the drawing player to control the &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; Kiowa and Comanche Indians raiding from the west; they represent a danger to both sides and control switches back and forth as the control markers are drawn. The length of a turn is variable and unknown to either player; it ends after two &amp;quot;End&amp;quot; markers have been drawn fromt he campaign marker pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is determined by control of the &amp;quot;capital cities&amp;quot; of the Five Civilized Tribes, but the game can end in sudden death if either player loses one of his primary bases. Each player is forced to balance active operations with force-building, concentration for offensives with dispersion to guard his territory, and careful planning with quick reaction to events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map &amp;amp; 228 counters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
