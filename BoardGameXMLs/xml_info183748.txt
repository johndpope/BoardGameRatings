			<description>Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2072. Virtual reality has become a worldwide phenomenon, allowing people to sink into the virtual web, while experiencing isolation in real life. A VR engineer has finished his virtual reality project, but before uploading it on the web, he decides to visit it for the last time, plunging deeper into his own surreal world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electric Highways is a game that's all about experience. Everything in this game, especially visuals and music, has been created for the purpose of giving the player a certain kind of emotion. The setting takes place in a surreal, virtual world, made out of abstract 3d graphics, where the player must explore ten levels, each with an individual theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The atmosphere of the game has been inspired by early 80's electronic music (including such examples as Gary Numan and Depeche Mode), System Shock and the 1984 version of the film Metropolis. In some ways, the game is like an interactive conceptual music album, where each level is like a short song. The project features a 100% original soundtrack inspired by classic electronic music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
