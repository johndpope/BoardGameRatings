			<description>2 to 6 players start the game in Hawaii with a private jet and $20 Million in cash. Players roll dice to determine movement options and attempt circumnavigate the globe on a 26 x 16 map-grid, visiting major cities in each continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At each city, players can purchase investments that will either grow their wealth or induce bankruptcy. They can also punish their opponents by forcing them to distant corners of the globe or by performing hostile takeovers of their investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has visited each major city and has returned to Hawaii. Players add up their cash, investments, and other bonuses. The greatest net worth wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
