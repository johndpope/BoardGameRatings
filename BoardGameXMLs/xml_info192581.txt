Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darknet is the hacking VR game we&amp;rsquo;ve all been waiting for since our first viewing of HACKERS, Johnny Mnemonic, or Tron&amp;hellip; Everything I wanted out of a hacking game since 1995. The future is finally here and I&amp;rsquo;m cracking nodes, dropping viruses, staying one-step ahead of security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
