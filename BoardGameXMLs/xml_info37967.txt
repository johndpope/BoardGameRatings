							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Letter Carrier Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;People play letter carriers and maneuver through situations that aid and hinder them in making all deliveries safely and efficiently.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to optimize the delivery path and be the first to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is made up of sixteen two-sided square tiles, featuring neighborhoods named after U.S. municipalities.  The game comes with 292 more pieces, including dice, hand-painted pawns, and &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; cards, which feature obstacles (such as an angry dog), incidents (falling ice), transportation (bicycle), and helps (helmet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can accumulate cards to help or sabotage an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer worked with his father, a retired letter carrier, to make the game as true-to-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://lettercarriergame.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://lettercarriergame.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
