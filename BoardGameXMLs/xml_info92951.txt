							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starfrost Island</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some years ago, off the coast of Tourmaline, a corsair vessel named The Starfrost robbed an elven trade ship of it&amp;rsquo;s treasures. Among the jewels was a beautiful silver tiara, a gift from the easterling kingdom to the Elf Queen. Set with seven magical stones, the headpiece was worth a fortune. After sinking the elven ship, the corsairs turned for home, but a freak wind storm (summoned, perhaps, by the curse of the elves) blew them off course. The waves battered the ship until it sank. Only two corsairs managed to swim to a small island; one of them had the tiara stuffed in his shirt. The rest of the treasure was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The corsairs decided to build a skiff and sail to the mainland. Fearful that the tiara would be lost during the uncertain voyage, they agreed to bury it on the island and return for it when they were better equipped. Since neither trusted the other,&lt;br/&gt;they bent the fine filigree work, and broke the crown in two. Separately they went into the forest, where each hid half. The corsairs met on the beach at daybreak and sailed for the mainland. Many days later, they were found floating offshore, nearly dead from exposure. One of them had just enough strength to gasp out his story, and then they both died. From that day on the island has been called Starfrost, after the corsair ship that was destroyed on its rocky shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
