			<description>SuperMark is a sympathetic and easy beginner game. The game where good deeds are rewarded. The optimal beginner card game, where the child has at most three cards on their hand at all times. In this fun card game you'll have to avert an accident. Play a accident card on the table, for example a boy who's about to jump in a swimming pool without water, and then find the hero card in which SuperMark pours water into the pool. The game consists of 40 super nice cards - with fun hero deeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SuperMark card games come in five different variations, each with their own theme. The games are especially good for pre-school children, as they will learn how to, purely motorically, hold the cards, and they get practice in colours, combinations, numbers and relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
