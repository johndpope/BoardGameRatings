							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Against the Storm (Savage Worlds)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So many adventures take place with the characters meeting up in a bar. This adventure is no different, except that it will take everything the PCs have to survive to see outside&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is definitely geared toward a fantasy setting, but realistically, it could be used in any setting. The flair of pulpy fantasy or even science fiction is best utilized in this adventure, and either way, it should be a lot of fun! It&amp;rsquo;s a pit-fight on steroids and at the end, if the PCs survive, their exploits will be legendary and they will have saved the town of Stonerift from a throng of Goblins and their would-be warlord!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meant to be a stand-alone, this adventure could be used in an existing story-arc, as a campaign springboard, or as anything else the GM comes up with. It is suggested that it takes place out of normal continuity of an existing story arc because of the sheer volume of enemies that are being thrust at the PCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
