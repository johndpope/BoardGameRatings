							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jack the Nipper</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack is mean and evil; he's also an almost 2 years old toddler. While his parents are busy elsewhere, he sneaks out of his room. His goal is simple, cause as much trouble as possible without getting caught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Jack and must explore his parent's house and the town (more than 50 different screens) and cause as much trouble as possible in order to raise the naughtyometer to 100% and receive the title of &amp;quot;little horror&amp;quot;. He can pick different objects (like a pea shooter, a fog horn or a box of soap), each with its use (for example the box of soap can be used to overload the laundry machines). Each time Jack does something naughty, he must escape quickly or receive a spanking. The game ends when the naughtyometer reaches 100% or when jack receives too many spankings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
