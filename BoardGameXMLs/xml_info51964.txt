			<description>Very classic sport trivia game from Finland. 3000 questions on 500 cards from every sport category possible, and I mean every. The game is played like a race around the station. Game board is also like a station. There are four rows - one for each player! Among them are colors that represent the question that you have to answer. You answer correst you move on. There are also 100 Joker cards among those 500. Sometimes you get instead of color a picture of a cup. Then it's time for a Joker question. Joker questions are YES/NO answers. The winner is the one who get to the finish first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
