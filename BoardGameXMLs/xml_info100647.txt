							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Regnum Potestas Gloria</name>
									
			<description>In Regnum+Potestas+Gloria, a fledgling kingdom emerges from the chaos of Europe&amp;rsquo;s Dark Ages. As a great house in this kingdom, you must work with &amp;ndash; and against &amp;ndash; your fellow houses to bring stability, order, and progress to a struggling land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will use loyal Retainers from your court to secure your fiefs and gather Labor &amp;ndash; one of the five types of Power you can earn and spend. As you develop and grow, you will find it advantageous to grant land to Monks, Knights, and Merchants, each of whom earns you a different type of Power. This also frees up Retainers so they can be used to take more actions on the game&amp;rsquo;s various boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These boards reflect the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s customs &amp;ndash; its political, religious, economic, and feudal structures. Each custom offers the players a unique set of actions, and some include Offices - positions of influence that grant their holders bonus Power as well as access to exclusive actions. Just as important, each custom dictates the types of Power valued by society; houses that produce the right kinds of Power will gain more Glory, and will ultimately win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to paying for actions, Power can be used to change the customs themselves, opening up new actions and offices, and altering the types of Power that will lead to victory. Players must therefore either adapt to new customs, or work to ensure that the existing customs remain in place. As you navigate your way to greatness and victory, you will find yourself arranging marriages, earning titles, erecting grand structures, and fighting alongside your fellow Houses as foreign nations invade the kingdom, but in the end only one house will be celebrated in the history books. That house must, by rights, be yours&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
