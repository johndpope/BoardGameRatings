							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jurassic Park 2: The Chaos Continues</name>
									
			<description>Jurassic Park 2 follows up its impressive cut scene with conventional side-scrolling run and gun style. The player(s) can select their level from a list and play through the game's stages in any order; however, &amp;quot;emergency&amp;quot; missions also appear after each level is completed, and the order of these stages does not change. Some stages offer a simple flat design, some have a platforming focus and others feature a maze of doorways which must be navigated to locate the exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grant and Wolfskin can choose among three lethal weapons (rifle, machine gun, shotgun), and three non-lethal weapons (electric stun gun, tranquilizer gun, and gas grenade launcher). The lethal rounds are effective against humans and dinosaurs, while the non-lethal rounds are designed to incapacitate dinosaurs without killing them, so as to preserve InGen's investment; if the number of dinosaurs killed with lethal weapons by the player becomes too high, the game will end. Non-lethal rounds do not affect humans, while killing Raptors with lethal rounds will not affect the number of dinosaurs killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions include:&lt;br/&gt;    Raptor Attack: The InGen field HQ is being compromised by a large influx of Velociraptors. The only practical solution will be to Infiltrate the installation and activate the Security Gas System to stop and cull the infestation.&lt;br/&gt;    T-Rex Carnage: Biosyn have freed the Tyrannosaurus, and it must be stopped before it causes too much damage.&lt;br/&gt;    Blockade: Clear out an InGen installation occupied by Biosyn attackers and safeguard sensitive data.&lt;br/&gt;    High Ptera: Reach the top of a mountain and secure the mainland communications radio tower for repairs, while limiting deaths of pterodactyls.&lt;br/&gt;    Search and Destroy: Locate a Velociraptor nest, illegally established by Biosyn, within a volcano and destroy it using explosives.&lt;br/&gt;    Protect the Gallimimus: Biosyn have been slaughtering Gallimimus for their research on dinosaur DNA and are plotting to airlift some live specimens out of Isla Nublar. Protect the Gallimimus herds and foil their inhumane theft operation.&lt;br/&gt;    Biosyn field HQ: Thanks to the information of an InGen Scout, Grant and Wolfskin now know the location of Biosyn's field HQ on Isla Nublar and must move in to evict them by force.&lt;br/&gt;    Disarm the Bombs: The Biosyn Task Force, routed by the loss of their field HQ, have initiated a &amp;quot;last-ditch&amp;quot; operation: Destabilize Isla Nublar's volcano cave network with time bombs and destroy Jurassic Park in a volcanic eruption.&lt;br/&gt;    T-Rex Scuffle: A malfunction in the time bombs has sealed the fate of Isla Nublar and evacuation is the only course left to Grant and Wolfskin. Unfortunately for them, the renegade tyrannosaurus rex is in pursuit which has made a final battle with the apex predator due. This mission is only available in Normal and Hard Mode.&lt;br/&gt;    Escape: Fleeing from Isla Nublar inside an Agusta A109, Grant and Wolfskin must fend off an intercepting CH-147 staffed by vengeful Biosyn soldiers and armed with bombs, missiles, and a vulcan. Only available in Hard Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jurassic Park 2: The Chaos Continues&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
