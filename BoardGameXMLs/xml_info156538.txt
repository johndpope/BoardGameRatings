			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minerva is a world almost covered in water.  Its islands are ruled by a dictator driven to build a better world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come to Minerva!  Join the massive building programs.  Search out the mysterious base in the inner system.  Learn about the Manly Trunion incident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Worlds 22: Minerva has been designed with the busy Referee in mind.  Minerva is meant to be an interesting and exciting place that can be easily added into any existing Traveller campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And short of ideas?  We've added several adventure hooks to get your creative juices flowing and allow you to make a visit to Minerva one your characters will remember.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with a printer-friendly black and white system map as well as a full-color chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
