							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Godhand!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defy the Gods! Ride the Storm! Tame the Storm! BE the Storm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I need more POWER! I will not lose to the likes of you!&amp;rdquo; Raged the Bjorne the warrior, the bloody stump where his arm once was now the perfect receptacle for the pact he craved. With a flourish he invoked the ancient blood magic of his people, his arm reforming before his very eyes as he charged down his foe in the arena. Comprised of clotted blood, bone spikes, and bathed in the light of hell itself- but he cared not for today he was to be crowned king...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people think it's a fantastic idea to bind things WAY out of their weight class to their bodies- you know, like minor deities, insanely powerful artifacts, or stuff of that ilk. Well, the godhand represents that with a fun chaotic risk/reward style of play that will have you smiling as you unleash the beast on your foes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The godhand base class (for good and evil divine arms)!&lt;br/&gt;    24 morphologies!&lt;br/&gt;    The magehand archetype (Bind insanely powerful artifacts to your form!)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
