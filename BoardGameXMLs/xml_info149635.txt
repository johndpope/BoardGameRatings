							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hurricane: The Game of Preparedness</name>
									
			<description>Hurricane: The Game of Preparedness is an update to the original Hurricane Game created in 1988.  The new version features a more compact and redesigned box, additional resorts, and new Hurricane Trivia cards. In the original game a player would read the hurricane update on their turn, but in this version the hurricane updates are determined based on rolling the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 players brave the storm as they buy and sell exotic resorts in hurricane prone areas.  They must buy insurance and take advantage of opportunities to prepare their resorts, or face the imminent threat of the hurricane!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in the original, there is also an advanced play option, where players cruise their yachts through the inner game board from one resort to the next, while trying to avoid the inevitable hurricanes.  But players must also beware of another threat... The Bermuda Triangle!  The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner, and therefore the best prepared player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
