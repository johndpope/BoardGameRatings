			<description>It's that time of year again: the Flower Festival is in full swing, and like every year, there's a price for the most beautiful garden!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flower Frenzy is a garden building game in which players collect seeds and use them to buy colourful flowers to add to their garden. The more colourful flowers, the higher you will score! And this year, the Jury awards additional points for completing Flower Arrangements!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set collection game for 2-4 players, from the age of 8. It plays in 15-20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         CONTENTS&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 60 seeds in three colours.&lt;br/&gt;- Black bag for the seeds.&lt;br/&gt;- 39 FLOWER Cards&lt;br/&gt;- 64 FLOWER ARRANGEMENT Cards&lt;br/&gt;- One HEAD GARDENER Card&lt;br/&gt;- One FLOWER PATCH Card&lt;br/&gt;- One JURY Card&lt;br/&gt;- One CENTRAL SEED BOX card&lt;br/&gt;- Four INDIVIDUAL SEED BOX cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        PORTABLE FUN&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything you need for this game can fit in the seed bag provided, so you can take this game and play it everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        GAME OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win Flower Frenzy, you need to have the highest score. Points can be scored by:&lt;br/&gt;- buying available FLOWER Cards.&lt;br/&gt;- completing Flower Arrangements depicted on the FLOWER ARRANGEMENT Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only certain FLOWER Cards will be available to buy each turn. You can plan ahead, as you can see which FLOWER Cards will come up for sale soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Flower Frenzy, the active player (Head Gardener) has to choose one of the three available actions:&lt;br/&gt;- Buy FLOWER Cards&lt;br/&gt;- Choose a FLOWER ARRANGEMENT Card&lt;br/&gt;- Pick all the seeds from one colour from the CENTRAL SEED BOX Card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, if you decide to play with the BIRD MINI EXPANSION (3 BIRD Cards, included in the game), the Head Gardener can use the BIRD Card to steal seeds from other players or even to block FLOWER Cards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All other players get an action too! Everyone gets to pick one seed out of the seed bag and add it to their SEED BOX Card. But remember, you can only have 4 seeds of each colour before your seed box is full!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
