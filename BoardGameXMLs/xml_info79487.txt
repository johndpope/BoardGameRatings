			<description>&amp;quot;Full Pipe (Total Flush) (Russian: Полная Труба, Polnaya Truba) is a computer game developed by Russian PIPE studio. It features script and animation by celebrated Russian cartoonist, Ivan Maximov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full Pipe (Total Flush) was released in November of 2003 for Russia, CIS, and Baltic states as part of the 1С: Game collection (Russian: 1C:Коллекция игрушек), and it received its first solo release the following month in Lithuania under the title Pilnas Vamzdis. After being discovered by Tom Hall and John Romero at the Russian Game Developer's Conference (KRI-2004), distribution rights were discussed, and a localized version of the game was released (via download only) over Steam in 2006. According to staff from the 1C display at KRI-2004, the game created such a favorable impression upon Mr. Hall and Mr. Romero that the pair had to be removed from the demonstration by force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game revolves around navigating a main character named Dude from the third-person perspective about a secret landscape under his bed in search of a lost slipper. The game is in 2D and consists of a number of puzzles centered on using items collected and interacting with the 45 other NPCs. There is no dialogue in the game and the difficulty often derives from trying to determine why a character behaves in the way it does. Solutions to the puzzles are often illogical, in keeping with the atmosphere of the game which has been described as psychedelic.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Full Pipe , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
