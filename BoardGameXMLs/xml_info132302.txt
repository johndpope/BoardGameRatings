			<description>When gold was discovered near the Yukon River in a remote area of Canada in 1896, nobody could predict the massive gold rush that would follow and the effects it would have around the world. From small huts along the rivers, towns sprang up and some became large cities while others disappeared completely. The small town of Skagway became the launching port for expeditions into the Klondike area over the White Pass. But as the miners squandered away their newfound wealth, it was often the clever business men and women who profited the most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Skagway, you will play one of these entrepreneurs in the town of Skagway employing two workers to help you reach your goals of fame and fortune. Through purchasing key buildings in town, heading out to the mines, building a railroad into town, and possibly hiring extra hands to help you out, you will start to build your Alaskan Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you choose to fight for good as the town sheriff, or become a legendary gunfighter or bank robber? Whatever path you choose, in the end, the player who has amassed the most wealth before the gold all dries up will be declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexity: 2.5 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Suitability: 2 on a 9 scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
