							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Landbierparadies</name>
									
			<description>Every region in Germany has its own traditions and conventions when it comes to drinking their national beverage. Well, Franconia is no different. But this region is really special. You'll have plenty of chance to sample the outstanding local beer at more than 270 traditional Franconian private breweries. Nowhere else you'll find such a mass and variety of beer in Germany (or the world).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landbierparadies is a specialized trade running five traditional Franconian pubs in the cities Nuremberg (host of the world's biggest toy fair) and F&amp;uuml;rth selling only pure Franconian beverages and food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of the card game started at the Essen fair 2009 and playtesting were done at most of their venues to catch the atmosphere. The 2 player card game inevitable themes to floor the typical wooden barrels of beer served at the pubs. Players distributes blond or dark beer cards to the barrels and try to meet the appropriate barrel number to drink it up and collect all the barrel matching (blonde or dark) mugs as a score. The famous &amp;quot;Schnapsrunde&amp;quot; might let you forget which color the barrel has and mix up your plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards produced by &amp;quot;N&amp;uuml;rnberger Spielkarten Verlag&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
