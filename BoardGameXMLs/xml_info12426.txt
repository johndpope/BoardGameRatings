							<name  sortindex="1">Peter Rabbit&#039;s Race Game: An exciting board game introducing Beatrix Potter&#039;s world famed characters, Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin, Jeremy Fisher and Jemima Puddle Duck</name>
									
			<description>Each player is one of four characters from the Peter Rabbit (represented in the original edition by individual lead (!) figurines) and rolls a die to move along their own linear track which winds irregularly over the gameboard.  They land on varied bonuses and penalties (which may, for example, direct the character along an alternate route, or tell them they may only move forward when they roll 2 and 3) all of which come with a story explanation appropriate to the character, and many with illustrations from the Beatrix Potter series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
