			<description>A Simulation of the Post-Reformation Smack Down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise behind Spiritual Warfare: Luther's Small Catechism Edition (LSCE) is that there is a very real war that is being waged across the world. Look, you may not think this is your thing. You may be completely unaware of the earth-shattering implications of the Reformation or a guy named Martin Luther. You may not know that there is a legacy of this radical confessing church that exists to this present day. Regardless, this is still a boss game that helps people understand the battle for truth that plays out for every member of planet earth. It is not combat that can be fought and won with worldly weapons. It is a war of words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with each side choosing their champions.  The Enemies of the faith can choose between slick Gurus, irreverent Pagans, boastful Humanists, and wicked Fanatics.  The Defenders of the faith square off against them with wise Mentors, sharp Theologians, courageous Missionaries, and generous Stewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play moves through 4 distinct phases: the Draw Stage, the Activation Stage, the Encounter Stage, and the Resource Stage.  Each player uses their champion to make the best on the spot decisions through each individual phase in order to gain the edge and silence their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can also function as a training tool in connection with Luther's Small Catechism to help students of any age learn the six chief parts of the historic, Christian faith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
