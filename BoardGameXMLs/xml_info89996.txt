			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MBI won&amp;rsquo;t let their mistakes haunt them any longer. They know their nuke will wipe out all traces of their crimes when the Countdown ends, but what of the small chance that a survivor escapes with the Hermit and his Intel?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the MBI Black Ops squad, a team of 5 deadly Soldiers under the command of the ruthless Chrissy. Will they pick off any lucky survivors before the Countdown wipes out the rest of them? Or will they fall victim to the heroes much like the horde of Undead surrounding them all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing a new playable character, CHRISSY: the fair-haired Controller of the Black Ops squad. Ant was once his greatest student until Chrissy's thirst for innocent blood turned the young soldier against his team and into a life of isolation. Now armed with an even deadlier group of 5 Black Ops Soldiers, Chrissy has been sent into the heart of Zombie-infested Endicott with a simple mission from the heads of MBI: kill everyone and everything before it can escape the end of the Nuclear Countdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden within the play deck amongst the flesh-craving Undead are the five Black Ops Soldiers. Uncover one, and become marked for execution. Try to fend off the Soldier with all your might until the sneaky assassins slither back into hiding within the remainder of the deck. Beware, once you are marked you run the risk of being executed sooner than you think! Take a breather from combating the Undead in order to attempt to remove the marks; but don't spend too much time to yourself - every attempt to remove a mark, whether successful or not, will cost you some of your slain Zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the time comes, Chrissy will send out the command to his Soldiers to EXECUTE! Roll the die when the command is drawn; the matching marks are instantly executed and players take damage (potentially fatal, if you have a hard time removing your marks). But that's not all - sometimes the Execute commands will allow more than one Soldier to execute their marks, spelling certain doom for any players who have unwillingly collected a variety of marks from several different Soldiers. If you fall victim to one of the Soldiers, respawning is no longer an option. You are instantly killed and any Cure cards you were holding become compromised with the Solders' evil decoy-deception. Now your allies must roll a successful Cure Retrieval value TWICE before they can take the Cure card and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite their advantages in both stealth and strength, the Black Ops Soldiers are still only human. If you can manage to do so, killing one will reward you dearly - not in points and not in monetary value, but with the knowledge that you and your comrades can walk the desolate streets of an apocalyptic Endicott with a bit more safety. But beware - the Zombies still run amok, and they LOVE adrenaline-pumped prey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 Game Cards &lt;br/&gt;88 5/8&amp;quot; Chits &lt;br/&gt; 7 Game Mats&lt;br/&gt; 1 Full Color 2-sided rules sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
