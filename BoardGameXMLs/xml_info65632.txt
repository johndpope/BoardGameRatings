							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Landlocked: Hither and Yon</name>
									
			<description>Travel as you please, from hither to yon. Just don&amp;rsquo;t become  Landlocked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to construct a correct path through 12 locations. Moving orthogonally, move your pawn from the upper left to the null tile of your outbound suit. You may move  your pawn through a higher-valued outbound tile en route to the current value your pawn is heading towards. However you may not pass through any tile on your inbound suit. Once this is done, you must mark each tile you passed through  After all the tiles you passed through are marked, move on to the ace tile of your outbound suit, marking each tile you passed through as before. Continue on in this manner and in order to tiles Ace-5 of the outbound suit to 5-Null of the inbound suit. When you are working on your inbound suit, you may pass through any and all tiles on your outbound suit. However you may not pass through an inbound tile that has a value lower than the current value your pawn is moving towards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
