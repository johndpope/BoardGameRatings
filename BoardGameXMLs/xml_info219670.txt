							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HUNGER: The Show</name>
									
			<description>A casting call has gone out for the reality show &amp;quot;HUNGER&amp;quot;! Are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime? Do you have the wits to survive, with other participants, on a deserted tropical island? Or simply want to win $1,000,000? If so, HUNGER is searching for self-reliant contestants to attempt this bold adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HUNGER: The Show is a fast paced family game with rich player interaction. To win, you have to predict your opponent&amp;rsquo;s actions. On the island, you can gather fruit and catch chickens to get more food. But to win, you also have to collect raft pieces. It's a good thing that no one would ever think of stealing food and raft parts from other participants...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HUNGER is a family/filler game for 2-6 players, ages 7 and above, lasting 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story: Welcome to HUNGER Reality Show! There is a 1 Million Dollar Prize and there can only be one winner. Alongside other participants, unfortunately not your best friends, you are cast onto a desert island. There is some food provided by the TV crew but it will not last long. You will be hungry very soon and will have to start picking fruit or catching chickens. You will also need to build a raft if you are serious about winning the prize. The first person to leave the island will be declared as winner. You will need rope and raft wood, which are hard to find. Well, you could always try to steal from the others, but would you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanic: Players simultaneously choose their next action and destination on the island. To be successful, players need to predict the other players' actions but also stay focused on their goal: having enough food to survive the next day (or otherwise being evacuated by the film crew according to the principle &amp;lsquo;your safety is our highest priority&amp;rsquo;) and building the raft as quickly as possible. Balancing those needs is key to winning the game. This is what makes the game so broadly appreciated among gamers but also non-gamers, families and children. The game is fast, smooth and easy to play and has no downtime, while allowing for a lot of player interactions. The better player will on average usually win most games but it is possible for a 7-year-old to win on occasion too, which makes the game a fun experience for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
