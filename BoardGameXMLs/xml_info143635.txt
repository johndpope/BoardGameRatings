			<description>publisher description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unleash an Ancient Curse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asleep for all eternity, buried with priceless treasure, and cursed by the gods, the mummy is one of the more terrifying undead. The mere sight of one of these desiccated corpses can bring a chill to the heart of the living and their touch carries with it an eternal curse that can rot the flesh, leaving behind nothing but dust and tears. Monster Focus: Mummies gives the busy GM everything you need to ensure that your players will be the ones uttering curses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find a number of options for player characters to use when going up against mummies. Options like the Curse Breaker feat, which allows a character to resist even the most powerful curses, or the sandblast spell, to scour and blind their foes. In addition, there are a wide variety of new rules for the Game Master to use in their game. You can bury your characters alive in the sand suffocation trap or have them face off against the mummy priest, a spellcasting mummy variant!  Game Masters will also find plenty of new magic items and adventure hooks inside. In total, this PDF contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 New Feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 New Alchemical Items&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 New Spells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 New Magic Items&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 New Traps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 New Types of Mummy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 Adventure Hooks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
