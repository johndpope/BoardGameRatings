			<description>The players fly from Berlin to London to deliver a box and from there to Paris to deliver a sack. While doing this, the players earn points (play money). On many spaces on the game board, points are awarded or removed. When all available points at the bank and the airports have been earned, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
