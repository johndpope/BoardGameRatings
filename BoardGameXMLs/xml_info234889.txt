			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Scorpion's Venom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prince's beloved pet -- a baby wyvern with a barbed, venomous tail -- has recently disappeared back into the canyon where it was stolen from its parents. Your party has been recruited to seek out the wyvern and return it home safely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryptid Canyon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the bottom of the canyon along the banks of the rivers and in the underground caves live fantastic creatures -- bears that dwarf the grizzlies of the woods, tribes of orcs and lizardmen, owls of enormous size and unprecedented intelligence, and giants with bellies that will never be satiated. The party will be challenged physically and mentally to limit the dangers they face and, potentially, overcome their foes without ever drawing a blade. But if a blade wishes to be drawn, it will draw blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3rd level characters; includes adaptation notes for 2nd - 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
