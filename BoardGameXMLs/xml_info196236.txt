			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The D&amp;amp;D Adventurers League is the official organized play system for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Players can create characters and participate in any adventure allowed as a part of the D&amp;amp;D Adventurers League. As characters adventure, players track those characters&amp;rsquo; experience, treasure, and other rewards, and can take those characters through other adventures that will continue their story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D&amp;amp;D Adventurers League play is broken up into storyline seasons. When players create characters, they attach those characters to a storyline season, which determines what rules they&amp;rsquo;re allowed to use to create and advance their characters. Players can continue to play their characters after the storyline season has finished, possibly participating in a second or third storyline with those same characters. A character&amp;rsquo;s level is the only limitation for adventure play. A player cannot use a character of a level higher or lower than the level range of a D&amp;amp;D Adventurers League adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This section contains information on setting background, and on running and organizing games in the D&amp;amp;D Adventurers League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
