			<description>The first tabletop game that allows you to simply and easily learn programming and robotics without a computer (with conditions, loop, logic, subprogram etc), and to enjoy discovering exciting strategies! For 2 to 4 players, aged 8 years and older (but played from 5-6+ ages). Training of logic, memory, team interaction - all this in a simple, but deep in content, a board game. Play at home with children, in the company, at school and use it in STEM additional education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Battle of Golems! Algorythmus archmage by Cybertania&amp;rsquo;s king&amp;rsquo;s order created Golems - clay robot warriors using coal as fuel. Due to the magic crystal in its head Golem can follow commands and perform short series of them called Programs. King also ordered to build a special field, which would be used for battles between warrior programmers and their Golems. You will take part in the tournament and prove that you&amp;rsquo;re the best robot engineer of Cybertania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 10 rounds each player set up the Program for his Robot-Golem from Action cards and executes it. The Damage tokens and Cards of Fortune will show you how many rounds and lives remain before the victory and whether you can apply Cycles, Conditions or other Bonuses when writing the Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your opponents in each round usually have four programming slots (depending on the type of Golem), so you need to take care of a short but effective algorithm. You can use both ready-made scenarios (more then 10+ including in Scenario book) and create your own rules, fields, and actions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 5 board pieces: (4 3x3 sizes and 1 4x4 size) (Print&amp;amp;Play includes only 1 4x4 size)&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Golems figures&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 4 golem cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 80 action cards (12 move cards, 4 battle cards and 4 bonus cards per player.
