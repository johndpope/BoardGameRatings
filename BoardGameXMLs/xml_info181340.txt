			<description>&amp;ldquo;Quilt-opoly&amp;rdquo; board game is from The DMC Corporation and debuted at the International Quilt Market in 2008.&amp;nbsp; It features quilts and quilting, and lets quilters share their passion for quilting with friends and family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The properties are all quilt blocks with escalating degrees of complexity. Players pick their favorite quilting game pieces and move around the &amp;ldquo;blocks&amp;rdquo; collecting Quilting Techniques and Block Designs to create their very own quilting empire! However, they must be careful that they don&amp;rsquo;t pick the &amp;ldquo;You sewed the seams uneven and now the points don&amp;rsquo;t match&amp;rdquo; game card or they will have to go to &amp;ldquo;Rip Out Seam&amp;rdquo; without passing &amp;ldquo;Start Quilting&amp;rdquo; and collecting $200.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
