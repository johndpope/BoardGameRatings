			<description>Are you a food lover who likes trivia games or a trivia game lover who likes food? Whichever you are you'll love The Original Food Lover's Trivia game! This is the first game of its kind dedicated solely to food trivia. The game features 1,800 questions in the categories of Beverages, Geography and Culture, Ingredients, Recipes, Food People and Food Arts &amp;amp; Science. Game play is not confined to a game board, players gather their game pieces and get comfortable wherever they want to play! Teams of chefs are challenged by opposing teams of guests with trivia questions all about food. Players start with full plates and the winners are the first ones to Clean his Plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The starting chefs roll a 6-colored die.&lt;br/&gt;2. The next team in line (the guests), draw a card and ask the question matching the color that the chefs have rolled on the die. The timekeeper starts the sand timer once the question has been read and understood.&lt;br/&gt;3. If the chefs answer the question correctly, and before the timer runs out, then the chefs remove the matching color food chip from their &amp;quot;plate&amp;quot;. That &amp;quot;food&amp;quot; (chip) is now considered &amp;quot;eaten&amp;quot; and the chefs roll again. &amp;quot;Eaten&amp;quot; chips should be returned to the game box or set-aside. Used cards are returned to the card boxes. Chefs must continue to answer questions matching the color they roll, even if they have already &amp;quot;eaten&amp;quot; the chip for that color category.&lt;br/&gt;4. If the chefs give a wrong answer, then their turn is over, and play progresses in a clockwise direction to the next chefs in line.&lt;br/&gt;5. The first chefs to &amp;quot;Clean Your Plate by &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; all of their chips are the winners of DINNERTIME!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 40 recipes and party ideas are included so that the game can be played with edible game pieces in the game options; Play With Your Food, Potlucky, The Diet Plate Special and The Blue Plate Special.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also variant rules (including &amp;quot;Seconds Dice&amp;quot;, which let you challenge other players), and suggestions for using real food instead of tokens (including recipes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
