							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken Swords &amp; Battered Shields Lorekeeper&#039;s Tome</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An old-school styled system meets the openness and flexibility of the new generation gaming.  This is R.A.R.E. (Realistic Advanced Roleplaying Engine), and it powers the universe of Broken Swords &amp;amp; Battered Shields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fantasy setting takes place in the world of Soluna.  Players can take on the personas of well known races such as Humans, Elfare, and Dulklakan, or try out one of many more exotic races, like the majestic Solgard, descendants of the Phoenix, or the reclusive Polaren, towering creatures of ice from the north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create Spells and many other exciting features for your character, completely from scratch.  We supply the tools, you supply the imagination to make it happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is tracked not in rounds, but in seconds, and every action takes a set amount of time to perform.  In this way, combat never is forced into a set pattern throughout the entire fight and provides dynamic gameplay for those at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the gem of R.A.R.E. is the MAX (Mote Advancement Experience) system for rewarding players for playing their character well, staying in character, and making the night as enjoyable as possible.  Gone are the days where killing things is required to level up your character.  Simply immerse yourself into the world and reap the rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Broken Swords &amp;amp; Battered Shields Lorekeeper's Tome is an all-in-one book for both the player and Lorekeeper.  This is a revised and modified edition of visioNation studios' previous edition.  It comes complete with the BattleBoard image, Combat Cards files, and Character Record Sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
