			<description>Warfare is a fast paced, constantly changing, strategic contest for immortal glory, all taking place in your living room.Meet your friends on the field of battle and see who has the mettle to lead their army to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warfare is played with 2-4 players facing off with four unique Units on a 13x13 grid. Players can use a turn to move, redeploy, attack, or attempt to capture a target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the players battle each other by rolling their individual dice. whenever a player wins a battle they receive a Victory Bonus card which gives them buffs that can affect the attack, defend or movement number they roll,or can be special actions like &amp;quot;Nuclear Strike&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Deploy 2 Units&amp;quot;. the losing player must remove their unit from play and discard it's Unit Type card and any assigned victory bonus cards.They can always redeploy their unit and get a new Unit Type card, this way the Unit's change constantly. having more than one unit in attack range of an enemy or a target adds to a attack, defend or capture roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;once the players have collected 2 victory bonuses on one Unit they can attempt to capture one of the corner targets. the corner targets have different defense Numbers and the players have to roll to beat them. if a player rolls less than the defense number they forfeit a Victory bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;once all four of the corner Targets are captured. the players race to capture the center &amp;quot;Primary Target&amp;quot; the first player to capture the Primary Target Wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
