			<description>EyePet is a game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, developed by London Studio. The original PlayStation 3 version was released in Europe on 23 October 2009 and in Australia on 27 October 2009. This version of EyePet was originally scheduled to be released in North America on 17 November 2009, but was held back. Instead, a newer version of EyePet adapted for the PlayStation Move motion control system is targeted for release in North America in &amp;quot;Fall 2010,&amp;quot; where it will be available in a bundle. In October 2010 the Move-adapted version will be released in Japan and Europe, with the European edition entitled EyePet Move Edition. The game will also support 3D on 3D enabled TVs. The PSP version of EyePet is scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2010 in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the camera to allow a virtual pet to interact with people and objects in the real world. Using augmented reality, the simian, gremlin-like creature appears to be aware of its environment and surroundings and reacts to them accordingly. The player can place objects in front of the animal and the game will interpret what the object is and respond to it. For example, if the player rolls a ball towards it, it will jump out of the way to avoid being hurt. It will also react to the player's actions and sound allowing the user to, for example, tickle the animal or clap their hands to startle it. A trailer shown at E3 2009 shows the pet being customised with outfits and coloured fur and interacting with virtual objects including a trampoline and bubble machine. The trailers also demonstrate users drawing custom objects (first trailer shows a car, E3 2009 trailer shows an airplane) which are scanned by the camera and converted to virtual objects which the pet can then interact with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a presentation at the Gamescom in Cologne the developers showed some aspects of the game. If the pet gets ill, the player can scan his animal, holding the card which will be coming out with the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;EyePet&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
