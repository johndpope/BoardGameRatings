			<description>This was one of several games in a series that focused on Regional Cities within NSW and Victoria, Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary function was to promote regions and businesses within the cities featured in each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there was a game here too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The gameboard is a full colour representation of your city and the players compete with each other to race to targeted destinations on the gameboard. The first player to arrive at the targeted destination will buy that property and receive a destination card. The first player to purchase 10 destination cards and return home safely, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Back of Game Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
