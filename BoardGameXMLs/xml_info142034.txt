							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Spellslinger: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic&amp;rsquo;s got all sorts that practice it. It&amp;rsquo;s got lifelong scholars, weedy folk glued to books talking about theories and dynamics and whatnot. Magic&amp;rsquo;s got priests and sorcerer knights, saying their gift comes from a God on high blessing their acts and granting them power. Magic&amp;rsquo;s got all sorts of kooks believing and doing any number of crazy things.&lt;br/&gt; Not you.&lt;br/&gt; You know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where magic comes from, or any philosophy about it. That&amp;rsquo;s just words to make other folks feel like they understand, like they&amp;rsquo;re in control. You know everything you have to learn about magic is how to sling it outta your wand and take down the other guy right quick. You know what you&amp;rsquo;re paid to do, you know how to do it, and you know what happens to anything that gets in your way.&lt;br/&gt; The crown&amp;rsquo;s law might call you a criminal, an outlaw, a troublemaker. They can call you whatever they want. You know what you are, and anyone on the other end of your wands know what you really are too.&lt;br/&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re a consummate professional.&lt;br/&gt; The Spellslinger is a playbook for Dungeon World. It's a combination of fast and deadly wand combat, and wild west lone gunman antics.&lt;br/&gt; The SpellSlinger has now been updated with new art, better fonts, and two free versions added into the package. These new versions have slightly different format, replacing Alignment and Race with two slightly different categories: Drives and Aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drives and Aspects are an exciting new look at Dungeon world classes that comes from the creators of inverse World,  the upcoming book that will have a unique setting for use with Dungeon World. Keep your eyes open for Inverse World!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
