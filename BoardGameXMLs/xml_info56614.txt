			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If there's one thing I've learned in my years as a merc, it's stay away from the Bugs and Lizards. They're both hidin' somethin'!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orphaned Races examines two of the sentient races of the Fading Suns universe: The insectoid Ascorbites and the reptilian Hironem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Ascorbites, native to the Decados-ruled jungle planet of Severus, are perhaps the least understood race in the Known Worlds. Their alien culture -- formed by a hive-mind -- has proved resistant to most of humanity's attempts to understand it. What's more, the Church claims that the race worships dark entities - gods the Ascorbites claim will one day return to drive the &amp;quot;soft-flesh&amp;quot; humans into slavery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Hironem, native to the Decados-ruled planet of Cadiz, revere their ancient culture-bringer gods, who are now believed to have been renegades from the advanced Vau Hegemony. These gods gave the Hironem their caste system and set a secession of God-Kings to rule them. Some humans wonder: Did these Vau &amp;quot;gods&amp;quot; also leave another, hidden legacy in the genetics and culture of the Hironem that is yet to be revealed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each book in the Alien Expeditions series examines one or more alien races, detailing their histories, cultures and planets of origin from multiple perspectives. Orphaned Races features dual-stats for both Holistic's Victory Point System and the d20 System (these rules require the use of the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;uml; Players Handbook, Third Edition, published by Wizards of the Coast &amp;uml;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
