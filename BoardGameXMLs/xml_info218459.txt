							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Think n&#039; Sync: The Great Minds Think Alike Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3&amp;hellip; 2&amp;hellip; 1&amp;hellip; Sync! Meld your minds in Think n' Sync, a party game of quick connections. Pick a partner and then, at the same time, shout out an answer to the chosen category. Can you both name a movie princess? An ice cream flavor? How about something orange? Your answers may be great, but they score only if they're identical! So think quickly, think cleverly, but most importantly think in sync!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
