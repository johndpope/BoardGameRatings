							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of Terror</name>
									
			<description>A self published book of Call of Cthulhu scenario ideas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the course of a Call of Cthulhu campaign the constant demands of inventive investigators can prove to be quite a strain on the poor keeper. A booklet crammed full of aasily adaptaable ideas can be invaluable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales of Terror was conceived with this in mind. The 'Tales' can be quickly and easily dropped into any game. While preliminary investigations are being conducted the Keeper has time to decide which (if any) of the three possibilities apply. Further details can be created by the Keeper if required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many scenarios for Call of Cthulhu are too big. Great Old Ones, R'lyeh, Outer Gods, and monsters the size of mountains all threatening civilization as we know it. In the midst of these major conflicts there should be smaller struggles. A nest of vampires, a haunted house, an unexpected death. Tales of Terror is brimming with these low key investigations that put saving the world into perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tales of Terror is also a source or red herrings and associated leads. On the trail of Deep Ibes? ( or Lloigor? or sinister orientals? or vampires?). There are tales here with the potential to confuse, illuminate and terrify.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, Tales of Terror is a booklet of ideas. The situations here each have the full potential of being expended into a full blown adventure. A scenario is often the development of one or two isolated ideas. A vision, spark or something. Tales of Terror consists of these ideas distilled out from the descriptive text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use it as you will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
