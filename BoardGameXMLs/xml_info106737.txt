			<description>Skorpion is a two player abstract strategy board game.&lt;br/&gt; The object of Skorpion is to play a piece in the center of the board. The game is played by playing pieces on the board, connecting newly placed pieces to ones already on the board. To play a piece on a connected space that&amp;rsquo;s your own or the neutral color only requires one existing piece to be connected to it. Playing a piece on your opponent&amp;rsquo;s color requires that you have two pieces in play connected to that space.&lt;br/&gt; Instead of playing a piece you may also move the Skorpion. The Skorpion and his tail (which is always in the previous spot the Skorpion occupied) not only blocks spaces but also will remove a piece from the board when it moves into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
