			<description>This game features a fly wheel and a starting grid for 6 horses. From the rules: Before running the race be certain that all horses are lined up evenly at the barrier (starting point) and that all the flags at the opposite end of the track are lowered. To operate, hook loop in string over the pin in the shaft and wind by turning the fly wheel away from you 5 or 6 times. Then hold the game down with one hand and give a vigorous pull toward you. This should keep the fly wheel spinning with enough power to carry all of the horses the complete length of the track to the point where the flags go up. As the horses finish the flags rise, for instance if the white flag goes up then the white horse has won the race and the flags go up in corresponding sequence as the horses all &amp;quot;come in&amp;quot;.  To line up the horses for the next race simply pass the string in front of the horses and draw them back to the start line. All horses have an equal chance of winning the race because once the race starts no one can have control of the action of the horses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules then go on to say that in some instances dirt or dust can retard the forward motion of a horse. To avoid this,  the grooves in the tracks should be kept clean by occasional use of a soft cloth. Also a drop of lubricating oil on the bearing at each end of the fly wheel now and then is advisable and that GEE-WHIZ should be played on an even and level surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
