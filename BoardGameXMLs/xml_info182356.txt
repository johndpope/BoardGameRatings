							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">We&#039;re Going on a Bear Hunt Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Roll and move game, with an end game chase between the leading player and the bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bright and colourful race and chase board game featuring the beautiful illustrations from the best selling book. The aim of the game is to be the first player to reach home, without being caught by the bear! Youngest player goes first and rolls one dice and move that number of spaces in the direction of the arrows on the board. If a player lands on a 'Uh-uh' space they must take a card from the top of the card pile. If the card is red 'We can't go over it' this ends their turn. If the card is green 'Oh no! We've got to go through it' they can roll the dice again and move forward.&lt;br/&gt;When a player reaches the 'Run' space they must stop and take full control of the game. Throw both dice and move your character that number of spaces, then throw just one dice and move the bear that number of spaces chasing after you. Keep going like this, it's a race to try and get home before the bear catches you. If you reach the 'Home' space before the bear catches up with you, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has strong educational components and helps children learn through social interaction as well as taking turns, all whilst having great fun. The game is for 2 - 4 players and suitable for children ages 3 years and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
