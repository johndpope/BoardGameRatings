							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corporate Ladder</name>
									
			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become CEO by tricking your coworkers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporate Ladder is a card game of deal-making, bluffing, and office humor for 2-6 players. Negotiate with your co-workers on what performance review cards you each will play. Equal cards give you both a Promotion and move you up the corporate ladder, but be careful: a worse card will give you a Warning and push you towards an early retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think your rival is going to betray you? Sneakily call in a favor from your rolodex by playing a business card to gain an unfair advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dole out enough Warnings  to get your competitors fired or earn enough Promotions to rise to CEO and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
