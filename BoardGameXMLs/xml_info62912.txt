			<description>From the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RingWielder, the ultimate role playing game that mixes fantasy and science fiction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step aboard the Orion, the most awesome project ever undertaken by mankind. This starship was designed to transport millions of people to new planets across the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orion is no ordinary ship, for it was built using not only the principles of science but also that of Psycho-Manipulative Energy, a newly-discovered force that works much like the magic of fables and legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But during its launch a terrible accident occurred aboard the ship. All animal and plant life was mutated, and the inhabitants were turned into characters from literature and imagination. They awaken with their old memories erased and new ones in their place, facing a starship defense system that is definitely not friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You, a survivor of the Orion catastrophe, will use science and the incredible &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; forces of PME to defend yourself and the people who rely on you to protect them in this hostile world. For in RINGWIELDER, you must use logic, wits, and courage just to survive from day to day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get set to explore the worlds of fantasy, science, and your imagination. They are waiting for you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
