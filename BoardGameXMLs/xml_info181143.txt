							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadlock City Bounty Hunters</name>
									
			<description>There is a place in a godforsaken corner in the wild west called Deadlock City. From time to time 2-5 players gather in this city to decide who the most capable bounty hunter is. Who will find out first who is who? Or will the stronger win in the end? This is a game of observation, deduction, deception and luck, for which only 20 cards are needed, so it has no box either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: &lt;br/&gt;Deal 1 card to each player. Deal a card also to the table face down and put the rest of the deck on top of it perpendicularly.&lt;br/&gt;This card will not be drawn except if the last action is a mandatory draw (with card #2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;1. Draw a card from the deck next to your own card&lt;br/&gt;2. Put one of these card down in front of you and execute the action on it (active cards #1-#6 and #9, passive cards #0, #7, #8)&lt;br/&gt;The cards are collected face up on top of each other so that the numbers on the cards are visible. The players play in clockwise order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when only one player is left in the game or all cards are removed from the deck. In the former case, the last remaining player is the winner. In the latter case the winner is who has the highest card in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards (pieces in the deck):&lt;br/&gt;0 (2) If another player looks at this card, that player is out.&lt;br/&gt;1 (5) Guess a player and a number (except #1). If that player has the card you named, that player is out.&lt;br/&gt;2 (2) You or a player of your choice must put their card down and have to draw a new one. The active card&amp;rsquo;s (#1-#6, #9) effect does not apply.&lt;br/&gt;3 (2) Secretly look at another player's card in hand.&lt;br/&gt;4 (2) Swap cards with another player.&lt;br/&gt;5 (2) Secretly look at another player's card and compare it with yours. Whoever has the smaller value is out.&lt;br/&gt;6 (2) You are safe from another players' actions for one round.&lt;br/&gt;7 (1) If this card and #5 or #6 are in your hand, you must put this card down.&lt;br/&gt;8 (1) If you put this card down, you are out.&lt;br/&gt;9 (1) You can play this card as any card from #1 to #6. If they guess this card you&amp;rsquo;re not out but you have to draw another card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
