			<description>From Chaosium website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Mythic Iceland Scenario. A Cold Death is set in North Iceland, in the year 990, during the Pagan Commonwealth period of the country&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six warriors return to their home valley after two years on the longships. They find that the old go&amp;eth;i (chieftain-priest) has been replaced by one of his followers, and that the valley where their farms are located is in the grip of an early and supernatural winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They near their home valley, laden with the loot of their years raiding. Their dragon ship is in the fjord, far behind them. The ship belongs to their go&amp;eth;i Einar, sponsor of the expedition. Before they go to their own farms, they must journey first to Einar&amp;rsquo;s farm at the end of the valley&amp;mdash;to give him his share of the loot, and to tell him about the death of his son.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
