			<description>In Život v Česku (&amp;quot;Life in the Czech Republic&amp;quot;), players start with a bit of free time, some volunteer work, and experience in primary school. During the course of the game, they can study at different schools, try a range of jobs, buy a house, start a family, and (alas) suffer from negative phenomena, such as an arrest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Život v Česku, which is tailored to the Bohemian Czech mentality and environment, features a new unique gaming system that gives players a lot of latitude in what's possible within the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
