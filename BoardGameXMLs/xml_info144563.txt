							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Upon a Fable: Player Order Cards</name>
									
			<description>These oversized player order cards feature Ruth Sanderson's gorgeous artwork from Upon a Fable and are available only for Kickstarter backers and as promotional giveaways. Their use in the game is optional, but gives players an elegant and random way to determine player order at the beginning of each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the Upon a Fable game starts, each player draws one card from this deck. The player who draws card #1 is the starting player and selects the first seat at the playing table. Players then take seats to the left of the starting player in ascending order of their player card number. Once the seating order has been arranged for the game, the player order cards are set aside and are no longer used until the next game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
