							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bear is Loose Within the Circus</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;The Circus is in lock-down and the staff in a state of controlled panic. Half an hour earlier, Control was found slumped over his desk, dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously, Control had hinted there was a mole within the Circus. As Control&amp;rsquo;s most trusted agents, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to root out the mole, and determine who among you is loyal enough to become Britain&amp;rsquo;s next top spymaster. If Whitehall catches wind of what has transpired, they may disband the Circus and hand over the responsibilities to the Military...worse, they would lose face to those overbearing Yanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witness the Murder of Your Father and Be Ashamed, Young Prince is the property of Nathan D. Paoletta. This work is part hack, part reskinning of his rules. GremlinLegions claims no ownership of the source material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
