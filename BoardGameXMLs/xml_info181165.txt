							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pit Fighter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This prestige archetype is all about performance combat from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat and needs these rules to function properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any good pit fighter will tell you, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how well you fight&amp;mdash;all the crowd cares about is blood, and they don&amp;rsquo;t care if it&amp;rsquo;s yours or the other guy&amp;rsquo;s. So if you want to survive your time in the pit, make sure the people get their blood, and lots of it. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough, the audience will be on your side, you&amp;rsquo;ll feel the roar of the crowd pounding in your chest, and nothing can stop you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While pit fighters&amp;rsquo; lives might seem defined by their profession, some do manage to escape the pits, either by winning their freedom in battle or by breaking their chains in the night. Though they may no longer be pit fighters by profession, they will always be pit fighters at heart, and often long for the excitement of battle and the roar of the crowd years after they&amp;rsquo;ve officially retired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Pit fighter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core Class: Barbarian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: The pit fighter is a stylish and brutal combatant who fights for style even when there is no crowd around. On a team, he keeps the strongest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
