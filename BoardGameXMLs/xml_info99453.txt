							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blackthorne Ogre</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Ariel the witch. While journeying through the Blackthorne Forest your parents were killed by worgs. You escaped and found yourself at the house of Mistress Haziea. She took you in. You have studied under her for a decade. At this stage you're skilled enough to strike out on your own. You only stay out of a sense of loyalty to your benefactress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That and there's a certain someone in the nearby Hiddenvale Village. Thanks to your mystic vocation you are distrusted by everyone, everyone that is except for him. As you've grown up he's been a kind ear, a shoulder to cry on and at times an insufferable tease. You care for him dearly and hope one day... but there will be time for such nonsense later. For now you must attend your duties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're standing in Haziea's potion cellar. It's a small, dry, stone chamber with no windows. The room is illuminated by captured starlight in a glass dome just inches above your head. Before you is a cupboard with five shelves. On each shelf are dozens of glass bottles sorted by their liquid contents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dusky Gold: Life's Glow, an ointment that returns cursed statues to life. Royal Purple: Elves' Blood, those who quaff it will attain supernatural beauty for one night. Apple Green: Viper Sting, it tastes of cinnamon but is a deadly poison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The empty space on the top shelf concerns you. Rose Red: Eros' Tears, a love potion, one drop is strong enough to enslave a soul with passion for eternity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your eyes narrow. Who would dare steal from Mistress Haziea?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ariel!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You spin around one hand outstretched, a red mystic sign traces in the air before it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Aggggh!&amp;quot; The young man cries shielding his face with his arms. He's a scrawny runt with glasses but dressed in fine clothes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Oswald you're dead.&amp;quot; You hiss but silently curse yourself for not hearing him come down the stairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Please.&amp;quot; He shrieks. &amp;quot;It's about my brother.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You lower your hand and the arcane symbol vanishes. A frown crosses your face. &amp;quot;Sebastian? Tell me.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;H-here...&amp;quot; The mayor's youngest son hands you an open envelope with a letter inside. You look at what's written on it. You recognize Sebastian's neat hand writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; 'Do not to open till evening.' &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I opened it early.&amp;quot; Oswald proclaims. &amp;quot;It's good that I did. Read the letter; you'll see.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You pull out the letter hesitantly. Sebastian is the only person you'd ever call a friend. When you read it your eyes go wide, they're shadowed with fear and concern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dear Father,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're reading this then I have been killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Know that I have perished fighting the Blackthorne Ogre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why would I risk my life? I've fallen for a girl and will kill the beast for her sake. I won't say who she is because I won't have the village to blame her for my death. Needless to say she is the most perfect woman I've ever known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would suggest that you contact Mistress Haziea and bargain with her for the village's safety. Her price will be high but she's the only one who can shield our people from the Ogre's wrath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your foolish Son,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sebastian.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You crumple the letter and grit your teeth. Your long red locks fall across your face hiding your eyes. Now you know what happened to Eros' Tears. Sebastian the handsome, polite son of the mayor. A kind soul but a master swordsman. The perfect man. Some tart from the village managed to steal the love potion and drug your friend. Now, enslaved forever to this brainless twit he's risking his dear life on her mere pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your magic burns the missive to ash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Hey! Those are my brother's last words!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Not yet.&amp;quot; Your tone is coloured with murder. &amp;quot;First I will kill the Ogre. Then I will turn whoever poisoned Sebastian into living dung and have maggots devour her. This will not stand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With that you storm up the stairs. Haziea's powers might not be enough to defeat him let alone your own. Still, you must face the Blackthorne Ogre. Thanks to Eros Tear's you'll never be able to tell Sebastian how you truly feel but at least you can attempt to save his life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
