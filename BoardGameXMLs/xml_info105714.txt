							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy</name>
									
			<description>From the Official Website&lt;br/&gt;After an unending war with the metastreumonic Force, the powerful organization Secreta Secretorum you belong to is finally ready to undermine the head-strong federation, despite an intense struggle for power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character the player embodies wakes up in a strange cave under the New Eden megalopolis after a fight and saw his fellow teammates die. He still remembers he's a member of the weird secret society E.Y.E, itself an armed branch of the Secreta Sectretorum. This last one will attempt a coup against the all-powerful Federation, a coalition of several worlds and planets ruling with an iron fist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He quickly learns that his own organization, E.Y.E, is plagued with internal conflicts, between the Jian faction, and the Culter faction he belongs to. The player is quickly torn between his superior and chief of the Secreta: the commander Rimanah who's a separatist with an unstoppable ambition, and his friend and instructor called the &amp;quot;Mentor&amp;quot;. The Mentor tries at all costs, even the most subtle, to unite the two rival but sister factions. The player thus finds himself in the middle of a fratricidal war, as well as political conspiracies and quests for power, in which different groups and megacorporations are implicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is in this context of troubles and changes that mankind is once again attacked by a force of unknown origin, taking from humans their worst terrors with the purpose of causing their own destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
