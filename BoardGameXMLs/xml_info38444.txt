			<description>&amp;quot;Medieval and Ancient Warfare. A simple, basic game based on warfare in ancient times. Easy to learn, easy to use, for backyard, beach or living room. Uses almost any size or type figures, from plastic toy soldiers to collectible miniatures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The figures are divided into a variety of classes: Infantry (with distinctions based on level of armor), Cavalry (light and heavy), Charioteers, War Wagons, Siege Crews, Archers, and Hakenbuschers (including Arquebusiers and Musketeers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each type of figure is rated for movement and each type of weapon is rated for range, rate of fire, and impact (at short, medium, and long range).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic castle siege rules are included. Advanced rules cover formations and morale, as well as offering further distinction to various historical units and projectile weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
