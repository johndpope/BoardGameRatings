			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age Past is an RPG that has been designed around an RPG gaming experience. The rules have been crafted to give players a deep experience without having to sacrifice choice. There are many way to play and there are nearly infinite builds allowing a player to craft her character to be exactly what she wants. Design efficiency is the key; keeping and utilizing rules that allow the system to be deep enough that players can shape, yet not so deep that the rules are dozens of pages deep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age Past is also designed to be modifiable. There are many optional rules that can help set the proper depth of complexity for the Game Master (GM). Play with anything you want and make new stuff up! If something seems too powerful then tone it back and if something seems weak then make it stronger. The GM and players can choose the level of intensity when playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many gamers enjoy intricate investigation scenarios. Some love brutal combat. Others enjoy evenly matched and tough combat with big boss fights. Others love political intrigue. In Age Past all of these scenarios are possible. The GM and players can craft a gaming experience that is of their own choosing. Age Past has minion and henchman combat rules, so if you like, you can sit back and let your underlings duke it out for you... or you can get in there and sever some heads. The combat system is simple yet is broken up into actions. Characters can spend actions to make things happen so combat becomes more dynamic than just move and attack. A typical combat includes attacking, moving, counter attacking, and moving again. There are many abilities that can be used right along with attacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic system in Age Past was designed to give those who like casting magic the ability to use it in any circumstance that is listed above. Casters have access to powerful damaging, mind altering, and mystery solving spells. Any spell can be cast at any time as often as you like so there are not any limitations except your caster&amp;rsquo;s stamina. Utility spells are build right in with all the other spells so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to try to choose between the &amp;ldquo;fire blast&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;open lock&amp;rdquo; spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skill system has been completely rethought and designed to help keep character&amp;rsquo;s balanced and every ability in the game is paid for in build points known as BP&amp;rsquo;s. This means that the more powerful the ability the more it costs to add it to your character. While character balance is perfect, it keeps everyone in line so that no one gets left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terres is the world that Age Past takes place in. It is made up of different spheres. A sphere is an area of land or continent separated by water, mountains, or crevasses. Each sphere is attached to its neighbor, but travel between the two is impossible or extremely difficult. Hence, natural life in each sphere as grown and developed differently over the many thousands of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time and gravity on Terres is constant unless altered by a magic spell or Gods&amp;rsquo; intervention. Characters will become hungry and need to sleep, and they will age at a standard rate. Different realms have different physical rules and will act differently from how Terres works. Realms are areas that lay on top of or coincident with each other. Travel between realms is extremely difficult and is only done by strong magic. In some realms characters will not grow hungry or age, while others will speed up time for the travelers or slow it down in relation to Terres. Not surprisingly, the races and cultures can live exclusively in these realms will be very strange to those who live outside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
