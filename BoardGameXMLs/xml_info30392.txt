			<description>Guide is a game of tactics for two players and extends some of the gameplay of draughts (checkers).  It is played with draughts pieces on a Laita board (irregular 4x5 diamond).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of taking pieces from the board, as in draughts, captured pieces are stacked beneath the attacking piece and can be rescued later when their attacker in turn is captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
