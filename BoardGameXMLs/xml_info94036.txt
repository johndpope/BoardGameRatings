			<description>This is an educational, vocabulary-building card game based on word etymology.  From the rules: &amp;quot;The world of words is explored in The Verbal Game where the familiar form of a deck of playing cards is used to construct words that work in everday life, as well as words for special purposes, such as college entrance testing.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;...an exercise in the building of words through the combination of prefixes, roots, and suffixes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The 52 card deck used is composed of one suit of prefix cards, one suit of suffix cards and two suits of roots, 13 cards in each suit.  The 'de luxe' edition has two extra, more complex suits of roots for use after players are experienced with the basic roots.  Each card has from four to eight word fragments and variations from which to choose when playing.  Like a standard deck of cards, this is a game system and rules are given for Verbal Rummy, Verbalgrams, Crossword Solitaire, Verbal Chess, Tug of War, and others.&lt;br/&gt;From the ALPSCO Science Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
