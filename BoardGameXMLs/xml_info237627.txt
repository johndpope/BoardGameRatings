			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delshandra Crabalar was once a powerful elven sorceress. She was a legendary adventurer and a pure heart. But then she and her band uncovered a powerful Zanzian artifact called the Gem of Fire. Even elves can be corrupted by the temptations of power and wealth. And so it was with her. She ultimately slay all of her companions in order to gain sole possession of the artifact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not long ago she was killed by assassins hired by the families of her former companions. She was buried in the cemetary just outside of the town she lived in despite her evil ways. The towns people chose to remember her as she had been before the Gem of Fire. And so they respected her with a fine grave in their local cemetery. Unfortunately things have gone badly since then. Something is very wrong in the Cemetary. And adventurers are needed to sort things out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an OSRIC style adventure for characters of 4th to 7th level of experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
