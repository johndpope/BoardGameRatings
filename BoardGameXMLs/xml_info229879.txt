							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ud: Labyrinth Lord Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An oldie but goodie adventure updated for Labyrinth Lord.  The original is described like so:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Can your party of ordninary adventurers thwart the greed of a devil?  Journey into the world of Ud and see if you have the steel to defeat Ud!  Many have fallen to Ud, defeated by their own lust for gold.   Drive Ud back and take what is his.  Fail and he will take what is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ud, a midlevel OSR adventure is here to challenge you!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is still true but noq it has been converted to Labyrinth Lord.   Much is the same, much has changed.   The story is still the same.   There is more art.   Better maps... etc... .  Perhaps a deal will be made with the Labyrinth Lord and Ud?  Ud needs Labyrinth Lords.  They need him Ud thinks...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time for the Labyrinth Lord adventurer to go where only the money obsessed would go.  Ud will turn your soul to GOLD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
