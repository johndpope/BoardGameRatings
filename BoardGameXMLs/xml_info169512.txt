							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Barbie World of Fashion game</name>
									
			<description>Traveling around the world, Barbie and her friends are teen fashion models: meeting new dates and earning money to buy kicky fashions. Rolling a die, players move around a 3-D molded playing board, attempting to land on spaces where they can receive date cards or earn money to later buy clothes cards at Shop spaces.  Once a player has at least 5 of these cards, they make their way back to London in order to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
