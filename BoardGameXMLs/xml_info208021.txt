							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dresden Files Cooperative Card Game: Wardens Attack</name>
									
			<description>This brings us up to books 10 and 11 &amp;mdash; Small Favor and Turn Coat, maximizing your options for play and offering new ways to ensnare and complicate your heroes' lives. But the real stars of this expansion are the two new player decks, Wardens both: Regional Commander Carlos Ramirez and Captain Anastasia Luccio herself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anastasia Luccio's deck is all about strategic plays and decisive moves. Overall her deck is focused most strongly on taking on the challenges that decide your ultimate win-or-lose fate, and nowhere is that more apparent than with her two &amp;quot;on the table&amp;quot; cards. Use her Captain of the Wardens talent to go after the toughest challenges you face, whether they're Case or Foe. Flip her stunt to Focus Our Efforts! from one Case or a Foe to another, maximizing your chances of clearing them off the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as you might expect, Carlos Ramirez's deck is just plain swashbuckling fun, at its best when he's taking on Foes or clearing Obstacles. On the battlefield, a Young Hotshot Warden like Ramirez knows that knowledge is power; his Talent lets you remove a Clue from a Case to land two Hits on an injured Foe. And as a Warden, Carlos has always Got Your Back, using his stunt to allow an ally to reclaim a card from their discard, letting the team deploy its greatest strengths a second time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
