			<description>If you thought turning a profit on Mars was tough, just wait until you land on Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s volcanic moon, Io. With resources that deplete over time creating fierce competition, you will have to adapt to the new environment faster than your opponents do in order to survive. Life support is so strenuous on Io that Mars will look like a paradise in comparison!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With two brand new factions, a new resource system, a new multiplayer &amp;ldquo;Infinite Map Challenge,&amp;rdquo; new patents, buildings, black market items, and much more, Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s Forge is a must-have addition for your Offworld Trading Company experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW LOCATION - IO&lt;br/&gt;Explore Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s volcanic and volatile moon where energy is plentiful, but life support is so difficult that it makes Mars look like a paradise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW FACTION - THE PENROSE COLLECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;Highly adaptable and influential, they are able to return claims and spread their operations across an already depleted environment in order to afford them easier access to more resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW INFINITE MAP CHALLENGE&lt;br/&gt;Compete against the online community as each map evolves and becomes more difficult than the last. See how many maps you can conquer before the harsh environments of space get the better of you.&lt;br/&gt; NEW RESOURCE SYSTEM&lt;br/&gt;Change your production priorities in order to survive on Io where even the element most essential to basic human life - water - does not exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW FACTION - THE DIADEM TRUST&lt;br/&gt;An elite business group, their advanced structures can outperform the competition. Their ability to purchase patents that are already owned even leaves lawyers scratching their heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW CAMPAIGN&lt;br/&gt;Show that you have what it takes to survive on the harsh environment of Io. Snag resources before your adversaries do and prove that money talks: you made it on Mars, and you can make it on Io.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
