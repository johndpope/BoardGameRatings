							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beauty and the Beast: Magic Mirror Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Disney film, this is a simple matching game similar to &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot;. Each player receives 2 Magic Mirror cards and places them in their play area. They then get dealt 4 cards from the deck and lay down any pairs that match. On a turn, you may ask one player for one card that you already have in your hand, &amp;quot;Do you have a Belle card?&amp;quot; If the player has the card you asked for, take it and lay your match in front of you, otherwise take a card from the draw pile. Instead of asking a player for a card, you may play a Magic Mirror card. You secretly look at all the other players hands. If you make a match you play it, otherwise your turn ends. The first player to lay down 5 matches wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
