							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great Fires</name>
									
			<description>New York: December 16-17, 1835&lt;br/&gt;Chicago: October 8-10, 1871 &lt;br/&gt;Boston: November 9-10, 1872&lt;br/&gt;Seattle: June 6, 1889&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco: April 18-21, 1906&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do all these dates have in common? They mark some of the most catastrophic fires in U.S. history in which thousands and thousands of lives were lost, and enormous sections of these major metropolitans were reduced to little more than ash and amber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most city building games require construction from the ground up. But with 'Great Fires', players find out what happens when their beautiful city is, in its prime, under siege of fires raging out of control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great Fires is a fast paced game where the object is to be the least devastated of all players at the end of the game. Each player chooses one city (New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle or San Francisco) and each game the fires begin in different districts. The mechanics for the spreading of fires can be fierce, luckily players are given some tools to help contain the fires--however the tools are limited, and will not be able to protect all of your city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prevent as many fatalities as possible, keep your city from burning completely to the ground, and you just might be able to come out on top!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
