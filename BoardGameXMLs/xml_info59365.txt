							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My First Larp</name>
									
			<description>Subtitle: A Primer for the Larpophobic and Larpically Challenged&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credited author and artist: Hugh Betcha (who is really Christopher Clark)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My First Larp is a hilarious parody of Live Action Role Playing that only very faintly resembles an actual game.  Learn the mystic secrets known only to Live Action Role Players that those fat cats on Wall Street don't want you to know!  Become a Master of Larping in just six easy steps! Learn about: Getting into character, Little-known hand signals used by Larpers, costuming, and making up a kewl Larper name!  Amaze your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book, like most Hugh Betcha books, is not recommended for younger gamers due to hand signals that some might consider obscene, and some sexually suggestive content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
