			<description>A Two-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past month has been rather strange. What started out as a nice quiet relaxing weekend devoted to nothing other than uninterrupted gaming, wound up starting you out on a most bizarre adventure. Somehow you were brought into the ADVANCED DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS world by a pink dragon, an evil minion of Tiamat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since your arrival here, other than the pink dragon you've encountered goblins, bugbears, orcs, crocodiles, two gold dragons, and the two most powerful dragons in this world Tiamat, Empress of Evil, and Bahamut, Defender of all that is Good. You wound up rescuing Bahamut's kidnapped children from Tiamat's clutches, earning his undying gratitude and invoking her legendary wrath. After the rescue of his children Bahamut had his followers train you so that you had a better chance of surviving until he could send you home. You were continuing with your training when your amulets began to glow. You realized that it must mean that Bahamut had finally found a way to send you home, and the fact that the scenery around you began fading gave credence to your beliefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
