			<description>Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;- board (wooden, made from slice of tree stump)&lt;br/&gt;- 25 white pegs&lt;br/&gt;- 25 black pegs&lt;br/&gt;- 37 discs (white on one side, black on the other)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexagonal board, players take turns to place pegs at the vertices of the hexagons, and by doing so, gain influence over the surrounding hexagons.  The player with the most pegs surrounding a hexagon has temporary ownership, denoted by putting a disc in the hexagon (in the case of a draw, ownership remains unchanged).  Once a player gets half the vertices around a hexagon, they get permanent control, denoted by putting a peg in the disc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all hexagons are permanently controlled, the game ends, and the player with the most pegs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clearly biased in favor of the first player, but rather nice nonetheless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
