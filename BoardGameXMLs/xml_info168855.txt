			<description>Taudelon Station is a game that shares elements with traditional card games and modern economy games. Players will use their hands of cards to create resources and currency so they can build various modules. These modules are worth points at the end of the game and they also modify how the game plays as well. A unique aspect to Taudelon Station is that these modifications change the game for all of the players, not just for the players who own the modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players&amp;rsquo; hands come from a deck of cards that has five suits, numbered 1 to 9. Players will either play a combination of at least two cards that equal exactly 10 to create a resource (called Elements), or they will play a combination of cards similar to the various types of Poker hands (pair, full house, etc.) to create the currency (called Energy) that works with the resources to let players build the modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, unidentified aliens are swarming around the station, and while the game is fully competitive, the players all must defend the station against the aliens or everyone loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
