			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Corps Come Calling&lt;br/&gt;Work in Chicago long enough and you get used to a lot of weird things, so when one corp puts out the feelers for a team of runners to pull off a sabotage job on another, it seems refreshingly simple. It&amp;rsquo;s a classic shadowrun set up&amp;mdash;two corps beat up on each other for a little while, runners make themselves a few nuyen, and the world keeps moving around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple. Of course it isn&amp;rsquo;t. If something of value is going through Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Containment Zones, people are going to catch its scent&amp;mdash;and when they do, they&amp;rsquo;re going to want a piece of it. Runners are going to find themselves caught between multiple forces in the city, faced with the kind of choice that always seems extra difficult in the Sixth World: Figuring out what&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Little Wetwork is the latest Shadowrun Mission providing a burst of adventure for home games, convention games, or any game in the Sixth World. It has stats and rules for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition, but plot elements from the game could also be used with Shadowrun: Anarchy with some adaptation of stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
