			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is it, the definitive follow-up work by the esteemed sage Greytar. Within these pages he catalogues a collection of the most varied and interesting creatures that populate the Kingdoms of Kalamar. With the aid of his fellow field researchers, they present this data for all interested readers &amp;ndash; be they mercenaries eager to devise effective strategies for combating known foes or magicians seeking to enhance their spellcasting repertoire. Only a foole would travel the realms deprived of this valuable material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fruit of years of extensive travel and personal experience, Greytar presents a complete picture of every creature incorporating sketches, personal accounts, known habitats, tracker&amp;rsquo;s guides, combat tactics and yield data to round out his general observations of the beasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second volume in the Hacklopedia of Beasts series for HackMaster 5th edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available as an &amp;quot;initial public release&amp;quot; PDF bundled with pre-orders for the eventual hardcover edition. The publisher notes: &amp;quot;The file will be incrementally updated as new monsters are added and existing ones tweaked based on reader feedback (and designer judgment). Your purchase allows you to re-download the PDF to receive updates as the document is rev'd to the final release version.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
