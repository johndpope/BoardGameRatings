			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Koichi is a new transfer to Atarashi High, eager to make friends but too shy to talk to anyone! What will he do when he becomes the object of affection of the schools three most handsome young rivals? Will he fall for the promising Young Athlete, the superstar Model or the school&amp;rsquo;s most popular Teacher&amp;rsquo;s assistant? Guide Koichi through three dates and help him break through his shyness and fall in love for the very first time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game uses the same rule set as G x B, Jake is busy re-writing the game text from scratch and introducing several small changes, including guidelines for creating custom characters. Heather Applington is creating a brand new set of illustrations for the game, including new instructional manga pages to help new players quickly learn how to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
