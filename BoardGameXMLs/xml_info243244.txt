			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you liked Dynacomp's Bridge 2.0 you will absolutely love Bridge Master.  Bridge Master is a comprehensive bridge program designed to provide hours of challenging competition.  Bidding features include the Blackwood convention, Stayman convention, pre-emptive openings, and recognition of demand bids and jump-shift responses.  After playing a specific hand, you may replay the same hand, with the options of switching cards with your computer opponents.  This feature allows you to compare your bidding and playing skills to Bridge Master.  Bonuses for game contract and slams are awarded as in duplicate bridge.  Doubled contracts are scored based upon a computer assigned vulnerability.  A score card is displayed at the conclusion of each hand.  The core card displays a summary of total hands played, total points scored, number of contracts made and set, and % bids made.  Bridge Master is clearly the best computer bridge program available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynacomp's previous Bridge 2.0 customers may upgrade to Bridge Master for a nominal charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
