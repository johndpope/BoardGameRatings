			<description>&amp;quot;At last, you've found it. The ultimate piece : the Key. You can feel its weight in your hand. As harmless as it may look, you already can feel its power. Thanks to that long-sought item, the Machine will work now. It will take you to London in 1888, where and when the forever war between good and evil is fought. The most extraordinary Ladies and Gentlemen are already gathering there, writing the fate of mankind in crimson letters.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smog, the Thirteenth Hour is a fast paced skirmish boardgame that takes you to the Victorian Capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assemble a league of your 3 to 6 favourite extraordinary Ladies &amp;amp; Gentlemen and fight your opponents' leagues in a challenge with London herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its simple rules make Smog, the Thirteenth Hour a fast and easy to board game, whereas its unique 88 action cards set and wide range of original characters make Smog as instinctive as tactical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smog, the Thirteenth Hour is a miniature board game for two players or more set in the 1888 Victorian capital, the theatre of fierce fights between the most extraordinary characters. Characters of Smog, the Thirteenth Hour are ideally materialized on the board by miniatures from the Smog, a Victorian Fantasy range published by Smart Max. Each miniature from Smart Max represents a fantastic character from the Smog universe. For more information about our little madnesses, visit &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.smartmaxstore&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.smartmaxstore&lt;/a&gt;. com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Smog, the Thirteenth Hour is your first miniature experience, imagine a weird chess game where each piece is a unique character, with dreadful fighting skills and likely to cast magic spells. Each of these pieces is played turn after turn, until a player claims victory. More than a game, Smog, the Thirteenth Hour is an open door on your own imagination. After assimilating the rules, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to create your own original adventures as well as design your own extraordinary Ladies and Gentlemen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the time, eliminating all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s miniatures or a large proportion of them will bring you victory. The scenarios proposed in this booklet present different set-ups, including variant rules and particular victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
