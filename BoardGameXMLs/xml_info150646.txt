							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PRIME - Heroes of Galaxia</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not your usual Super Hero Game &lt;br/&gt; You are just an ordinary citizen of the massive planet-wide super-city Galaxia. It is a super-city where, for unknown reasons, everyone&amp;rsquo;s memories, including your own, have been erased. Perhaps, though, you may just be more than an ordinary citizen. Perhaps you may be the hero everybody needs to restore order. Perhaps you may be a PRIME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play supers the CHAOS way&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The greatest Comic Book characters of all time were great for one reason. They learned how to adapt to the powers they possessed. They didn&amp;rsquo;t choose their powers. So why should a gamer choose his powers? But CHAOS gives players the opportunity to use their powers their way. CHAOS doesn&amp;rsquo;t limit a player&amp;rsquo;s abilities to a series of preestablished skills. Players base their skillset on actions they really use. And that&amp;rsquo;s the CHAOS way.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; CHAOS creator, Iffix Y Santaph&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
