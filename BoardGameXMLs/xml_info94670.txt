			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to a new invention 'The Portal' mankind has discovered that there is actually another world that we can go to. Well, mankind has been going there for ages already but just didn't realise it. We now call it Emo world, it's the place of your dreams, literally. Men and women travelled to the place in their dreams, in the beginning there was no problems with it and people where marvelled about with the existence of the new world. This world was truly filled with their dreams: Elves, Dwarfs, Witches, Vampires, all where a part of this world and almost all the creatures are kind to the dreaming humans. And these beings loved the visits of the humans it gave their live some extra colour. Not that they didn't already have enough colour in this world, this was truly a great world to live in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it didn't take long for humans to start realizing that if they went there all these years in their dreams they already did tons of strange stuff in this world. Stuff they didn't want anyone to find out because it was just so humiliating. And since they now knew that there live actual beings there they don't want to do the stupid stuff with real witnesses. They started to take pills to suppress their dreams. Also a lot of the humans decided that they didn't want the strange creatures to come to their world. What if these Vampires, Werewolves and other beings weren't that friendly? These creatures aren't allowed in this world, a world they now decided to call Ratio World. But what if some creatures still came to this world? How would they be stopped? The government decided that teams would be created to hunt down these offenders; these teams would capture the offenders and send them back to their own world. But soon the teams did not only work in Ratio World but got to work in Emo World as well. These teams are called the Fantasy Hunters and you are part of one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
