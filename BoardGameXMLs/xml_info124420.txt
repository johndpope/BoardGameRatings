			<description>Horse Haven is a new Facebook social network game allowing you to raise, nurture, and breed horses. Experience the thrill of being a horse ranch owner&amp;mdash;maintain buildings and stables, care for horses, compete against friends in special horse competitions, and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the sole inheritor of a once champion horse ranch now fallen into disrepair, you must find a way to return it to its former glory. With just a few rundown buildings&amp;mdash;a stable, a farmstead, and some deteriorated drinking troughs and hayracks&amp;mdash;you will only have a short amount of time to turn the horse ranch around. With only one lonely foal to start with you&amp;rsquo;ll need to expand your stable through a combination of breeding and nurturing. In Horse Haven you will experience the excitement and hardships of owning and running your very own horse ranch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
