							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Abandoned Library Finds</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survivors push away the dusty debris that blocks the entrance to the aging stone building. The elders say that this location is a sacred place of knowledge. As the characters peek into the massive main room they see piles and piles of old books lining rusty metal shelves and sitting on round wooden tables. Some books have fallen into the floor over time and others appear to have been chewed on by rodents. So what do these seekers of knowledge find in the abandoned library? Will it be classic literature, guides on surviving in the wilderness, the ancient theories of politics, or something altogether different?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
