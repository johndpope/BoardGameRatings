			<description>Up to six players battle it out to win the majority of electoral votes and become President of the USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player answers questions about America and every correct answer usually gains them 5 chips to place on the board. They can place these in no more than two states. As soon as a player has got 51% of the votes in a state they win all of the votes in that state. For example, Indiana returns 12 electoral votes. As soon as a player has staked 7 chips in that state they win ALL 12 votes. As soon as a player has grabbed 275 electoral votes he/she is declared the President!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designers advise that if six start then only two should be left at the end and Run Off to see who wins the Presidency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is quite large and the playing pieces are brightly colored counters. The board is simply a map of the USA with how many electoral votes are assigned to each state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
