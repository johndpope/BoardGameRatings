							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Explorer</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explorer is a rare individual, who willingly leaves his home and all that he knows to seek out the unknown. Whether for their own sake, or for the fame and fortune they may bring, explorers travel the hidden places of the world on a quest for the new and unusual. Explorers live for the challenge of venturing into hitherto unseen places, overcoming myriad dangers and encountering strange men and beasts. Possessed of great fortitude and resourcefulness, as well as uncommon bravery, the explorer excels not only in the wilds but also among the beings he comes upon in his travels. Rare is the circumstance that catches him off guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 8th book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20 system game, each of these mini-supplements introduces an entirely new core character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
