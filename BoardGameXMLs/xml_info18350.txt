			<description>This is a collection of games using a set of 36 cards.  Each card is a 2x3 grid with the squares colored in black and gold. All possible patterns are included.  Some games also use a set of 40 chips in 2 colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic mechanism used in many of the games is matching the cards according to the square colors.&lt;br/&gt; The multi-player games are listed below.  There are also three solitaire games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Territorial Matching - 2 players&lt;br/&gt;Players match card edges in an effort to get the most on their side of the play area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Covering Match - 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;Players match cards by covering sections in an effort to get rid of their cards first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Racing Game - 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;Players match cards edge-to-edge or in blocks of 4 squares in an effort to &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; as far as possible in a given direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rustler's Racing Game - 2 players&lt;br/&gt;Variant of the above where players can capture cards from each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gold Withdrawal Game - 2 players&lt;br/&gt;Players take cards from the edges of a 6x6 grid in an effort to get cards with the most gold squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chess Rook Game - 2 players&lt;br/&gt;The cards are assigned to Black and Gold players according to predominant color (with 10 being neutral) and moved rookwise on a 6x6 grid.  The object is to capture the most opposing squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surrounding Majorities - 2 players&lt;br/&gt;Players place cards in a 5x7 grid (one card is removed) in an effort to surround cards with a majority of squares of their color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keyhole Majorities - 2 players&lt;br/&gt;Similar to the above game, but played with 3 groups of 8 cards each (with holes in the patterns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guess the Rule - 2 teams&lt;br/&gt;A very simplified version of Eleusis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESP and More - 2-6 players&lt;br/&gt;A guessing and simple deduction game.  Correct guesses are paid off based on the number of squares guessed at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Equidistance - 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;Cards are played with matching edges.  A played card reserves the space on the opposite side of the play area for the inverse card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Square Casino - 2 players&lt;br/&gt;Casino adapted for this set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
