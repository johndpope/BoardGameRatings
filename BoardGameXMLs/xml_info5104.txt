			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yogi and Boo Boo were at home in their cave.  It was a nice day and the door was open.  The aroma of fresh baked cakes and doughnuts drifted thru the open door.  Yogi knew it came from Ranger Smith's Headquarters and he was determined to get a taste of the goodies.  Boo Boo told Yogi he could get in real trouble if he tried to get them.  Yogi said he would go alone but Boo Boo knew he would help his friend if he could.  In this game, each player moves both Yogi and Boo Boo thru many adventures to be the first to get to the Ranger Station and all the sweets there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
