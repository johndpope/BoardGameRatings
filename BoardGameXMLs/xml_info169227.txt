			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're a superstar athlete in a death sport dungeon live-on-pay-per-view! The Pathfinder update of the Ennie-nominated &quot;Best D20 Game.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fabulous prizes! Cars, wealth, and a year&amp;rsquo;s supply of furniture wax! All of these &amp;ndash; and much, much more &amp;ndash; can be yours... if you survive. Of course, you are going to have to kill the monsters to get the treasure, and you aren&amp;rsquo;t the crowd favorite today, and the cameras are very unforgiving. But there are no second takes, and if you die... YOU DIE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About Xcrawl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Xcrawl, the players are superstar athletes taking their chances in a live-on-pay-per-view death sport. It&amp;rsquo;s a modern-day world with a fantasy twist, and the game is simple: the Dungeon Judge, or DJ, creates an artificial dungeon under controlled &amp;ndash; but lethal &amp;ndash; conditions. He designs the maze, and stocks it with monsters, secret doors, magical traps, treasure and prizes. The players must go through the dungeon and fulfill whatever conditions the DJ puts forth in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xcrawl is a sport and the challenges are created, but the danger is no less real. If you die, you die. There are no second chances. Citizens of the North American Empire tune in every week to watch their favorite celebrities get eaten, paralyzed, turned to stone, and ripped apart. The nation&amp;rsquo;s hunger for blood and mayhem grows with every contest. How will you fare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xcrawl Core Book &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xcrawl core rulebook includes everything you need to start playing Xcrawl, including background material, equipment, character options, and new rules for Xcrawl, including rules for mojo, fame, signature moves, and more! This new edition has been completely converted to Pathfinder rules. The Xcrawl rules additions have been thoroughly playtested for more than three years in home games and at conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
