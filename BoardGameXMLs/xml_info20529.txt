							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Cells Game Cards</name>
									
			<description>A strategy game on immunology and microbiology, the game includes two decks of 40 cards each. One is the pathogen deck and the other is the immunity system deck. Players can choose to attack or defend, and the first player whose deck is exhausted or who runs out of immunity points loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Called Battle Cells Game Cards, the cards do not involve mystical beings or suits like diamonds and spades. &lt;br/&gt;.Instead, they are adorned with pictures of viruses, pathogens and pills, along with facts and the classification of the each organism.&lt;br/&gt;The cards were developed by a biotech company and a team of Raffles Institution students who have decided that that there are others ways to learn life sciences aside from textbooks and stacks of notes.&lt;br/&gt;First conceptualised by Genecet Biotechnologies, a leading biotech company that provides education in life sciences to schools, the prototype was then passed to the RI students &amp;mdash;Melvyn Kee, Hoe Si En, Nicholas Leong and Tan Ee Kuan &amp;mdash; to improve on.&lt;br/&gt;.Said Genecet Senior Manager Mr Jeffrey Lee: &amp;quot;Being students, the RI boys had a different perspective on the game, because we as adults don't really know what they would enjoy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
