			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A THOUSAND DEATHS WAIT IN THE MOST ALIVE PLACE ON EARTH...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Basics: Jungle Action brings players and Gamemasters tools to create exciting pulp-fiction style jungle adventures, with rules to support characters ranging in style from lan Quartermain to Tarzan to Fantomah. Feats, talent trees, starting occupations... it's all here, with an alternate spellcasting system, a few magic items, tables for generating adventure ideas, and sample characters thrown in for good measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the material presented has previously appeared in installments of NUELOW Games' Judy of the Jungle, Princess Pantha, and The Three Lives of Fantomah series of comics/rpg hybrid books. It has been revised for this release, which includes the never-before published rules for Ju-Ju Talismans, new feats, and a new talent tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Basics: Jungle Action is also fully compatible with NUELOW Games' other OGL d20 Modern releases, as well as the most popular OGL d20-based rules sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
