			<description>In the dice game Next!, players try to roll specific combinations of colors/symbols in order to claim target cards. The harder the target is to claim, the more points that card is worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, shuffle the 45 target cards, then lay them out face up in stacks of 15 in the three card trays. On a turn, a player can roll the dice up to three times, setting aside any dice that she wants to keep after each of the first two rolls. If a player could claim a target card after the first or second roll &amp;ndash; such as a card showing three-of-a-kind &amp;ndash; but decides to roll again, she can no longer claim that card after a future roll. Once a player claims a card, her turn ends and the next player goes, rolling all six dice to start the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player doesn't claim a card, however, the next player has the option of immediately claiming a card that matches the dice previously set aside or keeping those dice set aside and having only two rolls on his turn to try to claim a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards have icons that allow whoever wins it to take a special action, such as a bonus turn or theft of a card from an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a player has claimed a certain number of cards (4, 5 or 7 with four-to-six, three or two players), that player can decide to end the game. The game ends automatically once a player has claimed six, eight or ten cards (again, based on the number of players). Players then tally their points, and whoever has the high score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
