			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geasa is a storytelling game. It&amp;rsquo;s a game filled with goals, desires, needs, wants fears and then preys on all those things. It uses these elements to drive characters to their own ruin and leaves them broken and used by those who can&amp;rsquo;t care enough for the human condition. You see, Faeries are real and they&amp;rsquo;re all around us. They&amp;rsquo;re in the house when you can&amp;rsquo;t find your keys that you&amp;rsquo;re certain you put down on the counter. They&amp;rsquo;re in the random noises you hear at night when you&amp;rsquo;re alone. They&amp;rsquo;re in the changeling in the bedroom. They cause your dog to run and hide and the cat to hiss menacingly at nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Just the Rules&amp;quot; version of Geasa contains only the Creative Commons licensed rules used in the full game.  These rules are available as a free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
