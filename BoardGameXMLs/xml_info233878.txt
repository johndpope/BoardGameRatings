			<description>A Karrewiet champion! A board game full of questions and funny facts about animals, showbizz, sports, school, the world and nature &amp;amp; science. Surprise your opponent with your knowledge about stuff that's happening on our planet. Gather all the pieces of the different categories while moving around on the board using direction stones. While collecting your pieces, you build a small cube. When the cube is complete, rush to the finish to be the first one to enter and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karrewiet is named after the Belgium television program about the news. The game can be played with 2 to 4 players and is recommended for kids older than 8 years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
