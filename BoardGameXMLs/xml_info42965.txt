							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Subway Series:  World Series Baseball Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subway Series is a table-top baseball game that recreates the Brooklyn Dodgers v. New York Yankees World Series of  the 1950&amp;lsquo;s.  All of the plays of  each of the games played in the two historic ballparks (Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field) during the 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1956 World Series is &amp;ldquo;charted &amp;ldquo; with mathematical accuracy for the chance of each event happening.  The game is a cleverly unique system that recreates the history of these series games. All of the actions that actually happened during the games from the 1952, 53, 55, and 56 series are charted onto the fields, and by a roll of the 3 dice (producing  216 different outcomes) these plays will happen according to the actual probability of such an event.  All of the ground outs, hits, (singles, doubles, triples, HR's), fly balls, line outs, strikeouts, walks, and errors! Anybody who is familiar with the &amp;quot;Red Barber Baseball&amp;quot; game of the 1950's will recognize the basic game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes simple cardstock ballpark models of Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field.  As well as Roster Sheets for both teams for 1952, 53, 55 and 56. These sheets include dice roll adjustments for each player in each park to better reflect each hitters achievements for each park during each year according to historical probability.  In many ways this is BASEBALL HISTORY at a glance.  Just looking at the ballpark recreations shows where all of the plays took place in each area of each park. This is a BASEBALL GAME which faithfully recreates the hitting exploits of each team in each ballpark, through all four of the Subway Series of the 1950's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional infomation:&lt;br/&gt;The game as originally published in 1988 came with a short &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; of the four World Series that was written especially for this game by Hall of Fame sportswriter Bob  Broeg of St.Louis.  Very few games were printed and they were used primarily as a promo for BAUER DIAMONDS (maker of model ballpark kits).  Many were sold thru magazine adds, but some were given as gifts to family, friends, and supporters of BAUER DIAMONDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
