			<description>Pitchstorm is a party card game that puts players in the position of unprepared writers pitching movie ideas to the world's worst executives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round, one player acts as the executive, and everyone else attempts to pitch them movie ideas based on a character card and a plot card. At some point during each pitch, though, the executive may add a note card to the pitch and force the writer to add some really terrible new elements to their movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the pitches, the executive chooses which movie they liked the best, with that person scoring a point, then the game continues from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In groups of 6-12, players split into teams of two and must work with a partner to pitch their movie. This also means that there are two executives, and each of them gets to play a note card onto the pitch, leading to some pretty ridiculous movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
