							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blind Peg</name>
									
			<description>Up to four players each have a wooden board with 10 holes for pegs. They blindly draw colored pegs out of the can which is also used to store the game. If the peg is their color, them they get to score it, otherwise the peg is discarded and it is the next players turn. Two specially colored pegs. A silver peg forces a player to remove one of his pegs and return it to the can. A gold peg gives the player three more draws in the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was packaged in a round can about 3.5 inches in diameter and 4.75 inches tall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
