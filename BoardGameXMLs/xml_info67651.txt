							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dungeon Under the Mountain: Level 8</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain, Level 8&lt;br/&gt;Secret staircases and dark passageways take the adventurers from the Demon Fortress at level 7 to the so-called &amp;quot;Undercity&amp;quot;, on level 8 of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. The Undercity is populated by all kinds of dark beings: mind flayers, beholders, snake people and more. A single ruler does not exist, instead various power groups fight each other in order to obtain control over the Undercity. The Undercity features two main areas: the upper city and the lower city, divided by a long fortress wall dotted by watching towers. A single gate connects the lower and the upper city but is known of other, hidden underground passages....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Return of the Mammoth Dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under The Mountain is a massive dungeon you can locate anywhere in your campaign world. Each level contains hundreds of rooms ready to be filled with the critters of your choice and with the devious traps you prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product contains one king-size map (22&amp;quot;x34&amp;quot;) and the same map divided in eight US letter sheets. So, your choice is to print the whole map (maybe through a print server) or print yourself the single pieces and tape them together. You can print even a small portion of the dungeon and scale it as you see fit since these products are completely vector-based; therefore you will not suffer loss of print resolution. So, you could print out every single room in battlemap-scale, for use with your miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back to old-school mammoth dungeon, this product offers a variety of uses. You can simply take it straight, fill the rooms and start your favorite dungeon crawl campaign. The dungeon has suggested key areas but, if you want customization, it lies few clicks before you! Using the &amp;quot;Rule the Dungeon&amp;quot; feature you can alter the map as you wish to suit your needs. Want a blank dungeon without features? Want just the key areas over a white background? Want to print only some portions of the dungeon? Want to make handouts for your players with the dungeon without features? You can do all and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
