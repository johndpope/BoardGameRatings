			<description>Plan your day, where you will be, what you are trying to catch and explore the beautiful areas between your starting point at the cabin and your destination, the campfire.  Gather with your friends, but you will have to be clever as you recount your day and the events that happened in order to collect the catches you need to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campfire Tales is a game about story management!  As you progress in telling the path you took, hour by hour other players will have a chance to interrupt, and change the sequence of events in their favor.  There is a lot of storytelling fun to be had and of course an incredible amount of strategy in what information you reveal or keep hidden from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players will plot out their movement from area to area strategizing on what type of 'catch' they want to collect. If no one contests, they have first pick.  As the story progresses, other players will jump in to alter the events provided that they were in the location at or before the current player.  These interruptions allow the other players to sneak in and grab 'catches' that they want.  At the end of the game, players will total their catches and declare a winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
