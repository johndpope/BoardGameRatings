			<description>Game description from the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take on the role of a captain taking passengers to distant lands. You can collect points by making skilful manoeuvres, but your points can also be influenced by the elements. You have to be attentive to make sure you don't have any &amp;quot;stowaways&amp;quot; on board, because the coastguard can thwart your plans. You also have to make sure you have enough provisions. If you can overcome the challenges and get as many passengers as possible to their destination ports then you will be - with a bit of luck - the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a ship which he moves around from port to port on the wooden game board. During the game, players draw port cards showing a destination and its value. The players then can load passengers and bring them to these destinations. They have to make sure to have enough provision for all their passengers. The goal is to reach one of two objectives: either a general objective (40 VP), or a personal objective (chosen from a personal objective card when having reached at least 20 VP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game round is divided into two phases: an action phase and a movement phase. During the action phase, the starting player rolls two dice and then chooses to take&lt;br/&gt;A) the two actions associated with the dice results rolled or&lt;br/&gt;B) take one action not associated with a dice result.&lt;br/&gt;All the other player then take one single action: if the starting player chooses A) they have to choose B) and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possible actions are: take a port card, take a passenger/provisions card, load passenger(s), load provisions, take and execute an event card, lose 1 VP and choose any action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the movement phase, the active player can move his/her ship up to the number of spaces corresponding to the sum of his two dice. The other players can then move the higher of the two numbers rolled. When arriving in a destination port, players can unload passengers to gather victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
