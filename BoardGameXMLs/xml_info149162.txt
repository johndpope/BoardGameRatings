							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Thousand Leaves</name>
									
			<description>A mythico-historical card game based on 1000 cards that weave an edutaining spell through the looking glass of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game of history, drama and mystery made from 1000 unique Cards, each inspired by special parts of history. It may be played by 2 people, although the game is ideally played with 4-6 participants. The title evokes the oldest known Japanese poetry anthology, Ten Thousand Leaves, which transferred many oral poetry traditions to paper for the first time in the 8th Century. A Thousand Leaves is also a translation of &amp;ldquo;Chiba&amp;rdquo;, a region in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player is a Leader of one of the 8 Realms. The game takes place in Turns, each of which consists of 4 PHASES: Diplomatic, Military, Society and Spirit. In each Phase, each player may take one free Action (&amp;ldquo;Phase Action&amp;rdquo;).  Armies may traverse the globe or Priests build Temples, units turn against their masters or debates alter the fate of nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features a representation of ancient warfare, complete with a Center, Left and Right and real battlefield strategies.  Each player takes an action through pieces (Face Cards) on an imaginary board, alternating until all pieces have taken at least one action before the next turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
