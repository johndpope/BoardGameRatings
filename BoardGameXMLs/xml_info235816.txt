			<description>The game is played as two teams, both trying to escape from troll mountain. First players have to collect enough cards to repair the route, and then move through the route to safety. But beware, the troll might catch you. Then you will have to start your escape from the beginning again. The first team to get all their figures to safety is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
