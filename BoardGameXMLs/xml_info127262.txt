			<description>A GAME OF WORDS. Find and eliminate words [in a grid a letter tiles]. 4 puzzling modes. Longer words, larger rewards. Tackle tiles and keep your tower low.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 SINGLE PLAYER MODES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. TOWER MODE. No pressure here. Try and get the highest score possible out of 150 letters, eliminating small words to set up 7- and 9-letter block busters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. PUZZLE MODE. Every word you make adds a new row of letters! Strategic word finding at its best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. EXTREME PUZZLE MODE. Like Puzzle Mode, but with the minimum word length cranked up. Experts only!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. RUSH MODE. Row of letters build up over time. Find words as fast as you can, but be careful you don't back yourself into a corner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Also, there is a DEBATE MODE for 2 players with two devices (and two copies of the game) to compete via Bluetooth.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more, see the the publisher's website at spelltower.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
