			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game takes place in the Shrek mythos. It is designed to mimic the classic Labyrinth-tilt games where a ball must be maneuvered to the end of the maze while avoiding holes. The story of the game centers on the fact that the characters must manipulate a tilting board to direct food towards Shrek's hungry children. There are 24 characters from which to choose (some are unlocked through gameplay), but they do not add anything unique to the way the game is played. There are 4 worlds with 4 levels each for a total of 16 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single player has the player manipulating two on-screen characters at the same time. Each character is positioned on the end of a plank and the player controls them by moving the respective analog stick on their controller. When the plank is moved, the food ball slides toward the waiting children. The purple portals must be avoided since they will destroy the food. Normal mode has the player move through each level in order, whereas Score Attack mode is more fast-paced and you must feed children until you run out of food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player can either be competitive (split screen with each player working on their own level) or co-op (each player takes control of one of the two characters and must work in unison to alter the trajectory of the food on the plank.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
