			<description>Since the beginning of time, or maybe longer, this place has been here. It is a beacon of sorts, attracting the souls of those who both lived and died with recklessness in their hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bound by some unknown force, these wayward spirits cannot leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so they remain&amp;hellip; With time their souls will rot. They will fade away and they will be forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even here there is hope&amp;hellip; a legend whispered among the ghosts and specters. That any spirit to reach the tower&amp;rsquo;s peak will be granted one wish&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
