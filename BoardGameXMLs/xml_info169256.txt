							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hoverkraft</name>
									
			<description>Hoverkraft is an old-school building game with a twist. Players take turns stacking pieces on a platform... that levitates. Using magnetic repulsion, we've built a gameboard that defies gravity (take that, weak force!). Stack translucent game pieces higher and higher or remove them as the die dictates. The last player to place a block without causing the platform to tumble wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hoverkraft is intended for two players, but it's fun to challenge yourself to build bigger and better structures. And it's a fast game, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds (what? we were distracted) to 5 minutes. Bring it to a party and you can have an entire tournament in a few hours. Your friends may curse you for introducing them to Hoverkraft at first, but they'll be drawn back to it. There's something addictive about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
