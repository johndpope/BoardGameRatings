							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiddledy Winks: 5 Different Games Complete</name>
									
			<description>This 1935 publication from Milton Bradley was clearly issued to compete with Parker Bros. earlier Tiddledy Winks Bowling. In addition to the standard Tiddledy Winks game, there is a board inset in the box set up like a dartboard with 10 segments and values ranging from 5 to 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Spot Tiddledy Winks requires snapping winks onto the board and totalling the scores (highest wins), while the Game of Forty-Five requires snapping five winks on a turn, with the player getting closest to 45 without going over winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There also are two bowling games included. One involves setting up ten wooden pins in a standard bowling triangle on the table, with three snaps per turn and resetting the pins after each player turn. Players score one point per pin downed, and highest total after 10 turns wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the other bowling game, the pins are set up on the board in the 10 segments around the cup. The score per pin downed depends on the board segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
