							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pick-A-Winner Card Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Do you have Yak? Oh, joy!&amp;quot; If I ask you for Yak and you have Yak, you have to give me Yak. Or Powdered Toastman, or Hip Boots Filled with Cole Slaw or any of the other crazy things known and loved by those who know and love Ren Ho&amp;euml;k and Stimpy. As you try to collect the most matched pairs of cards, use a Magic Nose Goblin to pick a pair from another player, or Pick Somebody, Pick Everybody, or Peek &amp;amp; Pick to take cards from your opponents. Just be sure you say &amp;quot;Oh, joy!&amp;quot; whenever you get a card you need. If you forget, give back Glazed Ham . . . or Stimpy's Hairball . . . or a Bloated Sack of Protoplasm. You might even have to give back Yak!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's like a meaner but whimsical version of &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot;. The inclusion of the action cards add depth and strategy to what otherwise would be a rather ordinary game. But the theming makes it a tad better, with the requirement to say &amp;quot;Oh joy!&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Pick It!&amp;quot; allusion to boogers as that which will keep fans of the series (or just of nosepicking) interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
