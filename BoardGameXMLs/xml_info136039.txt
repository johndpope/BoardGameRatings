Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1,000 years in the future, humanity has traveled well beyond their Sol home to carve out a new empire in a nearby fold of the galaxy. Mankind has all but given up their warlike ways, instead following a destiny of peace, exploration, and discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, in the year 1044 A.E. (After Exodus), the cyborg race Xyl discovered humanity, and proceeded to systematically begin the process of what they had done to every other species in their quadrant - exterminate them to the last microbe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was supposed to be easy, just another species to eradicate in the search for the 'perfect hybrid' race of Xyl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pity nobody told the humans...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission as the human supreme commander in this exciting solitaire game is fourfold: First, rebuild and retool the peaceful human economy and set it on a war footing. Second, develop and build mighty starships of war to bring the fight to the Xyl, and to protect your systems from bombing and conquest. Third, develop new technologies that could turn the tide of the war.. or turn out to be worthless dead-ends. And finally, destroy the 4 Flagships of the 4 Grand Fleets that each contain a portion of the quadrant 'master reprogramming plan', or if you are bold (or desperate) enough, send an fleet to destroy the AI Core located somewhere on the Xyl homeworld. Only then can humanity breathe easy... but the Xyl are merciless and though they can be slowed, they can never be stopped... until and unless their xenophobic AI is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no diplomacy. There is no surrender. Humanity must Fight... or Vanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
