							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perfect Archer</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A snipers speed and precision, an assassin's dispassionate eye, and an action movie star's charisma and bravado. The Perfect Archer has it all. He's got the strength to draw back an 80-pound test bowstring and drive an arrow through a &amp;Atilde;&amp;sbquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;frac12; inch of steel, or stop a speeding car by putting a titanium arrow into its engine block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He's got the accuracy to take out a gunslinger by blasting the pistol out of his hands with a well placed arrow, and the skill to put an arrow through a criminals throat without even ruffling the hair of the hostage. And the Perfect Archer is never shy about sharing his opinions, accomplishments or just how damn good he is with a bow and arrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Advanced Class allows you to play a new breed of Hero! Included in this PDF are a host of new Feats and abilities including Champion's Pull, Pincushion, Beloved Bow, Fullisade and more. Also included are rules for specialty arrows and various modern bows and accessories for the modern master of archery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
