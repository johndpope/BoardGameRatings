			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungai, Artifacts, and Mechs, Oh My!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With our next installment to the Ruins Perilous, dangerous wonders are birthed from the spoils left by those that came before. &amp;ldquo;The Fungarium&amp;rdquo; carved itself into being from the leavings of a formerly grand banquet hall, an excursion by myceloids, and the exacting corruption of a deal with a dragon with an uncanny twist. How fares Questor candidates in a test of diplomacy between a pair of races with alien frames of reference and points of view. Ruins Perilous - The Fungarium is intended for a party of 4th level characters by Mike Welham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fire &amp;amp; Ice&amp;rdquo; is a mission of destruction for 9th level characters by Bret Boyd. Are the PCs up to the mission of destroying a minor artifact? A mission that all-but destroyed the prior party to attempt to complete it? On an island that intersects with the Plane of Fire, the party must complete their mission before an unknown nemesis lays waste to them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;And so the hero fought the corrupting god, in hand the ageless brand / withstood its sickened whisperers, the knight in iron clad.&amp;rdquo; Deep within a badlands, against insurmountable foes, a party of 14th level characters finds themselves as the blood, heart, mind, muscle, and sinew of an ancient construct known as the Iron Knight. &amp;ldquo;In Iron Clad&amp;rdquo; by Alex Putnam, challenges a party in this most unusual event-based adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, Creighton Broadhurst offers up a pair of drop-in encounters, Bal&amp;rsquo;s Garden and Deluge of Death, respectively for 6th level and 13th level characters. Suitable for underground&lt;br/&gt;adventures, Broadhurst&amp;rsquo;s talented mind offers enjoyable one off encounters to challenge your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Steven D. Russell continues his demonstrable advice on how to use and work sandbox campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However you slice it, this issue of Adventure Quarterly is chock full of adventure and excitement, something we all crave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
