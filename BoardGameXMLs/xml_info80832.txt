							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Penguin Harlequinade</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Penguin Harlequinade is a fast-paced comic role-playing game based on Commedia dell&amp;rsquo;Arte, an ancient Italian style of masked comedy theatre. The game focuses on ludicrous plans, ridiculous plots and very silly action. If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind playing a character with the mental attributes of a brain-damaged ant high on caffeine, you&amp;rsquo;ll really enjoy this unique game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, a disclaimer. There are no penguins in this game. Or at least, we have run many sessions of it in multiple tournaments, and there are yet to be any penguins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The source of the name was as follows: we were going to a tournament in Wellington called KapCon. We needed a name for this new system we&amp;rsquo;d come up with, and we were stumped. Eventually one or other of us came up with The Penguin Harlequinade because there are penguins in Dunedin (where we&amp;rsquo;re from) and not in Wellington; and because the system was designed as a Commedia Dell&amp;rsquo;Arte system and the Commedia was called a Harlequinade in England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you really want to play a game with penguins in it, look out for The Penguin Masquerade, a forthcoming game which we have yet to write. Its premise is simple &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;re a penguin, just keep it under your hat...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
