			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally developed for Rainbow Arts as &amp;quot;Giana 2 &amp;ndash; Arthur and Martha in Future World&amp;quot;, the legal fallout from Great Giana Sisters caused a name change and a re-skin to move from a fantasy to a space setting. Instead of two children, the player now controls two robots known as &amp;quot;Heavy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Metal&amp;quot;. This wasn't enough though and the game was eventually released only in Germany, and by ReLINE rather than Rainbow Arts. It only received a release in English-speaking countries on later compilations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gameplay remains highly reminiscent of the Mario games, with a left to right scrolling playfield and blocks to break. Coins are replaced with diamonds (or &amp;quot;Lithium&amp;quot;). Differences include that the player starts with a bouncing shot similar to a fire-flower which can be upgraded through the game to fire multiple shots. The player also has a shield and a smart-bomb which clears all enemies on the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer gameplay is unusual. As well as the standard hot-seat mode where control switches at the end of each life, with each player carrying on where they left off, there are two other options. Dead Mode is a cooperative mode with two players controlling the same robot, but control switched when a life is lost or at the end of a level. Time Mode also has both players controlling the same robot, but control switches every 10 seconds - particularly challenging in a platformer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
