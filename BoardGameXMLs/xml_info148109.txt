							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cryo Room</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cryo Room is a full-color, 32 x 30 inch, floor plan of a Cryo Room, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Get those biological samples frozen for the return trip. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a long one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cryo Chamber is a single room map featuring sixteen cryogenic stasis chambers. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Cryo Chamber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cryo Chamber is meant to be used in near or far future science games, but could be adapted as a cutting edge high tech lab in a modern game focusing on cryogenics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One adventure featuring the Cryo Chamber could be that a Xenobiologist requires new samples for research (such as genetics, dissections, etc.). He hires the Player Characters to capture alien life forms, specifying a single life-bearing world in a nearby star system. The Player Characters make their way to the system and must find native creatures to capture or kill as specimens on the life-bearing planet in the system. If they capture the specimens alive, it&amp;rsquo;s worth a bonus from the Xenobiologist, whereas dead specimens are worth the standard fee. Once they acquire the specimens, they place them in the cryo chamber in stasis. The biology of these creatures isn&amp;rsquo;t fully known however. The creatures they thought were dead could have regeneration if not fully cut apart; live specimens could react to the cold by going into hibernation for a time before awakening after a healing slumber, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another complication could be a power outage in the cryo chamber unfreezing them. When the creatures awaken, they go berserk, attacking the cryo pods from the inside to free themselves and attacking any staff and crew in the room. The Player Characters need to rush down to the cryo room and defeat the creatures as well as repair any malfunctioning systems and the pods themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A twist could be the Player Characters finding a hacked code in the cryo chamber computers that started the power outage. The Player Characters use their communication panel to trace the code to a coded message from the Xenobiologist professor&amp;rsquo;s academy. If the Player Characters do a sensor sweep of the area, they find a small spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Xenobiologist is inside the ship and was hoping the creatures would kill the Player Characters and then collect the remaining samples using his student minions without having to pay the Player Characters at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Player Characters hail the ship, they get no response except for the ship turning and fleeing. Whether they pursue the ship is up to the Player Characters. If they do, a chase scene is started which may end with the Player Characters boarding the ship and the professor and his students in the end surrendering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
