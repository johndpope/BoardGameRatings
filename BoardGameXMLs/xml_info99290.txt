							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Unpleasant Horse</name>
									
			<description>The good news is that you are a horse with wings. Nobody doesn&amp;rsquo;t like those! The bad news is that you are a, well, rather unpleasant horse with wings. How unpleasant? Glad you asked. Get this: Your idea of a good time is bouncing from cloud to cloud and on to the backs of other, cuter flying ponies, who will thus be sent plummeting to a gruesome, bone-chewing demise, thanks to an unfortunately placed series of meat grinders on the ground below. (Really kind of a tragedy of civil engineering.) All is well and good for you, though&amp;mdash;unless you happen to miss a cloud or pony, and then, guess what? Those meat grinders don&amp;rsquo;t play favorites. So keep those wings flapping, don&amp;rsquo;t miss a jump, and keep a lookout for cool powerups to keep you flying longer and higher!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
