							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infinite Aliens 3</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alien life forms have been a core feature of science fiction since the genre was conceived. Since then the human mind has dreamed up countless speculations about what these creatures might look like and how they might interact with us.  Not only has science fiction inspired us to daydream about meeting beings from another planet, we have also created alien heroes to admire and emulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite Aliens 3 present ten fully detailed alien races for use in your Infinite Futures games.  Used as either a player character race or as an NPC, these great aliens will fit well in just about any sort of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
