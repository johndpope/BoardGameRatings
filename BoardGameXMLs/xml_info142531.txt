			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;Players try to win most of the dwarves' treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Collect as many plastic chips (&amp;quot;gold coins&amp;quot;) as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;The board shows one central circle and 9 circles arranged around it. Each circle has a number from 2 to 11 printed at the center, and a number of small markings corresponding to that number around it. A plastic pot filled with plastic chips is placed on the central circle.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the two six-sided dice. The result of a roll is added up and a chip is placed on one of the markings on the corresponding circle (e. g. if you roll a 4 and a 5, you put a chip on one of the markings on circle 9).&lt;br/&gt;If you roll a 12, you put a chip on a circle of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;When all markings on one circle have been filled and that number is rolled again, the player wins the chips from that circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has collected 20 chips or when there are no chips left in the pot. The player who has collected the most chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
