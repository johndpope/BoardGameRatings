							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Traveler&#039;s Guide to the Elemental Plane of Fire</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can You Take the Heat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Furnace. The Crematorium. Inferno. These are among the names that have been ascribed to the Elemental Plane of Fire, one of the most exotic, dangerous, and misunderstood of all the planes of existence. Home to the fabled City of Brass, the trading hub of the planes and the seat of power of the mighty efreet, the Elemental Plane of Fire also houses the ashen wastes, a massive continent of soot and ash inhabited with the ancient ghosts of the lost azer empire, the lava seas, vast oceans of liquid rock traversed by huge galleons made of volcanic rock, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the Elemental Plane of Fire as a campaign setting for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. The first section of the book provides rules for creating player characters and NPCs of the four main races that inhabit the plane: azer, efreet, fire elementals, and salamanders. As in the critically-acclaimed Liber Vampyr: Secrets of the Blood by Necromancers of the Northwest, each of these races is presented as a race suitable for a player character, rather than what is found in their bestiary entry, as well as a 20-level base class that allows characters of that race to unlock their full potential. The book also includes over 50 feats that allow characters to unlock additional fire-based or racial powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following this is a detailed look at the Elemental Plane of Fire itself, from the magical and supernatural effects that pervade the plane, to special environmental hazards only found here, and expanded rules for managing the size, spread, and intensity of fire on any plane, as well as a 40-page gazetteer of the Elemental Plane of Fire&amp;rsquo;s five main regions: the City of Brass, the ashen wastes, the lava seas, the plain of burning coals, and the treacherous volcanic range known as the teeth of Soraak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want to set a whole campaign in the Plane of Fire, or just a single adventure, or even if you just want to play an azer, efreet, fire elemental, or salamander in a game set in a less exotic locale, this book brings the Elemental Plane of Fire to life in a way that you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before. The only question remaining is: can you take the heat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
