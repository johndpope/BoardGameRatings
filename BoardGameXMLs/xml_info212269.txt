							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Day at the Fair</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's the day of the school's fund-raising fair. Every club has it's own booth up raising money for charity, for club activities or just to show off something they've done recently. You and your friends are set to be this year's best booth at the fair. Nothing will possibly go wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Except the issue someone might have when they're unknowingly not human and about to enter puberty. Or that reporter who's nosing around to make something out of an assignment to a school fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included within:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A basic one-shot scenario with three plot threads.&lt;br/&gt;    24 characters which may be used as either pre-generated PCs or NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;    Gameplay discussions regarding various kinds of fair booths.&lt;br/&gt;    Suggestions for expanding the scenario into a full campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
