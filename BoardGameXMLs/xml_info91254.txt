			<description>Game show &amp;quot;Mr. Cinema&amp;quot; of French television, hosted by Pierre Tchernia.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to earn the most money by hiring actors producing films and answering questions on the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plateau is formed at the center of a track with boxes &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; and boxes for individual players where they can display maps &amp;quot;actors&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;actresses&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;directors&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Initially, each receives a capital of 30 000 francs, and a pawn and 5 playing cards Each card represents an actor or a director, with down the list of movies about them, as well as a figure in the top corner.&lt;br/&gt;At each turn the player draws a card, rejects the show and moves his pawn as many spaces shown on the card rejected. According to the box where his token arrives, it can answer a question, start a player (so the corresponding map file on his game plan), place a card on his board director or change one of his cards to another cons the deck (with a penalty of 15 000 francs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issues are different values, from 15 000 to 30 000 francs. When a player has collected a card, actor and director corresponding to the same film, he must stop on a box &amp;quot;Projection&amp;quot; to validate his suit and collect dividends. It can then reject all his cards and leave, and departure for a second film.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has completed at least 2 movies. The richest player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
