			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the fantasy noir campaign setting Shotguns &amp;amp; Sorcery&amp;trade;.  Written by S&amp;amp;S author, Matt Forbeck, and powered by the just announced Cypher System&amp;trade; from Monte Cook Games, the Shotguns &amp;amp; Sorcery core book contains all you need to play in one book. Defy the power of the Imperial Dragon Guard. Try your luck against the undead outside the Great Circle. New challenges, old foes and allies: a whole new setup to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shotguns &amp;amp; Sorcery is set in Dragon City, a grim and gritty fantasy metropolis built on top of and inside of a walled-off mountain and ruled over by the Dragon Emperor. Legions of zombies scratch at the cut stones of the Great Circle every hour of the night, trying to tear the wall down for their mysterious necromantic commander, the Ruler of the Dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside the wall, the people work and scheme to find an edge and get ahead on the city&amp;rsquo;s dark alleys and magically lit streets. The green-skinned folk squat down in Goblintown, stacked right up against the wall, where they can hear the constant moaning of the dead all night long. Above them, the rest of the survivors live in neighborhoods of their own, each stratified by their longevity and social standing, which make for the kind of barriers no hack on an enchanted carpet can fly you past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robbing the ruins that lay outside the Great Circle is illegal, but it&amp;rsquo;s the best way for people with questionable talents with rune-laced shotguns to keep the gold flowing. And most days it beats selling dragon essence to the addicts who use it to fuel their magics, or hiring out as muscle for the dwarven gangs. As long as you keep your nose clean and give a wide berth to the Imperial Guard, there&amp;rsquo;s a fortune to be made in Dragon City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just hope you live long enough to enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
