							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Corvette Trivia Quiz</name>
									
			<description>From the box...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game has been created with the Corvette enthusiast in mind.  We have designed the game where one can broaden his knowledge about Corvette history in an atmosphere of competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great deal of effort as been put forth to obtain the data for this game. Hundreds of sources and publications have been checked to ensure the proper answer for each question; including 30 combined years of working on the Corvette Assembly Line.  But nothing is absolute in the world of auto production, especially Corvettes. All questions are for the enjoyment of the family.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a trivia game but also a race around the board for a certain number of laps which are agreed upon by the players before starting(standard = 3 laps). Each turn you are asked a question (multiple choice). If you answer correctly you may roll the dice and move that number of spaces. If incorrect then you don't move.  There are also some special spaces on the board for flat tire, pit stop, engine trouble, traffic jams, plant tours, etc.  The first to finish the set number of laps wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three levels to the game: &lt;br/&gt;1. Beginner: Roll the dice and advance WITHOUT answering questions. (I'm being serious, it's in the rules)&lt;br/&gt;2. Enthusiast: Standard rules.&lt;br/&gt;3. Corvette Buff: Ask questions without multiple choice options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Game Board&lt;br/&gt;Set of 100 trivia cards (6 questions per card)&lt;br/&gt;4 Corvette pawns&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some question examples(most are pretty tough):&lt;br/&gt;- What was the first year forr AM/FM tape systems? 1963, 1977, or 1979.&lt;br/&gt;- A soft top was available in 1962. True or false.&lt;br/&gt;- How many interior colors were available in 1955?  3, 4, or 6.&lt;br/&gt;- How may 1978 Corevettes were built? 32,966, 37,267, or 46,726.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
