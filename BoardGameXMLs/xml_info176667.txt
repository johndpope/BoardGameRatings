			<description>Coin Tower is a casual abstract game that can be played for adults and children (&amp;gt;6 years). It's a game that have the spirit of Pong hau k&amp;rsquo;i or Tic-Tac-Toe; it's a little abstract that can be solved but that you can play with your children, or in a pub with casual gamers, because the original idea was to make it on a coaster. You need a little board game and only ten coins, that forms two towers of five coins each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build two towers, five coins each tower. Each player places, per turn, one tower on an empty space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first turn is for the player who placed the first tower on board. Per turn each player moves any tower one or two cells on the same row or column, without changing direction. When a player moves a tower can carry as many coins as he wants to the target cell, but he must leave at least one coin in the origin cell. The target cell must be empty and in his movement the tower cannot jump over other towers or other coins. Every move will create new towers, which can be moved in next turns. A tower consists of at least two coins. A coin on a cell cannot move, but can block the movement of other towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player on his turn cannot move a tower. The player who made the last move is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
