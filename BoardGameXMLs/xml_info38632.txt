			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using miniature figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;In 1745 Bonnie Prince Charles arrived in Scotland to try and claim the throne of England for the Stuarts. He hoped to overthow the Hanoverian King, George II. Some of the Scottish clans joined his cause. At Prestonpans near Edinburgh the highlanders caught the English army by surprise. The poorly trained and ill-prepared English were no match for the Highlanders. Charles won a famous victory, and began planning for the invasion of England.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
