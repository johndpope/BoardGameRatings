			<description>Lose It All&lt;br/&gt;    The object of the game is to collect as much money, love, and possessions as possible before you loose it all. The game can be played with 2-8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Start:&lt;br/&gt;Players choose their pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with $1500 (however the money can summed up to equal $1500 is fine. Ex. Two $500 bills and five $100 bills or three $500 Bills)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players start on the START space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place all of the &amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve Found True Love&amp;rsquo; cards (8 total) on the &amp;lsquo;Found True Love&amp;rsquo; Space. Do the same for the &amp;lsquo;Makin&amp;rsquo; Money&amp;rsquo; cards on the &amp;lsquo;Makin Money&amp;rsquo; Space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll Dice to determine who goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the first person is determined to start the game all players&amp;rsquo; turns are random. After each play you must spin the bottle. When the bottle stops turning and the head of the bottle is facing someone that person goes. You cannot go twice in a row it must land on someone other than yourself. In the case of two players just go back and forth, no need to spin the bottle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;Once it is your turn, roll the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move the amount of spaces as dictated by the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you have moved to that space pick a card from the draw pile (the draw pile should consist of all cards that are not money, making money, or found true love cards). If you land on a space that says &amp;lsquo;Lose it all&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Get scammed&amp;rsquo;, you move to the large corner space with those titles on the board and DO NOT move off of it until you roll a &amp;ldquo;6&amp;rdquo; or higher by adding together both dice. Then you move only ONE space off of &amp;lsquo;Lose it all&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Get Scammed&amp;rsquo;. You can be sent to these spaces by either landing on them or drawing a card that sends you there, either way the rules apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow what the cards tell you to do from there on out.&lt;br/&gt;a.    Put cards next to the draw deck that you cannot keep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b.    If you get a keepable card (ex. A house or car) and you already have it nothing happens just put it in the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;c.    Re-shuffle the cards once there are no more left in the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d.    If you land on a corner space your turn ends there regardless of how many spaces you rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to end the game:&lt;br/&gt;     Someone has found a true love card on the &amp;ldquo;Find true love&amp;rsquo; space&amp;rsquo;, they have a job card, a house card, and a car card, land on the &amp;lsquo;Makin Money&amp;rsquo; Space to get a &amp;ldquo;Makin Money&amp;rsquo; card, and make their way back to the Start space. When they have done all this they have won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
