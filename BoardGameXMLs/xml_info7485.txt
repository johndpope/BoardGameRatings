							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The HexGames</name>
									
			<description>One of the so-called &amp;quot;Penny Games&amp;quot; from tjgames, The HexGames are variations on both Reversi and Checkers, using a hexagonal board with hexagonal spaces, instead of a square board with square spaces.  The game is basically a board printed on heavy-stock paper, and a set of rules; you're supposed to supply the pieces for the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the envelope: &amp;quot;Take a checkers board, grab it by the two sides in the middle, and pull really hard until you stretch it into a hexagon.  Now you have the basic idea behind the HexBoard Games.  A cheap Hollywood remake of two classic 8x8 board games, Checkers and Reversi.  If you really did try stretching your checkers board and it ripped ... sorry about that.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexversi requires 91 penny-sized pieces that are differently colored on each side.  Hexchex requires 12 standard checkers for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
