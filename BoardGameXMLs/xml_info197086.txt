							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trick-Taker</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This set of rules may be used as a brief interlude within a larger RPG campaign or as a short standalone game. It is ideally suited for 3-5 people (with a Game Moderator adopting the role of the Trick-Taker) but may be adapted for a larger group. Standard playing cards are used and the basic rules of trick-taking card games (such as Bridge, Hearts, Spades, Tarot, Whist etc.) are used to determine the outcome of situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The events in the game unfold from the hubris of the players&amp;rsquo; characters after completing a task. Perhaps they have defeated an enemy and accumulated a hoard of loot. However, in doing so, they have tilted the balance and are no longer the underdogs that they once were.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trick-Taker represents an entity (human, supernatural, artificial or other) who mocks authority and holds the players accountable for their actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is inspired by Trickster characters found in mythology and folk tales from around the world. The choice of setting is up to the GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
