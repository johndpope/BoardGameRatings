							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empire of the Dead: Requiem</name>
									
			<description>Requiem is a miniatures expansion of the game &amp;quot;Empire of the Dead&amp;quot;, a whole host of new characters, and ingenious steampunk machines, from Victorian fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in an age where a steampunk victorian empire rules the world. An empire fueled by an extraordinary discovery. The mineral that has become known as infernium. But all is not well, dark shadows from our deepest nightmares stalk the smog shrouded streets of London. An ancient evil is rising from defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose from 4 starter factions which they can expand and add to from a range of special character models. Each game is played over several turns, each turn consisting of four distinct phases (maintenance, initiative, activation and combat).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion, Requiem, adds 70 new characters to the original game and introduces new factions like the Clickers (a race of automata) or the Supernatural Branch (new character types, weapons and machines used by Scotland Yards Occult Police force) and also the rules covering the new Victorian Machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
