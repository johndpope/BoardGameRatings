							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frigga&#039;s Chosen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the Apegia mountains, long forgotten to mortals, is a small building that leads into the heart of the mountain range. Once a Clan of goblins called this place home, but have now been slaughtered and raised as Charion servants to the cult of Orus. The Cult searches for an artifact of the Usarm that will aid them in the release of Orus and provide him with a sacrifice that will empower him and sate his Unmortal masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends say this artifact the Cult frantically searches for rests in the Apegia mountains waiting for its black heart. Where this heart is no one knows, but if found the relic has the potential to destroy everything from the City of Newrk on the coasts to Icago in the west. Hundreds of miles of death and destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frigga has summoned her last surviving Chosen; a woman who has turned away from her faith, to stop the cult from finding this object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for them a small band of adventurers has been swept up into this battle of life, death, and godly politics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
