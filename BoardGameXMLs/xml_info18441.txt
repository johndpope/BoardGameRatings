			<description>Description      &lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a trivia game. It&amp;rsquo;s a strategy game. It&amp;rsquo;s Marble Quest! Test your knowledge and your skills in this unique game that combines 3 dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe with multiple-choice trivia questions in four categories; social studies, the human body, earth science, and pop culture. Three levels of game play mean the whole family can get involved.

Game comes with game board, 200 trivia questions, 32 glass marbles, plastic game tower, dice, and instructions. For 2 &amp;ndash; 4 players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner Top Toy of the Year Award 2004, Creative Child Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
