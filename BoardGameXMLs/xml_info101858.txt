			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge&amp;quot; is the sequel to the 2001 computer game &amp;quot;Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;John Cooper's brother, Marshal Ross Cooper, has been killed by a criminal called &amp;quot;Angel Face&amp;quot;, and John wants to avenge him. Along with his new ally Hawkeye, he gathers his friends once again, and together they start looking for any clue that would lead them to Ross' killer. Soon they find out that John's brother was killed because he was investigating evil plans between soldiers and the red Indians...&lt;br/&gt;Once again you control John Cooper and his gang. Though it's possible to play the game in an top-down/isometric view much like the previous game, Desperados 2 is rendered fully in realtime 3D, allowing the player to zoom and rotate the camera in many angels. The camera can even be switched to a third person view, and follow the individual characters around. This increased functionality becomes especially useful when moving around inside a building or engaging enemies in gunplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
