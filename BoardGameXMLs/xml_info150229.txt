			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best guide for designing story-filled locations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do the PCs go when they enter town? Inns, taverns and restaurants of course! But after dozens of such encounters in your games, these places have lost their novelty and excitement. It's time to shake things up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make it impossible for your players to take the table in the back corner by designing a round tower tavern.
