			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using micro-scale tank miniatures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The German invasion of the USSR in 1941 was, at first, a smashing success. However by 1943 the German army was on the brink of disaster . . . Hitler decided to gamble on a massive armored assault designed to force the Soviets out of the war before the Allies could open a new front in Western or Southern Europe. The Soviets anticipated the German attack at Kursk and prepared the battlefield with dense mine fields, trenches, and well hidden gun positions. They also assembled an enormous reserve force . . . The battle of Prokhorovka, near the end of the Kursk campaign, was the largest tank battle in history.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the rules are very basic, they incorporate concepts such as unit activation, opportunity fire, heavy/medium tank formations, artillery, and air strikes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
