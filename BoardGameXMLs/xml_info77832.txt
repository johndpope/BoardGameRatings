			<description>Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law is a video game developed for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable by High Voltage Software...It was published by Capcom of America. The game is based on the Adult Swim cartoon of the same name, with collaboration of the show's writers. The same voice actors used for the animated show reprised their roles for the game, with the exception of Stephen Colbert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played like the Ace Attorney Capcom court-themed series, but with the Harvey Birdman type of humor and feel. The game also include cameos of Capcom characters within the 5 cases.  A trailer for the game shown at the 2007 E3 Convention confirmed that the game included the mechanics of cross-examination and evidences lists from the Ace Attorney series, as well as cameos by many Street Fighter characters. Thanks to the show's simple flash process, the game was able to closely mimic the show's animation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
