							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mitarra - The Agenda of Itherelle</name>
									
			<description>User Note: Available as a pdf with several audio enhanced features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party is sent on a quest to the Cave of Crystals to gather rare spell components. Experience the thrill of the search as they venture into the wild, meet a tribe of barbarian elves, and battle their way though forests and caverns to the final confrontation, in search of their goal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caves of Crystal is the second in a long series of adventures comprising the Agenda of Itherelle. Designed to bring a party of 4-6 2nd level characters together and introduce their players to Mitarra, The Caves of Crystal is more than just an adventure. It is also a resource for the Mitarra nation, with everything DMs need to get familiar with the nation, but not so much to be overwhelming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitarra is a small, geographically isolated, human civilization that can be placed into most larger, pre-existing settings with little effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the pages are an extensive look at Mitarra the city, and its newest town, Istanus. Included are maps, a presentation of the leaders, and a thumbnail tour of each of the cities&amp;rsquo; various districts. The module includes extensive game notes and DM aids, full color and black and white maps, and a series of complete PDF bookmarks for easy reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
