			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Butcher, Baker, Candlestick-Maker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society is built on the backs of people who gather resources and turn them into food, shelter, and finished goods. Low-Tech Companion 3: Daily Life and Economics looks at the lot of ordinary TL0-4 folk &amp;ndash; much of which is of concern to adventurers, too! Contents include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Food. How to gather and prepare it, whether you're raising crops or hunting game on the way to your next adventure.&lt;br/&gt;    * Domesticated Animals. Stats for common beasts as sources of both labor and food.&lt;br/&gt;    * Big Machines. Costs, weights, and performance figures for heavy construction and industrial equipment.&lt;br/&gt;    * Manufacturing. Work out how long it takes to make that nifty new sword and how much it costs &amp;ndash; and learn secrets that would make it better!&lt;br/&gt;    * Construction. Detailed rules for erecting buildings of all sorts, from log cabins to Gothic cathedrals.&lt;br/&gt;    * Transportation. Guidelines for hauling and shipping almost anything, with stats for low-tech merchant vessels.&lt;br/&gt;    * Occupations. Details about many common jobs, complete with new Professional Skills and practical advice on thriving as a merchant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're not satisfied with fantasy worlds where nobody gets his hands dirty and everything is for sale at the market, then Low-Tech Companion 3: Daily Life and Economics is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-Tech Companion 3: Daily Life and Economics is a supplement to GURPS Low-Tech. The information on manpower, manufacturing, and resources would be useful in any campaign that values historical realism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
