			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A fast-paced guessing game of delicious deduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take turns playing customer and server. As the customer, make three food selections. Place your order by displaying the menu clue cards. Flip the timer! The server rushes to fill the order by using the clues. Ring the bell when the order is correct!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more food items you serve correctly, the more money you earn! Switch roles and play again!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game for young children features cardboard food items, matching clue cards, and a screen to allow the customer to secretly choose three food items. The server can see only the clues (one for each item, describing color, shape, or temperature) and must figure out the customer's order using logic and process of elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
