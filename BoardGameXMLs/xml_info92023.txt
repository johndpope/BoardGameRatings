							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Valley Forge II: A Supplement to Valley Forge</name>
									
			<description>Information compiled from the website tomeoftreasures.com with information from the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is essentially an &amp;quot;errata section&amp;quot; for TSR's game Valley Forge, a game released at GenCon for the 1976 Bi-Centennial.  However, this game product was self-published by the designer Dave Wesely as he was being called into the US Army.  He hired former TSR employee David R. Megarry to work out the details.  Combined with Valley Forge, this provides 44 pages of tactical rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some copies were sold bundled with TSR's Valley Forge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
