			<description>This very old game from Milton Bradley comes from around 1920. It is a simple spin and move game. It depicts a dirigible race. (Since the age of dirigibles was between the mid 19teens and the late 1930's (Hindenburg crash) I feel reasonably comfortable using 1920 for the game design date. Also the dirigible is also called a balloon in this game. The board is a very simple track which includes a few spaces where you get another turn or you have to move back some. The first player to move his &amp;quot;balloon&amp;quot; the full length of the yellow route and back to the airdome wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
