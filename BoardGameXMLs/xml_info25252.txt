							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jacob und seine Freunde</name>
									
			<description>Jacob, a comic figure drawn by Sven Hartmann, is a cat. He has 4 animal friends, Pump, Flap, Pingi and Patsch - all are seen here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 9x8 board. 20 tiles show 4 x Jacob and his 4 friends. The tiles are randomly placed on the board face down. Each player puts the playing piece of his neighbor on an empty space of the board and the game can begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to collect 4 tiles with each friend of Jacob. The player who achieves this first, is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movements of the playing pieces are handled in a very unusual way: each row of the board shows a number, which indicates the distance that a pieces must move (in any direction). If a piece lands on a tile, the player looks at it secretly and keeps it, if he does not have it already. If he finds a piece already in his collection, he puts it back on a empty space of his choice. This can not only confuse the player's memory, it can also be made in a more strategical way, because the movements of the playing pieces are defined by the already mentioned number of the rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
