			<description>Train your Magikarp to soar as high as possible in Pok&amp;eacute;mon: Magikarp Jump! The lowly Magikarp now gets its time in the spotlight with this fun app for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. Feed and develop your Magikarp to maximize the Pok&amp;eacute;mon's jump power to reach new heights. Then compete to see if your Magikarp is the best. Can your Magikarp rise to the level of League Champion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your training, if Magikarp gets knocked out, or retires upon reaching Lv. 20, you'll start over with a new generation of Magikarp. But not all progress is lost&amp;mdash;your new Pok&amp;eacute;mon will start off a little bit stronger than your last. Keep training every Magikarp until you can make it to the top of the in-game tournament ladder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you're raising your Magikarp, keep an eye out for Pok&amp;eacute;mon that want to help you. For example, some Pok&amp;eacute;mon you encounter will give you food to keep your Magikarp nourished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you do well in jumping tournaments, you can get commemorative photos of your achievement. You can share these photos online and with friends to show the world how well you've trained your Magikarp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magikarp Jump also features in-app purchases, where you can spend real money on a variety of things to speed up your training, replenish your food stock, and catch more Magikarp. You can also purchase decor to customize your Magikarp's habitat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look for Magikarp Jump for iPhone and iPad in the App Store, and for Android devices in Google Play. Magikarp Jump can be played in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and traditional Chinese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soar sky high with Magikarp in Magikarp Jump today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
