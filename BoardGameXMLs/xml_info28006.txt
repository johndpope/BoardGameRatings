							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Irish Rhyming Game</name>
									
			<description>A simple roll-and-move game which is designed to give even footing to children and adults.  Be the first around the board rhyming your words before the timer runs out and you win.  On each move, a player rolls the die and selects a card from the appropriate deck.  They then have 30 seconds to list words that rhyme with the word on the card.  The number on the die indicates how many rhyming words they need to name, and if the succeed, that is how many spaces they move ahead.  The cards for adults have more difficult words.  Manufacturers recommend the game for ages 5 through adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
