							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman (1986)</name>
									
			<description>Batman is a 3D isometric action-adventure game that was released in 1986 under the Batman licence by Ocean Software for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and MSX microcomputers. An Amstrad PCW version was also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to rescue Robin by collecting the seven parts of the Batcraft hovercraft that are scattered around the Batcave. The gameplay takes place in a 3D isometric universe, which programmers John Ritman and Bernie Drummond would further develop for 1987's Head Over Heels, and is notable for implementing an early example of a system that allows players to restart from an intermediate point in the game on the loss of a life rather than returning all the way to the start (in this case the point at which Batman collects a &amp;quot;Batstone&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Batman was received well by the computer game press at the time. Crash gave it a rating of 93%, Your Sinclair scored it 9/10 and Sinclair User gave it five stars and rated it as a &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Batman_(1986_video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
