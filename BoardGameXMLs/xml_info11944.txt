							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MacDonald&#039;s Farm Game</name>
									
			<description>Four Scotch brothers, Sandy, Neil, jack and Rob MacDonald, own four adjourning farms.  But they have no livestock, no poultry, not even a dog for their farms.  They can get what they need at the County fair, but because the supp of each item is limited as e each brother wants to be the FIRST to stock his farm, the competition is keen and exciting.  In playing MacDonald's Farm Game, you can take the part of one of the Scotch brothers and attempt by &amp;quot;Selecting Stock at the County Fair&amp;quot; -- &amp;quot;Cornering the Market&amp;quot; -- &amp;quot;Trading&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Unloading Surpluses&amp;quot; to be the FIRST to stock up your own farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to fill his farm with the exact animals needed. On each turn, you spin the spinner and must take one group of animals, if possible, from the section the spinner lands on.  If you have too many of a specific animal, you may attempt to trade by spinning.  If the spinner lands on a trade space, you may attempt to negotiate a single trade with any of your opponents.  Otherwise, your turn ends.  Once you have all of your needed animals, you get rid of your excess at the county fair.  Again, you spin and if you land on a county fair space, you may return one group listed there to the stock.  Otherwise your turn ends.  However, if you forget to declare that you are going to the fair, you must draw animals as though it were a normal turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
