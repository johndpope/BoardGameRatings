							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sink the Ship</name>
									
			<description>Shooting game. 6 targets, made of card. The targets are 'stood up' in wooden supports. A nice cannon is used to shoot at the targets. A player must knock over a ship to count as a 'success' and earn a point. You can decide before you start the winning conditions, first to score 5 successes wins, that sort of thing.&lt;br/&gt;Box - &amp;quot;A battling good game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;I'm guessing the date but it looks to me like a WWII vintage game, when children, particularly boys, were very interested in all things military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
