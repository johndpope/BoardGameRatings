			<description>Sorcerer Character Has Warrior Adventure Onanistic Hoodoo: A Supplement for the Ə Fantasy Role-Playing Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside cover Welcome:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glad you could make it. Without a doubt the main question I've received when telling people about writing this supplement is, &amp;ldquo;What the hell is Ə?&amp;rdquo; followed closely by, &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; Usually by family members. My uncle was especially baffled when I responded to his, &amp;ldquo;How much are you making off of it?&amp;rdquo; with, &amp;ldquo;Nothing. I give it away for free online.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;That's fucking stupid. Why do something if you don't get anything out of it.&amp;rdquo; Says the guy whose son wants as little to do with him as possible. Hey Oedipussy Avunculus, why bother having a child if all you're going to do is belittle and alienate him? But to answer the question, &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; Because. Because I wanted to; because it helped to pass the time; because it keeps the voices at bay; because a person can't watch internet porn 24 hours a day; because I want to see how far the game can bend before it breaks; because disappointing my uncle is funny.&lt;br/&gt;You know, because.&lt;br/&gt;The three of you reading this (Hi, Mom!) will no doubt recognize much of the material presented here. Some of it was pulled from the main book, other parts came from thoughts and musings I posted in the online forums. But fear not, very little made the transition unchanged and there is plenty of new material that is being presented here for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ə&lt;br/&gt;Onanistic Hoodoo&lt;br/&gt;New Races&lt;br/&gt;New Weapons&lt;br/&gt;New Spells&lt;br/&gt;New Monsters&lt;br/&gt;New Artwork&lt;br/&gt;Same old Crap&lt;br/&gt;Throughout history there have been certain events and&lt;br/&gt;innovations that irrevocably altered the course of human&lt;br/&gt;development: the taming of fire, cultivation, animal husbandry,&lt;br/&gt;the wheel, the printed word, splitting the atom, sliced bread.&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerer Character Has Warrior Adventure&lt;br/&gt;is not one of these things; it's just a game that uses funny dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
