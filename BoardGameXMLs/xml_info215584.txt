							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Woes of the Whispering Tree</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome To The Danby Woods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How Long Can You Stave Off Sleep?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woes of the Whispering Tree is the latest and greatest module from the team at DeepDark Designs and is intended for use with the 5e OGL ruleset and the materials that can be found for free online in SRD 5.1. Within the pages of this 34-page adventure, we invite you and your players to visit Thistle;  a wonderful, whimsical little hamlet that can be found in the deepest glade of the sleepy Danby Woods. Here you'll meet an eclectic cast of personalities, all of whom share a common secret; that they are suffering beneath the crippling depredations of terrible nightmares. It falls to the PCs to make themselves useful about town&amp;ndash;helping the locals with a number of errands and tasks&amp;ndash;while investigating and resolving the larger issues affecting Thistle and the woodlands themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woes of the Whispering Tree provides adventuring materials for a 1st-level party of 3-5 PCs and should see them all the way to 3rd-level. It offers plenty of optional and modular content and easily provides enough materials for 2-6 sessions, depending on how voraciously your players set about devouring them. In addition to questing ideas and suggestions, the module also offers new rules related to handling dreams and nightmares, and includes a modest dungeon run as it builds to its conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of theme, this product presents an enchanting, surrealist setup and aims to deliver on it without compromise throughout. If you're looking for an adventure that shrugs off the usual tropes and attempts to do something different, Woes of the Whispering Tree might just be your new best friend. It provides a standalone experience that doesn't require any other adventures or a lot exposition to make sense of its narrative, although it also pressents an opportunity to be combined with another upcoming adventure by DeepDark Designs that's being developed for PCs 3rd-level; 'The Beast of Brookhayven'. Additionally,  Woes of the Whispering Tree is also suitable for use with most fantasy settings and makes few assumptions on the part of the game master. Best of all, the entire product is provided in a variety of formats, including 'standard', 'printer-friendly', and 'super printer-friendly' - so that you can make the most of it at your table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
