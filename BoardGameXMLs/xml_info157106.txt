							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">S.R.D. of the All Mind</name>
									
			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;S.R.D. of the All Mind is applicable 3rd edition rules to run characters from the SYSTEM REFERENCE DOCUMENT Revised (v.3.5). &amp;ldquo;Skills&amp;rdquo; passages have been excised that are supplanted by Knights of the All Mind. The four booklets of S.R.D. of the All Mind combined with Knights of the All Mind contain the substantive rules needed for players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 1, Adventurous Men, has information on races and classes for building a character. No offense intended to women, &amp;ldquo;men&amp;rdquo; is just a tongue-in-cheek nod to gender stereotypes of 70&amp;prime;s gaming. Volume 2 of S.R.D. of the All Mind, Travels and Gear, has information on movement, weapons, armor, and adventuring equipment. Clashes and Feats, the 3rd volume, contains rules for combat plus all the relevant feats from the System Reference Document. The 4th and final volume of S.R.D. of the All Mind, Magical Incantations, details the pertinent rules from the System Reference Document for casting arcane and divine magic spells. Note that there are only general spell descriptions by class for each spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;This 4 volume set of booklets, in combination with the Knights of the All Mind booklet, form the core rules for the Knights of the All Mind rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
