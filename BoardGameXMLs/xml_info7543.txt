			<description>The board for the game consists of a plastic tray with nine compartments arranged in a 3x3 grid for holding the playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have either a blue circle or a green circle on them. To start the game, the cards are dealt into the tray, alternating blue and green on each row (i.e. Row 1: B,G,B; Row 2: G,B,G; Row 3: B,G,B).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player has to attempt to change the color pattern of the cards to 9 Blue Cards in exactly 9 moves. S/He may pick any card from any compartment and place it into any other compartment. this counts as one move. S/He may not take two cards from the same compartment consecutively OR place two cards into the same compartment consecutively. After s/he completes nine movers his/her turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each card s/he has changed to blue, s/he scores one point. If all nine cards are the correct color, an additional nine points are scored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player then attempts to do the same thing with the color opposite of the one used by the preceding player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to 100 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
