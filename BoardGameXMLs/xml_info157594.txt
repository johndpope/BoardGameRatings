							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crone</name>
									
			<description>from the Kickstarter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game about Witches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crone is a card-based role-playing game where you and your fellow players adopt the role of witches in a dark age of shattered empires and untamed wilderness. One player, the Game Master, organizes an adventure while the others create their characters, choosing skills and reputations &amp;amp; building decks of spells and artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crone&amp;rsquo;s witches don&amp;rsquo;t build gingerbread houses or eat naughty children &amp;mdash; well...most don&amp;rsquo;t. Instead, they journey across the land, fighting powerful evil and working to bring hope back to a world engulfed by the horrors and ignorance of the Dark Ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast with many other role-playing games, the characters of Crone do not start at a low point of skill or ability. They are immensely powerful witches, and the threats they face and goals they pursue will mirror that power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catching common criminals or hunting bandits may be appropriate fare in other games, but in Crone these objectives would feel silly and out of place. Any sensible, mundane opponent would flee in terror the moment they learned they were fighting a witch. To make threats believable they must not be banal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
