							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hand-Off: The Card Football Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Hand-Off combines the strategy and decision making of playing cards with the drama and tension of college football. You take control of the action &amp;ndash; bust out a big run, throw a game-breaking long bomb, make the big open-field tackle, or pick off the pass and take it the other way for a touchdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand-Off is a new and improved version of CSE Games' original critically-acclaimed Card Football: Premiere Edition game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For one to four players, Hand-Off takes about 45 minutes to play and features the following editions (with more to come):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Florida Gators&lt;br/&gt;- LSU Tigers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand-Off also features Team Cards highlighting some of the best teams of all-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bragging rights are on the line as players battle through four fast-paced quarters of Hand-Off action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
