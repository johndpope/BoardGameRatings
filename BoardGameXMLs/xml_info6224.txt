			<description>From the box:  &amp;quot;Escalation is a game of war.  Begin the game by positioning your forces consisting of battle pieces and mobile missile launchers within your Home Country.  Then maneuver them to areas throughout the world as permitted by the dice roll in order to attack an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game you can use airbases and ports to achieve a rapid and strategic deployment of forces.  Build and strengthen your forces by capturing countries, liberating POW camps, using the &amp;quot;Draft&amp;quot; and reaping the military benefits from Reinforcement cards and Mobile Missile Launcher cards.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game appears to be self-published, the packaging and components are first rate, featuring a mounted board, coated cards, and plastic pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
