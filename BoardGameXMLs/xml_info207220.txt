							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Link Thorne: The Flying Fool</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He'll Fly Anything, Anywhere... If It's Worth His Time! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the summer of 1947, the creative team that created Captain America, Joe Simon &amp;amp; Jack Kirby, took over a lackluster aviation adventure strip that had crashed-and-burned in the pages of Airboy, and turned into such an electrifying read that outshone everything else in the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All seven of the Flying Fool episodes from the pencils and pens of Simon &amp;amp; Kirby have been collected in NUELOW's Link Thorne: The Flying Fool. Each unfolds more like a movie than a comic book story, and this little-known effort shows the wide variety of genres these founding creators of the comic genre were capable, as within the framework of an adventure strip, they provide action, romance, supernatural mystery, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the classic works of Simon &amp;amp; Kirby, Link Thorne: The Flying Fool features a complete supplement for ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game that features stats for many of the characters in the stories, as well as for Jack Kirby &amp;amp; Joe Simon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
