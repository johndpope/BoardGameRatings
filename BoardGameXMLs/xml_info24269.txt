			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Political Favours is a board game for social interaction. In order for a backbencher (ordinary member) to rise up the greasy pole, using favors, deal-making, pay-backs and pork-barreling to both advance and secure their position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Political Favours is based on skill, chance, strategy, tactics, duplicity, greed and ambition - all the elements necessary to climb up the greasy pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game, and the winner, is the player who can accumulate the greatest number of Favour Tokens. If at the end of the game (or allocated time) there are two or more players with the same number of Tokens, then the amount of cash each player has determines the result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
