			<description>Ebon Tendrils: Episode Two&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Two-Round Living City Adventure Featuring Low and High Tiers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low Tier/Round One: The Brigadier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cool air of early spring blows through your hair as you make your way past the fish vendors of the Harbor District. Your nose curls at their salty smell when a young boy approaches your area. He looks no more than nine years old, and his dirty clothes might once have been colorful, but are now soiled by repeated use. His face is contorted in a look of frustration &amp;ndash; you watch him go from person to person, pleading with them for attention. He must be a beggar, you note, just as he comes up to you and tugs on your shirtsleeves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re adventurers, right?&amp;rdquo; he asks. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a boat just docked in harbor. A big important man called me over to it and asked me to find help. He looked real funny, but also worried. Will you help him?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
