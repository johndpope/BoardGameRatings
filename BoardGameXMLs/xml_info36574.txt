			<description>&amp;quot;Multiplayer card game or Solo rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each player controls a small town in a medieval setting. Every turn players build structures and hire defenders to protect their town. Some cards are used to send invaders and disasters to destroy your opponent's towns.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The custom card deck contains three types of cards: Structures, Invaders, and Disasters. Revenue gained from structures can be used to purchase Defenders ranging from guards and swordsmen to longbow men and mounted knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Object: Have the most defenders and structures at the end of the game. Each defender and structure is worth 1 victory point. The game ends when the last card is drawn from the deck. In a multi-player game, the game ends if all but one player's town is destroyed.&amp;quot; In a solitaire game you win by getting through the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
