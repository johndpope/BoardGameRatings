			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mortals Who Threaten the Gods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After incalculable hours of study and countless life-threatening adventures, you've reached the pinnacle of your profession. You have mastered all that has been set before you, yet you still do not possess the powers of old or the might of others you know came before you. What have you been denied?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rest easy, for your search is at an end. This player's sourcebook contains information on all the class powers and spells available to characters of levels 31-35. All the secrets uncovered in the Planes of Power &amp;mdash; the homes of the gods themselves &amp;mdash; are ready to open before you. Are you worthy of this final challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the material included in Heroes of Norrath is 100% compatible with 3.5 edition fantasy role-playing rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clues to EverQuest II&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the vast amount of game material in this volume, there's more good news within for EverQuest fans: We look again at all of the iconic characters introduced in the EverQuest Player's Handbook, now at stages much later in their careers or even at the end of their lives &amp;mdash; and each of their stories includes information about the new EverQuest 11 game setting not previously available anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See the barbarian warrior Vagner, an epic leader of men, awaken the Sleeper! Follow the heroic enchantress Arrialla as she observes the Books of Knowledge being stripped from Norrath. Information about the great wars, the destruction of Luclin, the disappearance of the gods, and more is all included herein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
