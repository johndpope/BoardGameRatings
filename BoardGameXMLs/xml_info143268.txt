			<description>Touchy Feely is a game in which players have to find objects using only their sense of touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-six Touchy Feely trinkets (miniatures of real objects) are placed in a nylon container, the &amp;quot;Tube of Touch&amp;quot;. Cards showing each object indicate what items should be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three games can be played:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Memory Match: Four cards are drawn. The players get five seconds to memorise them. They are then placed face-down. Now, both players simultaneous go searching for the items shown, and get sixty seconds to retrieve three items and place them on top of the cards. Whomever has the most matches wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;    Speedy Feely: One card is drawn. Both players go searching for the object. When someone finds it, he takes the card, and the next card is drawn. Whomever has collected the most cards after sixty seconds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;    Hand Solo: A solo version of Speedy Feely, with one player trying to find as many objects as he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fourth game, Kitchen Sink is played with custom items rather than the supplied trinkets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
