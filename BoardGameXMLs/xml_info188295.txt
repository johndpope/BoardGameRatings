							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Labyronia RPG</name>
									
			<description>Synopsis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labyronia is a traditional, story-driven RPG focused on partly non-linear progression and exploration in a large and original world. Advancing in the world and puzzle solving requires critical thinking at times, even though most puzzles and environmental hazards are fairly simple to overcome. The game's core challenges lie in overcoming certain large rough road maps, and surviving the strategic boss battles on the way. To gain more skills, the player must utilize the super-simple, but elegant Cue system. The storyline starts slowly, but should be emotion-inducing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brief introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Labyrinths. Maze-like structures consisting of trees, rocks, hills and everything in nature. The Four Elemental Gods- Labyronia's rulers- created the Labyrinths by using their divine might. Soon afterwards, powerful monsters appeared, beginning to cause havoc in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifty years have passed since the Labyrinths first came to be. Why were they created? Did the gods really want to punish the people for their wickedness? What about those monsters? They seem to have originated after the Labyrinths appeared. It's time to stop pondering this and go out there to find out the truth myself! This will be the final chapter of my diary, at least for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Diary of Arres&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features &amp;amp; Version Info&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Partly non-linear progression in a large and original world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Cue system encourages exploration. Find abnormalities to obtain skills, and challenge yourself to collect all the Cues!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Strategic Boss battles, and smooth combat system with Yanfly's battle engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Random battles are limited to the world map (and even there it's possible to avoid them usually.) Otherwise, all enemies are visible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Clean, colorful visuals and a bunch of fresh-looking monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Experience the emotional storyline and challenge the four elemental gods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
