							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasures and Objects d&#039;Art</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enchiridion of Treasures and Objects d'Art is 144 pages intended as a resource for players and GMs alike. In it is a system for creating truly memorable (and believable) treasures - from single distingushing pieces of equipment to exotic treasure hoards. This system for creating objects d'art has the flexibility to create literally billions of works of art, from engraved gold chalices to finely spun cloaks to weapons made of gemstone and other exotic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurers! Tired of lugging around endless piles of coins? Want to get equipment that makes you stand out of a crowd and be noticed? Trying to find that special signature look to make you the talk of the town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GMs! Tired of trying to come up with exciting and memorable non-magical treasures? Wondering just exactly why monsters have piles of coins - is that all they collect from mugging passing caravans? Wondering what you can pass out to low-level PCs bored with potions and masterwork items that will be appreciated but without giving them too much power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by those who have long told us that no monster would really collect piles of coins and magic items, this product will add a whole new dimension to the art of treasure-hunting. This of neccessity includes treatments of the Appraise, Craft, Profession, Spellcraft, and other skills... In addition, new rules for crafting items and for economic systems of communities are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all of the works in the Enchiridion Series, this work is designed to be as modular as possible, allowing seamless and easy integration of as much or as little of the material as desired. The design is intended to be literally plug-and-play: no converting existing campaign material, instead just add what you wish right into your current campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
