			<description>Kruzno is an abstract strategy game usually played with two players on a hexagonally tiled board. Though the rules are extremely simple (three minutes to learn for most players), the number of possible moves and interactions are comparable to chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kruzno uses standard chess pieces (bishops, knights and rooks) but is more closely related to hexagonal checkers and R.C. Bell's Jungle Game. Like the Jungle Game, capturing is non-transitive: bishops capture knights; knights capture rooks; rooks capture bishops. This split between offense and defense means that most standard strategies of move and capture have to be scrapped or reworked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game variants include versions with reduced number of pieces for faster play and expansion sets for three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.kruzno.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.kruzno.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
