			<description>A fast and action filled card game where the players are trying to hunt the most valuable animals in the forest. All the cards are spread out on the table with their back side up, forming the forest. When it is a player's turn, he can either reveal a new animal in the forest by flipping a card, or start a hunt for one kind of animal by playing a card from his hand. If a hunt is initiated, all players simultaneously try to pick up as many animals as possible of that type. At the end, the value of each caught animal is decided by how many times that kind have been hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
