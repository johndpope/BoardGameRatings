							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank Wars</name>
									
			<description>Tank Wars (also known as BOMB because of the file name) is an artillery game developed in 1990 by Kenneth Morse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows for up to ten players in any combination of human and computer players. The number of games played in a set is chosen before the game (default is 20 games). New terrain is randomly drawn at the start of each individual game, and the tanks fall one by one into their start positions in random order, evenly spaced horizontally on the screen. The tanks then take turns firing at opponent tanks, order going left to right, until only one tank remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether or not there is wind during the game, and the amount of wind can be set. Other options are available including rebounding walls, background effects, and whether the tanks can fall when terrain is blown out from under them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are awarded during the games for kills and wins. Points can then be used for each player to purchase new weapons and misc. items in between games. These weapons range from the Nukes that give the shot a larger blast radius to energy shields, as well as dirt bombs that can be used to increase defences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Wars,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Wars,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
