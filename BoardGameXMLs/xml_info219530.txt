							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Kaito</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the peasants of the Ro-Kan lack in weapons and armour they make up for with their knowledge of the lands they are defending and with the ingenuity born from the necessity to survive in these times of war. Kaito&amp;rsquo;s tenacity on the battlefield is inspiring to those around him, allowing those imbued by his courage to shrug off lesser wounds. Knowing the lands like the back of his hand, allows Kaito and his allies to pass through the foliage unimpeded, meaning the Temple can pick their battles where the terrain is most advantageous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
