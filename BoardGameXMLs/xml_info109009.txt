			<description>At the starting gate the tension is very high, the  snow is perfect, the atmosphere is the one of the big occasion. In an explosion of force, power and technique you face the first run of the giant slalom during the first meeting of the white circus.&lt;br/&gt;You are one of last season's best skiers and lots of fans are expecting a great result from you and you cannot disappoint them. You will count on your incredible talent, your explosive strength, your cold lucidity. As cool calculator you will fight against all the hazards of the track to the best of your abilities.&lt;br/&gt;Win the race and be on the cover of the most famous sporting magazines of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slalom is a game for 2 to 4 players (the single descents serve only for training). The competition is divided in 2 runs where every skier in turn tries to descend in quickest possible time to complete the slalom. The skier will move on the 14 tiles, using the values of the card they received at the start and at the two intermediate times.&lt;br/&gt;Every move on the race tiles will be followed by a positive or a negative change of the starting time.&lt;br/&gt;The hourglass will force the players to organize the sequence of their plays in the available time, in order not to lose precious hundredths of second.&lt;br/&gt;The cowbell represents the support of the people near the track and it will help the skiers during the critical moments of the race...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
