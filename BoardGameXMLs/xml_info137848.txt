			<description>Quiz game loosely based on a TV show that featured teams of schoolchildren. Actually, the name and the picture on the box were the only TV show link.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player doesn't play at all, he or she is in charge of asking the questions. As a player or team get right answers, they advance up the board. First to reach the top, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game has 1,000 questions. In those pre-Trivial Pursuit days, all quiz games (in my shop, at least) were terrible sellers. I actively tried not to stock them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
