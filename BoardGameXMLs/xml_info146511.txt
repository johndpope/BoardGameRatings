			<description>Rikken is a cardgame popular in Noord-Brabant (The Netherlands) and parts of Belgium. The 4 player cardgame is related to Whist and Bridge. In addition to the general rules, each region has its own set of minor rules. The games dates +/- 1950.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 52 cards (a deck without jokers). Each round starts with the player left to the dealer making the first bid. There are many different bids possible, due to the different rules per region. However, the most commen bids are (in order):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Pass: the player does not make a bid&lt;br/&gt;- Rik: score 8 (with a mate)&lt;br/&gt;- Piek: score exactly one (alone)&lt;br/&gt;- Miser&amp;eacute;: score 0 (alone)&lt;br/&gt;- 9 or 10 alone: score 9 or 10 (alone)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the bidding ends (players can over-bid eachother), the winning player announces the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- requested ace: the player who won the bid requests an ace. This must be an ace that he does not have himself. The player who does have this ace will be his mate for the current round. If the bid is a &amp;quot;rik&amp;quot;, then the 2 players together have to score 8 and the other 2 players try to prevent this. If the player plays alone (for example &amp;quot;piek&amp;quot; bid), he does not request an ace and just plays alone versus the 3 others.&lt;br/&gt;- choose the trump (&amp;quot;troef&amp;quot;): the player who won the bid also choses one colors to be the trump. The trump cards are worth the most for this round (similair to &amp;quot;Hearts&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round starts with the player left to the dealer playing his first card. The next player has to play a card of the same color. If that is not possible he can play any other card. The player with the highest card in a matching color scores. However, a &amp;quot;troef&amp;quot; card tops all other colors. Meaning players can &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; a turn by playing a &amp;quot;troef&amp;quot; card. The round ends when all cards are played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
