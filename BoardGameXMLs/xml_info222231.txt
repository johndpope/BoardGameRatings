			<description>Diagonals is played with black and white stones on an 8x8 grid (i.e., the intersections of a 7x7 gameboard). Each turn a player places a stone on an empty space; there are no captures. When a diagonal line is full, the player who placed the last stone on the diagonal line scores the number of friendly stones on that line. The player with the most points wins when all spaces are occupied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
