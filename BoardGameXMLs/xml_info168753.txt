			<description>MIND: A Path to Thalamus is a First Person Puzzler that throws you into a fantastic and surreal environment. You will bend the natural elements to your will in order to progress in this emotive, mindbending tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new First Person Puzzler throws the player into a fantastical and surreal environment that allows them to bend the natural elements to their will. I am Carlos Coronado, the man behind &amp;ldquo;Warcelona&amp;rdquo;, one of the most renowned campaigns for Left 4 Dead 2, with more than 1,000,000 combined downloads and a 96/100 rating at L4DMaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main developer is Carlos Coronado, the man behind Warcelona, one of the most renowned campaigns for Left 4 Dead 2, with more than 1,000,000 combined downloads, 96/100 rating at L4DMaps and made official campaign by Valve some time ago. This project was co-developed by artist Dani Navarro and scriptwriter Luka Nieto. Additional programming was performed by Jose Ladislao. Many other kind people also supported the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wrapped in a mindbending tale, the gameplay of &amp;ldquo;MIND&amp;rdquo; focuses on changing the very weather in order to solve puzzles: the player will cycle between day and night, modify the levels of fog and rain and even travel in time between seasons, changing the environment to advance the gameplay-driven story &amp;mdash;indeed, the mechanics are directly related to who the protagonist is, what has happened to him and everything he is doing: a man trapped in his own mind, he must use all the tools at his disposition to escape to reality. Accompannied by the snarky yet heartfelt narration of this comatose patient, the player will guide him through fantastical forests, dark caverns and deceptive worlds of water and ice that directly relate to his emotional state at each point in his journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
