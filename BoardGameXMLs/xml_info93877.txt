							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mick &amp; Mack: Global Gladiators</name>
									
			<description>Global Gladiators (also known as Mick and Mack: Global Gladiators) is a 1992 platform game by Virgin Interactive, originally programmed by David Perry for the Mega Drive/Genesis and eventually ported by other Virgin Interactive teams to the Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear and the Commodore Amiga. A Super Nintendo port was also in development but was never completed for undisclosed reasons, though a prototype exists on the Internet. The game is loosely based on the McDonald's fast food chain and has a strong environmentalist message.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game Boy port of the title was also fully developed (by Damian Stones, of Climax) but was never released for the same legal reasons as the Super Nintendo port.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the single-player game, the player controls Mick or Mack through four worlds; Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-town and Arctic World. Each world has several sub-stages where the character must collect a certain number of Golden Arches to advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are guided in their quest by Ronald McDonald, who appears at the beginning and the end of the game. The characters are armed with a Super Soaker-type gun that shoots gooey projectiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game engine is the same used in other Virgin Interactive games such as Cool Spot and Disney's Aladdin, as all of them (Mega Drive/Genesis versions) were handled by David Perry's programming team, which eventually turned into Shiny Entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The music is composed by Tommy Tallarico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mick &amp;amp; Mack: Global Gladiators&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
