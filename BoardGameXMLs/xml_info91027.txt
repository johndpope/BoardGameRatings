							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Bones</name>
									
			<description>Mr. Bones, is a game released for the Sega Saturn in 1996, Created for SEGA by Ed Annunziata and Zono Incorporated. The game tells the story of Mr. Bones, a resurrected 19th century rural southerner, as he attempts to save the world from destruction at the hands of a vampire named DaGoulian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has the distinction of having very few levels which share the same style of gameplay. With few exceptions, each level operates on completely different game angles and control mechanics, so while one level may be a side-scroller, the next could be a guitar jamming session, an arcade style zapping game, a game of memory, or even a level with gameplay similar to Breakout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DaGoulian, a mad philosopher who believes that one can only &amp;quot;ensure the survival of good by making evil thrive&amp;quot;, sets out to purify the world with evil. By playing a special set of drums powered by science and alchemy, he is able to tap into a primal power which he calls &amp;quot;skeletal magnetism&amp;quot;(or &amp;quot;skeletism&amp;quot;) and summon the dead from their graves as his skeletal soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One inmate of the cemetery, however, is pure of heart and is thus resurrected not with red(evil) skeletism, but with blue(good) skeletism. Because of this, he retains his free will. This fact is quickly noticed by DaGoulian, and he orders his newly created army to destroy this rebel, who calls himself simply &amp;quot;Mr. Bones.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Bones soon becomes determined to stop DaGoulian's plan. He must find a way to counteract the evil of red skeletism before DaGoulian's minions catch up to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mr. Bones (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
