			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Night before Christmas is a murder mystery game for 12 to 15 guests and a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is December 24, 1948. The socialite Evington-Browne family and guests are preparing for the annual Christmas Eve cocktail party, held by tradition at the family's hunting lodge in the White Mountains north of Boston. Snow has been falling for days - a blizzard has now set in - and the party finds itself cut off from the rest of the world. This is unfortunate, as the valet of one of the guests has been found dead in the kitchen! It looks like a heart attack - but is it murder? Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive The Night before Christmas? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Night before Christmas you will discover the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Who has been wearing a Santa Suit to sneak around? &lt;br/&gt;    Who will inherit the Brilliant Diamonds? &lt;br/&gt;    Would the infamous cat-burglar 'the Puma' dare to strike here? &lt;br/&gt;    Are the Evington-Browne family in danger of losing their money, their reputation in society *and their sanity? &lt;br/&gt;    Can anyone keep control of Tracy's pet monkey? &lt;br/&gt;    ...and, of course, who killed the valet? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in The Night before Christmas!&lt;br/&gt; In The Night before Christmas, the stage is set for an innocent family gathering, with a few friends and strangers added to make the party go with a swing. However, not everyone is as they seem - some have dark secrets they need to keep hidden... and someone is the killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Night before Christmas lasts for three to four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (78 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
