			<description>Played on a three dimensional board game, Miners' Mountain, for two to seven players, takes you back to the mining days of the Klondike era. The object of the game is to become the wealthiest prospector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dice roll moves your game pieces up the mountain until you reach one of the numbered mine entrances. Placing a numbered marble in the mine entrance enables player to actively mine that mine. To recover gold, a player rotates the mountain using mountain movement cards. Amount of payment for gold depends on marble landing in assayer's tray. Once paid, the player reuses the game piece, to start over climbing the mountain to mine for more gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More advanced players can challenge each other to gunfights or steal each other's mines by claim jumping. A dice roll determines who wins a gunfight or takes over a mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third dimension to the game, Bushwhackers, is a game of capture. It uses the gunfight rules along with the location on the mountain to gain advantage against your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
