			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The factions have heard murmurings of a new cult rising from the ashes of the obsessed dragon and elemental evil factions that they have dealt with in the past.  This time, though, they seem to have an even more apocalyptic goal.  A deep gnome informant claims the cult is dabbling with dangerous magic, but he, too, may have his own agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4-hour D&amp;amp;D Adventurers League adventure for characters levels 11-16 starting in Mulmaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is intended as a sequel to Princes of the Apocalypse, but characters need not have participated in that adventure to play this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was officially released at the Queen City Conquest gaming convention in Buffalo, NY, on September 8, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
