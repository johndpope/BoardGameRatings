			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First century AD, Britain. As the Roman legions push further and further north towards the Scottish border, the Roman and Celtic Gods are also at war, fighting to support their believers. Fearing that too much divine intervention in the affairs of mankind would threaten the fabric of reality, the Gods decide to solve the matter by sending a Roman and a Celt champion to the Otherworlds. The first champion to return to Earth would see his cause prevail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Warlord, a fierce Celt chieftain. You must find your way back to the real world before the Roman. You'll encounter puzzles, strange places and mythological creatures from the Old Faith. Be wary because the Gods don't like to play by the rules, and the Otherworlds are their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warlord is a text adventure game with graphics. The game include a save feature, and scoring (expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
