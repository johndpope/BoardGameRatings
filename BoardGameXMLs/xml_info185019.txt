			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Argo Galaxy is growing &amp;ndash; not physically but figuratively. After years of study, the House of the Alliance has finally decided to open the Hastilion Expanse for full settlement and corporate utilization. Researchers identified numerous planets and moons as optimal for civilization and corporations from around the known galaxy, including Drake Mining and Manufacturing, are making plans to acquire land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception, Drake Mining and Manufacturing has prided itself on mining resources and creating high-quality products from those resources to support the entire galaxy. Moving into the Hastilion Expanse provides them with a wealth of opportunities to expand their operations and grow their business. That is, of course, if their new facilities can survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New planets are always fraught with hidden dangers from native flora and fauna, pirates, rival corporations, and rebellious populations. Only the strength of Drake&amp;rsquo;s mercenary force will help them overcome any roadblocks and become successful. As long as they don&amp;rsquo;t get killed in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Leohn presents the Novice portion of the Hastilion Expanse campaign for Mercenary Breed Savage Worlds or it can be used as a collection of adventures for any sci-fi setting. Originally published in Savage Insider Premium and the Hastilion Expanse Compendiums, this new campaign book updates the content to Mercenary Breed 2.0 and expands on the original content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Leohn includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Novice-rank campaign missions.&lt;br/&gt;    A collection of additional Novice-rank adventures based within the Drake Mining and Manufacturing setting.&lt;br/&gt;    New Xenopedia entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
