			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Vehicles that travel through air, in the sea and on land... Match the mode of transportation to its medium! Match the cards to the boards in a lotto game of photographs!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;4 game boards (park, street, air, water).&lt;br/&gt;24 game cards (6 for each board representing a different vehicle with a picture and name).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is for children ages 2 to 5. The rules list two ways to play, a &amp;quot;Lotto&amp;quot; game and a &amp;quot;Memory&amp;quot; game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;Lotto&amp;quot; game each player receives a board. Players take turns drawing a card and comparing the vehicle on the card to the vehicles on the player's board. Matching cards are placed on the corresponding board space. The winner is the first player to cover all six spaces on their board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Memory game is played by first choosing a dealer. The dealer gives each player a board. The players study their board for one minute then turn them face down. The dealer shows the top card to all the players. If a player thinks it matches a vehicle on their board they say &amp;quot;Mine&amp;quot; and place the card next to their board. This continues until all the cards have been shown. The players turn their boards face up. For each matching card a player earns 1 point. For each non-matching card a player looses 2 points. The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
