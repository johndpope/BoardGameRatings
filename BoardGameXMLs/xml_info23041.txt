			<description>This is similar to tic-tac-toe and played on the 3x3 grid. The big difference is that each player has only three tiles: U, S, and A. Players take turns placing their letters onto the tic-tac-toe board, IN ORDER (U, S, then A). After all 6 letters have been played. Players take turns moving their letters IN ORDER. When a player gets their three tiles in a row, in order (backwards is okay, ASU) that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
