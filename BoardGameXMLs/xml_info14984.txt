							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Intuition</name>
									
			<description>According to Sid Sacksons &amp;quot;A Gamut of Games&amp;quot;: One player announces a &amp;quot;self-portrait,&amp;quot; an &amp;quot;ideal,&amp;quot; or an &amp;quot;image&amp;quot; and then secretly chooses ten from a set of thirty cards with descriptive characteristics. Then others place cards from identical sets, the score depends on how closely they match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTUITION is the new and exciting game of POSITIVE perceptions for new acquaintances, friends, lovers and family!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It stimulates interesting, often humorous conversation, and improves communications between people.  It is a truly different game - a thinking person's game for those who have an active curiosity about themselves and other people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTUITION provides new insights every time it is play, not only because it can be played many ways, but because player intuition changes at different times with different players.  Usually, INTUITION is played by two, three or four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have players test their intuition in a variety of ways by describing their perceptions of the values and opinions of other players.  This is accomplished by players matching selections of personal qualities and characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
