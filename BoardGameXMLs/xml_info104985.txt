							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nose Game</name>
									
			<description>A game you had to collect, the cards being in with your packets of cigarettes.&lt;br/&gt;It is a set collecting game but with the novel feature that you are collecting noses. The amusing cards feature five kinds of nose - Artistic, Impulsive, Enquiring, Aggressive and Commercial.&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 examples of each type of nose and you presumably had to collect as many types of the same nose as you could. &lt;br/&gt;As often happens with cigarette card games, the cards remain within the family but the rules (which you wrote off for, all those years ago) are lost. &lt;br/&gt;The advertising leaflet proclaimed &amp;quot;Laugh while you play - learn character-reading at the same time&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
