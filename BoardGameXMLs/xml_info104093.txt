							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babylon 5 Wars: The Dilgar Invasion</name>
									
			<description>In February 2228, the Dilgar Imperium attacked and defeated the Alacans, a weak minor race struggling to make a place for itself in the Galaxy. This began almost five years of terror and war as the Dilgar swarmed through the League of Non-Aligned Worlds, conquering the weak and bombing those homeworlds they could not control. Only the intervention of the Earth Alliance turned the tide of battle and saved the Galaxy from the Dilgar menace. Read the complete history of the war, and fight the vicious Dilgar using the ships in this product! Also included are several new races not seen before - the Alacan Republic, Balosian Underdwellers, and Markab Theocracy - plus Dilgar war era ships for the Earth Alliance! This long-awaited product is a must have for all fans of Babylon 5! Includes full color rulebook, separate ship book, and color countersheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
