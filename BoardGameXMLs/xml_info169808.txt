							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eldritch Victory</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEWARE THE OUTSIDE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is everything that isn't.  It is the anathema of existence.  It is the opposite of that which is.  It defies description, it is beyond understanding, and it HATES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the world of Eldritch Horror, and face fates that make Damnation seem like a walk in the park.  Fear the creatures from the seas and the stars, and learn to tremble at the mention of the curse that is Corruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eldritch Victory contains new Abilities unique to Creatures of the Outside, new Magic Spells, new Equipment (with new Enhancements), new Character Packages, and a bucket of opposition; everything from the cultists of the Outside to their Mastermind leaders, the Creatures of the Outside themselves, and even a few Greater Outside Beings to threaten whole worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are unaging, they are totally oppposed to everything that exists, and they absolutely WILL NOT STOP until the Universe... ALL Universes... fall to dissolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone should probably do something about this...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
