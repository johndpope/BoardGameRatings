			<description>No Benefits is a card game about your job. The job you&amp;rsquo;d quit in four months, five years ago. Relive one week of your life in one hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember how you said you wanted to be a writer? An artisanal pickle maker? Now's your chance. It only takes you two hours to finish your data entry, but management doesn't know that. Do you really want to make copies of copies all day? Why not work on your novel and brine pickles in the bathroom instead? You&amp;rsquo;re pulling a paycheck either way. At the end of the day, players that didn't complete their tasks will be reprimanded, unless of course they can play an excuse to get out of it. Watch out for Wednesday, though, as there's always something that goes wrong on hump day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Benefits is set in an average workplace, where players are average employees trying to get through the daily grind. You need to balance not getting fired with working too hard, in order to finish the week as the least productive worker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to gain the most slack by the end of the 5 day working week (5 turns).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players will be given an assignment from the day's inbox by the current Assistant Manager. On Wednesdays, crisis cards are also drawn and dealt with. Players can then play morning memos, plan their workday by selecting Grind cards to play, and then revealing their selected cards to show their progress towards their assignments. Players with incomplete assignments can plead their case with excuse cards. Without an excuse, players receive a write-up, and are fired if they gain 3. Finally, any late memos are resolved and that round's slack scores are tallied up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves a careful balance between putting off work for points, or doing work to gain sway and perks from your superiors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
