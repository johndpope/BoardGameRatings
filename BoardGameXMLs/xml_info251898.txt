			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in Sixty Mile Sky revolves around roleplaying, intrigue and character conflict. The intrigue is generated by the game master, but must be prodded and dissected by the players. Character conflict is also generated by the story, but there are also opportunities for the characters to find conflict with other characters in the party, with the world around them, or with themselves.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other role playing games, abilities and interactions do not revolve around depleting the hit points of enemy monsters. Instead, character&amp;rsquo;s abilities focus on applying Conditions. Conditions are adjectives or descriptors that influence how a character should make a decision. Frightened, Shaken, Guilty, Seeking Cover, Emboldened, Impressed, these are all conditions that would change how an individual character would react to a situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
