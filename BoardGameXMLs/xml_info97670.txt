							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grab Bag</name>
									
			<description>Author's Blurb from the Kickstarter page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case you missed it, I sent out an all-call for REIGN fans to suggest what they wanted to see in the next supplement.  They answered, I wrote it, and now it's time for you to put your money where my mouth is.  Supplement #16's Grab Bag contains the following articles to delight your imagination and spur players to new heights of prompt attendance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Violence, Please -- A collection of new features for &amp;quot;Out of the Violent Planet&amp;quot; to make your shooters deadlier, your madmen crazier, your aliens more oleaginous , and your psychics marginally less vulnerable to extaterrestrial enslavement.  3,124 words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies of Awful Scale -- A set of rules that bridges the scales between a REIGN Company (like, say, the US Army) and the epic individual threats that could go toe-to-toe with them (such as Godzilla, the Incredible Hulk or that monster from Cloverfield).  Where's a scrappy band of misfit heroes when you need...?  Oh wait, they're stuck between its teeth.  Never mind.  Send in the Marines.  2,586 words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secrets of Nain -- As you'd expect, the Kingdom of Nain is complicated, confusing, and rife with secrets and surprises.  This article scratches the surface, providing not one, but two new charts for random monster loose dice, along with a selection of interesting side effects and nasty new backshocks to keep those dabbling wizards on their toes. 3,481 words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cults of the Secret Places -- Nominally for Ardwin, these detailed secret religions work just as well in REIGN's standard setting.  Five totem spirits are lovingly detailed, explaining what they want, where they are, and what they offer.  An entirely new style of magic, one free of Nain's pesky heritage requirements or the tiresome study other systems require.  All these gods ask is your loyalty... 8,836 words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All told, that's 18,027 words, laid out, illustrated and picked over with careful eye for speling errors.  Spelling, I mean.  Spelling errors.  As with the typical REIGN ransom, when I get the requisite money, I release the files for everyone, indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for your support!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-G.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
