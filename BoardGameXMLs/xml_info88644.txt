							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spears of the Tisangani (Thrilling Tales Version)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they learn that the lost half of an antique map has been discovered, Our Heroes must journey into the heart of darkest Africa in search of the long-lost city of Tisangani! But they'd best beware, for one of their enemies seeks to thwart their efforts to find the fabled city. And if they do reach it, they'll find themselves plunged into a political battle between the king and his warlord, with the fate of all of Africa perhaps hanging in the balance....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spears Of The Tisangani is the first of Adamant Entertainment's d20 conversions of Pulp Hero adventures from Hero Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Steven S. Long, with D20 conversion by Steven Rushing, this 17-page adventure is intended for a group of 3 to 5 player-characters of 7th through 9th level. Suitable Thrilling Tales advanced classes include the Big Game Hunter, the Fortune Hunter, the Paragon, and the Noble Savage. With a little work on the part of the GM, almost any basic or advanced class can be accommodated&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
