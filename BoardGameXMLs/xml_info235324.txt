			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Markelis, City in the Mists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty years ago the Mists came over the city and took more than half its population. The former capital of the ArchDespotate of Faremh was abandoned in a hurry, its treasures left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A history of the city of Markelis&lt;br/&gt;    Detailed descriptions of its most important sites, such as the Spire of Skulls, the Temple of Man, and the cemetary.&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure locations and plot hooks &lt;br/&gt;    Three new monsters: Ethrereal Worms, the Tar Mummies and the Warrior Daemons.&lt;br/&gt;    Two fully-statted out NPCs: the ghast King-of-Mists and the blind erinyes Rodwenza.&lt;br/&gt;    A city that will be used extensively for the Legacies Organized Play Campaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content of this book is usable for the Tyrants of Saggakar, but can be used in any campaign using BOTH 3rd and 5th edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest role-playing game or Pathfinder Role-Playing Game.
