							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters of Conjuration</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second pdf in Reality Deviant Publications' Monsters of Magic product line, each PDF in the series detailing monsters based on the schools of magic. Within the pages of this PDF you will find six extensively detailed monsters based around the theme of conjuration. These monsters will either be creatures that rely on conjuration magic, are based on some element of a conjuration spell or are related to the school of conjuration in some other way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster entry contains full details on the monster, including description, background, ecology, hunting methods, habits, society and combat statistics. To further entice you to use these creatures in your games, an adventure hook is given for each monster in the pdf. DMs are encouraged to make the most of the supporting background material on every monster to create interesting, detailed and realistic encounters based on the nature and ecology of the creatures presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this pdf contains a number of new conjuration spells, as well as two new and interesting NPCs based on the creatures contained within this PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
