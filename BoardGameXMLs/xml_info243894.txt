			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Catun was once a toll station on the King's Road. The thorp is dominated by a single tall tower. Most of the town is made up of tents and other temporary dwellings though there are a few stout buildings left over from its days as a toll station. There are only three permanent structures in town the Tower, The Hunter and Mug tavern and inn and the pawn shop G&amp;amp;M's Artifacts and Relics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is governed by a corrupt aristocrat, the human lord Ered. Ered was exiled from the capitol for bribery and corruption. He was given this post as a reward for his &amp;quot;loyalty&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dedication&amp;quot; to the king. Ered was too well connected to the council of Barons to be taken out and executed so he was&lt;br/&gt;given this non-reward and he knows it. He constantly schemes to regain his position and is more than willing to hire some adventuring types, who don't ask a lot of questions, to do some morally ambiguous things. Ered lives in the tower and rarely shows himself to his &amp;quot;subjects&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Instant Towns pdfs provide GMs with interesting NPCs and locations to use with or against your player group. Instant Towns can be interesting stops along the road, temporary bases from which to loot nearby ruins or side quests in between major campaign events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of each Town including tavern, meals and costs, patrons and some rumors, town goings on, any stores, brothels or other significant places of interest in town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
