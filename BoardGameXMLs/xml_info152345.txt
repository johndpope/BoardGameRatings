			<description>La Patrie en Danger is another fine game from OSG's publisher Kevin Zucker's famous series &amp;quot;The Library of Napoleonic Battles&amp;quot;. Based on the epic &amp;quot;Napoleon's Last Battles&amp;quot;-System, (further upgraded to the Library of Napoleonic Battles): it shows 480 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn, 400-800 men per strength point. Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 20 turns. The Full campaign links the individual battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game contains five battles from the opening phase of the 1814 Campaign in France following the Battle of Nations, which was fought just half a year before at Leipzig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Napoleon has just arrived at the front. At their first encounter the French surprised Bl&amp;uuml;cher's Prussians and Russians during a snowstorm. The Battle of Brienne was a short-lived success, however, for just two days later the Prussians triumphed at La Rothi&amp;egrave;re and wrote-off the enemy as a spent force, advancing hell-for-leather across the Marne and onto the highway to Paris. Ten days later Napoleon seized his opportunity when &amp;quot;Marschal Vorw&amp;auml;rts&amp;quot; allowed his advancing columns to get dispersed and defeated in detail, in rapid succession in three short sharp combats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BATTLES SIMULATED &lt;br/&gt;Brienne Unskilled Fury, 29-30 January. &lt;br/&gt;The raw conscripts under Napoleon and Ney chased the Russians and Prussians from the town. Bluucher himself was almost captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Rothi&amp;egrave;re A Defeat on French Soil, 1 February. &lt;br/&gt;Reinforced with troops from the Army of Bohemia, Bl&amp;uuml;cher was ready to fight again. Napoleon, not realizing the enemy's overwhelming superiority, advanced. At Noon Bl&amp;uuml;cher attacked, taking 54 guns and inflicting 6,000 French casualties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champaubert, 10 February. &lt;br/&gt;Marmont ran into an isolated corps of 4,500 Russians commanded by Olsufief. Marmont attacked and dispersed the Russian corps, capturing its commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Montmirail, 11 February. &lt;br/&gt;Mortier pinned down Yorck and Kleist's Prussians to the front, while Napoleon separated Sacken's Russians from their allies, sending them streaming back towards Ch&amp;acirc;teau Thierry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vauchamps, 14 February. &lt;br/&gt;Marmont held Bl&amp;uuml;cher's Prussians in check while Napoleon made a flank march through the mud, sending Grouchy's cavalry round to the rear to cut their retreat to Ch&amp;acirc;lons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;Three 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; maps&lt;br/&gt;560 counters&lt;br/&gt;100 cards&lt;br/&gt;2 rulebooks&lt;br/&gt;15 player aids&lt;br/&gt;Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME SYSTEM: &lt;br/&gt;The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the &amp;quot;Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series&amp;quot; &lt;br/&gt;- scale = 480m/hex, &lt;br/&gt;- time = 1hour/GT,&lt;br/&gt;- strength = 500-800 men/SP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
