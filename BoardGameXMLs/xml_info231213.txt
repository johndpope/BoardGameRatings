							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Micro Civilization</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to build your civilization from humble beginnings to greatness. At the end of the game you get victory points from Prestige icons that your civilization has collected, and also from the longest Wall your civilization has built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four starting civilizations to choose from: Rome, Greece, Babylon and Egypt. Each turn you may add a card to your tableau, using a unique mechanism of partial overlap. However you must make sure that your civilization produces enough resources of military, science and gold to cover its own growing needs. You may also collect prestige icons which have no effect during the game but convert into victory points at the end of the game. Each card also has a piece of wall on one of its 4 sides. By placing the cards in a certain way, you might be able to build a long wall and score a lot of points. But keep an eye on your opponent's military strength, lest she attack your developing micro civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
