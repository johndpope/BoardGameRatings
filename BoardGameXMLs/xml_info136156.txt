			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hundred years that began in 1495 was a century of exploration and conquest. By the close of the sixteenth century, the New World had been transformed. The native civilizations were no longer, having been replaced by the fiefdoms of European conquerors. In amazingly short spaces of time the Aztec civilization of Mexico and the Inca civilization of Peru had fallen to remarkably tiny bands of conquistadors. To the north the conquistadors had wandered the American southwest researching for the mythical El Dorado, the city of gold. Farther north English explorers found Hudson Bay and the vast reaches of Canada while searching in vain for a northwest passage for trade routes to China and India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of New World gives you the opportunity to recreate this turbulent century, and, as Spain, England, or France, help yourself to a share of the riches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In New World, Spain, England and France each have a chance to win. Historically Spain was the hands-down winner, with colonies from Chile to Florida and enormous quantities of gold and silver looted from the Indians. The Portuguese, despite their success in colonizing Brazil, have been omitted from the simulation. Most Portuguese efforts were directed toward Africa where a series of disasters led to the ruin of the country by the 1570's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the long run, the English and French would find greater gain from their settlements than the Spanish. While a Spanish colony often consisted of only a few missionaries and soldiers sufficient to extract gold from the Indians, the English and French saw the New World as a storehouse of more useful goods: furs, timber, agricultural products. These added to the real wealth whereas the gold-laden galleons often just inflated the Spanish currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MECHANICS OF PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New World is played in turns, each of which represents 5 years of historical time. The game starts in 1495 and ends in 1600, so there are 22 turns in a game. Depending on how many people are playing, a complete game may require as much as 3 hours. With some versions the game can be saved to disk at the end of any turn. One to three people can play Spain, France, and England. If only 1 person is playing, the computer will take the part of one of the other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn each player collects taxes and income from his colonies, recruits colonists and soldiers, and purchases ships and supplies. You may send some or all of your forces on expeditions to the New World. In the colonies you can fight Indians and other European forces, search for gold and move your men from colony to colony. Various random events complicate your task, for example: European wars, graft and corruption, storms at sea, and Indian uprisings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOUR OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective is to gain control of as many colonies, and to populate them with as many colonists, as possible and to return gold to your country's treasury. Toward these ends, you may wage war, mine for gold, and move personnel and ships from colony to colony (two land moves per turn; however, ship transfers are unlimited). Colonies can change hands several times, particularly those in which gold has been discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
