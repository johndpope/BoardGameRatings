							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Starship Bridge 02</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 16 inch by 20 inch, floor plan of a SciFi Bridge, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The captain is acting strangely since his return from leave. In addition, he is refusing medical and psychological evaluations. I am at a loss of what to do at this point.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Medical Officer Evelyn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Bridge 2 is a small interior map of a starship bridge and a captain&amp;rsquo;s quarters. This bridge has enough computer stations and chairs for four personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Bridge 2 is intended for near or far future science fiction games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure idea for this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extended Leave: Starship Captain Bradley came back from leave seemingly refreshed and invigorated, but his decision making and mental capacity seem diminished. His usual reserved demeanor has been changed to an emotional and temperamental one. The captain refuses to be tested by the medical officer for physical or psychological impairments. The captain also refuses to allow anyone into his private quarters for any reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crew must decide what to do. Do they continue to follow a man whose orders continue to befuddle them? Do they mutiny against their long time captain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the truth about the captain&amp;rsquo;s change in behavior? Has the captain been replaced by a clone? A shapeshifter? An android capable of emotion? Has the captain been drugged instead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the captain has been replaced and the crew subdues the doppler, they find the real captain in his quarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
