							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scrapyard Battle</name>
									
			<description>Unashamedly based on the TV show of a very similar name, each player controls a team of 4 characters (each with their own nick-names and brief backgrounds) who have to build a fantastic competing machine out of the bits and pieces found by them in the scrapyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On day 1 they need to find the best components that they can in the scrapyard heaps, drag them back to base and weld them together within the time set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On day 2 the two (hopefully completed) machines square up in competition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 battles in the base game - a Sofa-slinger, a cabbage cannon, a powered raft, a can stacker and a hill climber that can be played individually or one after the other as a championship challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An entry for the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
