							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skōsh</name>
									
			<description>Skōsh is the team-play trivia game for people who have more fun figuring it out than knowing it all. Draw from hundreds of questions, then pool your wits and take your best guess - you might miss the mark but the closer you get, the faster you advance. Keep score with a tug-of-war by trying to pull the puck away from your opponent's winning circle and into your own. It's free-wheeling fun for all whether you miss by a mile or win &amp;hellip; by a Skōsh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
