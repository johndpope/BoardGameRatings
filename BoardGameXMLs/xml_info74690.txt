							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sins of a Star Empire</name>
									
			<description>A boardgame inspired by the fantastic PC game Sins of a Solar Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is more or less in the same respect as the PC game. You build ships, research technology, and expand your empire through vast star systems, of which several may be used at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will build massive fleets of varying ships and fight for control of the planets they need to yield resources, and spread their culture across one or more star systems. All while attempting to destroy another players Home World. Once a Home World has fallen, the game ends, and scores are totaled using a score card. &lt;br/&gt;Scoring is the most detailed and elaborate part of the game. Players can earn points in all four different categories, including Military, Culture, Technology and Economy. There are also bonuses for players who scored the highest in any one of these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            Sadly, the one who looses their Home World REALLY looses in points. Trying to work this problem out so they don't feel like they loose so badly, while keeping book keeping down to a bare minimum. Any suggestions on how to do this would be greatly appreciated. This is one of the main things I have yet to really work out.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- 3 unique races, each with special abilities, research trees, and &amp;quot;Home World advantages&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;-- 3 different resources to manage, along with a black market, on which you can sell or buy these resources if you cannot acquire them through &amp;quot;legal&amp;quot; means.&lt;br/&gt;-- All planet types you can expect to find: Terran, Desert, Volcanic, Ice, Asteroids, Worm Holes... &lt;br/&gt;-- Several ship classes, including Frigates, Cruisers and Capital Ships.&lt;br/&gt;-- Bucket of Dice combat system makes the battles fast and easy, while still having the epic space battles that the PC game delivers.&lt;br/&gt;-- Semi-Modular game boards. The star-system boards are set up with blank spaces linked by phase lines to place planets. Set up a random map, or design your own. Each map also has 2 different colored Phase Lines for smaller or larger games.&lt;br/&gt;-- Pirates occupy each undiscovered planet, with the player opposite of you rolling for the Pirates. This allows for a bit more interaction in the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;-- Cheap. Besides the dice, you only need to print out a few items. The only thing you really need to print with quality is the Star System board, and two 4x6 sheets of game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer Note: I do not own any of the rights to the PC game, nor do I intend on making any sort of profit from it in the slightest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
