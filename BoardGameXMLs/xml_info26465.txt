							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babysitter Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;If you wake the baby ... he'll YELL!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone becomes a baby sitter when he plays this fast moving, money earning game.  Each player tries to perform tasks without waking up little 'STANLEY', a light sleeper, who is sleeping peacefully in his crib.  The players earn money for each task they perform while baby-sitting.  Every time little 'STANLEY' jumps up and yells, players lose money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a huge (15&amp;quot; x 21&amp;quot; x 4&amp;quot;) box.  The large elaborate molded plastic gameboard features a complicated mechanism beneath the surface which is responsible for setting the tasks which will not be completed successfully.  The gameboard depicts Stanley's room; Stanley is in his centrally located crib which is surrounded by a circle of 16 holes where the various task symbols are inserted.  These holes are in turn are surrounded by a circle of 20 holes - 16 corresponding task peg holes and 4 chore holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt three cards at the start of the game and draw another (or more if needed) at the start of each turn to give a total of four; these are used in gameplay to either perform tasks to earn money, or hinder other players while performing their tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player receives the task pegs and inserts pegs into the corresponding task peg hole when required.  Up to three tasks may be attempted per turn, depending on the cards held.  25 cents is awarded for the first task completed successfully, 50 cents for the second and one dollar for the third.  If however Stanley pops up and 'cries', all money earned that turn is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when there is no money left for distribution.  Players total their earnings and the player with the highest amount is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
