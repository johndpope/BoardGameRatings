							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Secret of the Knights</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 14th century, King Edward III began an order of knights who wore a cloth garter on their sleeves. A secret motto was written on it: &amp;quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense.&amp;quot; Why did the knights wear this garter, and what does the motto mean? To find out, you have to travel back in time and become a knight yourself! The Time Machine series challenges young readers to use their imagination and decision-making skills to write their own story. Options in the text allow readers to choose any path they like within the plot. Readers must draw on background information about the period to make the right choices. This makes the series a great educational device for youngsters to learn about history and all the different cultures, events, and periods that shaped it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
