			<description>Sedan: The Decisive Battle for France, May 1940, designed by Paul Youde, simulates the German Army&amp;rsquo;s offensive to reach and cross the imposing Meuse River, near Sedan, and the subsequent breakthrough to the west. Using basic combat mechanics, the game includes command control strictures to better simulate the differences between French and German capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-player (German versus French) operational level game. The game includes 228 medium-sized die-cut counters, with the Battalion as the primary maneuver unit, and also includes air units, artillery units, blown bridge chits, pontoon bridge chits, and command draw chits. The colorful map features the Belgian/French border, centered around Sedan along the Meuse River, with each hex representing approximately 2 miles across, and includes such prominent locations as the northern extent of the Maginot Line, and the city of Sedan, as well as various charts and tables for easy reference during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules entail a variety of standard and unique rules, such as Roadblocks, Demolishing Bridges, German Pontoon Bridges, Dogfights, Bombing Bridges, Overruns, French Fuel Shortages, the French 2nd Army Cavalry, the French 3rd Brigade de Spahis, Headquarters Activation, Air Support, Operation Niwi, Reinforcements, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory in the game is determined by the accumulation of VPs for control of the Meuse River (primarily involving the quantity of German units that have crossed the bridges), as well as eliminating enemy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in World at War Magazine #24, Jun-Jul 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1 day&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Battalion to Regiment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color map&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (228 9/16&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 16-page Sedan rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 4-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
