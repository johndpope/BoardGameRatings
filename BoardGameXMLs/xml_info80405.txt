			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the 24 Hour Role-Playing Game Naked in Space. Did the title grab you? I hope so. Any nakedness in this game is up to you, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what it&amp;rsquo;s about. The 'naked' in Naked in Space is more of a reference to the bare bones rules system, and the 'in Space' because this is Pulp Sci-Fi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My goal with this quickie RPG is quick and simple rules and a bit of hearty emphasis on fun in a pulp sci-fi setting. And if you don't like pulp sci-fi, so what, dump the setting and use the rules. It's your game. I'm not going to go into the ins and outs of role-playing; I'm going to presume that as you've got this far you know what a Role-Playing Game is so you know what you're looking for and you know what all this nonsense is about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
