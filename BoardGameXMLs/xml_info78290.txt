							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reservoir Dogs</name>
									
			<description>Reservoir Dogs is a video game based on the Quentin Tarantino film of the same name. Released in 2006, it garnered mostly mediocre reviews and caused minor controversies for its violence, being banned in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the movie by Quentin Tarantino. It has the same story, but goes into more detail. It remains faithful to the film, with gamers able to play all the key characters. It follows the progress and planning of the diamond heist, and reveals some of the events which only took place off-screen in the film itself. The game consists of both third-person shooting and driving sections. The game encourages the player to take hostages and avoid mass-slaughter: both in the ratings system, where a player may be rated as a &amp;quot;Psycho&amp;quot; if many people are killed, or a &amp;quot;Professional&amp;quot; if they are not. It also features the full and original soundtrack from the movie, the so-called K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. Of the original actors, only Michael Madsen provides his likeness and voice acting for the game. Other characters look and sound only vaguely similar to their big-screen counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Reservoir Dogs (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
