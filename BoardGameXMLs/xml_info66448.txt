			<description>From the game's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roleplaying game. That means you play a role. The role you'll be playing is a Discordian Double Agent, fighting against the tyranny of Order and those who would impose their dogma upon others. Sure, those others are just sleeping sheep who want to be lead around, but that doesn't mean they deserve to be lead around, does it? Hell no. You've got a right and duty to do something about it. One of those things is more important than the other - right and duty, I mean - but I'm not telling which is which.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin, you need a character: your Discordian Double Agent. While you are a Discordian and you worship Eris with all your heart, you've also managed to infiltrate one of the Illumanati: the true masters of the world. Forget world governments; they're just puppets on strings. The true masters of the world are organizations so vast, ancient and faceless that they can never be stopped. Especially by the likes of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
