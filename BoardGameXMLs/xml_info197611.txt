On the stage, you are Iskender, a dying prince, in search of the flower of immortality. Finally, when reaching the coveted artifact, you face a guardian spirit, La P&amp;eacute;ri, who gradually turns into a beautiful ballerina that bewitches you to prevent you from taking possession of the flower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new VR experience made for roomscale VR is focused on a dancer's performance. Immersed in a piece of classical music, the viewer will be surrounded by a whirlwind of movement, color and form in perfect synesthesia. Theater, dance, photography and cinema have always imposed a frame for the stage or the screen. VR, on the other hand, is the first visual art to be fundamentally free of these constraints, offering a virtual space that the viewer can truly embody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
