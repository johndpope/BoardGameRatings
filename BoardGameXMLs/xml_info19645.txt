			<description>Quiz Game made in England in 1962 by Bell Toys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a family quiz game called the &amp;quot;The Wizard of Oz&amp;quot;. This works along the same lines as the Magic Robot games that were also made in the 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are sheets of questions and answers covering eight different categories. You stand the Wizard figure in the red magnetic base and move his pointer to a question. You then place him on the mirror in the middle of the answers section and he will magically move his pointer to answer your question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He always gives the correct answer - he is a very clever little man!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 board&lt;br/&gt;1 Wizard figurine&lt;br/&gt;4 overlay mats with questions and answers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
