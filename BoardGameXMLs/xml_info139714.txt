							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002</name>
									
			<description>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 (FS2002) was version 8.0 of Flight Simulator. It offered vast improvements over previous versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to improved graphics, FS2002 introduced air traffic control (ATC) and artificial intelligence (AI) aircraft enabling users to fly alongside computer controlled aircraft and communicate with airports. An option for a target framerate was added, enabling a cap on the framerate to reduce stutter while performing texture loading and other maintenance tasks. In addition, the FS2002 aircraft feature 3D virtual cockpits. The external view featured an inertia effect, inducing an illusion of movement in a realistic physical environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anticipation was high for this version because of its interactive AI traffic and ATC features. Due to the September 11 attacks, release of the software was postponed to remove the twin towers of the World Trade Center in all copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A free copy of Fighter Ace II was also included with the software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Flight Simulator 98&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
