							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pony Tales</name>
									
			<description>Pony Tales is a simple RPG based on the setting of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic television show, but is written around actual mention of particular elements and characters to avoid trademark infringement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the creator:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pony Tales is a role-playing game for ages twelve and older based loosely on the Open D6 open-source rules set. Rewritten from the ground up in a straightforward conversational style, the rules have been streamlined for ease of play and heavily customized for a better fit to the unique characters and setting. A chief feature of the game is its differentiation between &amp;ldquo;literal&amp;rdquo; games, which take the show&amp;rsquo;s anachronisms and inconsistencies at face value, and &amp;ldquo;figurative&amp;rdquo; games, which assume those elements are exaggerations or simplifications for effect. Where possible the rules make allowances for both kinds of games, offering suggestions and alternatives to suit the different styles of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
