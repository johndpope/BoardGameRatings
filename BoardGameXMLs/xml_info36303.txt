							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quest for the Princess Bride</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2 players. Based on the Princess Bride Story. One player takes the role of Westly. The other player takes the role of Prince Humperdink.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Humperdink player starts with control over Princess Buttercup. Both sides attempt to recruit allies as Character Cards are drawn. A fight may break out, randomly determined to be a battle of wits, strength, or sword. Card play determines the winning side. The winner of a fight gains or maintains control of the Princess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: Any player able to control the Buttercup token for 4+ consecutive turns wins. Any player who loses his Main Character (Westly or Humperdink) in a fight automatically loses. If the deck runs out, the player in control of the Buttercup Token wins.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
