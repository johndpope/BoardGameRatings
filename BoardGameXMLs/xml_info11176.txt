			<description>The goal of this game is to pick one of the ten pre-made boxers and attempt to climb to the rank of Heavyweight Champion of the  World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boxers have basic ratings of skill, punching power, and defense.  In any given month, assuming you aren't nursing some sort of injury or voluntarily training, you are randomly assigned an opponent according to your current experience level.  You the take on that opponent in an extremely quick fight... it should last only 2-3 minutes.  Based on the outcome, you may have advanced a few levels, earned some money, and pocketed some points to use for later training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cool thing about this game is that the fight purse is dependent upon your level, your opponents level, and whether or not it is some sort of title match (British, Commonwealth, European, or World).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
