							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Combat Essentials 1: Critical Matters</name>
									
			<description>From the Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illirian stood, his sword shaking in his left hand. His vision blurred and his right arm - his sword arm - hung broken and twisted. Blood ran down the limb, pooling below him. He took a step forward and waves of dizziness rose within him from the blood loss and the pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was supposed to be an easy battle. One minute and this ridiculous, self-appointed hero would be dead. It should have been over before it began... but one lucky shot. One lucky shot and it all came down around him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your reign of terror is over,&amp;quot; the boy said. So typical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Shut up.&amp;quot; Illirian raised his sword in his off hand. The boy had gotten lucky. Maybe luck would run both ways...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical Matters is a Critical Effects product. In these pages, you will find more than seventeen hundred unique Critical Effects. Some of them are funny. Some of them are brutal. They are all more interesting than simple Damage.

It makes combat more dangerous and evocative. With it, the underdog can win. With more than one hundred results for each Damage Type, this book will give you years of gaming enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
