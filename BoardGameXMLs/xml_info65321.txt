							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Frog&#039;s Banquet</name>
									
			<description>A Frog's Banquet is a fast, fun, frog filled game of eating dragonflies and dodging dangers. Choose a play board to jump around, choose a frog and jump to it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 frogs may compete, or go it alone with the single player variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a frog: Flecks, Springs, Grublic or Bubbly. The frogs each have a default 'jump' that they can use during their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of five cards from the event deck and may play any of them face down, adding to a line at the edge of the board. The majority of these cards are Dragonfly cards that dictate where the dragonflies will appear and where they will move to. Dragonflies are worth points depending on which turn they are caught by the frogs (first turn they appear, second turn they move, third turn they move and then fourth turn they are gone)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can only ever be one dragonfly of each colour on the board at any one time, so players need to plot carefully to get their frogs in the right place at the right time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the deck is also a series of Dangers - Turtle, Heron, Snake, Toad and the dreaded Bunyip! These dangers are added to the board when played and will act according to their own rules (they are played by the game). Avoid them at all costs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played to a certain number of points, depending on the length of game you are after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play boards depict different environments that the frogs may inhabit, for example wetlands and rainforests. Theses are presented both horizontally and vertically. They contain their own special rules - for example, don't get caught in the waterfall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easy to pick up and play with people of all ages, but with careful tactics and clever use of your jumping resources, the better player gets the most dragonflies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
