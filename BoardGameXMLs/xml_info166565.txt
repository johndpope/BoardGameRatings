			<description>Simple Trivial Pursuit-like game from Canada in which players can choose to answer questions themselves for 10 points (Trade-In) or pass the question to an opponent for 5 points (Trade-Off) with the goal of getting 50 points in each of 6 categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorrect answers in the &amp;quot;danger zone&amp;quot; (between 15 and 35 points) means players must choose a penalty card, typically causing a player to lose points or lose their next turn. Players who correctly answer a question passed to them get to choose a bonus card which could earn bonus points or an extra turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six categories are: &lt;br/&gt;1. Movies, TV, Theatre&lt;br/&gt;2. People, Places, Things&lt;br/&gt;3. Food, Drink, Customs&lt;br/&gt;4. Fiction, Fables, Myths&lt;br/&gt;5. Music, Singers, Songs&lt;br/&gt;6. Sports, Games, Hobbies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 120 cards in each category with 6 questions on each, for a total of over 4,300 questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
