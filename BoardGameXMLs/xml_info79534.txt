			<description>&amp;quot;Metal Slug 3 (メタルスラッグ 3) is a run and gun video game for the Neo-Geo console/arcade platform created by SNK that was released in 2000 and is the sequel to Metal Slug 2. Being the last Metal Slug that SNK was working on until the bankruptcy, it was given a lot of features, enhancements and improvements. The music of the game was developed by Noise Factory. The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game was also released for the Wii, PSP, and PS2 as part of the Metal Slug Anthology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay mechanics are the same as previous Metal Slug games. New for Metal Slug 3, however, is the branching path system; in most missions, there are forking paths for the player to choose from, each with their own obstacles, and of varying length and difficulty. All paths eventually lead to the same boss battle, but the player may have different equipment, and may have rescued more or fewer hostages depending on their choices.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Metal Slug 3 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
