							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Obitu</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the darkest corner, Lord Varquil the Lich plotted. Legions of his undead clashed with the holy power of the temple brethren yet again. The dreaded army of bone and blade lost yet again.  In response to his loss, the lich began work on a new breed: undead imbued with life&amp;mdash;true life. The obitu were to be a life force as docile and obedient as his other minions with one marked difference; they were technically living, breathing entities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by infecting undead with an arcane disease, the numbers of obitu grew quickly to the thousands. As they marched towards the distant citadel, something else began to grow as well; their free will. By the time the temple bastion was in sight, many obitu already began to doubt the wisdom of serving an evil master. The obitu rapidly converted to the goodly faith and became a bane to undead ever since. So wrap your boney fingers around that broadsword, march to the clatter of skeletal feet, and pull back that hood to reveal your undying smile. This new PC race will warm you to the bone!&lt;br/&gt; Published under the Fourth Edition GSL. Full racial statistics for a new PC race, feats, monster blocks, and much much more! Colorfully illustrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
