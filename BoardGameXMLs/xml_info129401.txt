							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spell Trek</name>
									
			<description>Players are on a trek around the world, trying to take photographs of the things they see, but somehow all the vowels are missing!  Complete the words by finding the missing vowels and you will move ahead on the Game Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives three Word Cards, and places them face up in front of them.  On your turn, draw a Vowel Tile and check whether it can be added to any of your own Word Cards.  If not, check whether it can be added to another player's Word Cards.  If it can, and it has no prior vowels added to it, you may exchange one of your empty cards for theirs and play your Vowels Tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player completes a word, they move ahead on the Game Board as many spaces as the length of that word (3 letter words move 3 spaces, etc).  The player must spell the word aloud for everyone to hear as they move their pawn on the board, then discard their used Word Cards and Vowel Tiles, and draw a new card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first time any player crosses either of the wooden bridges, recycle all the used Vowel Tiles from the Discard Tray back into the draw area, and rearrange them.  The first player to reach the Finish space wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN:  The Vowels, Using Vowels to Spell, Word/Picture Recognition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
