			<description>From LateForTheSky.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENTLE, INTELLIGENT, FRIENDLY, EAGER TO PLEASE&lt;br/&gt;MEET THE GOLDEN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With good reason, the Golden Retriever is one of the most popular breeds in the United States.  They are loveable, well-mannered dogs with great charm and a striking golden coat, making them both beautiful and a joy to own.  Originating in the Scottish Highlands in the late 1800s the Golden was used predominantly for hunting.  Active and energetic, this breed can adapt to many different living situations but requires daily exercise.  They are easily trained, always patient and gentle with children, and make wonderful canine companions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOLDEN-OPOLY IS A GAME OF TAIL-WAGGING FUN!&lt;br/&gt;COLLECT YOUR FAVORITE GOLDENS AND PLAY HARD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increase your rent by buying Toys for your dogs and upgrading them to Big Bones.  Sounds easy enough until you get fleas, have an accident on the carpet, or worse yet, get sent to the kennel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRAB YOUR TOKEN AND ADVANCE TO GO GOLDENS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows!  You may soon be Best in Show... or marching in the dog parade!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
