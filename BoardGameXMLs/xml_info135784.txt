							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Infinite Library</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DM: You open the door and step inside what must be the wizard&amp;rsquo;s library. Shelves cover three of the four walls, stretching from floor to ceiling. Hundreds of tomes are stacked thereon &amp;mdash; books on almost any imaginable topic.'&lt;br/&gt;Player: Cool! I grab a random book off the shelf. What&amp;rsquo;s it called?&lt;br/&gt;DM: Uh&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve found yourself in the above situation. Quite a few DMs have. Perhaps you simply want to provide some interesting new treasures for your players, and you think a valuable tome should do the trick. Or maybe the party&amp;rsquo;s been hunting for a particular book for ages, and it&amp;rsquo;s only when they&amp;rsquo;re right on top of it that you realize that even though you&amp;rsquo;ve described it to them a dozen times, and told them who wrote it, you never actually decided on a name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever the situation, whatever the reason you need one (or more) book titles for your fantasy roleplaying game, the Infinite Library has you covered.With a few random rolls,making use of a simple sequence of tables, you can generate many thousands of titles without ever repeating a trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, as with most random elements of an RPG, the DM can&amp;rsquo;t forget common sense. If you follow the tables slavishly, you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes wind up with a title that may not quite make sense as is. Feel free to alter plurals, replace &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;a,&amp;rdquo; replace &amp;ldquo;from&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;out of,&amp;rdquo; or make whatever minor tweaks are necessary to create just the title you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
