			<description>B-Sieged: Heroes Set 1 introduces three brand-new Heroes to defend the Citadel of Modhelm: Seren, the Trickster; Axel, the Engineer; and Eyra, the Thief!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seren, the Trickster&lt;br/&gt;As a seasoned artist, Seren, the Trickster boasts a very unique and powerful starting Special Ability: Chicanery! Through Chicanery, Seren is allowed to draw 1 Resource card from the Seasons Resources at the beginning of each of her turns, and she can choose from any of the four types (Armory, Tavern, Market or Sorcery). This ability frees her up from visiting the Citadel's buildings as frequently as other Heroes, and gives the Heroes a way to get at least one Resource card per turn. Note that unlike Kador's Archmastery or Orobox's Intimidation skills, Seren may only draw from the Season Resources, which drains from the Heroes' common resources and makes her options limited if the Season resource decks are depleted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axel, the Engineer&lt;br/&gt;As an Engineer, Axel comes with the Royal Artilleryman starting Special Ability. With it, Axel gets a free action per turn to either Rotate or Shoot the Catapult, and it can help the Heroes in crucial moments! Each Catapult shot may kill up to three enemies and it has a Strength of 4, so it can kill M&amp;ouml;lens or severely damage the Avatar! The option to rotate the catapult is also important because Axel may use it to aim the catapult for another Hero, allowing him or her to shoot twice with the catapult in their turn if they wish to do so!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eyra, the Thief&lt;br/&gt;Last, but not least, Eyra the Thief brings two starting Special Abilities that emphasize her roguish nature: Filch and Archer's Discipline. With Filch, Eyra &amp;quot;accidentally comes by&amp;quot; one Market resource card at the beginning of each of her turns. These Tavern Resource cards come directly from the Tavern Resource pool, so she may get a card even if the Tavern is damaged or destroyed. With her trusty one-handed crossbow and Archer's Discipline, Eyra is able to shoot with better precision at enemies in Zone 2, making her a valuable asset to help control Krohns and Gargohs and filching Tavern cards every turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
