			<description>Childbirth Trivia is a trivia game to test and teach knowledge about childbirth to expectant parents or health professionals.  Players compete to answer questions in a number of categories.  Players roll a die to determine which of six categories they will answer.  Another player draws a card of the corresponding color and asks the question.  If the question is answered correctly, the player rolls again and answers another question, continuing until an answer is wrong.  Once a player answers questions in all six categories, he or she must answer one last question in a category chosen by the other players.  A correct answer wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A longer version of the game requires players to progress through various levels.  Some levels require answers in each category, some are free choice categories and others allow opponents to choose the categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions may be asked at level 1 (for the general public or expectant parents) or level 2, for health professionals or other childbirth professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can also be played with a board from Trivial Pursuit or a similar game, substituting the Childbirth Trivia cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
