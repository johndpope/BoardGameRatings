			<description>The Operations and Objectives sourcebook allows players to introduce a strategic level to their WWII gaming. Taking control of company sized formations on the campaign map, sides compete to accomplish objectives set by the upper echelons of their commands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for multiple players using the &amp;quot; Rules of Engagement&amp;quot; tabletop wargame, this addtion will encourage gamers to carefully consider every turn within a game of &amp;quot;Rules of Engagement&amp;quot; as any poor decision at platoon level could potentially cost the campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign rules provide all that is needed to play in cluding map generation, terrain features, supply lines, tactical reserves, resolving casualties and special rules such as railheads, para drops, airstrikes and the random fortunes of war! Also includes the sample historical scenario, &amp;quot;The Defence of St.Vith&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operations &amp;amp; Objectives is easily convertable for use with any system, from ancients to sci-fi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
