			<description>Released in 1995 according to Moby Games, The graphics are enhanced from their original incarnations. However, the sounds are minimal at best. This game was never released in the Japanese, European, or Australian markets. Being the final game ever released for the Atari Lynx, this game would ultimately begin an era where Atari would produce games for other console systems as opposed to their own.&lt;br/&gt;Super Asteroids pits the player against a never ending supply of extraterrestrial debris and enemy UFOs trained to kill any human spacecaft. He must destroy everything while snatching power-ups. Super Missile Command has the player defend various of his space colonies from incoming missiles, satellites, and enemy fighters. Intermissions allow players to buy better missiles and defense system to bolster up his defense of his space colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Asteroids &amp;amp; Missile Command&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
