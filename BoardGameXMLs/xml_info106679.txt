			<description>1-4 players, 10-40 minutes (extra 10 min. per player), ages 12+.&lt;br/&gt;Handmade canvas/natural paper board, 2 dice, 10 wooden tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Introduction in the Rulebook)&lt;br/&gt;You are students at wizarding school racing to finish your final exam. You begin in an ancient Castle, which represents the 9 steps of brewing your Transmogrification Potion. While you race through the halls to complete your concoction, the bewitched game board works against you by counting down precious hours. Each revolution (as it passes the 24 hour mark), your grades are collectively lowered one level, and continue to spiral downwards towards &amp;ldquo;Failure&amp;rdquo; the longer you take. You must split your actions between moving through the 9 steps of your potion (the further you get, the faster time counts), casting basic spells (powerful, but they can harm you), rewinding time (strategically use this to gain grades back) and fighting Cryptids (a selfish action testing the strength of your Potion and thus raising your individual grade). Roll the dice, move your markers, and choose an action. Work together to complete this dastardly exam, but only one student will prevail, leaving with the knowledge that could save you all. Will it be you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, there is a bonus educational element to the game.  One of the dice used can be replaced with any self-provided questions (homework, trivia cards, flash cards...), anything about any topic that you can answer quickly.  If you get it correct, you get to perform an action this turn, incorrect and you must wait until your next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game boards are all hand made, printed on Nepalese paper, covered in a matte gel medium and backed with canvas.  This allows the game board to be flexible enough to roll into a scroll, the coating keeps the artwork protected, and when you unroll it, the game will lay flat.  It has an incredible texture, very tactile, and ships in rolled up in a tube with all the components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
