			<description>This game uses a standard deck of cards. The goal is to win tricks containing cards of different suits from the one led. In each trick, any card of the suit led is a 'dead' card and scores against you, while any card of a different suit is a 'live' card and scores in your favour. The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led.&lt;br/&gt;At end of play, each side scores the total face value of all its live cards (numerals count face value, J-Q-K count 10 each, Ace counts 15), minus 1 point for each of its dead cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
