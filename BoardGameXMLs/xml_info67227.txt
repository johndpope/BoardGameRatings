							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thieves&#039; Guild</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This medium-sized thieves&amp;rsquo; guild is a three-storey building that can be located in any city or fantasy town. The ground level of the guild offers a smart cover for the thieves&amp;rsquo; shadowy activities; an unwary citizen will see nothing else than a tavern, a forge and stables. The thieves use the backroom of the tavern or a secret door in the forge to enter the guild. On the first level there are the common facilities of a guild such as an exercise room, a laboratory, a small chapel, a refectory, a kitchen and so on. On the second level there are the guildmasters&amp;rsquo; quarters and council room for high-level ranking thieves. The guild features two levels of dungeon. The first level dungeon houses a torture chamber, cells and guardrooms, while the second level is the sacred sepulcher of the master thieves, secretly connected to the sewer system. Some hints to use the guild follow:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The old thieves&amp;rsquo; guild building belongs now to the PCs, exploring it they discover dangerous secrets of the guild.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The thieves guild is the headquarter of a would be ruler of the city, the PC must sneak into the guild and find clues of his shadowy activities.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; This abandoned thieves guild is now haunted by specters and undeads, they search something hidden in the guild.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; This is the thieves guild of an ancient ruined city, a bandit has settled here with his thugs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
