			<description>Break In is a push-your-luck card game in the vein of Incan Gold, with players trying to steal as many gems as possible from a bank before they get caught. The longer you stick around, the more you'll earn &amp;mdash; but stay too long and you'll find yourself wearing handcuffs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Break In &amp;mdash; first published online in the game compilation &amp;quot;Femtitv&amp;aring;&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; can be played with a standard deck of cards or with the free downloadable card deck provided online. To set up, remove the 7-10 in each suit from the deck. Shuffle the cards into three or four equal stacks, after which each player can look through one stack, then reshuffle that stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player draws the top card from a stack of her choice. If a face card shows up, it counts as a guard and is placed face-up on the table; any other card counts as cash and is placed in front of the player. (An ace also allows the player to look through one stack, then reshuffle it.) At any time during the round, a player can cash out, scoring one point for each pip on the cards in front of her and one point for each card face-up on the table, whether cash or guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a second guard shows up in a suit, then the round ends and no one still in the round scores for the cash in front of them. After five rounds, whoever has the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
