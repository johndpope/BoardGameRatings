			<description>Each player spins to establish their color.  The 24 puzzle pieces are evenly distributed.  The red player starts by trying to put the puzzle together while the person on their left is trying to spin red's color.  When red is spun, the player spinning tries to put the puzzle together while the person on their left tries to spin that persons color.
