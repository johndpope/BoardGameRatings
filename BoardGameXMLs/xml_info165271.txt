							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ziggurat of the Dragons</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Six Great Dragons will lead you. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the details. They brought civilization to all the races at the beginning of the first age and now they&amp;rsquo;re ready to emerge. They&amp;rsquo;ve designated you &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;re going to be the champion and wear the dragon scale armor the Six Great Dragons created. First assignment? Bring Micha out into the world. He may not be ready, but time is running out. He&amp;rsquo;ll be a big help to you. Imagine? He can make whatever you need out of the power of his language. See that Sickle Man there? Micha made him. So hook up to the power sources here in #81 and change the world. It&amp;rsquo;s  going to change with you or without you, so step right up. Start with Micha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
