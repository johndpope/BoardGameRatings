							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Shiloh</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;1862 - Shiloh (American Civil War in 3D)&lt;br/&gt;Shiloh is the tenth battle in the series, this TWO day battle sees the Confederates launch a surprise attack against the Union who are in encampment. This battle is finely balanced and could go either way once the Union reserves arrive for the second day.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a printable game board that can be constructed 3 dimensionally for an impressive realistic feel. Counters, rules and all playing aids accompany the game including a set of tile dice for those of you without any cube dice.&amp;quot; - &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.wargameshop.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.wargameshop.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game, as well as any other in the series, is an easy pleasure to play.  Combat units (brigades, batteries) show range, attack (to hit die roll), and strength.  Leaders show organization level and command area.  If subordinate units aren't close enough to the leader, there is only a chance they will be able to fire or move.  Victory is achieved by controlling certain hexes and disabling or dispersing the opponents' units. Low counter numbers (32 confederate, 49 union) don't overwhelm the nicely drawn map.  If someone wishes to make the effort, the maps can be created in 3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
