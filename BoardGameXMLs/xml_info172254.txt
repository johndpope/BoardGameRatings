			<description>Kiqsuyapi - A game for three to eight players who are puzzle fans and fast thinkers. Here the players themselves decide about the level of difficulty, because they take turns in being the puzzle master who can ask the questions, and it is totally up to him or her what is asked: How many feathers were there altogether? How many headbands were worn? Or how many weapons were pointing to the left? Was the second Indian from the right painted with war paint? Or is there an Indian wearing a shirt, and carrying a tomahawk? The player who is able to give the first correct answer, gains a token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10 playing cards in Kiqsuyapi are double-sided. They determine the level of difficulty of the game. With only 4 cards, the challenge is still moderate. With 10 cards even true champions are going to work up a sweat. And if you still consider this too easy, the expert version will be an even greater challenge for you. Here, all players have to answer and the right answer will gain you a point, as before. Wrong answers, however, will cost you points! This applies in particular to those questions that ask for two or even three aspects at once. For example, how many Indians are wearing a shirt, a headdress and are carrying a bow?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
