			<description>Rauf &amp;amp; Runter is a small memory/guessing game for children who try to get around the palace garden over objects in the garden, without touching the ground with their feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 5 characters, 5 betting markers, 5 starting tiles and 21 tiles with an item on both the front and back. The items depicted on the 21 tiles can be 1 of 6 different objects, reaching from a mushroom (height 1), mole hill, bucket, dog house, horse and tree (height 6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first the 21 tiles are shuffled and placed randomly in a circle. Then each player selects a character and places the corresponding character and starting tile on one of the 21 tiles. He also takes the betting marker in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns in clockwise order. When you correctly guess if the next tile is above, below or at the same height (by using the betting marker) than the one you're standing on, you can move one tile forward. You can guess up to three times correctly before your turn ends. As soon as you've guessed wrong, you are moved one tile backwards and your turn ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to have moved over all the tiles and returns to his starting tile wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
