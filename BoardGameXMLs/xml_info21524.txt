			<description>From GAMES Magazine review:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, move two poles and two ports. Poles can move one or two spaces orthogonally, or they can teleport. A port has two ways of moving: It can either reorient (that is, spin so that its right angle is flush with any corner of the space it occupies), or it can glide across the board like a chess rook. A port forms a teleport by landing on a square with another of its color, with each right angle in opposite corners of the square. A teleport enclosing an enemy pole sends the pole back to one of its home spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pole teleports between any two of the following:  friendly teleports, home spaces, and goal spaces (except that a pole can only teleport to a goal space from another goal space). Poles can be blocked by port walls or other poles, but they can also move between the board's left and right edges as if the edges were connected. A pole completely blocked by the opponent teleports home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
