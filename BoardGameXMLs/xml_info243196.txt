			<description>The amazing creatures that live in the ocean deep are valuable. You know if you can catch them, wealthy marine life enthusiasts will pay major moolah to add them to their collections. Yet, you aren&amp;rsquo;t the only diver after these beasts of the big blue. Fortunately, you have a gift. The skill to charm and command smaller fish. It is with this talent in mind that you will go... Into the Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Separate the cards in to two decks&amp;ndash; one light blue, and one dark blue. Deal 2 light blue cards to each player. The player to the dealer's left has first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn, each player shall draw up to 3 cards (the hand limit) from the light blue deck, and play 1 card on the playing surface to create lines of the same colour fish (red, blue, yellow and green). Only 1 line for each colour is permitted at a time, and is shared by all players. When a card is played that increases a line of fish to 5 or more, a &amp;quot;school&amp;quot; is created&amp;ndash; attracting a big sea creature. The player who placed the last card to create a school shall draw a card from the dark blue deck, briefly add it to that school for all to see, and finally collect the school, plus the big sea screature, to score the total of the number of points shown on each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shrimp and Butterfly Fish are wild cards. They may join any colour line of fish. However, Butterfly Fish also let a player place a second card during his or her turn. Play continues clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to have scored the most points, once all sea creatures have been captured, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
