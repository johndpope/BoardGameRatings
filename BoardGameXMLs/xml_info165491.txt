			<description>Producer's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Jimmy Crane is fingered for a murder he didn't commit, his cop buddy, Ralph Becker, finds himself torn between loyalty to his friend and his sworn duty as an officer of the law. Can the whole mess be sorted out before it's too late or will Jimmy be wrongly sent to the electric chair?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Death Kisses Coldly is an adventure (or &amp;quot;film&amp;quot; as we like to call them) for The Big Crime. The film's plot is full of all the twists, turns and surprises that have become hallmarks of film noir over the decades. It is designed for use by one Director and two players, though advice for more or less players is included. Best of all, you'll find two versions of the film: the Theatrical Release (which offers a very structured gaming experience with pre-made characters) and the Director's Cut (which allows for a more freewheeling approach with player-made characters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Crime is a roleplaying game that faithfully and meticulously emulates the bleak, shadow-drenched crime thrillers of the 1940s and &amp;lsquo;50s &amp;ndash; Out of the Past, The Asphalt Jungle, Double Indemnity, The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep and hundreds more! Every aspect of the game was designed to evoke the pessimistic, desperate tone of these films!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
