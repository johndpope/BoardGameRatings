			<description>Meet Pazzo, he is a little mad - too many years spent under the scorching sun scouring the west as a not-so-successful bandit. He has now turned his hand to an honest trade, hunting for gold beneath the rocks scattered across the plains and mesas of the wild west.The only problem is that his sun-addled memory is not so great, that is where you come in to give his memory skills a boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roc Pazzo is a 3D physics memory matching game. The unique gameplay combines classic memory skills with the puzzle solving cunning and fun of fully three dimensional physics. The game features two game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
