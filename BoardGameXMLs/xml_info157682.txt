			<description>Ever dreamt that you were fighting monsters in a B-grade horror film? Maybe you had just encountered Monster Town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Town is an action/adventure card game which places each player in control of their very own gang of classic horror movie monsters. Each gang needs to survive monster bites, fallen angels, parasitic demons, deadly weapons and ferocious gang warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquest of Monster Town is achieved by wiping out all opposing gangs or by being the first player to collect 10 conquest points by capturing locations and killing opposing gang members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each successful battle brings you closer to claiming victory in the End Game finale, where all surviving gangs compete for control of Monster Town in one last free-for-all battle until conquest has been achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hair on the back of your neck will raise as you feel the breath of a werewolf stalking you from behind. Your heart will race as a blood-thirsty vampire attempts to control your mind. Your legs will turn to jelly as you are ambushed by a horde of zombies. Animal instincts will take over as you battle the human militia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Town is a game for 2 to 4 players sure to bring out your survival instincts no matter what gang you lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
