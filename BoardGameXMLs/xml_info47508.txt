							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demongate High</name>
									
			<description>Demongate High is the world&amp;rsquo;s single school for supernaturally-talented youth. Run for centuries in secret, it teaches such gifted students to control their powers and use them in the fight against demons as well as humans who would use their own powers for evil ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Demongate High book, written to resemble a student&amp;rsquo;s orientation packet, includes rules for creating supernaturally-powered characters including Half-demons, Holy Chosen, Inheritors, Seers, Spirit Energists, Summoners, Warders, and, of course, ESPers. Each type of student brings their own unique abilities to the fight against demons, and their own personalities to life in high school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book includes over fifty demons, new skills and Backgrounds, and an introductory adventure module, as well as limitless paranormal thrills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you thought high school would be boring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
