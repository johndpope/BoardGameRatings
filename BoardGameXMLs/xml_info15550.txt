			<description>The Cocoos contains several different games. They are about collecting sets of 4 Cards. the Cards have two different sides. One is kind of green and the other light red. Each card has Cocoos in 4 different sizes and in 4 different colors. The basic principle is that a card has different cocoos on each side. This means if there is a red Cocoo in size 4 on one side, there is certainly not a red cocoo and no cocoo in size 4 on the other side.&lt;br/&gt;You start picking cards from the table, and as you can see one side of the card you can guess which card helps you most in collecting a set. &lt;br/&gt;It is a quite tricky game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
