			<description>Based on part of the Brennan Bear Series games and books.&lt;br/&gt; Brennan's ExBEARdition is designed to help your student's listening skills grow through thinking and discussion.  Students will have fun as they practice listening skills in basic concepts, vocabulary, and language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will answer questions, roll the die, and move along the game board to collect 4 different souvenir picture cards- one from each of the Brennan's destinations (Kool Kat's, Tiffany's, Tweet's, and the Milky Way). The first student or team to collect the 4 different souvenir picture cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Stimulus card contains questions for the young and advanced.  Questions are based on- basic concepts, vocabulary, and language- with 15 listening cards for an All Play activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
