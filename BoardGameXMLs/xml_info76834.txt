							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2</name>
									
			<description>Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 is the 2001 successor to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX and one of the last videogames created by Acclaim Entertainment before going out of business. It was first released for the PlayStation 2 in August 2001, and in the following months it was ported to the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Xbox video game systems. Both the GameCube and Xbox ports featured two extra levels that were not present in the PS2 version. It is generally seen as a significant improvement over the first Dave Mirra title.[peacock term]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, players can take on the role of one of 13 top BMX riders, or a number of other characters. Along with the pro riders, there were 3 hidden characters. One of which was a teen who had won a contest and got his likeness put in the game, the Slim Jim man from the Slim Jim commercials, and then Amish Boy, who rode around on a wooden bike and had Amish clothing and a corn cob pipe. Some of the stages included in this game are Woodward Camp, Venice, Greenville, North Carolina, and the Manhattan train yards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2006, Crave Entertainment re-released this game on PlayStation 2 with the Greatest Hit label, under their copyrights and trademarks instead of Acclaim Entertainment since they closed their doors in 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
