			<description>48 cards, 16 with a number on them (1,2,3 or 4) and the other cards are illustrations of flora and fauna. The numbered cards are all examples of what not to do in the country. I do not have the rules sadly but an educated guess is that it is a game related to Beat Your Neighbors, the traditional children's card game. The cards are dealt equally amongst the players. In his turn, a player turns over one card. If it does not have a number on it, the next player turns over a card, and so on. If a numbered card appears, the next player must turn over cards equal to that number. If that player turns over a number when doing this, the next player must turn over cards. If no number is turned over when 'paying the penalty', the person who played the number collects all the cards and puts them at the bottom of his stack. The winner is the one who has captured all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
