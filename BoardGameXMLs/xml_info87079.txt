			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scenario:&lt;br/&gt;One year ago, Robert Killingsworth bought the farm. Six months later, he was dead - leaving his widow, Elizabeth, to tend to their fledgling winery and vineyard on the outskirts of California's wine country. With mounting debts and no clue as to how to run a business, Elizabeth is desperate to sell the farm and recoup her losses. The fierce drought and shaky economy, however, have left the Killingsworth Farm on the market for far too long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One early autumn day, six people passed through the gates of Killingsworth Farm to see Elizabeth - one of them, a cold-blooded Killer...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those Present at Killingsworth Farm:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Nightshade: This real estate developer from New York arrived unannounced with plans to buy Killingsworth Farm and develop it into a low-cost housing community. His boss ordered him to obtain the Killingsworth land at any price&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Chelsea Barren: After suffering a nervous breakdown, this psychiatrist and best-selling author moved to Northern California to relax&amp;hellip; but she moved next door to the Killingsworths instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vicki D'Adly: Elizabeth's estranged sister from New Jersey, she and her husband were traveling on vacation when Vicki decided to drop by Killingsworth Farm for a visit&amp;hellip; a surprise visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norman D'Adly: A real estate broker from New Jersey and husband to Vicki, Norman is trying to salvage his job and his marriage while traveling across the country on vacation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kathryn Lawless: Best friend to Elizabeth, this local librarian and historian has a flare for the eccentric. She lives down the road with her 15 cats and loves true crime - especially the mysterious, unsolved death of Robert Killingsworth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enrique Graves: This young drifter wandered onto Killingsworth Farm just as Robert and Elizabeth were moving in. Elizabeth took a liking to Enrique and he has lived on the farm ever since - tending to the fields&amp;hellip; among other things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which of these people has a secret worth killing for? Come to Killingsworth Farm and find out before it is too late!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.whodunitmysteries.com/sour.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.whodunitmysteries.com/sour.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
