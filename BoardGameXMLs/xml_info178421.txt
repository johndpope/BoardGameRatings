			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game about undead warrior kings trying to make it as a rock and roll band, inspired by a song by They Might Be Giants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through some terrible black magic, the evil sorceress Azita has resurrected several ancient Mesopotamian warlords to serve as generals of her undead army, leading her conquest of the modern world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead, you started a rock band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you&amp;rsquo;re driving across the United States (or wherever) trying to break into showbiz, one gig at a time.  You wander from town to town, having adventures and hoping that they bring you closer to success.  You do not understand this strange new world, with its technological wonders and modern customs. But you have a set of used musical instruments, an Econoline van and a desire to rock your way to music stardom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complete roleplaying game in 15 cards.  To play, you'll need 3-5 players, 1-3 hours of time and a variety of funny shaped dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in the Indie Mixtape Anthology, now revised and expanded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
