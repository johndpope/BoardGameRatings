							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twin Cities</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to choose two city sites across the river from each other and join them with a minimum of six road pieces and one bridge. The city sites are placed at the intersection of hexagonal pieces which have numbers on them, and each turn dice are rolled and cities adjacent to pieces with the rolled numbers produce resources, just as in Catan. Also as in Settlers, players trade resources with each other and then use them to build roads and bridges. Unlike Settlers, Twin Cities uses three dice with 1-5 and a question mark on the faces; rolling question marks gives you action cards, and rolling certain combinations has special effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contents include:&lt;br/&gt;12 city pieces&lt;br/&gt;66 interlocking plastic board pieces&lt;br/&gt;8 board frame pieces&lt;br/&gt;360 resource cards&lt;br/&gt;85 action cards&lt;br/&gt;72 road pieces&lt;br/&gt;24 bridge pieces&lt;br/&gt;3 dice&lt;br/&gt;1 board piece bag&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
