			<description>Also known as &amp;quot;The Cow Game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an ancient game similar to Mancala, and it originated in Africa, in the area now known as the Sudan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is similar to a Mancala board, and 5 stones are placed in each of the 10 playing wells. Players take turns moving stones by picking up all the stones in a well (except for one!) then dropping a stone in each well until they run out, moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise. You skip the scoring wells and must put a stone in the well you started in (in addition to leaving one there to begin the move). A well with only a single stone cannot be moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After your move, starting with the well you last placed a stone into, any wells that have exactly two or four stones may be placed in your scoring well. If there is a well that you cannot score (it has a number of stone other than 2 or 4), then any that come after it in sequence may not be scored either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when neither player can make a legal move. Any stones left on a players side of the board are added to those in his scoring well. However has the most stones is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Um el Tuweisat is considered a children's version of this game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
