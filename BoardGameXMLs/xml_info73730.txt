			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Nations is a game played on a tabletop where each player controls his own nation in a fantasy world. Each game is a new experience since players create the game &amp;ldquo;board&amp;rdquo; anew each game by placing large cardstock terrain tiles on the table. Players conquer territory, recruit new units, draw magic items, gold, healers, heroes, sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s apprentices and additions to their royal family from the Cup of Destiny to increase their power, making and breaking alliances with other players, slaying monsters and fighting desperate battles. It is possible for more than one player to win. Any game set can be played by itself or added to any of the other Fantasy Nations game sets to increase the size of the playing area and add new races, allowing larger games with more players. Each nation comes with its own special rules, terrain tiles and die cut pieces. Explore all the possibilities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each set is compatible with any of the others or can be played by itself. The Barbarian Hordes Fantasy Nations Game set includes: unique desert, forest and swamp terrain tiles, plus special rules and pieces for the Lizardmen, Orcs and Div cat-people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
