			<description>SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium (Japanese: 頂上決戦最強ファイターズ ＳＮＫ　ＶＳ．ＣＡＰＣＯＭ Hepburn: Chōjō Kessen Saikyō Fighters SNK vs. Capcom?, &amp;quot;Final Great Battle of the Strongest Fighters: SNK vs. Capcom&amp;quot;) is a fighting game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. It features a total of 26 characters from SNK and Capcom, eight of which are hidden. Play options includes 2-fighter tag teams, 3-fighter queue teams, and of course, one-on-one. After that, the player can choose either a Capcom-style level gauge, an SNK-style charge gauge, or a 'neutral' meter that enhances super attacks if full.&lt;br/&gt;Every character also has a rival, whom they will fight at the fourth stage. The last two stages has the player fighting the tag team of Geese and Bison, then, depending what the side opposite to the player character's is, Orochi Iori or Evil Ryu.&lt;br/&gt;As a side feature, there is Olympic mode, where one can play themed minigames such as blasting Martians FPS-style (lifted from the final boss of Metal Slug 2) or helping Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins hop pits to snatch up treasure, as well as there being time-attack, first strike, and survival events. The player's performance in these games awards the player special vs. points which can be used to unlock a special attack for each character.&lt;br/&gt;The Match of the Millennium is capable of linking with such other games as the Card Fighters Clash series and even the Dreamcast version of Capcom vs. SNK, but the only purpose this serves is data transfer.&lt;br/&gt;The use of both companies' material is quite extensive, from every character having their theme playing (not always from the first games they appeared in), to the featuring of stages from both universes. There is also interesting screens shown when this game is used in a monochrome Neo Geo Pocket, with such things as Alex and K' staring at each other, Shermie dressed up as Morrigan (to Yashiro and Chris' awe), Morrigan herself donning a suit like that of M. Bison (at which Balrog and Vega stare in embarrassment), Chun-Li doing her taunt pose while Li Xiangfei plays a Neo Geo Pocket, and Lilith and Kaede playing Neo Geo Pocket together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
