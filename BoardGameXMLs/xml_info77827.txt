			<description>Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator in PAL regions, also known as Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank 4) is a 3D platformer&amp;ndash;shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony. Released for the Playstation 2 in 2005, it is the fourth game in the Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank series,...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's story begins as Ratchet, Clank, and Al are abducted and forced to compete in &amp;quot;Dreadzone&amp;quot;, a violent game show in which heroes are forced to kill each other. Ratchet is given a &amp;quot;DeadLock&amp;quot; collar, which will explode if he becomes uncooperative. Ratchet defeats Dreadzone's most successful gladiators, the Exterminators, and becomes one of Dreadzone's most popular contestants. The three must find a way to deactivate the collars, and free the other heroes being held prisoner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is similar to other games in the series, but focuses more on shooter aspects rather than platforming. The player, as Ratchet, fights in Dreadzone tournaments across the &amp;quot;Shadow Sector&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;Solana&amp;quot; Galaxy, with a large variety of weapons. This game was the first in the series to feature cooperative gameplay in a story mode, and also includes an online multiplayer mode. Some vehicles return from previous games, and new ones are introduced. For the first time, Clank was not a playable character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ratchet: Deadlocked,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
