			<description>Nix the Six is a chess variant, using a chess board, with common six-sided dice for pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first in a planned series of games that will attempt to rival the richness and complexity of the largest wargames, with nothing more than a common 8x8 chess/checker board, and a bunch of common 6 sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with 16 dies each for black and white, with the beginning layout and piece powers similar to chess. But from there, complexities abound, as pieces can not only capture, but can also steal powers from the opposing pieces, and trade powers among themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one side no longer has any number 6 dies left, hence the title!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
