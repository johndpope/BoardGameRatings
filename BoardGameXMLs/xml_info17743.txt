			<description>'Rainy day cricket' is a game in the 'big fun in a little box' series by Tobar Ltd. Like other games in the series, it comes in a large matchbox-like container and has a nice miniature scoring pad and pencil. The main equipment are a green die bearing: bowled, run out, L.B.W., not out, no ball, caught; and a yellow die bearing: 1,2,3,4,6 and appeal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Rainy day cricket  (2 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose your teams and list their names on the scoresheet. Toss a coin and decide who will 'bat' first. The batting player uses the YELLOW die and will throw either 1,2,3,4,6 or APPEAL. If a number is thrown, record the score against the player in to bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If APPEAL is thrown, the bowling player uses the GREEN die and will throw LBW, CAUGHT, BOWLED, STUMPED (sic), NO BALL OR NOT OUT. If LBW, CAUGHT, BOWLED or STUMPED is thrown, the player batting is out and the next player on the list comes into bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If NO BALL or NOT OUT is thrown, the batting player carries on throwing the YELLOW dice as above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If NO BALL is thrown, an 'extra' is also added to the batting team's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The batting team's innings is over when all eleven players are out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other team then bats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winning team is the one that scores the most runs in one innings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A time/throws limit can be set if required. The game can also be varied to introduce more of the elements of a real cricket match if the players are enthusiastic enough!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Grammatical errors have been corrected)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
