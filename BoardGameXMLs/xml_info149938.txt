							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The S&#039;mores Demon (Aether)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the bonfire pits of Camp Wicakini, decades of campers creating S&amp;rsquo;mores created a mass of confectionary disaster as thousands, maybe even millions, of marshmallows were roasted, falling into the bonfires. Joining the marshmallows were hundreds of pounds of chocolate and box upon box of graham crackers as campers discarded unwanted S&amp;rsquo;mores, or the bigger kids took the S&amp;rsquo;mores from the younger kids and threw them into the blazing hot coals. The result became a coagulated mass of sugar, kept intact over the years by equal parts of rage, sadness, and inadequacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the final S&amp;rsquo;more hit the fire, spawning the S&amp;rsquo;mores Demon; a camp Demon whose driving need is to act out violently against those it sees, lashing out through the emotions that created and sustained it for decades before gaining sentience and form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This freebie from us is to celebrate National S'mores Day, which apparently is a holiday!  Kick back, relax, and terrorize your players with this abomination from beyond as it tears out of the ashes of the camp fires of Camp Wicakini to destroy and crush everything and everyone around it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
