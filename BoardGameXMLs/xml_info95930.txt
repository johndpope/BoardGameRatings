			<description>In this game, two players are theoretically nations competing in seven named areas. However, the game is highly abstracted, with each area represented by a track. Each player has seven cards which are secretly allocated to the areas each turn. The player allocating the higher card to an area (with the values wrapping around) moves a marker one space closer to their end of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to win four of the seven areas by getting their markers to your end of their tracks. Markers on shaded spaces move double, and markers reaching an end don't move again. Cards are also removed when this happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
