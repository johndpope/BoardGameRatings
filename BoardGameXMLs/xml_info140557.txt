							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">20 More Unique Weapons</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue of Ooh, Shiny! includes 21 weapons, one of which is The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game only. That being said, I invite 3.5 aficionados who like it to simply make it a heavy chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in these 21 items are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brewhammers - Available in both one- and two-handed varieties, brewhammers are both respectable weapons and, more importantly, a source of fine, magically-laced stout for a dwarf on the go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: the Dwarven Homelands are not responsible for loss of life or limb resulting from party jealousy toward the excessively fine quality of the brew conjured by its Brewhammers. The Dwarven Homelands is, however, responsible for that delicious aid spell you just consumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Floating Butterfly and Stinging Bee - These paired +1 clubs grant their wielder a dodge bonus to AC and the ability to make a paralytic poison attack. With their powers combined, however, there is no end to the hilarity that can ensue, especially when the player discovers that whole &amp;quot;grow butterfly wings&amp;quot; thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mimeowands - Nothing says Gnomish construction like a wand that can't make up its mind. Mimeowands remember the identity of the last spell its owner has cast. Accordingly, it becomes a wand of that spell until another spell is cast, at which point it copies THAT spell instead! Careful planning will allow for extension of a caster's favorite spells. Poor planning will result in swearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spellswallower - A classic concept tweaked and rebalanced the Interjection Games way, this keen shortsword has the ability to absorb the spells of those it strikes, thus giving its master the ability to cast those spells himself. Wielder beware! Though Spellswallower is awash in raw power, clever tactics by the target of this weapon can force it to be unable to come back for a second helping anytime soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ooh, Shiny &amp;ndash; 20 More Unique Weapons is an OGL licensed supplement for 3rd edition D&amp;amp;D and is compatible with both 3.5 and The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
