							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlefield Haunts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunts of the Battlefield!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are few places as full of carnage and death as battlefields. Folklore and history are full of tales of haunted battlefields, and yet, perhaps because of the nature of the game, many of the haunts in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game tend to focus on more enclosed locations. This book presents eight new haunts thematically relating to war and battlefields, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase &amp;ldquo;horrors of war.&amp;rdquo; Some of the haunts in this book include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fog of war, a thick red mist that pervades battlefields, obscuring foes and driving men mad with rage.&lt;br/&gt;    Ghostly command, the voice of a long-dead general that drives living souls onwards to their dooms.&lt;br/&gt;    Hands of the dead, an army of grasping hands rising up from the ground to drag down those who disturb their unmarked graves.&lt;br/&gt;    Spectral charge, a massed cavalry assault of ghostly knights that defend a patch of ground well after their death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
