			<description>A target game where bombs are loaded into a bomber and then dropped over a board in an attempt to hit the targets.  The game comes with a wood bomber and 4 plastic &amp;quot;bombs&amp;quot; with metal points on the tips of the bombs (similar to tips of darts).  A color lithograph board depicts topographical &amp;quot;targets&amp;quot; with various point values assigned to them.  Each player takes turns dropping their load of bombs on the board and scores points based on what targets they hit.  The game is not dated, but it may be post-WWII, perhaps in the 1950's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
