			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MMMMMM is a puzzle game based on a gravity-flipping mechanic similar to that used in VVVVVV.  The player has the ability to walk left and right and to set the change the direction of gravity to point away from the surface the player is currently touching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the player is to travel through a maze collecting trinkets while avoiding the lethal spikes.  A checkpoint system is used to minimize the cost of player death.  Significant to the game is that both time and space are broken into discrete chunks, which puts the focus on solving puzzles and not on reflexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
