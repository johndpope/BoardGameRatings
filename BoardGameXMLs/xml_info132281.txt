			<description>You score points &amp;mdash; for pairing twins, for going out first, for holding the Wide World card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE DEAL: All the cards, one at a time. Some may have an extra card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PLAY: First everyone pairs his twins, putting them face up, in his own stack. The player at dealer's left then draws a card from the player at his left, if he makes a pair, he shows it and puts it down in his stack, and draws from any other player. When no pair is made the next person to the left plays. In each turn, you draw first from the left, and then keep on drawing from anyone as long as you make pairs. Play continues until all twins are paired. If you have the Wide World card when you pair your last card, you keep it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WINNER: Scoring: 1 point for each card paired; 5 points to the first player to go out (pairing all the cards in his hand); 10 points for the Wide World card. The highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
