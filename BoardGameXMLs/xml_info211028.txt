			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbiosis explores the quest to learn healthier coping and communication skills in relationships. The characters are an alien species on the planet Saturn who subsist on stardust. In adolescence, this species is Parasitic, meaning that in order to acquire stardust, they can only extract it from their loved ones through dysfunctional strategies. As they mature, this species learns Symbiotic traits, which allow them to create new stardust together through mutual exchange and inter-dependency. In this scenario, a group of adolescents are sequestered at a retreat guided by the Gardener, a fully adult Symbiote, who facilitates their development through structured exercises. Each adolescent starts with one Parasitic and one Symbiotic trait. If adolescents are able to learn two additional Symbiotic traits by the end of the larp - for a total of three - they may leave the retreat. Otherwise, the Gardener asks them to stay and continue to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a few print-and-play components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
