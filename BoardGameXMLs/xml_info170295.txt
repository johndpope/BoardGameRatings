			<description>Foodtown Throwdown is a quick card game that takes a humorous look at modern food trends. Players compete to build the best food truck business in town by completing new takes on classic food truck fare with absurd ingredients.  Duck meat hamburgers, banana bread grilled cheese, or jelly bean nachos may end up on your menu in this light, anything goes card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to earn victory points by completing recipes, establishing their territory, and publicizing their truck. There is plenty of room for sabotage with a host of action cards that keep each player on their toes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
