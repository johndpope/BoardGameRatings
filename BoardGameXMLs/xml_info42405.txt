							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mangos Mania: The Nightmare before Christmas</name>
									
			<description>Yikes!  It's that time again -- time to create our annual Mangos Holiday Card.  Ever wonder how we do it?  Are you game?  Come play along with us as we re-create the process.  Experience the trials and tribulations, the heart aches and the triumphs.  The thrill of victory and the agony of your feet as you walk the gauntlet of the approval process, trying to make it to production before you miss the printer's deadline.  It will give new meaning to the words &amp;quot;HAPPY HOLIDAY!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
