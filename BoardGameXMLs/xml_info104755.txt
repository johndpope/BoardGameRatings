							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Destiny of Zorro</name>
									
			<description>The game will be set in the coast and desert landscape of Spanish California in the early 19th century, as the player takes the role of the hero Zorro. &amp;quot;The Destiny of Zorro draws inspiration from the Mexican, Spanish and Native Southwest American cultures prevalent in California in the early 1800&amp;rsquo;s&amp;quot; and gives the player a number of plots to play through, such as taking it up against Calavera and his troops or a power-hungry mob boss, thwarting a plot to steal a great treasure, and facing off against a rebel army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a traditional third-person action game, with cut-to sections where you use the Wii remote to execute certain moves. The Wii Remote lets the player whip, slice and perform Zorro&amp;rsquo;s signature &amp;lsquo;Z&amp;rsquo; slash move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Destiny of Zorro&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
