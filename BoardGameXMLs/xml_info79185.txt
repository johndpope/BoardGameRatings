			<description>A set collecting deck-building auction game, using the Rainbow Deck. A sister game to Boojum, which uses the same mechanics but with a Decktet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players bid on groups of cards to make sets of various descriptions. The bids are cards from the players' hands, which then get added to and become the lots for the next round of auctions. There are different types of sets to collect from familiar poker/rummy type sets like straights, flushes and full houses, to rainbow deck specific letter-based sets. The first player to collect one of each of the six set type tokens is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
