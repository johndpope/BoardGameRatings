							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buffalo Round-Up Game</name>
									
			<description>Game that appeared in the 1992 children's annual, The Desperate Dan Book. The rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howdy, folks.&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Cactusville Cattle Market and the local ranch owners are in town to buy up cattle. The biggest buy is a herd of buffalo which has been split amongst four neighbouring farmers. You have each been hired by one of the farmers, to get his share of the herd home first.&lt;br/&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s get them steers a&amp;rsquo;rollin&amp;rsquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;You will need a dice and coloured counters (coloured pieces of card will do just as well). Each player must start on their own coloured circle in the middle, the highest roll of the dice deciding who goes first. The players must follow their coloured arrow and go round the board in an anti-clockwise direction. If they land on a square with instructions on it they must follow these instructions. The winner is the first to get his or her coloured counter to the ranch of the same colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(A longer version of the game can be , played where each player has an equal amount of counters. When each throws, they can then decide which counter to move. The winner here shall be the one to get all their counters home!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
