			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once, the elves were the favorite creation of the Djinn, and for countless millenia served as immortal assistants to the elemental rulers of the Flux.  But the corrupting influence of the Shades brought about their downfall, and now the elves walk as mortals upon the material plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karmic Races:  Elves is the first in a series of supplements designed to inspire storytellers to rethink everything they think they know about the mortal races.  This compact PDF provides a wealth of information and ideas to take your campaigns in new directions.  The majority of this product is written in a system-nuetral manner, so you can take the ideas and incorporate them into your own games.  With ideas and story concepts for using elves in fantasy and modern campaigns, four different sub races, elven specific medical conditions, and advice on what to consider when adjusting your current game mechanics, Karmic Races: Elves brings a fresh perspective to this  fantasy favorite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
