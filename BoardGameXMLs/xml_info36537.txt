			<description>&amp;quot;The Strategy Game of Common Cents&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-player game was inspired by Nim - the popular game, played with piles of objects, that was invented by mathematician Charles Bouton in 1902. It appeared in the October, 1995 issue of Games Magazine, and requires 49 pennies (or other small objects).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 7x7 board filled with one penny per square, although each player removes one penny of their choice at the beginning of the game. Game play consists of players alternating turns of removing two or three adjacent pennies from the same horizontal or vertical row. The last player to be able to remove such a group wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
