							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One-Eye Pass</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villagers are running for their lives! A recent series of raids by a Cyclops is terrorizing the area. It comes from the One-Eye Pass in the Cairn Hills. Old One-Eye was a black wizard who has a tower in the area, but he has not been heard from in a decade. Several locals have been taken by the demons and a local hero &amp;quot;Praga&amp;quot; followed their trail into the hills, but has not been heard from in over 2 weeks. Will the Heroes help rid the area of this evil and rescue those lost?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
