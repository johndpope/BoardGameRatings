							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Navy Force</name>
									
			<description>Navy Force is the first web-browser based RTS strategy game with features of a Naval War. It is Free to play providing a great experience to players by allowing them to build and manage their own Naval Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 7 Nations available for the players to select from. Each Nation has unique characteristics of naval bases. After you develop your naval base by selecting a Nation and continent, it is then time for you to expand your territory by occupying Secret Islands which appear randomly. Players can interfere with others by sending troops in various ways (Fleet attacks, Air-Raids, send Spies, and Send Recons and etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navy Force plunges players into the deep end of an alternate history; protracted wars have ravaged the planet and divided the population into separate independent cultures. 70% of the land is now submerged under the sea, thanks to abrupt changes in continental plates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wars destroyed the economies and resources of every country, making trading under proper protection vital to survival. As the dependency on the sea grew, countries with long coastlines captured advantageous positions for trading, pushing for economic development and dominance based on their positioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the war ended civilization began to recover the world over, building houses and re-developing land and economies. All was looking better, until a mysterious pirate super-power appeared to break the peace, claiming to be a marine government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pirates plundered vessels, kidnapped entire crews and massacred innocent people, justifying their actions by saying there's a fee for using the sea - and everybody must pay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pirate uprising prompted the world to join forces and work together to eliminate the common enemy, creating powerful marine weapons - including submarines, aircraft carriers and huge warships - in the name of the collective mop-up operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inevitably, human natures lust for greed and self destruction was soon back. As economic and military development grew, so did the demands for more power and, soon, payback over enemies that humiliated them in the previous war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result, every countryaccelerated military build-up for the purpose of its own interests. Soon, the world was at war again, locked in a three way battle between themselves and the pirate threat they had originally vowed to eliminate together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the research of Historians, anyone who secures the legendary treasure book, The influence of Sea Power upon History - by Alfred Thayer Mahan, would dominate the world and open the future as a strong maritime power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaders dreaming of such power have shown strong commitment to own the book. With everyone fueled by a passion to find the legendary treasure and obtain rare resources, the world is again running into unforeseeable struggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything is at stake. This is more than a world war - this is 'the' world war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
