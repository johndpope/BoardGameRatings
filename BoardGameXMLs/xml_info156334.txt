							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Skeleton</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get up lazy bones, you've got work to do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you are a necromantic experiment gone wrong, a soul that escaped Death's grasp, or something else entirely, the skeleton is a chance to play something out of the ordinary...or maybe to give an unfortunate character a second chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skeleton is a made of bones but is as hard as nails, using a Bones mechanic to reduce damage, as well as create weapons, help out its allies, and more. There are a few extra pages with that give you some added insights that we learned during our playtest, what various mechanics mean, as well as some extra moves that did not quite make the cut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will things work out better this time? Will you avenge any wrongs? Will you spare someone from a similar fate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the bones, and play to find out what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
