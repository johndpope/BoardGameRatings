			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any party of heroes in Midnight must count legates as among their greatest foes, and their power does not radiate merely from authority. With power over magic and the training to wear and use arms and armor, legates are formidable foes on many levels. Their astiraxes even allow them to become formidable intelligence gatherers. Yet legates are more than simply a collection of stats and class abilities. They are all individuals, with their own complex motivations, skills, specialties, and tendencies, and moreso than the orcs or shadowspawn that the PCs in a Midnight campaign face, each legate should be unique. The following three legates are fleshed out and ready to be used as foes, plot hooks, or unexpected allies. Alternatively, they may aid DMs looking for insight into a legate&amp;rsquo;s life or ideas with which to create their own NPCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: Ties into Heart of Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
