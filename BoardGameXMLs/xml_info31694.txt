			<description>Alte Spiele -- Games of Old -- Jeux d'Autrefois&lt;br/&gt;1975 Calendar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was a 1975 promotional calendar from printing press manufacturer Roland Offset. it contained six roll-and-move style games from the 1800s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the first page:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Present-day games have contemporary goals: The imagination envisions planetary flight and the psycho tests of the psychologist are dinner table discussion. In this context, who would like to hazard his fortune on a throw of dice?

All one wanted to do at the end of the day was to relax. Television, radio, record player and cinema were unknown. The first motorists purchased their fuel at the apothecary and the operator of a magic-lantern illuminated his coloured glass slides with a kerosene lamp.
