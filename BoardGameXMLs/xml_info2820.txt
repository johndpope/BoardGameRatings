			<description>In the card game of astrological magic players hold six cards and on their turn may play up to 3&lt;br/&gt;or refuse by discarding one and replenishing from the stock. Cards come in 4 types:  signs,&lt;br/&gt;elements, planets and aspects, and are played to a row of 6 under strict rules.  When every &lt;br/&gt;player has refused to play a card, the last player to have played scores. He adds up the&lt;br/&gt;number of matches he has in columns 1-3 and multiplies by the planet number in column 4&lt;br/&gt; to receive points on paper. Then the row is cleared and this player starts a new tableau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
