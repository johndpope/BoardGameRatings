							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Ole&quot; Thousand Face</name>
									
			<description>Promotional game made by a chocolate manufacturer.&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of five rectangular boxes, printed on all sides, that combine to make funny faces. Play consists of collecting the various components to make a face. Described as a parlour game,  the game is in the grand tradition of British games like Mis-Fits and American games like Mixies.&lt;br/&gt;The box was originally filled with chocolates.&lt;br/&gt;The illustrator, Carey Orr, was employed by the Chicago Tribune as the creator of the Kernel Cootie comic strip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
