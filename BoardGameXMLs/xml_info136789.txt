			<description>The iQue Player (pronounced &amp;quot;IQ&amp;quot;) is a video game console that was manufactured by iQue, a joint venture between Nintendo and Chinese-American scientist Dr. Wei Yen. The system also goes under the Chinese name of Sh&amp;eacute;n Y&amp;oacute;u Ji (神游机), literally &amp;quot;Divine Gaming Machine&amp;quot;. Sh&amp;eacute;ny&amp;oacute;u (神游) also serves a double entendre because the term also means &amp;quot;realistic experience&amp;quot;. The console itself takes the form of the controller and plugs directly into the television. A box accessory is available that allows multiplayer gaming.[1]  At the moment, it is only marketed in mainland China, as the console's unusual game distribution method is an attempt to curb games piracy in that region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The iQue Player was first announced at the 2003 Tokyo Game Show, and it was released in mainland China on November 17, 2003. A Japanese release was rumored for mid-October 2004, but never materialized. Nintendo currently has no plans to release the iQue Player outside of China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games for this console are stored on a 64MB flash card which is contained within a cartridge that plugs directly into controller/console. Games are purchased at a special &amp;quot;iQue depot&amp;quot; where games may be downloaded onto the cartridge and played later, in a similar manner to the Famicom Disk System. Demo games that come with the iQue include The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Star Fox 64. These demos are time-limited versions of the games. Full versions of the three titles are available, as are other first party Nintendo titles such as Dr. Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, Wave Race 64, and F-Zero X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;IQue_Player&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
