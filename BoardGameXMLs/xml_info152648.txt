							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historical Turning Points: Luzerne</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never really considered a major blip in the newly-created Second Star Leagues&amp;rsquo; plan, Luzerne&amp;mdash;through simple chance&amp;mdash;became listed in the history books as one of the longest and desperate campaigns during Operation BULLDOG. The former Combine system became the defining moment for Clan Smoke Jaguar on the eve of their demise. Battered and beaten, the Clan fought tooth and nail to hold on to Luzerne even as the remains of their Occupation Zone fell in tatters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Turning Points: Luzerne looks at the pivotal battle that defined the Second Star League&amp;rsquo;s Operation BULLDOG and spelled the end of the most vicious Clans occupying the Inner Sphere. Return to BattleTech&amp;rsquo;s recent past, when the Inner Sphere&amp;rsquo;s newly-united realms embarked on their own crusade to rid themselves of Clan Smoke Jaguar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, or inserting it into their own campaigns. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the planet of Luzerne, a rundown of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-Star battles or recreate the entire gamut of Operations BIRDDOG and BULLDOG on Luzerne. Only the players&amp;rsquo; imaginations are the limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
