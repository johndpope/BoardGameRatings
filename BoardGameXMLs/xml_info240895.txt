							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Washing Lines</name>
									
			<description>Washing Lines is a set collection game where players try to score the most points by hanging out wet laundry items on their washing line and, when dry, putting them in their basket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a small element of push your luck and a tiny bit of take that. The mechanic is a 2 card draw: You draw a card, decide to play it or discard it. If played then draw and discard the next card. If discarded then draw and play the second card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once either 3 laundry items of the same colour, or 5 of different colours, are hanging on the line (multi coloured, stripey, clothes being 'wild') they are dry and can be placed in the player's laundry basket to be scored at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;There are some special sets to collect for bonuses and also Event cards for various effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Washing Lines is an entry to the 2017 Children's Game Print and Play Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;A colouring-in version is also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br/&gt;Contest results:&lt;br/&gt;1st place: Best Game for Early Elementary School Children&lt;br/&gt;2nd place: Best Matching/Pattern Game&lt;br/&gt;2nd place: Best Strategy Game&lt;br/&gt;1st place: Best Colouring Book Components&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place: Best Original Artwork&lt;br/&gt;2nd Place: Children's Choice Award&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
