			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ulthuan teeters on the brink of ruin as Daemons run rampant across its Ten Kingdoms. Meanwhile, in the grim north of Naggaroth, Malekith the Witch King prepares to face his destiny once and for all. Everything you think you know about the Elves of Warhammer is changing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer: Khaine continues the epic saga of The End Times. The fate of Ulthuan is described over two softback books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer: Khaine Book 1 is a 144-page book which details the third chapter of the End Times,the final reckoning between the Elven races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warhammer: Khaine Book 2 is a 48-page rules book that contains six new scenarios and orders of battle based on the events in Warhammer: Khaine Book 1. It includes Magic of the End Times, a new spell lore available to all armies, and new army lists, allowing customers to field a unified Elven army drawn from Wood Elves, High Elves and Dark Elves to match different parts of the narrative. It also includes newly updated special character rules for Malekith the Eternity King; Tyrion Avatar of Khaine; Imrik Crown Prince of Caledor; and Alarielle Incarnate of Life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
