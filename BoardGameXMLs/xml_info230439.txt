							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Questers of the Middle Realms Second Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lighter side of traditional fantasy gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to dive into the wild, weird world of fantasy for a while without getting bogged down in lots of rules detail? Take a look inside!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The world of Median - an outline setting taking a fondly humorous look at fantasy gaming standards.&lt;br/&gt;    The PDQ System - a simple, fast and flexible set of rules emphasising story more than tactics, and easy to pick up for a quick game.&lt;br/&gt;    A &amp;quot;build your own&amp;quot; approach - use the framework and add the gods, organisations and character types your gaming group wants in your stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second edition, eh?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questers originally came out back in 2006, using Chad Underkoffler's super-simple PDQ system. This is a revision and repackage really, but '2e' seemed more fitting as a nod to those classic fantasy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The rules are pretty much unchanged. (I removed Virtue and Vice, and may have clarified a couple of things.)&lt;br/&gt;    The main change is the layout, changed from Letter to Trade. There's been a print edition available through another outlet, but the format didn't work very well and I've long wanted a nicer one available here.&lt;br/&gt;    It's had another editing pass, and the sections have been reorganised to match 'Jaws' (which benefitted from the lessons learned with Questers!).&lt;br/&gt;    It's pulled in the mini-supplements Character Assistant and Ten Magical Thingies.&lt;br/&gt;    The art has kept some pieces, lost some and gained some new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
