			<description>From Publisher Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexover is a fun and fast moving new strategy game of reversing momentum. Hexover takes a new twist on play pattern with roots dating back to England is the 19th century. The play pattern, which consists of trapping and flipping opponents disks, is familiar to people worldwide who have played Reversi. The object of Hexover is to be the first player to complete a string of five disks in their color on the white hexagons on the game board, with at least one game piece being positioned on the outside row. Because of the hexagonal shape of the game board, players have to stay alert to all of directions impacted by each move. Hexover is a game of planning, positioning and rich strategy. The obvious move, may not be the best! The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Hexover is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
