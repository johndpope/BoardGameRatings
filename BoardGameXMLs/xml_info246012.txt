			<description>Как стать Жучиной (How to become a Bug) is about the best bug-scout academy graduates, who are trying to pass their final examination in a wilderness camp. Tutors set the difficult task for them: the young bug-scouts should search the wilderness and find the firewood for the alarm bonfires. The squad who lit their bonfire first would be the winners. The problem is while searching for the wood all the colourful bug-scouts got all abroad. And now every beetle claims about what bonfire should be lit first. To work out the winner fair and square bug-scouts settled the distinct rules of lightning the bonfires. Meanwhile the goal remains the same: whoever light his alarm bonfire is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 6 decks consisting of the identical cards, but with different images on the back of the card, 6 &amp;quot;bonfire&amp;quot; cards representing goals and 30 small &amp;quot;ember&amp;quot; cards to count victory points. During game players place his or her cards in the shared stacks face down. When every player put 3 of his cards on the table, the stacks are revealed, and the bugs are counted to match certain color-combination printed on one of the &amp;quot;bonfire&amp;quot; cards. Whoever have this bonfire card gets victory points for the round. 3 kind of active cards affect other cards in its stack to add a strategic component to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
