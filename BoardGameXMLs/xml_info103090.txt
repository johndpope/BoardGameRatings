			<description>In Lecker oder Gemecker! players want to feed animals the food they like best, earning coins as they do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, six animal cards are placed in a circle, then one plate of three different foods (out of six total) is placed in the hole on each animal card. These three foods are in three sizes: small, medium and large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player rolls the die, then everyone races to place their hand on the animal that most wants the food rolled, i.e., the animal who has that food largest on its plate. The player who does this first wins a lion coin, then places a food tile in this animal's plate to show that it's been fed. If that same food is rolled again later, players must locate the plate where that food is medium-sized. Since this animal is also fed, ona third roll you find the animal who has the small version of this food. On a fourth roll of this food, you race to grab the Glutton character in the center of the circle, removing all the food tiles of this type after doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect five lion coins wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lecker oder Gemecker! includes five variants, some of which are simple play variations while one is more involved, using the obverse of the lion coins, most of which have a special rule that affects which food or animal players need to find after the die is rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
