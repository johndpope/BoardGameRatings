			<description>In harbours you see ships which are moored to the jetties and quays with thick ropes and complicated knots. These knots were developed by seamen a long time ago and are still used to this day. Each knot has its own special function and meaning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Knot Game you learn more about the knots and you can lay as long a rope as possible in your colour. Up to four players can take part in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Knot Game is a tile-laying game. Each tile shows a rope, or two (differently coloured) ropes knotted together. The players start the game with four tiles. Each turn, a player may add tiles to those already on the table in order to inecrease the lenght of one of the ropes depicted. At the end of his turn, the player draws new tiles to replace the ones he has played. The game ends when all tiles have been drawn. Each player then gets one more turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is secretly assigned a colour. The player that has the colour of the longest rope that has been created wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
