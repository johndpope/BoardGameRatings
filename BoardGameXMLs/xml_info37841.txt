			<description>&amp;quot;Each player takes the role of an (American) Indian Brave (Young Warrior). Players compete to accumulate prestige by their deeds.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck of cards. There are nine types of cards in the deck: Tribe, Weapon, Dress, Approach, Coup, Hunt/Trade, Luck, Spirit, and Trade. The cards are used to engage in various activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect Eagle Feathers by participating in raids, which come in four different types: Horse Raids, War Parties, Revenge Raids, and Pipeholder Raids. Players may also hunt, hold tribal gatherings, and trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: The first player to accumulate 28 Eagle Feathers has enough to make his Warbonnet and wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
