			<description>This game was produced in a small print run in 2004 but never reached a major publisher.  According to the designers' website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.ripperopoly.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ripperopoly.com/&lt;/a&gt;), pre-orders of the game were shipped to buyers.  The trademark of the game and 75 copies were purchased in 2006 by Ken Chapman who sold copies via eBay.  The game no longer appears to be supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designers' website:&lt;br/&gt;RipperOpoly&amp;trade; is a property buying game where up to six players move around the board trying to gather enough money to rent or buy a Doss House (Flophouse to our American enthusiasts) where they can stay safely through the night. All the properties are the locals or actual addresses of Ripper victims, suspects, or establishments central to the Ripper killings.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
