			<description>The final mission against the Master Brain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AD 2488. A long war has put human race on the edge of self-extinction. Four years ago, a space creature known as Master Brain arrived with the promise of a new dawn. Now, a huge army launched an attack to the few cities that are still on, following the plan of the creature. A small group of soldiers have formed an alliance to defend those cities and kill the master brain. This games tells the story of their final mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8bit killer is an action first person shooter styled to resemble a NES game in look and feel. 32x32 pixel textures, 64 color nes palette and 1bit sounds make this game look like an early 90s game. The soundtrack has been created by the genius RushJet1. The story, characters and scenes are inspired by films like Mad Max or 2013: Rescue in LA and by games like Contra, Megaman, Bionic Commando, Metroid, Catacomb 3D or the sequel Wolfenstein 3D, and many others...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
