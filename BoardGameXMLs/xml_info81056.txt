			<description>Super Hunchback (スーパーハンチバック) is an early Game Boy game. Published by Ocean, it is a sequel to their 1984 conversion of the 1983 Century Electronics arcade machine Hunchback  and features many similar obstacles. It is notable for its high level of technical accomplishment. The title screen bears a 1991 copyright, the cartridge label records the year as 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured a series of levels, each divided into five sections. The player, as Quasimodo, could advance from one section to the next by locating and ringing a giant bell. Progress is hindered by obstacles such as cannonballs (which can be ridden but will catapult Quasimodo across the screen if he takes a side hit), arrows, bubbles, swinging ropes and rolling logs. Some sections feature water portions. There is an emphasis on hidden sections and on quick play - losing a life causes the player to be returned to a nearby location with no break in gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Super Hunchback , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
