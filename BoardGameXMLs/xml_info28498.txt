			<description>Meta is a gaming system, consisting of a 10x10 board that may be laid down or stood upright and 44 wooden tokens in 3 colors. The 8 dark green tokens are identical on both sides, but the yellow and light green ones have a dot on one of their sides. The components are of excellent quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system comes with four games:&lt;br/&gt;Menos: an evolution of solitaire where the player jumps over the pieces to remove them (for one player).&lt;br/&gt;Esca: a five-in-a-row game, where the board stands upright with the two players on either side. Players try to make 2 5-in-a-rows by placing their tokens, blocking and removing enemy tokens.&lt;br/&gt;Tremplin: a chinese checkers sort of game where players try to reach their respective goals by jumping over pieces. (2 configurations: for 2 or 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;Arriba: an original concept where the board is positioned at an angle. Players try to reach the top row but the holes become deeper and deeper towards it, so multiple tokens have to be positioned in the holes to create stepping stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
