			<description>From the developer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microsoft Research has launched The Path of Go, an Xbox Live Arcade game based on &amp;lsquo;Go&amp;rsquo;, the ancient Chinese board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go is a strategy game that is at least 2,500 years old and originated from Ancient China. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not known exactly when the game was invented, by the 3rd century BC it was already a popular pastime. The game is played by two players who take turns placing black and white stones on the vacant intersections of a grid. The objective of the game is to control a larger portion of the board than the opponent. It is a game that takes minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
