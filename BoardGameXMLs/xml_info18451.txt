			<description>&amp;quot;Players act out 'hang-ups' to develop sensitivity to racial attitudes and the tendency to think in terms of racial stereotypes. As stressful situations are encountered on the game board, players pantomime the 'hang-ups' for other players to identify . . . Based on the premise in The Nature of Prejudice, by Gordon W. Allport.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Age or grade: High school to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials: Instructor's manual, players' manuals, game board, three sets of cards, clue lists, playing tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed by uncredited employees of Synectics Education Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
