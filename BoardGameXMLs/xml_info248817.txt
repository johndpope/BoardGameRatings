							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Orders of Chivalry (fan expansion to Carcassonne)</name>
									
			<description>If the player places a chivalry tile onto a city that he has occupancy in, he may exchange one follower of his own colour for another of his own colour. For example, a Yellow regular Knight is deployed in a city. On his turn, Yellow draws and lays a chivalry tile that extends his already occupied city. He may now exchange the regular Knight in this city for another legal&lt;br/&gt;follower.1,2 It is irrelevant how many players occupy the city or who has the majority in that city at the time of exchange. An exchange occurs instead of &amp;lsquo;moving the wood&amp;rsquo;3 and must take place at the time of laying the chivalry tile.&lt;br/&gt;The idea of exchange is one of promotion or demotion. Knights who served their position well might be honoured to a higher Order. Those who neglected their duties could be stripped of their title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approved by carcassonnecentral and carcassonne-forum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
