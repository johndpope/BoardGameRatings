			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mystery Of Arkham Manor is an adventure game in which the player investigates strange events in a country manor. The player must write articles and send them back to the London Chronicles to earn money, and try to keep a high enough Sanity score. The game is split in two parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Arkham village, June 23, 1924&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something fishy's going on here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can't put my finger on it - yet - but already I've got a feeling that things aren't what they seem in this sleepy backwater. Something terrible's about to happen...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, I'd better file my first article. The editor of the London Chronicle has issued me with one of those new-fangled plate cameras  to photograph events and suspects, and he expects me to send  in full-page layouts, complete with headlines and pictures! He reckons this could be the news story of the century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is, if I stay alive long enough to write it...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
