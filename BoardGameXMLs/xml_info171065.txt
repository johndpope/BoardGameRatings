			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Old School Gaming Action!  Delve! Zine is back with this special edition adventure Lost Lair of the Lizard Laird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once, a great and hidden kingdom prospered in the heart of the jungle.  The lizardfolk of the Great Steaming Jungle were presided over by the powerful Lizard Laird Gungwa Tsrok, who drew tribute from the various lizardfolk jungle tribes and also traded with some of the human tribes that dwelt at the edge of the jungle.  For many years, the lizardfolk prospered under the strong leadership of the Lizard Laird.  However, many years ago, the kingdom fell into decline as the Lizard Laird of the kingdom of Saralan Smasah disappeared and access to the kingdom of Saralan Smasah was closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, rumors have grown up about the fabled wealth of the kingdom and a horrible plague that brought it down.  The adventure begins with the party held captive by the lizardfolk.  Tsoraz Tsoraz, the tribal shaman visits with the adventurers and informs them that they have trespassed upon the borders of the lizardfolk.  The tribe is willing to release them and forgive the party&amp;rsquo;s trespass if they will perform a task on behalf of the tribe.  Tsoraz Tsoraz believes that he has found one of the entrances to the upper halls of the great kingdom of Saralan Smasah &amp;ndash; the Upper Halls of the Sun and Stars.  If the party can recover the Scale Heart, one of the Lizard Laird&amp;rsquo;s badges of office believed to have been part of the treasury at this site; then the party will have earned the gratitude of the tribe and be free to go.  If not, then they may well find themselves invited to dinner &amp;ndash; as part of the menu!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
