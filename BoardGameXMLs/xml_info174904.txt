			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Slag-Heap is a three-story tall entertainment venue located in the center of the massive Lonely J scrapyard. As one approaches the Lonely J from the road they can see nothing but towering walls of crushed vehicles. It is only when a person reaches the gated entrance that they notice something strange. The driveway acts as a perfect bottleneck by forcing all traffic into a single file. On the right is a poorly hidden assault cannon trained on the gates and a pair of heavily armored guards patrols the opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is only after one is allowed to pass through the yards rusty gates that they begin to feel the deep rumble of powerful speakers from further in the scrapyard. The vibrations threaten to send the wreckage spires tumbling down at any moment. Strange flickering lights and powerful strobe lights create deep shadows across the yard and conceal all manner of hidden danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber8s The Slag Heap is a cyberpunk location for use with the Crazy 8s Rules-Lite Universal Game Engine and the Cyber8s setting expansion. This sourcebook provides multiple adventure hooks for a Cyber8s game and introduces a new setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
