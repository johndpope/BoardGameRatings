			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;My lord,&amp;quot; said the man in the dark room. &amp;quot;I give you the most incomprehensible gift. A gift that even kings and princes will envy. I understand your hesitation, but the time has come.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years later, he remembered the man, even as he finished his part of the ancient ritual. So much had happened. He closed his eyes. He felt tired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Friday, October 13, 1307, all members of the Templars in France are arrested and accused of heresy. Despite intense interrogations, executions and unrestrained torture, none of the arrested knights reveal the secrets of the order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
