							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mazinga Z alla riscossa</name>
									
			<description>Doctor Inferno and his ally, baron Ashura want to dominate the world thanks to their evil robots. Mazinga Z is the earth defender and he will have to struggle to defeat the evil enemies. In the game you are Rio and you will pilot Mazinga Z to lead him toward the final clash and defeat Dr. Inferno. If you're the first defeating him you will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play:&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into two different phases: during the first Rio has to reach Mazinga's head, in the second there are the fights against the evil space monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st phase:&lt;br/&gt;Roll the roulette and advance on the board, along the path to reach Mazinga's head. Avoid Ashura's areas: she will make you go back, while if you meet Aphrodite nothing will affect your way.&lt;br/&gt;Every player reaching Mazinga's head will immediately move its pawn to the Rio piloting area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd phase:&lt;br/&gt;There is a new path to afford and Mazinga's cards now will drive your game-play, determining victories or defeats during the fights. The roulette still brings you forward toward Dr. Inferno.&lt;br/&gt;To win fights you must draw Aphrodite's cards. Moreover while in a Aphrodite's area you are protected against Ashura evil effects. If you are in a Ashura o Space Monster area you will suffer of the penalties of these monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory conditions:&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to reach Dr. Inferno and defeat him drawing an Aphrodite card. Otherwise step back and let the other players try to win&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
