			<description>Dark Heaven: Apocalypse (DH:A) is a miniatures game set in the fantasy world of Adon.  Players assume the roles of commanders of armies of fantastic races such as humans, vampires, dwarves, elves, etc., fighting among themselves and against the ultimate villains, the Dire-Dead, who are led by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In DH:A, the 10-sided die is used to generate the random results to determine the outcome of battles, spells, and incidents.  Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.  Rules also cover artillery, morale, chariots and elephants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battles are split into turns, which are further split into class movement phases (where increasingly more mobile units act ahead of slower ones).  During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.  Individual figures can be grouped together with a leader in combat, supporting their leader in its fight and dying together with it if its roll fails against an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winning conditions for a battle can include total destruction of the enemy, seizing an objective, or fleeing the battlefield after being surrounded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
