			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for characters of 10th-12th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Returning home from your most recent adventure, you find yourselves in the alpine hamlet of Feldspar. This small, sleepy village makes its living from the sale of lumber, animal skins, and most importantly, its small silver mine. Feldspar is not unlike a dozen or more other hamlets you've traveled through in the course of your adventures. The only thing it really has going for it is its inn, the Mountain Pine. Haddy Lowbon, the Mountain Pine's proprietor, is notorious for his strong ale and hot meals. The inn's rooms are also well regarded by travelers, with comfortable beds stuffed with fresh straw and thick quilts to ward off the mountain chill. As you trudge into town after another long journey, you welcome the prospect of at least one night of warmth and comfort in the welcoming inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
