							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">V. L. C.: Very Large Creature</name>
									
			<description>In the 27th century, earth faced a pollution problem of monumental proportion.  To combat this problem, a new breed of genetically engineered creatures was created.  These creatures could consume pollutants and scrap materials (they are also designed to be cute and machine washable).  Unfortunately, some of these VERY LARGE CREATURES, or V.L.C.'s have gone rogue and are now eating cities.  Can you stop them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VLC allows you to take your stuffed animals and wage war with them against your miniatures.  Because of the nature of the VLC world, any minis are usable, from fantasy, to 20th century soldiers, to futuristic vehicles and aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player controls the V.L.C. bent on eating another city.  The other player plays the cities inhabitants, militia and army forces.  These troops are armed with swords, spears, rifles, ray-guns or whatever you can find in the way of army men or other minis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't worry, the V.L.C.'s don't eat people, and if a V.L.C. is destroyed, its unique biology allows it to reform after the game.  This makes combat a non-lethal affair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So take that teddy bear, rabbit, Cthulu or whatever stuffed animals you have, and reek some havoc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
