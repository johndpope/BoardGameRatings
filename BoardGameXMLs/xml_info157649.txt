							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Providence Hotel</name>
									
			<description>website blurb&lt;br/&gt;A Monsters and Other Childish Things scenario starring little Howie Lovecraft and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;Grand Providence Hotel is a scenario for Monsters and Other Childish Things. The scenario has been designed to be played with the pre-generated characters included. These characters include 4 children and 4 monsters. For an eight player game each player plays a single character (either a monster or a child). With 4 players each players should play one of the children and the monster of the player sitting next to them. In the eight player game there is a danger that the monsters may outshine the children so the GM should pay special attention to creating opportunities for the children to get &amp;ldquo;spotlight time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Background:&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in The Grand Providence Hotel, in New York 1900. The Grand Providence was originally built by the grandfather of the current proprietor, Joseph Ward. Joseph Ward was a powerful sorcerer and designed the Hotel using his knowledge of unnatural geometry so that the architecture of the building would warp the surrounding reality, making it easier to contact the extra-dimensional horrors with whom he did business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
