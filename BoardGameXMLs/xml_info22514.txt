			<description>From the cover:&lt;br/&gt;THE BUCCANEERS, a Seafaring Game of Adventure for 2 to 6 players, based on the popular TV program, is a game of strategy and skill that youngsters of 7 to 15 find absorbing get-together fun. The friendly rivalry of &amp;quot;Pirates&amp;quot; against &amp;quot;King's Men&amp;quot; offers the exciting competitive play recommended by child psychologists for growing-up years. Every game plays differently and is bound to capture the attention of even the most active children for a period of quieter play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning moves on the action-packed &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; board in order to capture the most &amp;quot;Buccaneer Treasure&amp;quot; develops mental concentration and encourages social responsiveness through the opportunity for team play. Ideal for an after-school get-together, family play hours and other recreational moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships move from their own Start Corner to their own Finish Corner by role of dice. Along the path if they land directly on a &amp;quot;Pick up Treasure&amp;quot; space, they may do so. Treasure chests are vary in value and the value remains secret until the game ends. If they land directly on one of their opponent's ship, they &amp;quot;Cannonade&amp;quot;, taking off a mast from the opponent's ship. If all three masts are removed, the ship is sunk and any treasure it had goes to the other side. The game ends when all of the Treasure Chests have been sailed off the board or one side has all of its ships sunken. Winner has the greatest value from their treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
