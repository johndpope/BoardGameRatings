							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pacal</name>
									
			<description>King Maya Pacal was born on March 26th 603 a.c. from Mrs. Zuc Kuk. Nobody knows Pacal&amp;rsquo;s real name. He was called Pacal in many writings in order to show everybody that he was a person because his armor was found after a war and in the Mayan language armor is called Pacal. This king had a throne and he was in charge for over 68 years. Now there has to be a successor, and the players have to build their pyramid. The greatest value has to be upside and the lowest has to be on the base ascendant sorted from left to right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;s going to build his pyramid first and will be the new king?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
