							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Off World Colonies</name>
									
			<description>In the early 21st century the Rytell Corporation created the first androids, vat-grown, speed aged, altered humans with a shortened lifespan. These androids, and the cheap disposable labor they represented paved the way for the exploration of space and Earth&amp;rsquo;s first &amp;ldquo;Off World Colonies&amp;rdquo;. Mining corporations soon began to exploit the riches of the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In Off World Colonies players pilot mining ships in the asteroid belt finding resources needed for a depleted, desperate Earth. Players will use androids for labor and defensive armies on their mining claims. Beware the new generation of Androids - Naxos 7 - resent their lower class status and have begun to revolt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Off World Colonies is a game for 1 to 3 players lasting 20-30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have 3 action points (AP) to spend each turn in the game (in a 2 or 3 player game, the 2nd and 3rd player each get one additional AP for their first turn). Players may earn more APs as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can land on an asteroid, orbit the comet or dock at PKD Station and remain there for multiple turns if they desire. Only one player may mine any one asteroid at any one time. Multiple players may be orbit the comet or be docked at PKD Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player&amp;rsquo;s turn they may do one or more of the following, spending their AP:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Stake a Claim&lt;br/&gt;    Mine an Asteroid&lt;br/&gt;    Refuel&lt;br/&gt;    Refine Fuel&lt;br/&gt;    Defense&lt;br/&gt;    Claim Jump&lt;br/&gt;    Attack&lt;br/&gt;    Process Resources&lt;br/&gt;    Buy Upgrades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game androids are blind drawn from the game bag by players. If all players have completed a single turn and none have purchased any androids during that time, the first player must blind draw an android from the game bag and place it on PKD station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the number of white Naxos 7 Androids have been drawn from the bag (3 - 1 player, 4 - 2p, 5 - 3p), the androids begin their revolt and take over the asteroids and the comet, preventing players from using them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a specific number of tiles have been flipped over either due to being mined out or take over by the Naxos 7 Androids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1 player = 5 tiles&lt;br/&gt;For 2 players = 6 tiles&lt;br/&gt;For 3 players = 7 tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest number of credits is the winner. In the case of a tie, the player with the greatest number of androids (in the Cryopod and on any asteroids) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
