							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chips Olympiade</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the traditional concept where you flip a plastic chip by pushing its edge with another chip. However, the author has added an entire sports stadium with different disciplines, which are very well designed. For the high jump, for instance, you actually have to flip your chip over a bar that is raised each round. There are also more jumps and different running competitions. For each of these you can gather points which determine the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
