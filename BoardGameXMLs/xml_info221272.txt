			<description>Erica Page is an ordinary teenage girl, just trying to fit in. She&amp;rsquo;s also trapped in a mansion haunted by a 200 year-old curse. You know, the normal stuff. Help her explore the huge, creepy, and not exactly empty mansion, revealing its darkest secrets and hopefully a way out. There are clues to decipher, tools to collect, and puzzles to solve. If all else fails, Erica can beat the goo out of supernatural nasties with an arsenal of clubs, knives, and swords. Oh, did we forget to tell you? Erica has to escape by dawn, or she&amp;rsquo;ll become the next ghost in the mansion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
