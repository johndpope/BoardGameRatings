							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magica Tenebrae</name>
									
			<description>Family, friends, moral sense, tranquility: you knew you had to lose everything in exchange for forbidden magic. But now you must obey the whims of a demon prince ... You will have to leave your den, avoid the inquisitors and use your powerful spells to face many dangers. Is your soul permanently corrupt or is there another way? Your destiny will depend on your choices, because the hero is you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magica Tenebrae is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
