							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Spinners</name>
									
			<description>Players in Space Spinners need to be the first to load their fuel payload into the spaceship because if they do, they'll be the one to launch the ship and win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has five colored fuel balls, a landing pad, and a &amp;quot;spinner ship&amp;quot;. With everyone playing at once, players place one or more fuel balls on their landing pad, place their spinner ship over these balls, then moves their ship in circles so quickly that centrifugal force holds the balls up and doesn't let them fall through the hole in the bottom of the spinner ship. Place your ship on top of the mother ship and let your fuel balls fall inside; if someone else places a spinner on top of yours, you're pinned until their fuel is loaded, so you want to get in and out as quickly as possible &amp;mdash; but that's tricky to do because if you don't spin your ship quickly, your fuel will eject before you've reached the mother ship!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you drop a ball, you pick it up, then place it on your landing pad later for another go. Whoever loads her fuel first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
