			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero of Silvergate is a text game where you take on the role of a knight who lives in a fantasy version of medievalesque Europe. What kind of hero you become will be decided by your choices. A bloody handed warrior that wins wars is as likely as the paragon of honor revered for his fairness. I have chosen to use the Choice Script programming language for this game as it is tailor made to facilitate this kind of storytelling. It allows for the manipulation of statistics and for customizing the text and choice based on previous events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web site required to play this game appears to be no longer available.  However, the javascript and browser package can be downloaded (as a ZIP archive) and installed locally to enable game play for tech-savvy users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
