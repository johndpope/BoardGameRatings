							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World of Tales from the Crypt</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, kiddies, to my cozy Crypt. Have I got a story for you! It's time for another terror tale from your old pal, the Cryptkeeper &amp;mdash; only this one stars you and your fiendish friends! It's a sickening little saga that promises to plunge you into malice, madness, murder and mayhem! So take a seat, boils and ghouls, the show's about to start... the credits are rolling... and it's curtains for you! Hehehehehehe! &lt;br/&gt;From out of the Cryptkeeper's &amp;quot;die-brary&amp;quot; comes a roleplaying game guaranteed to provide frightseekers with twisted tales, sickening stabs at suspense, and chucnks of chilling charnel chatter. The Cryptkeeper is looking for someone to play with, so he's sending you and your players spiraling into a world of blood curdling horror, in search of sinister secrets, murderous mysteries, artifacts too awful to name, and the answers to his own &amp;quot;cryptic&amp;quot; riddles. The rules of his little game are simple: win... or die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His players are people with dark secrets, hidden fears, and here and there a hint of madness. Dropped into strange settings (and sometimes other bodies), they must confront countless horrors, all the while at the mercy of the Cryptkeeper ... and the Cryptkeeper has no mercy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this WorldBook are tips on designing and running Tales from the Crypt adventures and campaigns, new background options, new skills, source material on the terrifying little town of Gainesford, adventure hooks, character templates, and a mini-adventure, &amp;quot;Circus of Souls&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must have MasterBook to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
