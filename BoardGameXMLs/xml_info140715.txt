							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Giant&#039;s Footprints Game</name>
									
			<description>Game that appeared in the 1988 Rupert Fun book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;This game is played on the footprints in the two ovals. First copy the two green footprints on thin card so that they can be cut out separately and used for counters. Next make a cardboard top, as shown on the right, and push a used matchstick through the centre to make it spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player chooses the track marked L, and the other the track marked R, Each places his counter on the correct green footprint at the start. Take turns to spin the top. The number which rests on the table tells you how far you may move. Sooner or later one of you will land on the green footprint of your track. If the other player&amp;rsquo;s next turn takes his counter on to the other green footprint, he has made a &amp;ldquo;pair&amp;rdquo; and so wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
