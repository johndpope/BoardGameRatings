			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;In BasketDudes, you will create your basketball team by recruiting players from the World Basketball Clubs. Each player has a name, a background and a specific set of skills that define his role within a BasketDudes team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using points earned in the game, or by paying with virtual money, you can get new players for your team and personalize them while they are on your team. You can also equip your players in many different ways, improving their skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the diversity of players and equipment, you can create different types of teams: defensive, offensive, balanced, based around a star player, etc. In order to create a great team in BasketDudes, you will have to learn in which way each character plays best, what his strengths and weaknesses are, and you will have to work on improving his skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
