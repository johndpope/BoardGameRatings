							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HexCON</name>
									
			<description>HexCON has a board of 4x4 hex-diamonds of 4 hex side length and a scoring hex-diamond of the same size. Each hex diamond is called a subboard. 2 sides of each subboard are associated with the color white and 2 with the color black. The subboards are alternating in the direction of these sides on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal:have the biggest connected area of subboards&lt;br/&gt;How:connect the sides of your color of a subboard to win it. Placement of stones in the subboard determines where your opponent can place the next stone on the board. When you win a subboard you get a bonus turn in which you can place your stone freely anywhere on the board. That stone determines the subboard for your opponents turn. It is possible to chain such wins. Is it impossible for a player to place a stone in a certain subboard, she can place her stone freely on the board. Won subboards are marked on the scoring board in player color.&lt;br/&gt;Game end: as soon as one player controls an area on the scoring board that can not be surpassed in size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
