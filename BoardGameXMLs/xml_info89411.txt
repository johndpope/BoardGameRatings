			<description>This is an economic simulation game where each player is the manager of a multinational company. These companies produce and sell the same good (but in different styles and qualities) in 4 different regions (North/South America, Europe, Asia). Each game year the players will need to make important investment decisions (such as constructing or shutting down shops/factories worldwide, buying/selling shares, paying dividends), select a viable and efficient production plan, try to fulfill it and finally convert their production to sales. Also, they will have to look at the competition and through research try to push their efficiency even further. Simultaneously, local providers will also offer their products and &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; a share of the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in reality selling does not come easily. Each region will have a specific demand for the homogenous good (but in different quantities and styles) and a specific preference for quality and style. Considering these factors and of course the price, players will try to manipulate the markets. Demand is not totally known, however there is always a way to know better and possibly &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; the knowledge of the competitors at the last moment. Difficult decisions and a bit of luck will define the actual sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to make profits not only for the money but also for their share price. Otherwise they will have to pay dividends if they want to keep the share price from declining. Loans are limited, costly and should not be taken lightly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is unlocked by profitability and is measured by share price. Thankfully, no ownership changes are taking place in this game (it is assumed that the initial number of shares represent less than 50% of the company).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The managers' desicions include all the main aspects of running a business:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- How much to produce and where&lt;br/&gt;- How much to stock, sell and where&lt;br/&gt;- What price to set in each region&lt;br/&gt;- How many retailers to develop in each region&lt;br/&gt;- What style of goods to produce and what quality to maintain&lt;br/&gt;- How many workers will be employed and with what wage&lt;br/&gt;- How much will be spent on advertising (pay for more demand information?)&lt;br/&gt;- What mix of owned, private and public capital will be used&lt;br/&gt;- How production and sales will be spread worldwide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not an easy game to win and in fact, it is more difficult to win the better your opponents are. But, still, it is a great mind challenge and a highly realistic answer to the multimillion euros quaestion: how successful a manager can you be?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
