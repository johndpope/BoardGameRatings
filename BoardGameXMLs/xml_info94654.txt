			<description>Kinetica is a futuristic racing game for the PlayStation 2. It was the first game to use the Kinetica game engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinetica is set in the future versions of Earth's major cities, outer-space, and some fictional locations in the Earth's distant future. Nine racers compete whilst wearing &amp;quot;Kinetic Suits&amp;quot;, which have wheels on the hands and feet, giving racers the appearance of motorcycles. Kinetic Suits have the ability to scale walls and ceilings, the vehicles are capable of reaching terminal velocity and beyond, reaching speeds of over 350 miles per hour (560 km/h).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is the same as any racing game; be the first to cross the finish line. There are fifteen tracks and three seasons in the game. In order to progress through the game the player must achieve first, second, or third place in the first season races. In the second season the player must place first or second place and in the third season the player must win the race to advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's soundtrack is mostly house, breakbeat, and trance, featuring tracks by Amoebaassassin, Skope, Hybrid, Way Out West, and Meeker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kinetica&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
