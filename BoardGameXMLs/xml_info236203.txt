			<description>Time to stack your pieces high in Stack-A-Biddi, but you need to keep your pieces connected along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player has a set of eight long rectangular blocks, and on each of the four long faces of these blocks are thick black lines that travel from one edge to the other. Each player also has a set of four short blocks called &amp;quot;biddis&amp;quot;, with each biddi being one of four colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first round, one player rolls four ten-sided dice the same colors as the biddis, rerolling as necessary until at least three different numbers show. Players then race to create a single stack of blocks that includes a biddi at the height shown on the matching colored die. If the red die shows a 3, for example, then the red biddi needs to be placed on third level. What's more, you must create a continuous black line up the face of these blocks, rotating and flipping the blocks as needed to keep the line continuous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When someone has created a stack six blocks high, they end the round. Then everyone scores 1 point for each block in their stack, starting from the table up to the highest legally placed block. The player who ended the round scores 2 bonus points for each biddi that shows the smiling face on it right-side-up in their stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then complete six more rounds, stacking their blocks one higher level each round so that in the seventh round, they're placing all eight blocks and all four biddis in a stack twelve levels high. After scoring in this seventh round, whoever has the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
