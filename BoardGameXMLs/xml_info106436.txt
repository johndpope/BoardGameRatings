			<description>Super Star Force: Jikuureki no Himitsu lit. &amp;quot;Secrets of the Space Calender&amp;quot;) is a video game developed and published by Tecmo on November 11, 1986 for the Family Computer only in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the sequel to Tecmo's famous shoot 'em up arcade game, Star Force. Unlike most shoot 'em ups during the time of its release, Super Star Force is a combination of a shoot 'em up and an adventure game. Players must go back in time in order to defeat the evil Gordess. However, seven time stones must be collected from each level's hidden dungeon. The game starts in the year 2010 and players must destroy the enemies in the past so that the player can confront the final boss in the year 2137.  When the player's ship is destroyed in the air area, his score time is cut in half The highest is 99,990; which is used as currency in the dungeons and the time travel sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Star Force: Jikuureki no Himitsu,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
