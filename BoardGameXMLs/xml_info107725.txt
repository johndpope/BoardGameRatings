			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plain as the third nose on your face...you're mutating. Poor Baby. So is everyone else in your party. Deal with it. Find ways to slow it down. The Fountain of Dreams - the water - it can cure you. Rejuvinate you. You must search for it. Kill for it. Because you are the endangered species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Break into the stronghold of one of the powerful factions of this tropical wasteland. Learn the Desoto family secrets, disarm their traps, then bring them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pump the Voodoo lord for info. Get him what he wants or your screams may come true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mother Nature's mutants are a petting zoo compared to the trigger-fingered Killer Clowns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are these guys smiling? Is it that warm Florida hospitality, or is your Uzi out of ammo?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
