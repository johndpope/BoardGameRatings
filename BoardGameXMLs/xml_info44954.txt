							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Weird North</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the 128-page sourcebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cold As Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's what the cowpokes who venture north of the border say.  There's gold in them thar' hills, and more land up for grabs than there are folks who can hold it.  Besides that, the Indians are far more friendly than the Sioux to the south, and the Mounties keep this vast expanse surprisingly free of outlaws and highwaymen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the dangers are also great. Deadly blizzards, blinding whiteouts, howling winds, and white water hazards challenge even the most intrepid adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also tales of great horrors in this cold, desolate land. Legends aboud of the wi-lu-gho-yuk, swarms of flesh-eating mice that move through the snowdrifts like piranha. Others claim that those who grow so ravenous they eat of human flesh become something else - the legendary wendigo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's only one way to find out the truth, partner. Throw on a fur coat and join us as we trek across the border and into the Great Weird North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Weird North is a regional sourcebook for Deadlands: The Weird West covering Canada and Alaska and the weird things that live there. Rule sections are dual-statted both for classic Deadlands and Deadlands d20.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
