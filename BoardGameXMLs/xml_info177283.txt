			<description>Hero Keeper is a real time strategy game that will have you constructing a kingdom to attract heroes who will explore, fight, shop and quest in your realm. Heroes will buy and find equipment, potions, charms, magic books and much more that they can use to become more powerful and gain new abilities! Throughout the campaign you will be faced with fighting hordes of monster and even other Kingdoms with their own Heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alongside the campaign there is also a skirmish mode that will allow you to customise the way you play, you can fight monsters or rival kingdoms as well as play on different types of random maps. Hero Keeper supports rival kingdom AI who will build up and attract heroes the same as you would, the AI will also play differently every time having many different strategy&amp;rsquo;s to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes have different personalities for instance; Knights will occasionally rush off to do battle on their own while thieves will steal gold from your shops as well as enemy kingdoms and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
