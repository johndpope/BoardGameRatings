			<description>KOALA BROTHERS - LET'S GO HOME is a childrens memory  game based on the animated children's television series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What a mess!  The vehicles belonging to the Koala Brothers and their friends are completely mixed up and little by little, as night falls, the way home is hard to find.  Where is the scooter? Who knows where Frank and Buster&amp;rsquo;s house is?  Your mission is to help the friends to get themselves and their vehicles back to the right house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is comprised of five small boards representing the homes of the Koala Brothers and their friends. Each house has three spaces on it.  The (two) Koala brothers and four of their friends appear on six red counters and their preferred means of transport are represented on five blue counters (the koala brothers fly a twin seater plane).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game the counters are mixed up, one of the red ones removed, and the remaining ten distributed at random between the houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to roll a special die and take actions accordingly:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    If it shows a number then the player moves a piece of his choice the number of free spaces indicated on the die.  Movement can be in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    If it shows an eye the player can secretly look at a counter of his/her choice.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    If it shows an arrow the player selects a playing piece of his/her choice and turns it up so that everyone can see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also gamble tokens by secretly peeking at counters.  If the counter is at the right house then it wins tokens, if not it loses tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds until all the friends and their vehicles are face up in the right location.  The player with the greatest number of tokens is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
