			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Builder: A Guide to Designing Communities is a manual specifically designed to help guide Game Masters through the process of creating exciting and compelling urban areas and other sorts of communities and places within them for their campaigns. It is a universal resource that is not specific to any particular game system and is intended to be compatible with the needs of almost any ancient, Dark Ages, Middle Ages, Renaissance, fantasy, or other role-playing milieu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contents of City Builder were initially released in 11 different volumes (all of which were Silver or Copper bestsellers on DriveThruRPG and RPGNow) and these have been combined and expanded in this unified edition of the book. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This comprehensive, fully-illustrated book is divided into 14 sections and includes chapters on Communities and Craftsman, Entertainment, Professional, Tradesman, Mercantile, Service, Scholarly, Religious, Governmental, and Underworld places; detailed descriptions of nearly 70 different sorts of places; one to four Adventure Hooks tying in with each described sort of place; and an appendix on Guilds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
