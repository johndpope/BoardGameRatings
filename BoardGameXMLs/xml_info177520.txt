			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Old legends say that a long time ago gods lived in the great boreal forest of Canada. If one got lost in the woods, one might have seen among the trees one of their totems, which were sacred objects they used to channel their energy. The legends also say that the gods loved to play and that, every few years, they would transform the entire forest into their playground and compete for control of these totems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Borealis is an epic game of conquest in which players represent old gods of the boreal forest, trying to capture each other's totems using units with various abilities. It is played on a modular hex-based board, which is created anew at the start of each game by the players and can be transformed during it. It lasts 9 rounds, and to each round is assigned a season, summer or winter, which affects the units' movements and the arrival of reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Be the player with the most Victory Points at the end of the 9th round. At the end of each round, a Victory Point is awarded to the player who controls the most totems. If there's a tie, no Victory Point is awarded. If, at any point, a player's victory becomes inevitable because his or her point lead is greater than the number of rounds remaining, the game should end then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
