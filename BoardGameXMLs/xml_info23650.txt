			<description>Construct-A-Game: You Build It - You Play It&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maze Trap is a 3-DIMENSIONAL strategy game you color, build, then play. Move your &amp;quot;runner&amp;quot; through the maze as quickly as you can while, at the same time, trying to obstruct your opponent's runner with your &amp;quot;blockers.&amp;quot; Pieces move around maze walls, over bridges and through warp zones. The first runner to get to the finish, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
