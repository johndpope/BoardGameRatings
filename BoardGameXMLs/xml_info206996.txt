							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Postman: The Jolly Mail Game</name>
									
			<description>This spin-and-move mail delivery game consists of a board with intersecting tracks and branches, 4 &amp;quot;Mail Bag&amp;quot; playing pieces, 4 RFD (Rural Free Delivery) boxes, 4 large &amp;quot;Special Delivery&amp;quot; letters, 16 smaller Regular letters, and a Dog counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players first place the RFD boxes anywhere on a main track, and then draw one Special and 4 Regular letters. They start from the Post Office in the middle of the board, and may leave by either of two entrances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12-space spinner provides moves of 1-6. Half the spaces (1s, 3s and 5s) have an image of the Dog. Players spinning a Dog have the option of either moving their Mail Bag that many spaces, or placing the Dog in front of any address or RFD. The dog prevents delivery to that address.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must complete their Special Delivery first, and the remainder in any order. The first player to complete all deliveries and return to the Post Office wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
