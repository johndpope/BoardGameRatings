			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multiplayer fantasy text adventure that has been running for almost ten years.  Dragonrealms has a wide variety of character classes and races that can be chosen.  There is a strong emphasis on working together.  The only class that can heal cannot fight at all.  The class that can revive others cannot heal them first, and if you revive someone with horrible wounds they will die again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stats are raised with points gained from leveling skills.  Skills are leveled through usage, so you can only become a better climber by finding an area to climb that is compatible with your skill level.  The challenge becomes find an area that you can increase your skills that is not so difficult that it kills you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a lot of premium events that must be paid for to join in, and it is enforced that you remain in character while in public areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a huge variety of skills to train and monsters to fight, as well as three different currencies in use in the game.  Each area will only take one currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
