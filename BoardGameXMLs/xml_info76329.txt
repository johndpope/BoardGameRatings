							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Ship</name>
									
			<description>From The Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ottah, an Egyptian necromancer, is in league with forces that want to destroy the Empire. He has a secret&lt;br/&gt;Network of necromancers and conspirators throughout Rome. The governor of Egypt has discovered the&lt;br/&gt;plot, and has uncovered the names of the conspirators. He has commissioned a centurion to take the list of&lt;br/&gt;names back to Rome on board a merchant ship. The reason a merchant ship is being used is to preserve&lt;br/&gt;secrecy. However, Ottah learned of the betrayal of one of his men and discovered the name of the ship that&lt;br/&gt;the centurion is traveling on. He just manages to catch the ship as it is leaving the port of Alexandria, and&lt;br/&gt;he curses the ship and all on it, sending it into oblivion. Najja, one of Ottah&amp;rsquo;s assistants, is one of the&lt;br/&gt;passengers on board. He is insane, thinking that he will gain immortality if he helps Ottah destroy the ship.&lt;br/&gt;He travels with magic powder that is capable of summoning spirits of the dead. Ottah&amp;rsquo;s amulet, carried by&lt;br/&gt;Najja, is the key to removing the curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
