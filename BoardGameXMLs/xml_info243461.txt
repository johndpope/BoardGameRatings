							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antimatter Splatter</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A more dastardly alien could scarce be found than one who would wipe out an entire civilization by dropping anti-matter anti-canisters, right?  If your opinion of this alien trouble maker is the same as ours probably your first thought was, get some matter!  We say calm down.  All is not lost.  A mobile rapid splatter cannon capable of both breaking through his standard alien moving force fields and laying waste to the ever increasing number of anti-canisters is even now hovering above us.  If only our cannoneer hadn't called in sick... say, what are you doing today?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anti-Matter Splatter is 100% machine language and runs in standard 5K VIC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
