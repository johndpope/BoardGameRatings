							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Sea Lion</name>
									
			<description>Operation Sea Lion, the German Invasion of Britain never took place, but remains one of the greatest &amp;quot;What ifs&amp;quot; of the Second World War.  This scenario supplement is based on the results of the famous 1974 wargame conducted at Sandhurst under the watchful umpiring eye of Dr Paddy Griffith, with fourteen scenarios designed for company sized engagements using I Ain't Been Shot Mum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial section of the supplement looks at the German and British plans, detailing the troops involved and their means of operation.  There are then fourteen scenarios, each of which includes a colour map of the terrain, individual briefings for both sides and a set of umpire's notes for the game organiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
