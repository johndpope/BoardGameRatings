			<description>From the back of the book: At the start of a summer, four women get together to help remodel one of their homes. Each woman is near forty years old, and each has gone through a major life change recently. Some good, some bad, but for each of them it is a moment of taking stock and charting a new direction. The women are friends, and have the opportunity to be there for one another, in small ways and in large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each woman has reached the middle part of her life, not yet at menopause if that is something she will experience, but with a major portion of her life gone by now. Goals she has sought to reach have been attained, or passed her by. But this time brings new challenges, new joys and unexpected beginnings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To tell this story you will play a role playing game. Four players take the roles of the women and the group will play out events. You&amp;rsquo;ll also play other characters in the womens' lives, exploring scenes earlier in their lives and throughout this summer of change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
