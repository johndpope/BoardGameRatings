			<description>Ready to slap something quickly? Well, Quick Slap! is the game for you as it features both &amp;quot;quick&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;slap&amp;quot; in the name. The games features a deck of symbol cards, with the cards featuring 1-3 symbols in various colors and shapes, and a deck of &amp;quot;slap&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, three slap cards are revealed, each saying something like &amp;quot;Three red&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Four triangles&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Three different cards showing the same color&amp;quot;. The symbol cards are dealt out among the players, then they takes turns laying out one card at a time, with each new card covering the card that the player previously played. As soon as the cards in play match the conditions on one of the slap cards, players race to slap the slap card; the first player to do so claims the card, then a new one is revealed. (If you slap at the wrong time, you must return a previously claimed slap card.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever collects the most slap cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Slap! Deluxe includes more symbol cards, more slap cards, and a bell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
