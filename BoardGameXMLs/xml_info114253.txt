							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1st &amp; Goal: Southwest Division</name>
									
			<description>1st &amp;amp; Goal: Southwest Division, an expansion for 1st &amp;amp; Goal, contains 28 dice which make up 4 custom teams. The Dice Football League (DFL) Southwest Division includes the following teams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Las Vegas Vampires - The Vampires enter the league with the 11th ranked running game and the 14th ranked passing game, out of our 24 inaugural teams. Despite an average running game and an average passing game, the Vampires have a defense that is, well, pretty average. Coach Pete Zaria states, &amp;quot;The best thing you can say about the Vampires is that we don't suck at anything...&amp;quot; Quarterback Drew Blood had this to say: &amp;quot;You think it's easy being average? It's not like being great where you can get better. Or terrible, where you can get worse. There's a definite ceiling when it comes to mediocrity and we have reached it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Los Angeles Leopards - The Leopards enter the league with the 17th ranked running game and the 21st ranked passing game. Despite a questionable offense, the Leopards have the 4th ranked defense. Coach Anthony Detiger states, &amp;quot;Our defense wins games.  They&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; pretty good! That's our motto. Points are way overrated.&amp;quot; Defensive Lineman Oswald Matung had this to say: &amp;quot;We're gonna shake 'em and bake 'em and earthquake 'em! We're gonna rip 'em and crack 'em and heart attack 'em! That's the plan, anyway.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Oklahoma City Ogres - The Ogres enter the league with the 3rd ranked running game and the 8th ranked passing game. Sadly, despite a top shelf offense, their defense stands at 24th in the rankings. Coach Jim Locher states, &amp;quot;I won't say we have the worst defense in the league. I'll leave that up to you guys.&amp;quot; As mentioned, the Ogres do have a phenomenal running game, led by running back Izzy Foreel.  Foreel stated, &amp;quot;When you got a runner like me you don't need no defense no how.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; San Antonio Scorpions - The Scorpions enter the league with the 13th ranked running game and the 11th ranked passing game. The Scorpions have the 14th ranked defense. Coach Sal Minella states, &amp;quot;We don't believe in putting our eggs in one basket. We prefer to spread the eggs around. Anywhere you look on our team you're gonna find an egg. I like eggs. I like 'em scrambled.&amp;quot; Quarterback Juan Fordemonay had this to say: &amp;quot;You didn't talk to Coach did ya? I don't know what Coach is talking about.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
