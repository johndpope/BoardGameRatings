			<description>In Stranded, Time Machine travel takes you to great events in American history! From the Mayflower's landing at Plymouth Rock to the Wright Brothers' takeoff at Kitty Hawk. From Paul Revere's biggest date to the Gold Rush of '48. But the trick is: getting from one to the other without getting stuck! Fun and suspense mount as every move makes return to the present a little bit tougher. Simple but well-timed strategies are key to being the last remaining player and winner of the game. Fast-paced, friendly, and educational too, STRANDED is for 2 to 4 players, ages 8 to adult. Approximate playing time is 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 1 Game Board, 1 Set of Rules, 4 Movers, 1 Color Die, and 48 Colored Time Machine Circles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
