			<description>The board is set up something like a plus sign.  The center area is called &amp;quot;The Arena&amp;quot; and it is 4x4 grid with alternating black &amp;amp; white squares like a chessboard.  On each side there is a 3 x 4 &amp;quot;Safety Zone&amp;quot; which serves as the starting area for each player.  The safety zones are also arranged with alternating squares, although the squares are gray and the color of your pieces.&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move diagonally away from their &amp;quot;safety zone&amp;quot;.  No piece may enter any safety zone once it has entered The Arena. The goal is to move your pieces into the arena and create kings.  &lt;br/&gt;Initially, all pieces are &amp;quot;pawns&amp;quot; and can move only diagonally forward (away from their safety area).  Once they enter the arena, they can move diagonally in any direction but may not leave the arena.&lt;br/&gt;A player may create a &amp;quot;prince&amp;quot; by landing on an opponent's pawn with one of his pawns.  The stack of two pieces can then move either 1 or 2 spaces, still diagonally, but may move forwards or backwards.  It may not enter any safety zone (it must remain in the arena).&lt;br/&gt;A player creates a king when his prince takes a pawn or his pawn takes a prince (princes may not take each other).  A king is a stack of three pieces.  Once formed kings are removed to the scoring area.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is no possibility of additional kings being made.  The winner is the player who has the most kings.&lt;br/&gt;Note that while the game says it will play 2-4 there are no rules offered for any number other than 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
