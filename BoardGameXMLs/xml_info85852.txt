							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Big House</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prison compound sits in a section of vast empty space in Death Valley national park. The compound is on 80 acres of land and is surrounded by an electrical double wire fence with razor ribbon on top. Onlookers have described the building proper as &amp;quot;plain as a cake box.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big House is a generic prison, filled and emptied to suit your campaign needs. The Big House is a brand new facility; its opening day is the day that you insert it into your campaign world. It is up to your players to fill it. As criminals are incarcerated, fill in their names and locations on the pages provided. This will allow you to see who is sharing space with whom and also who their cells are near.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
