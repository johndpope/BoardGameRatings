							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Icons: Great Power Conversion Notes</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the ICONS Superpowered Roleplaying game was published by Adamant Entertainment in 2010, I&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of time to look it over, and to think about it, play it, run it, and talk to other gamers about their experiences with it. That led to various notes scribbled in notebooks and word processing files about different places where the game could be clarified, expanded, or improved, particularly with regard to some of the powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the introduction to Great Power points out, powers are at the heart of most superhero games, and ICONS is no different in that regard. While I set out to maintain consistency between the sourcebook and the published ICONS rules as much as possible, some changes were necessary to fulfill the sourcebook&amp;rsquo;s goal of improving and expanding the powers rules. This document provides an overview of those changes and how they may affect existing ICONS characters and what, if anything, you may wish to do to adjust characters accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notes look at the power descriptions and rules given in the ICONS Superpowered Roleplaying game book in the order in which they appear, describing any significant changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These conversion notes do not go into detail on all the whys and wherefores of the changes, nor do they address the added material in Great Power, which stands on its own and builds on the power descriptions and rules in ICONS. As with all of the rules in ICONS (all rules in all RPGs, technically), the material in Great Power is optional, and you are free to use it &amp;mdash; or not &amp;mdash; as you choose and as best suits your own games. I sincerely hope that you find both the sourcebook and these notes useful and that they help to make your games more fun and enjoyable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
