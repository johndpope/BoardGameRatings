							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alpha Blue</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Alpha Blue contains potentially offensive material in regards to sexual content, adult situations, vulgar language, mature themes, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is not only a rules light sci-fi RPG (d6 dice pools similar to both Crimson Dragon Slayer and The Outer Presence), but a campaign setting full of tables and scenario seeds.  And what is that setting?  Well, Alpha Blue is one of the most notorious space station brothels in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what makes this different than similar offerings?  Three things!  The first is humor. I've made this a fun read with hilarious, gonzo shenanigans around every corner.  The second is sex appeal.  Plenty of folks won't buy this book.  Hell, they won't even read a free PDF if it was shoved in their face.  Why?  Because some of it is raunchy, disgusting, perverted, and just plain gross.  Your welcome, skeezoids!  Third, I love old school sci-fi.  So much, in fact, that the future is seen through a 1970s and 80s perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't forget tables, tables, and more tables!  Mutations, alien quirks, funky fashion, just the right retro color palette, what's inside that asteroid, what are the scanners picking up, did you assassinate your victim, how does your therapy-bot help you cope with life among the stars, is the space station's central computer in a favorable mood, sexual fetish, weird space cocktails, etc.  A third of this book is fricken random tables!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, there's a ridiculous amount of awesome artwork and schematic designs by Glynn Seal.  Not only four individual space station maps that can combine into one mega-map but a super cool starship, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully, you enjoy using and abusing Alpha Blue as much as I enjoyed having sex with... er, I mean, creating her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
