							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power Play: Schemes &amp; Skulduggery</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why make your Power Play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You want to be a mastermind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps you have a glorious vision of world domination, or a revelation of new religion, or simply some deranged psychopathic drive. You begin the game with some grand design and some supernatural powers and connections. How you will accomplish your goals, who you will use, what you will need, and where it will all come together are dependent on your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Play is a dark, pulp-fiction styled game that revolves around a secret competition where the stakes are high and the players will go to any lengths to win. There are no allies in the world of Power Play, only pawns that have not yet outlived their usefulness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Play is a Competitive Narrative Game, which means you will use traditional RPG-style narrative actions to accomplish your goals. However, there is no game master to guide you and no team to aid you. Instead, the others at the table are interlopers on your ascension to power: Rivals to be crushed at any cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game Rules Book&lt;br/&gt;     A Bonus Scenario Book&lt;br/&gt;     57 Role, Item, and Location cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need five or more 6-sided dice, plus some scrap paper, colored pawns, and pens or pencils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
