							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gauntlet II</name>
									
			<description>The gameplay is very similar to the original Gauntlet, a topdown dungeon crawl supporting up to four players. The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick; the players being differentiated by colors. Thus, instead of having a &amp;quot;warrior&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;wizard&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;valkyrie&amp;quot; (for instance), in Gauntlet II there could be a &amp;quot;red wizard&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;blue elf&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;green warrior&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the new &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; system, new level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the playfield turned in steps of 90&amp;deg;. Level 100 was the winning design from a public competition. Other new features included the enemy &amp;quot;It&amp;quot;, which upon contact would make a player &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; and draw all enemies towards him/her. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which would occupy multiple squares and require multiple hits to destroy.&lt;br/&gt;New level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included &amp;quot;all walls are invisible&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;magic walls&amp;quot; which changed into monsters or items when hit, &amp;quot;stun tiles&amp;quot; which stunned the player, and exits which flashed from functioning to non-functioning. This sequel was also the first to feature what is now known as the Gauntlet theme tune, which resembles a simplified Baroque fugue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gauntlet II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
