							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Match Day</name>
									
			<description>Match Day was a football computer game, published by Ocean Software in 1984, originally on the ZX Spectrum and then later released on the Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, &amp;amp; Commodore 64 systems. It is the first game in the Match Day series, and the title and opening music are references to Match of the Day. It was the creation of programmer Jon Ritman, but later versions were written by other programmers - the well received Commodore 64 conversion was written by Mercury Microware, a software house consisting of two 16 year old schoolboys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This video game was the first one where large moving footballers characters could dribble, throw-in, take corners, etc on ZX Spectrum. The game uses modified sprites from a previous title Bear Bovver to create an almost isometric, but still ultimately side-on football title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Match Day,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
