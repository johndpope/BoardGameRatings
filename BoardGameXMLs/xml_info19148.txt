			<description>A quick card game for three or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Organize the cards in your hand into consecutive matched pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need: A deck of cards with four distinct suits (red, yellow, green, blue / hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds / plains, forest, mountain, island)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give each player two cards from each suit. The rank of the cards does not matter. Sort the cards in your hand so that no card is adjacent to a card of the same suit. On your turn you can shift (move one or two cards from one end of your hand to the other) or swipe (ask any player, 'Do you have any {name a suit}?' If your target has that suit at either end of his or her hand, he or she must give it to you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have four consecutive pairs of suits in your hand at the end of your turn, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
