							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Luftwaffe</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion will feature ten single missions with support for up to four players in co-op mode, two new planes and over 40 aircraft skins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wings of Luftwaffe, the player takes the role of a German pilot in explosive battles over Britain, Sicily, the USSR, Belgium and Germany. From blockading aerodromes, to intense dogfighting and bombing runs, players must fight with honour and bravery for the glory of Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air combat fans will enjoy strapping into one of the game's many planes and seeing the Second World War through the eyes of a German pilot. Wings of Luftwaffe puts you in the heat of battle, creating an experience so lifelike, you'll feel the padded seat yield to your weight as you evade enemy fire. Wings of the Luftwaffe offers a chance to experience first hand the desperate fight in the skies over Europe during World War II from another perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
