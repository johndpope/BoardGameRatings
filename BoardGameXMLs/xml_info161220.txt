			<description>To the Ends of the Earth is a fully-cooperative adventure game based on the 1930's adventure serials. Players take on the roles of intrepid explorers traversing the globe in search of ancient artifacts while trying to outwit and outrun enemy agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with the players choosing a mythical artifact, which will serve as the McGuffin for the game. Each artifact will have a series of clues that are distributed around the world.&lt;br/&gt;Clues take several forms: They can be excavation sites, scraps of historical documents, ancient relics, or even people who may be able to help the players deduce the location of the artifact. Each clue that is collected brings the players on step closer to discovering the artifact&amp;rsquo;s final resting place. Players will have to act fast as enemy agents (controlled by the game) will be hot on their heels collecting clues and setting ambushes at every turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat in EotE takes the form of action sequences, or confrontations with the enemy villain that happen periodically throughout the game. Players work together to defeat enemy minions by using their weapons, special abilities, teamwork, and most importantly, the environment around them. Furniture such as crates, explosive barrels, tables, and even bottles of whiskey can be used and manipulated by the players to give them the upper hand in any battle. Find yourself staring down the barrel of a Tommy Gun? Flip over the nearest table for cover! Cornered by a band of hired muscle? Grab the nearest whiskey bottle, set it alight, and toss it at an explosive crate to create the perfect getaway!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the Ends of the Earth is the board game where you, the players, truly determine the course of your adventure! Fight vigilantly to defeat the enemy villain, recover the artifact, and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EotE features a unique Action Dice allocation system to determine the options available to each player during their turn. Each player will choose an adventurer to control for the duration of the game. Each adventurer has three &amp;quot;stats&amp;quot;, which determine their proficiency for different tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brawn determines a character&amp;rsquo;s Strength, Speed, and Endurance, and is used for physical tasks such as brawling, climbing, or using melee weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skill describes a character&amp;rsquo;s Dexterity, Coordination, and Awareness. Using firearms, disarming traps, and driving vehicles are made much easier with a high Skill Stat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wits relates to a character&amp;rsquo;s Intelligence, Problem-Solving, and Inter-Personal skills. A high Wits Stat is needed to conduct research, excavate dig sites, or issue commands to allies and other characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each turn, a player will roll their available Action Dice (five six-sided dice if their character is healthy). Each die rolled below a Stat may be used for an action that requires that Stat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions include movement, researching artifacts, brawling with enemies, using firearms, or manipulating the environment. Special abilities and equipment broaden the choices available to each player, and with so much potential to strategize, there is never a &amp;lsquo;bad roll&amp;rsquo;. Every action you take will have consequences that ripple through the rest of the game, creating a unique adventure each time you play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
