			<description>Without huge rulesbook, without masses of material, without lots of fuss.&lt;br/&gt;The different games in this box are small, easy to learn and you may play them everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;acute;s something in the box for everybody &amp;ndash; for strategic thinkers, for optimizers, for bluffers, for memory-cracks&amp;hellip;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nu&amp;szlig;knacker &amp;ndash; Nutcracker&lt;br/&gt;For 3-4 players&lt;br/&gt;What shows the hidden card? Ask smart and listen how the nut cracks.&lt;br/&gt;Not a game for people with brains like bricks#&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16 cards with the values of 1 to 8. One card is placed face down - the aim is, to identify this card) The active player asks another player about a value between 1 and 8 (a game with all 16 cards (2x8) is quite complex...). The value has to be on his hand either as single card or as sum. The others answers either with &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; (no card/s with this value on my hand) or with the value in one or more cards. The other players just see the number of exchange cards, not their values.&lt;br/&gt;I.e. if one askes about a 6 and passes one card, is HAS to be the Six. If the other player passes two cards it might be 3/3, 4/2 or 5/1.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever indentifies the face down card correctly, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bauab &amp;ndash; Buildown&lt;br/&gt;For 2 players&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;acute;s a rough play amongst the building contractors. Save building sites for you, plan buildings, kick the others and force them to retreat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry, Folks, but this here is too complex, to explain it some sentences. Two players try to save construction areas for their own buildings, by placing planning-chips or reservation-chips on a variable board. Every player tries to take the last free area of his opponents chips - reminds me a bit on Go..., but of course, the game is faster and the value of the chips is important too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raufer &amp;ndash; Upper&lt;br/&gt;For 3-4 players&lt;br/&gt;Chase the others through the staircases and take their opportunities to move. But take care that you are not sticked by yourself&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20 cards with values of 1 to 20. Quite easy card game. The active player plays a card and commends to the next &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;down&amp;quot;, which means to react with a higher or lower value. If possible, the player gives the next command to his neighbour. If not, he has to take an additional card. Bad luck, if nobody can react properly - than the first player has to take additional cards. So, recall all played cards. &lt;br/&gt;Winner is the player, who played his last card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Misd&lt;br/&gt;3-8 Players&lt;br/&gt;Which symbol is missing? Is it missed really? A game for fast thinkers.&lt;br/&gt;Kids will blame you&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything planned?!&lt;br/&gt;For 3-4 players&lt;br/&gt;Is there a plan? Change places? Change Cards? Plan the use of your cards?&lt;br/&gt;Who plans with lack of plans, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schollenschubser &amp;ndash; Floe pushers&lt;br/&gt;For 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to cross the icy sea over swaying floes to safety. Charity begins at home. Shurely not a game for the kindhearted&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schlauraff &amp;ndash; Smartsnatch &lt;br/&gt;For 2-4 players&lt;br/&gt;Use your dice perfectly and get the uppermost points. More than simple but never the same&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a remark: since the producer delievered us... eh... somewhat insufficient dice (from our point of view...) we ordered better dice, and pass them with every sold box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And another remark: authors of the games in this box are: Till Meyer, Klaus-Peter Rudolph and H.&amp;amp;W. Fuhr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And another one: there only one language-based game in the box, but for this and all other games we offer an english rulesbook as download. It may need some time, since Christian enjoys his holidays and we want to present you grafics too - not just plain text. :-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
