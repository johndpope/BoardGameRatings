			<description>Subtitled: A Convention Tournament Game. This reworking of the Avalon Hill classic Le Mans, is staged only at conventions, including Gen Con, and special weekend events.  The track is over 12' long and 6' wide.  Players wear numbered vests that match their cars and the cars are moved around the track as players choose their gear, speed, whether or not to risk corners, and manage their tires.  To a certain extent, players are also able to manage their cars' condition as they choose whether to drive conservatively, competitively, or press.  Pressing will increase a car's speed, while also increasing the chance of mechanical problems cropping up in the car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games last 5 - 24 hours, that's no joke, players schedule 24 hour games.  In &amp;quot;short&amp;quot; five-hour games, players race independently.  In 8-hour games, players drive in 2-man teams, and while &amp;quot;driving&amp;quot; players are not afforded food, drink, or bathroom breaks!  In the 24-hour version of the game, cars are driven by 2 or 3-man teams with players driving longer shifts, which allows time for sleeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
