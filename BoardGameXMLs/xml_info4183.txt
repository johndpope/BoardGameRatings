			<description>Double Dog Dare is a card game in which players draw and play cards to summon fantasy monsters to fight each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's combat mechanic is based on an elemental &amp;quot;rock-scissors-paper&amp;quot; cycle: fire trumps earth, which trumps air, and air is superior to water, which overwhelms fire.  Two monsters of equal power would resolve the battle based on their elements; a monster of an element can, however, defeat a much weaker opponent that is of a superior element.  Special and Orbit cards affect the game in other ways, preventing an opponent from attacking for a turn, forcing a player to discard a card, and such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has no more cards in hand or in front of him or her; the winner of the game is the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
