			<description>Each player begins with a set of eight d8s in the same color. Three gray d8s that belong to no player are rolled first and are not re-rolled for the remainder of the round. Then, the remaining dice are rolled, and each player must freeze at least one of his dice. The non-gray, non-frozen dice are re-rolled, and each player again must freeze at least one more die. The round ends either when all players' dice are frozen or when the dice have been rolled four times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, a player scores no points unless he has rolled three dice that match the face values on the gray dice. If his dice have matched, then his score is the sum of the face values on his five other dice. Another round begins, and play continues until a player reaches 150 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
