			<description>From the Back Cover of the RPG:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        SpaceTime is science fiction role-playing, so gritty that you can feel it between your teeth. Set in the 24th century, Earth is still recovering from WWIII, with quite a way to go. Reaching tentatively to the stars, other human societies are found, remnants of an interstellar society blasted back to the stone age some thousands of years ago.&lt;br/&gt;        Adventure on corporation-dominated Earth, where economics takes the place of politics, and anything you can get away with is legal. Or explore Mars. Its eceltic society produces the best brains in the solar system, but still can't explain all the mysteries of the uncharted Martian Ruins. Travel to other human worlds, or any one of the hundreds of habitable but unexplored systems The frontiers are waiting....&lt;br/&gt;        SpaceTime is based upon the TimeLords RPG System, and is fully compatible with all other games in the system, The realistic rules have a simple hierarchy, letting you decide how much detail you want to include, and the unique combat and damage system gives results like no other game. SpaceTime... as close to the future as you can get. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
