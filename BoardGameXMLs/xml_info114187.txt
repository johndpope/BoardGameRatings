			<description>Game intended to keep the kids quiet on a long car journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each child gets a different card which has various images on it. The players must observe  each item on their card. As they are seen, they are ticked off using the special crayons in the box. The boards are laminated so that any marks can be rubbed off, making sure that the game can be played again on the next journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 9 images on each board, so the first to spot all 9 on their particular board, wins. I guess, if the journey finishes before the game, the one with the most successful observations up to that point, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
