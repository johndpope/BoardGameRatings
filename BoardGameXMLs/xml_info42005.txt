			<description>&amp;quot;Welcome to Going Places! Courtesy of your travel agent, you and your friends now can travel together between vacations! We think you'll enjoy this care-free but informative game on travel goals.  Your next move to see any of the destinations visited in the game, is at your travel agency. Have fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is basically a travel-themed version of Careers which appears to have been distributed by travel agencies.  Instead of gathering a total of 60 Money, Fame, and Happiness points, players must gain 100 Sun, Fun, and Discovery points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
