							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mordechai Graves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tall and Scary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The albino giant known as Mordechai Graves is a man only whispered about in the streets of New York City. There are many rumors as to where Mordechai comes from, but little is known about his actual past. It is unclear how many have fallen to the hands of Graves. No one has ever come forward to confirm that Graves is the murderer everyone claims him to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mordechai found employment with the Crime Czar, who made Graves the public face of his business enterprises. Calculating, emotionless, and highly intelligent, Graves enjoys operating in the light; where he can use his fearsome appearance to intimidate his business contacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
