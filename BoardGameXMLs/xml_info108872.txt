			<description>Fighting Eagles uses a simple game system to simulate the air battles of 1918 fought between the American and German air forces. Based on Rohrbaugh's Showtime Hanoi design, players will play head-to-head matches pitting several Allied aircraft vs. their German counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allied player wins the game if their German target is destroyed and more German aircraft are destroyed than Allied. Any other result is a German win. If Red Baron (Fokker Dr1) is shot down or leaves the map the best the German can do is tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition the game will include two historical scenarios: Red Baron's Last Flight and Frank Luke's Last Flight and several variants including additional missions of bombing &amp;amp; balloon busting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will need a standard deck of cards and one six-sided die (D6) to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each copy of Fighting Eagles is composed of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One set of 40 die cut counters&lt;br/&gt;     One 8.5 by 11 map with the Turn Record Track&lt;br/&gt;     A set of rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
