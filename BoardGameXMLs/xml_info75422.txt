			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silent Hunter 4: Wolves of the Pacific is a computer submarine simulation for Windows developed by Ubisoft Romania and published by Ubisoft in 2007. It places the player in command of an American submarine during World War II and takes place in the Pacific theater. The game allows players a variety of play modes including career, single war patrol and single battle engagements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation uses detailed and accurate 3D graphics to immerse the player in the environment of a World War II submarine. The systems of the vessel are largely functional and the player is exposed to many aspects of submarine warfare of the time. The game allows the player to choose how realistic and challenging the game experience is to be and it is designed to allow new players to easily master the basic game play, while allowing for experienced users to manually control systems such as crew management, torpedo allocation, radar, sonar and target trigonometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessor Silent Hunter 3, the simulation features a fully dynamic campaign. The game gives players various mission objectives and unique rewards, and attempts to make each campaign a unique experience. The major naval battles of the war in the Pacific, such as the Battle of Midway are re-enacted and players are informed of them via in-game radio messages. However, unlike its prequel, the game gives more specific and varied mission objectives during the campaign, rather than just assigning a specific patrol area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
