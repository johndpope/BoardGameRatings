			<description>French cycling game that appeared in the 1950's, it was published by a small company from Paris and featured a map of the Tour de France on the gameboard and 4 pawns (each representing a country / player). Strangely enough, the name of the game is English (though the game is French, and the game is subtitled 'Nouveau Jeu du Tour de France'). The rules are very straightforward. There are 4 national teams that can be selected by each player, the teams of France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. The game also included counter-chips and money. Instead of a die an original spinning device was used (ranging from 0 to 10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
