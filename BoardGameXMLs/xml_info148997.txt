			<description>Luna is a Pachisi based game, produced by Spika in East Germany in 1966. There are three each of six player pieces, which are small spaceships or satellites. They are precision cast in red, black, green, yellow, white and blue plastic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to &amp;quot;land&amp;quot; all of your spacecraft on the moon first. The board pips help you advance or retard a player's movement toward the moon. The movements are determined by the roll of a single die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seems to be inspired by the space race, and the game tokens bear some resemblance to the Sputnik satellite. Greg Stachowski added this information, &amp;quot;The rocket looks to be pretty generic, perhaps based on a Kosmos. The spacecraft above each of the rockets is clearly a Vostok. Actually the artwork is damn good, those are pretty accurate renderings of all the spacecraft, even down to little details like the curved antennae on the Vostok or the hexagonal base frame on the Ranger (in fact given the accuracy of the others I might hazard a guess that it is a 1964 or later Ranger (6 through 9) due to the rectangular rather than trapezoidal panels).&amp;quot; Greg's identification of the satellites is in a labeled image he prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
