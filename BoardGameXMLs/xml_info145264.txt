			<description>You can think of Dope Dealer as &amp;quot;speed Werewolf&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;mini Resistance&amp;quot; using ordinary playing cards.  It's primarily for four to six people; deal the Ace of Spades, King of Diamonds and then two to four Jacks depending on how many people are playing (one card each; for more people, add in Queens too).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are kept secret; each player's card gives him/her a secret identity: Ace = dope dealer; King = undercover policeman; Jacks/Queens = customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played as the policeman vs the rest of the players.  The dealer's goal is to sell his dope without getting caught.  He makes a sale by slyly winking at a single customer whom he does not think is an undercover policeman.  If it is a customer, the customer within five seconds of receiving the wink says &amp;quot;I'll buy some&amp;quot; and flips over his or her Jack/Queen; he/she no longer takes part in subsequent play.  (Dealer and customer must make eye contact one on one; if another customer oversees a wink between the dealer and another customer, he/she cannot say &amp;quot;I'll buy some,&amp;quot; but instead must wait to receive an individual wink from the dealer.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the policeman thinks he knows who the dealer is, he makes an accusation.  This ends the game.  If the accusation is right, then the policeman wins the game.  If the accusation is wrong, he loses and the dealer's team wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer can also win by successfully selling to all the customers without being caught by the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(If you want to play with children, re-theme the game as playground bubble gum dealer, and change the policeman to &amp;quot;teacher.&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
