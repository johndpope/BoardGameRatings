							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Doctor: The Zombie Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Zombie Doctor is a fun and frantic card-turning game. Amputate, reattach and swap limbs in a desperate bid to stay alive. It's your turn not to turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for 2-4 players (preferably 4), lasts for around 60 minutes and is suitable for ages 15+, due to the comic zombie gore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's small enough to fit in your pocket and is suitable to play at parties or if you have a spare hour with friends and family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is easy to learn but the elements of luck and strategy will keep avid board gamers entertained and challenged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
