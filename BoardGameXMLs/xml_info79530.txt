Eyewitnesses alternately described a ball of flame falling from the sky or the sky opening up and pouring out fire. An orange glow in the sky was visible for days as far away as Western Europe. Although the cause is still unknown, the consequence was clear. Magic was reawakened. Traditional native cultures and occultists were the first to notice, but it soon became common knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genie was out of the bottle &amp;ndash; and nothing would be the same again...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
