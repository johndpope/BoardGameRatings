			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are your game's Tarrasques and Thoqquas distinctly unobservant? Are your Vargouilles not as stealthy as they should be? Are your Wights not reaching their full potential? These are just a few of the monsters in the SRD that have significant errors in their stat blocks, bringing their mistakes into your game. But now Cooper's Compendium of Corrected Creatures fixes the problems you didn't even know your monsters had! This critical new series of books by ENWorld staff reviewer and 3.5 rules guru John Cooper presents thoroughly revised and corrected stats for the myriad creatures in the v.3.5 SRD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sample booklet includes revised statistics for the Troll Hunter 6th-Level Ranger and his Owl Animal Companion; the former appears in Cooper's Compendium of Corrected Creatures: OGL Monster Stats T - Z (Tarrasque - Zombie), while the latter is unique to this publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
