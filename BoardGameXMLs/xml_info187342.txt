			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filbar Friday presents Kettlespit one of the major cities in my 5th edition campaign! Home to a variety of merchants, malcontents, and adventures this city has something for everyone. A group favorite for one-shot adventures my players all enjoy a visit to this city located in the Principality of Lockerbie. This city has a both generalized encounters and open challenges for any numbers of players. The open challenges (City adventure hooks) have been left to assign challenge ratings depending upon the characters encountering the issue. The vast sprawl of the city gives the players a multitude of businesses to shop in but gives the DM the flexibility to make it &amp;ldquo;fit&amp;rdquo; their campaign. I hope your characters enjoy Kettlespit as much as mine do!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for the 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for any level adventurer(s) and DM.  This adventure setting is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
