							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tavern of Daednu</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tavern of Daednu is a short adventure for 3-8 characters of 1st-3rd level. The scenario works best with characters of low level who are veteran players. They will of course be suspicious and fully knowledgeable of the monsters that they will encounter, making the unpredictability and horror of the tavern that much more of a surprise. That said, although it may&lt;br/&gt;confuse novice players a bit, it will also work for them as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you trudge along wearily, contemplating another night beneath the stars, you round a bend in the road, and something strange catches your eye. The last rays of the setting sun, and the pale light of evening illuminate an  edifice standing along the side of the road, no more than a quarter of a mile away. It is a large two-story building,  with a stable and a well to one side. It is far too large to be a house, and in fact, it almost looks like an inn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you approach the building, you see it is a decently constructed, two-story, stone and wood edifice. A lamp hangs from a spar protruding from the wall, illuminating a green sign with red trim. In flowing, golden script the sign proclaims that this place is the &amp;ldquo;Tavern of Daednu.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
