			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in D-Quest have three Basic Characteristics (Physique, Wits, and Lore) and three Derived Characteristics (Courage, Fortune, and Health Points).  The Basic Characteristic values (-3 to +3) are purchased from a point pool.  The Derived Characteristics are directly calculated from the Basic Characteristics (-3 to +3, except Health Points which range 6-18).  Characters then purchase Skills with from a separate point pool (1 to 7).  Skills allow characters to perform actions, including combat and magic use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Task resolution is based on a Target Number (3-15), determined by the GM and modified by approach, being rolled against by d26.  Characters with exceptionally good or poor Skill or Characteristic in the relevant area may get additional dice or simple modifiers.  Combat works the same way, with armor and opponent ability possibly influencing the Target Number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters gain Exploit Points through experience.  Exploit Points accumulate and may be spent to raise a Basic Characteristic or gain/increase a Skill.  Notably, simply maintaining &amp;quot;Master-level&amp;quot; or above values in a Skill requires the continual expenditure of Exploit Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
