			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In CivClicker, the player manages a civilization which begins as a hamlet.  As citizens are added, they consume food at a particular rate of food per second.  When employed as farmers, food is generated to counter this rate.  Thus, a stockpile or deficit of food is produced.  The same occurs for the civilizations wood and stone, which is used to construct buildings and upgrade the civilization.&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, a player must employ blacksmiths, apothecaries, clerics, and so on, to manage other effects in their empire such as production of metal, illness, piety, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of these events and statistics are measured in numbers that change each second depending on the status of employed citizen, random events, and - most centrally - the player's mad clicking to manually collect resources and manage the civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
