							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Morloc&#039;s Tower</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morloc, the malevolent magic user, has sworn to level the city of Hagedom by tonight, upon the rise of the new moon. Unless you--Brian Hammerhand--can fulfill your quest, one of the inhabitants of the town, pursued by the awesome and evil power of the wizard, will live to see the next sunrise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morloc commands the fire that burns the soul and a host of evil and inhuman servitors, from a pack of ravenous hounds to a fiery salamander (a species of corporeal fire elemental)... and worse... The foul warlock rests secure in his tower, but the seeds of his destruction are sown therein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you, as Brian Hammerhand, puzzle out the workings of Morloc's possessions and so use them against their master? Will you slay the archvillain and save the fair maid Imelda for better than roasting in a fireball?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Morloc's Tower, you'll find three kinds of rings, a magic sword, two amulets, a half a dozen other treasures, 30 rooms, 18 real-time command options, and a dozen types of monsters, including crafty old Morloc himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morloc's Tower is a fascinating game that's easy to learn but a real challenge to master--a challenge of wit and the powers of deduction, where you should always expect the unexpected. Even after you've figured out all of the puzzles (or think you have), you'll play again and again to improve your score. But if the puzzle should prove too tough, the Book of Lore offers hints to help you find the solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be warned: the optimal solution will prove to be even more elusive than the mad wizard!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Superb graphics! Computer-generated map. (With the Apple you get high-resolution color!)&lt;br/&gt;     Real time&lt;br/&gt;     A race against time!&lt;br/&gt;     Competitive scoring system&lt;br/&gt;     For ages 10 through adult&lt;br/&gt;     Complexity: Intermediate&lt;br/&gt;     Playing time: 10 to 30 minutes&lt;br/&gt;     For one player &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
