			<description>Game Manual [with bracketed user comments]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get set and go with these two 1-player problem solving quizzes to sharpen your addition and subtraction skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After pressing START, the first problem will appear on the screen with two question marks under the answer line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Instructions explain how to enter your answer using the hand controller.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your answer is wrong, &amp;quot;TRY AGAIN&amp;quot; will appear on the screen.  You have one more chance to solve the problem correctly and score a point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, after the second attempt to solve the problem, the answer is still incorrect, Math Quiz will turn itself into a blackboard and show you how to get the solution to the problem step by step.  A point will be added to the score in the lower right corner.  This is the number of incorrect problems. This score will show up after you pull up on the hand controller for a new problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtraction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Instructions are the same as for addition.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Chairs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game for 2 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player then takes turns solving problems on the Math Quiz. He continues to solve problems until he gets one wrong. Correct answers after TRY AGAIN count. When a player gets a problem wrong, he gives up the &amp;quot;mathematical chair&amp;quot; to the next player. Keep score for each player by pressing RESET between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most correct answers after everyone has been in the &amp;quot;mathematical chair&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Several other multi-player games are described in the manual. These involve rules that must be enforced by the players, and typically require pencil and paper. These games include Up To 1000, Star Gazer, Hang Math, A-maze-ing Math, Digital Dots, and Math Battle.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
