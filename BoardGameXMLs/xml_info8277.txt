							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pentaghastal</name>
									
			<description>The players are Paranormal Investigators in the 1920's, trying to foil the attempts of the Pentaghastal Society to summon the devil Yangoogilathl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds in a continuous 3-round cycle. Each round consists of an Auction Phase (one auction) and an Action Phase (executing one or several actions on the board). After every Third Round, a Scoring Round occurs. Power Cards are awarded, according to the distribution of Agents in each Site. Some of these Power Cards award a single Victory Point, which is needed to win the game. After 3 Rounds, the cycle begins again. The game ends immediately, if a player acquires the required number of Victory Point Cards or if, after a Scoring Round, there aren't enough new Power Cards to place 3 Power Cards for each Site. The game is a compelling race against the clock, as the players struggle to choose the right Auction Cards, effectively distribute their Agents on the game board, and win Power Cards that allow them to execute special actions early in the game (often, confounding teams of rival Agents), and award Victory Points later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
