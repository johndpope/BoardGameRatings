			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Neiyar: Land of Heaven and the Abyss, alchemy and science are almost one in the same. Instead of being the domain of spellcasters alone, alchemy is studied by those otherwise shut out from the magical arts. These men and women seek to replicate the effects of magic in order to bring their benefits to the most people... and perhaps take back some of the power the Devi hold over the people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jungle Alchemy takes a new look at the craft by looking to the real world for inspiration. Pulling from both modern uses of various plants and their traditional uses of those indigenous to jungle environments. This product includes information on over two dozen real world jungle plants and their traditional uses, as well as additional fantasy plants from the Neiyar campaign setting. Also includes over 50 original alchemy recipes, as well as variants of the core alchemy recipes and recipes from the Neiyar campaign setting.  Build batteries, portable ovens, and frost boxes. Brew heart serums and have a chance to bring fallen comrades back to life without divine healing. Give magical potions a special kick with Sorcerer's Brandy. Learn how to craft armor and weapons from sulfuric clay and sulfuric glass. Find advanced rules for poisoncraft, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed for use with the Neiyar campaign setting, Jungle Alchemy can easily fit into any jungle or rainforest campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
