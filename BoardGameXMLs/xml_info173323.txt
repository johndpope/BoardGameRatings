							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Character Quest: Heroes – Goblin Raiders Adventure</name>
									
			<description>Goblin Raiders Adventure intro: The nearby farms are being captured and pillaged!  Lead by a Goblin Brute that must be defeated.  Player's take turns trying to free Wheat Field locations before Goblin Torchers show up and pillage them.  Once the fields have been rescued (or burned), players will then be able to try and defeat the Goblin Brute before time runs out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full 50 card hero deck.  It has a few heroes from Game Pack #1, a few from Game Pack #2 and a couple heroes from a future Game Pack (sneak peak of the Storm Shaman, Half-Giant Warrior, and Templar)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full 26 card Goblin Raiders Adventure deck is a spin off of the Goblin Keep Adventure but it also includes a few new cards made just for this demo (mostly to help with the new objective of stopping the goblins from raiding nearby farmlands!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This introductory set does not use the final art from either Game Pack #1 or #2. The cards also reference 'Raid', this simply means a fight or battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A link for downloading this game can be found on the Kickstarter campaign page for Character Quest: Heroes (Tavern Edition).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
