			<description>This game is played with one or two standard decks of cards (depending on the number of players). Each player in turn has two possibilities: he can draw a card or play a combination (cards of the same rank, suit, or in sequence) face up or down. Then he wins those cards unless other players challenge it by playing the same number of cards. Than the more valuable combination wins. This continues until all cards have been won. Then every cards won score 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
