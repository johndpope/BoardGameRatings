			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multiplayer (2-5) card game on power politics in the fictional Latin American country of Virtualia, after the departure from power of its strongman leader Jesus Shaves (pronounced &amp;ldquo;hay-sus sha-bezz&amp;ldquo;)... actually a thinly-disguised post-Chavez Venezuela (though when first designed in 2013, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t post-Chavez yet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is semi-cooperative and semi-competitive, and plays up the constant tension between these urges. As players vie to create the largest and most durable personal power base (scored periodically throughout the game), the card deck delivers more and more crises that players must deal with collectively (and collect small rewards immediately), or the country will collapse. Coups d'etat provide another quick way to score!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offered both in free print-and-play and assembled versions. The free PnP version consists of 90 cards, 230 counters, and the usual rules and play aids; the assembled version has 90 cards printed on coloured cardstock, 120 die-cut, pre-punched counters, and 120 wooden cubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
