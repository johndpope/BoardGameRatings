			<description>In Loyalty, the players struggle to get more treasures by using the special powers provided by some characters, such as the King, the Priestess, the Knight, the Merchant, The Farmer and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But to get the loyalty of those character the players have to bribe them with some points of influence and then get their loyalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, as they gain more influence, they are also becoming more greedy and more difficult to bribe. But do not worry, everyone has their price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn you can take 3 of the following possibles actions: &lt;br/&gt;1) buy a card&lt;br/&gt;2) get 1 coin&lt;br/&gt;3) discard 6 different cards to get a crystal&lt;br/&gt;4) discard 1 + &amp;quot;x&amp;quot; cards of the same type to get the loyalty of a character (x is the total influence in the target character)&lt;br/&gt;5) use the character's ability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon one player get a certain number of crystal, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
