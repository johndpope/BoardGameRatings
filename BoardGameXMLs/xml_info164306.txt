			<description>Junior eXtraDICTION is an educational vocabulary-building crossword type game not unlike Scrabble.  There are three levels of play, increasing in difficulty for older children with more advanced vocabularies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each level of play, children choose cards, write the words on those cards onto the Scrabble-like grid game board, and then score points based on the values of the squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the lower-level games, an adult helper reads the word to the child and helps him or her write the word on the grid.  In higher-level games, children must guess the word based on a given definition and then write it on the grid, scoring points based on both the values of the squares and the number of &amp;quot;zones&amp;quot; the word passes through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chance squares introduce an random element.  If a word crosses one, the player writing the word chooses a card that can earn them bonus points or cause them to lose points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
