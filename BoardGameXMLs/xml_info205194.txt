							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New Game of Blockade Runner</name>
									
			<description>This is an early 20th Century British game loosely based on the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese war and in particular the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur in the early stages of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The label on the back of the board shows ships of the period along with the Russian and Japanese flags, and has the subtitle: &amp;quot;A Game of Skill Without Intricate Rules&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board does not make these rules clear, but there is a Start position at the southern end of the Yellow Sea and a web of red lines and dots leading to ports in China, Manchuria and Korea. Seven ports have their names and the word &amp;quot;HOME&amp;quot; in a white box, and there is an additional &amp;quot;HOME&amp;quot; port for Manchuria as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board bears the words &amp;quot;Design Registered&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;British Manufacture&amp;quot; but no date, publisher, copyright or patent claim. Given that the Strait of Korea is at the east edge of the map (leaving out the neighboring Tsushima Strait where the climactic naval battle of the war occurred, this game may well have been published in 1904, during the first half of the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
