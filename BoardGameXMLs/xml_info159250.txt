			<description>Super Bis is pretty simple language learning game. The game comprises of two decks of cards (one deck of questions and one deck of answers). For every question card, there is just one matching answer card. There is also one joker and one jack-in-the box -card. There is two rule sets in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first game you just deal out the cards. Joker is removed. Everybody then removes matching pairs from their hands. Then the player in turn takes a card from the previous player. If the card matches a card in the players hand, he/she reads it loud and removes the pair. Then it's next players turn. This goes on until cards run out. Winner is the player who gets rid of his/her cards first and the loser is the player holding the pairless jack-in-the-box when pairs run out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the other game you just deal out the question cards. Joker and the jack-in-the-box are removed. Answer cards are shuffled and put in the table. One player then turns up the first card from the answers deck and reads it out. The player with the matching question reads it and then discards it. Then you read out the next answer card. Winner is the player who first gets rid of his/her cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
