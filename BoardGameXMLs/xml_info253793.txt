			<description>Our beloved Martians from Gardens of Mars and Gardens of Io have travelled to Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s moon Enceladus to harvest the flowers they planted last jovian year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help your little Martian gardener harvest the flowers making sure he collects enough of each type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES SUMMARY (please refer to the official rulebook for details)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MATERIAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A board representing a garden on the icy Enceladus (10x10 squares) and 10 special actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 96 flowers in 6 different colours (16 each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A carrying case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 6 black Martians in 3 types (2 each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 4 white Martians in 2 types (2 each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 4 peaks (black pyramids).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 9 black counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 1 &amp;lsquo;silver&amp;rsquo; counter (the wildflower)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving their martians orthogonally, landing on a space with a flower and taking it. Then taking an adjacent flower. Finally taking all isolated flowers from the board (soliflowers; those that don't have orthogonally adjancent flowers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optionally, at the beginning of the turn, the players can execute special actions by 'purchasing' them with 3 flowers of the same colour. Each action can only be executed once during the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Randomly pick 3 flowers from the game case (don&amp;rsquo;t look), if there are at least 3, and add them to your reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Exchange one of the flowers of your reserve with one of the flowers of another player&amp;rsquo;s reserve. You choose which flowers to exchange&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Jump horizontally or vertically over a peak. Pick up the flower of the landing space if any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Pick any flower from the board and add it to your reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Move diagonally (not jumping over peaks). Pick up the flower of the landing space if any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Swap the positions of any one peak and any one planted flower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Swap the positions of any 2 planted flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Move any one planted flower to any other empty space of the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Move any peak to any other empty space of the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Pick the wildflower and add it to your reserve. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to place a black counter on the circle, as there is only one wildflower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME END AND SCORING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player can't move her martian to a space occupied by a flower the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get your score, count the number of flowers of the colour you have the least (consider the 6 colours, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have flowers of some of them!). The wildflower acts as a wildcard; it can be used as any colour but you have to declare which one before scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score wins. Ties are broken by the second colour you have the least and so on. If the tie persists play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
