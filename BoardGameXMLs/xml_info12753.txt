							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Bunny Rabbit Game</name>
									
			<description>Two to four players compete in a simple spin-and-move game to bring home the most carrots. All players on their turn spin the arrow and then moves the number of spaces indicated. Each time a player's bunny lands on a carrot the player picks up the carrot and keeps it until the end of the game. When a bunny reached the gate by exact spin that player hops home and he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
