							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Orphan Annie Pursuit Game</name>
									
			<description>For Little Orphan Annie, the object of the game is to rescue Daddy Warbucks, Sandy, Punjab and The Asp. This is done by entering the square in which they are jailed and bringing them to the safety of the center HOME circle. If she does this without being captured by one of the Jailers, she is declared the winner. For each Jailer, the object of the game is to capture Little Orphan Annie. If a Jailer lands by exact count on the same space occupied by Annie, that Jailer has captured Annie and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple spin and move game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
