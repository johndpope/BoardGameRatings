							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Room 66a: A Treasure Chest Guarded by Two Orcs</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a one-act story game for two players, though others may be added if required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our drama takes place in a dungeon, within which there is a room containing a treasure chest guarded by two orcs (or more, if required.) The orcs are not clear on whose dungeon they are in, what is in the chest or why they are standing here guarding it, though they expect a party of adventurers to arrive and try to steal it, at some time, soon... possibly. The orcs are surprisingly erudite and loquacious, as we shall see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
