							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroic Frenzy: Petrograd 1919</name>
									
			<description>In July 1919, General Yudenich was made Commander-in-chief of the Northwestern army of the Whites, and was recognized by Kolchak as his representative. In August, with the aid of England and Esthonia, the Russian &amp;ldquo;Northwestern Government&amp;rdquo; was established. Yudenich&amp;rsquo;s planned Fall offensive was timed to coincide with the pinnacle of the White&amp;rsquo;s success, as Denikin approached Orel and Tula, the munitions-manufacturing center. From there it was only a short distance to Moscow. Heroic Frenzy covers the battle for Petrograd during this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map scale is about 3-3.5 miles per hex. Each aircraft unit represents one aircraft, each tank unit equals one AFV (armored fighting vehicles), and each armor car unit represents three armor cars. White units are brigades (X), battalions (II). Red units are brigades (X). A game turn represents two days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
