			<description>From Publisher Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Trappex is little bit like reuniting with an old friend. While it is comforting rekindling childhood memories with the time tested &amp;quot;Dots and Boxes&amp;quot; play pattern, there is still something new and different how the game has grown up in the meantime. Even though Trappex is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you alert from your first move till your last. To play, players take turns placing their wooden &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; pieces on the board, attempting to complete squares while preventing their opponent from doing the same. The player with the most completed squares at the end of the game wins. Trappex is simple enough to be played by children, strategic enough to engage a true gamer. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Trappex is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
