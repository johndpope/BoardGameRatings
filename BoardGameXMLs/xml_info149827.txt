			<description>MathMind&amp;reg; is a game of simple math and fast hands. Each player has a set of cards with the numbers from 0 to 9. First player places a card (by choice or randomly) on the left side of the game board, next player (clockwise) places a card (also by choice or randomly) on the right side of the game board. Now the first player rolls the MathDice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as the dice cup is lifted an equation is revealed. All players calculate the result and then try to find it among all of the answer cards spread over the table. He or she who finds the answer first grabs the card and places it next to him/her in such a way that all players may reach it. The answer card now constitutes one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the answer card has been found the dice cup is passed on to the next player (still clockwise), the played cards are removed from the game board and a new turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should an answer that has already been taken by a player come out again, everyone may try to steal that answer. Again fastest hand wins. If a player grabs an answer card that he or she has already has by his/her side, a special card is given to remember that extra point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when all cards have been played. The winner is the one with the most answer cards. In case of equality the digits on the answering cards are counted, higher number wins (i.e. &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; is one digit and &amp;quot;1.25&amp;quot; is three digits).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To sum up the idea of the game:&lt;br/&gt;Finding the answer was easy - but where is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
