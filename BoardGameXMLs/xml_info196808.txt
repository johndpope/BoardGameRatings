			<description>From Developer Website: Can you take control of a mail distribution company where your business will need to adapt to a growing city? Will you be able to handle the pressure of new delivery opportunities or are other delivery businesses step in to pick up the slack and impact your profit margin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Excalibur's Post Master you'll start out with a single post office, supplying pick-up and delivery services for a small area of the city. To maintain an excellent service you'll need to hire workers to sort mail, contract security guards to protect your offices from robberies while also purchasing new vehicles to pick up and deliver mail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
