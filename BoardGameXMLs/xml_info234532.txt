							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic Item Compilations Set One</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 55 magic items in this beautifully illustrated package. Some are powerful, some are more mundane. All of them should add to the fun and enhancement of your adventures!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are wondrous items, weapons, armor, cursed items and even some fun trinkets to try out on your party. What would you do with a cauldron that has an endless supply of blood? Can you use a Greatclub that causes minor earthquakes? How about a maul that does full damage to walls and makes short work out of constructs? Can you use a rope that only you can climb? How about a deadly Lich finger you wear around your neck? All of these and more await you in this package!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
