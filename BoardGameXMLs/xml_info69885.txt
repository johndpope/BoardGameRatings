			<description>There are 65 cards in five colors and with five symbols, numbered 1 to 13. At the start of the game, the players decide whether they will search for symbols or for colors. The task then is to locate all cards with that color/symbol in the right order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are dealt so that in front of each player, there are two stacks. As soon as the game starts, each player grabs one (any!) stack of cards and looks through it, trying to find the first card he/she needs. When successful, he/she puts the card face-down in front of him/her. Whether successful or not, the rest of the stack is put back to its position. The player then grabs another stack and proceeds. If the players can remember the contents of all the stacks, it's easier for them to find the cards they need later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete his/her stack correctly is the winner. If the fastest player is making a mistake, the player with most correct cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
