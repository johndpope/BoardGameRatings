							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of 45</name>
									
			<description>This game is played on a board with 10 x 10 squares. The goal of the game is to create a line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) on the board that contains one of each number (the sum of which equals 45, hence the name of the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a rack with ten numbers on it. Each turn, he may take one of two actions:&lt;br/&gt;1) Draw a new tile, and:&lt;br/&gt;a) Place a tile from his rack on the board, and add the newly drawn tile to his rack, or;&lt;br/&gt;b) Place the newly drawn tile on the board;&lt;br/&gt;2) Take a tile from the board and replace it with a tile from his rack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a tile is placed on the board, it may not be placed in a row that already contains the same number. The round ends when a player manages to complete one row on the board (or two, in a two player game) while also having completed 'row' on his rack. All players now score points, and a new round starts. The game continues until a agreed-upon number of rounds has been played, or an agreed-upon score is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gameof45.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.gameof45.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
