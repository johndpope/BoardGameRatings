			<description>Since 2012, the Strings (GM guide) now forms part of the main Icar core rules. It has been vastly updated and improved!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This book is a gamemastering guide for Icar.  It contains an overview of general gamemastering skills and information on Icar-specific gamemastering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Icarian Model: Prologue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Icarian model is a set of tools and rulings to allow a GM run Icar in its full manner. Regardless of your GMing experience, Icar is utterly different from anything else you have run. This is not a selling point, it is a fact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Icarian model initially makes more work for the GM but allows far more depth and colour to any campaign setting. If you really like to GM but have trouble creating in deep, meaningful, different, vast and consistent campaigns that allow the players to do just about anything then this is the system for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, not all the tools will be useful for every GM but to play Icar to the full, all the assets below must be used. You can run Icar in a more linear manner, but experienced players may baulk at being forced into a linear setting. Most of the Icar non-speci?c rules can be ported to other game systems with little effort and this is encouraged for the GM with too much time on their hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
