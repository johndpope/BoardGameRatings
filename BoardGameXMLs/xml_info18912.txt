			<description>Paraphrased from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take turns gathering colorful shapes as you move around the gameboard. If you land on a space with the Gigglepants character, you have to actually put on a pair of pants (Gigglepants) over your own clothes before the time runs out and you get to pick a shape. Collect all six shapes and you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a large gameboard, shape cards, colored shapes, kid-friendly pawns, spinner, sand timer, and Gigglepants play pants. For 2 to 4 players. Ages 3 - 5. Gigglepants teaches children about colors, shapes, numbers and counting. The game also helps to improve motor skills and encourages social interaction. Gigglepants play pants are designed to fit most 3- to 5-year-olds up to 45 lbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No reading required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
