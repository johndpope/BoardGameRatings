							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guilty Party: Murder on the Casting Couch</name>
									
			<description>First in Steve Jackson (I)series of adult murder/mystery party games.  Not sure if any others followed.  Standard issue, very much like How to Host a Murder or Murder Mystery Party line, only no audio tape.  However, each invitation includes a mini-newspaper with background information about the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story line:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who Killed the Studio Chief?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The date is 1927.  The place is Hollywood.  The crime is murder. Arthur McCutcheon made a lot of movies.  He made a lot of enemies, too.  When he was found dead in his luxurious office, it was easy to find suspects.  Too many suspects!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Matt Montgomery, dashing star of the silent screen?&lt;br/&gt;    Kathleen O'Shea, Superior Studios' leading lady?&lt;br/&gt;    Olaf Hedrikssen, the brilliant Danish director?&lt;br/&gt;    Betty Sue Wilson, Iowa farm girl turned starlet?&lt;br/&gt;    Wilbur Andrews, the famous inventor?&lt;br/&gt;    Irma Meyers, hair stylist and girl Friday?&lt;br/&gt;    Alice Chatterly, the gossip columnist?&lt;br/&gt;    Clyde Willoughby, insurance adjuster and movie buff?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
