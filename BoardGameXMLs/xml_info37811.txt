			<description>A game of conflict between fantasy armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 13x13 grid. The square at each corner of the board holds a tower. To win the game you must have an army on all four tower spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players travel around the board recruiting fighting units. Units are recruited by landing on an empty space and drawing a card from the colored card deck (of the five) which correlates to the color of the space. Each card describes a unit by name, Force value, and number of spells. Separate card decks describe for magic spells and artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
