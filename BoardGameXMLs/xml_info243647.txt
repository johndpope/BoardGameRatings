							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SciFi Rocketship</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, map of a SciFi Rocketship , with Hex, Square and No Overlays. The Zip file contains the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;All we know is that the sky has suddenly turned black on the horizon. You need to leave now and find out what is going on in the skies of the eastern continent. Prepare for launch! &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;Captain Kurtis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Rocketship includes a single interior and three different exterior paint jobs of a rocket ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Rocketship is intended for use in near future science fiction games. It could also be used as a high-tech rocket ship in modern games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unnatural Eclipse: When the eastern sky is blotted out by black shapes and dust, Captain Kurtis sends the group to investigate the situation in a rocket ship as a scout and report back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the group gets to the eastern skies, they see them covered with winged insectoids flying over a massive crashed meteor filled with large honeycombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insectoid creatures don&amp;rsquo;t take kindly to the presence of the group&amp;rsquo;s rocket ship and immediately swarm the ship! The black insectoids have large heads with two yellow compound eyes and antennae and thick mandibles, a thorax with two arms and two legs ending in four digit claws with two black wings, and an abdomen with two segmented yellow stingers protruding from its end. The insectoids have trouble with the metal armor of the rocket ship but soon start attacking the weaker glass on the cockpit...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the group survive the swarm and retreat back to HQ to report the situation? Or will they dive right into the swarm, crash land the rocket ship, and fight their way into the meteorite hive without back up?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
