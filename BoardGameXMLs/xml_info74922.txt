			<description>Subtitle: A Super Hero Quick Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;Each year one of the most prominent super villains in the world hosts his annual &amp;quot;Recruit a Minion Expo&amp;quot; for his fellow super villains. Every year the event is held in a new and secret location in an effort to keep prying eyes and would be party crashers out of his business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villains from all over the world, times past, present, and future, and planets near and far journey to this expo for the best and latest in recruitment of regular goons, super powered muscle, and the latest in technology for their loyal employees. This year&amp;rsquo;s show looks to be one of the best to date, with the host promising to unveil a prize minion up for auction: a former top tier super hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party has been recruited by the host of the Recruit a Minion Expo to provide extra security for the event. Usually there are no problems at the Expo, and the free trade of the villains and recruitment of minions is smooth. This year, however, may prove to be different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The host has learned that a team of super heroes may have discovered the location of this year&amp;rsquo;s Expo, and it is possible that they are even the former team of the special auction subject he is planning as the main event. He does not know for sure if the heroes have learned the location of the Expo, and even if they have there is no confirmation that they are connected to the former hero turned minion auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
