							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quest for Iscandar</name>
									
			<description>In the year 2199, Earth is under attack from an alien race called the Gamilons. &lt;br/&gt;Gamilon planet bombs covered the earth with a deadly radioactive pollution and &lt;br/&gt;the surface of the earth is now unlivable. All life on Earth has moved underground. &lt;br/&gt;But even there, far below the earth's surface, the deadly radiation poisoning &lt;br/&gt;is beginning to reach them. Now all life on Earth has just one year left to live. &lt;br/&gt;But there is hope. On the planet Iscandar, there is a machine called the Cosmo DNA &lt;br/&gt;which can remove the radioactivity and restore Earth to it's natural state. &lt;br/&gt;The Star Force must travel 148,000 light years and back in just one earth year or &lt;br/&gt;all life on Earth will become extinct. But the Gamilons are determined to stop the &lt;br/&gt;Star Force at all costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exiciting print-and-play card game pits the Star Force player attempting to travel 148 parsecs and the Gamilon player attempting to stop him in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
