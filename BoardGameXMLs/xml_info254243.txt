DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looks like this is the place.

A couple of player characters can sleep in the bedroom (perfect for a couple), one on the couch, and one on the carpet with an airbed or sleeping bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hit: A couple has run afoul of a local mob. The couple saw something they should not have and made it worse by blabbing it to the local authorities. The player characters are detectives sent to get the details from the couple and then escort them to the local police station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile the mob has ordered a hit on the couple to shut them up permanently. When the detectives arrive, they may find the couple already murdered and need to investigate and seek out their killers. Or the detectives arrive and soon find themselves caught up in the mob attack, needing to fend off the mobsters and protect the couple. Either way, its up to the detectives to gather enough evidence to nail the higher ups in the mafia that caused the attack in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
