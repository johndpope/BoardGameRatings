							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hamnett Yamazaki</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first volume of this series details Hamnett Yamazaki, Admiral and commander of all Imperial Naval Forces within the Sub-Sector . Hamnett is a study in contrast; he is a career Naval Officer that takes his duty seriously. He also employs means well outside the accepted code of conduct for Naval Officers. He views his job as overseeing the Sub-Sector as the main priority, and applies that motivation to all his actions. He'll take credits to look the other way while a container of fermented Anshevaax Milk passes through, or give a careless crew intercepted with illicit goods a pass so he can know more about a new syndicate setting up shop in &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; Sub-Sector. He will not let crimes like kidnapping, arms shipments or certain types of espionage go un-punished. While he considers himself an upstanding officer and would never do something directly harmful to the Imperium or his home system, like knowingly allow terrorists or prohibited weapons to pass unmolested; he sees other infractions of the Imperial code to be lesser sins. Indeed, sometimes &amp;quot;greasing the wheels&amp;quot; of commerce does more to avoid hostilities than a dozen peace negotiators. Hamnett learned long ago that it is impossible to prevent illicit goods from travelling the stars. &amp;quot;Profit finds a way&amp;quot; is one of his personal sayings. Hamnett is a realist, and he also realizes that if the goods are going to flow anyway, he might as well get a small piece of the profits. His current position as head of the sub-sector fleet facilitates this nicely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF release includes information on Hamnett including his background, personality and how he treats people he conciders Allies, Contacts, Rivals or Enemies. There are also dozens of adventure hooks and ideas for using Hamnett in each of these roles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
