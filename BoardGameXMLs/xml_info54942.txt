							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Columbia: the Next America Game</name>
									
			<description>This appears to be a promotional item devised at the request of the Rouse Company. Centered on the planned community in Columbia, MD, this game offers players the opportunity, &amp;quot;to become a developer in the NEXT AMERICA, COLUMBIA.&amp;quot; Players must accumulate wealth and property in order to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with Monopoly, upon which this game is strongly based, &amp;quot;Columbia: the Next America&amp;quot; ends when all but one player goes bankrupt, at the end of a predetermined time, or, in a unique addition, &amp;quot;when the next feature comes on the cable.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center photo for the game board, as well as the game box, feature an 1982 aerial view of Columbia, MD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
