			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final chapter of the saga, Shadow of the Beast III was released for the Amiga in 1992. In this game, Aarbron has finally maintained a human form but must face Maletoth once and for all to regain his full humanity. It did not get as much attention as its predecessors, in spite of the overwhelmingly positive reviews, with most praising the improvements in gameplay and toning down of the difficulty level. Its graphics and sound - though still high quality - were not revolutionary anymore in 1992. Beast III had four distinct stages instead of one big area. The game placed less of an emphasis on the action elements so prominent in the first two games, instead preferring a more cerebral approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
