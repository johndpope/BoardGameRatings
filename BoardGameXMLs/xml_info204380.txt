			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Balkan Tragedy is a one-two player game simulating the conflict in the balkans during both the first and second balkan war. This is a more traditional hex and counter War-Game and plays in 90-120 mins for each scenario. The first scenario being the first Balkan War, and the Second Balkan War being the other scenario included in the game. This game is meant to setup the background for our further exploration into the conflicts of the time period. Particularly WW1, as well as other post WW1, and inter war period conflicts. The game will feature a paper map, and units counters, and all necessary tracking counters for the game. Nations included in the game are: The Ottoman Empire, Bulgarians, Serbians, Greek, Romanian, and Montenegrin forces. This is your time to see if you can change history in the Balkans, and perhaps influence this critical region at this point in human history. Your the General now!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
