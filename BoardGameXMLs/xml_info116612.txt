			<description>The year is 2051. Location: SATAZIUS, a long-abandoned planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cruiser Agano was on patrol when it was attacked and stricken by a confederacy of space pirates that had established a base on SATAZIUS. The pirates attacked the Agano intending to steal the assault ship &amp;lsquo;Trafalgar&amp;rsquo; that was stowed aboard the Agano, but the Trafalgar made a successful emergency escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crew of the Trafalgar calculated the probability of successfully escaping the pirate overrun planet at 0.02%; the probability of charging into and successfully destroying the pirate base was 1%.  Taking the higher probability escape plan, the crew of the Trafalgar turned their ship toward the pirate horde and began their charge into the heart of SATAZIUS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
