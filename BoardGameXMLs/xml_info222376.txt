							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Approach to Moergorond</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The island of Ghaol Dhalld stretches for more than 300 miles southeast into the Sea of Storms from the Nidevellir continent, separated from the mainland by the 14 miles of the Strait of Storms. The center of the island is dominated by three chains of mountains, the Bahlphon, the Zelanaw, and the Widkallens. Moer Vale lies deep in the Zelanaw Mountains, near the island center. Dwarves came to Ghaol Dhalld more than 3000 years ago, and by 2250 years past reached the Moer Vale, establishing a silver mine at the foot of Wydorrith Mountain. Over the next 500 years the Dwarves found gold on Juttermad Mountain, iron on Mount Paagdoon, and coal on Ker Wert and Mountain Trewk. They also founded the town of Kolli on Lake Moer, and the villages Lokdell and Mantry. The city that came to be called Moergorond developed from the original silver mine and became a major Dwarven center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
