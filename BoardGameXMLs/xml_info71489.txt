			<description>A D20 Campaign Setting and Adventure for Character Levels 7 - 9&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A futuristic invader attacks a fantasy milieu; the heroes must fight back to defend their home and their legacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Campaign in Brief&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign is a D20 fantasy supplement. It requires use of the Dungeon Master's Guide and Player's Handbook to play. It is compatible with the Spelljammer campaign setting. It can also be used with the Dragonstar campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beast's Black Fortress crosses the void of space, hopping from planet to planet. Once the Black Fortress lands, Slayers spill out of its womb, burning villages and towns, torturing and slaying everyone in their path. The Beast will accept nothing less than genocide in its conquest of every planet for its own, dark purposes. What it does with a planet once it takes over is unknown, but it's clear that the Beast and its Slayers have powers far outstripping the cultures they invade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Role of the Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ideal situations to introduce the player characters (PCs). Two examples include: an armed guard contingent protecting the prince, or a ragtag band of bandits and mercenaries who later swear their allegiance to the king in a battle of survival. Prince Colwyn is not picky about who will be in his &amp;quot;army&amp;quot; -- he's desperate enough to consider anyone who isn't with the Beast. This sort of campaign is recommended for a more combat-oriented group. If there are spellcasters, none of them should have a means of teleportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beast and his minions have an eerie, science fictionish bent, although there is not actually anything to indicate that they use technology. The Slayers are alien, the Black Fortress looks like a scene out of Aliens (the movie) and everything looks like a desiccated skeleton. With the Beast's Black Fortress flying through space, it could easily invade any game world. The Beast's tactics are inelegant but effective, as the Slayers are immune to most environmental hindrances (asphyxiation, poisons, food, fatigue, etc.). While not particularly powerful singly, an army of these beings will easily outstrip even a well-armed contingent of knights through sheer numbers alone.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This D20 Fantasy campaign setting/adventure includes an adventure synopsis and campaign setting with 10 scenes, a new race (cyclops), 10 new NPCs, 3 new magic items, and 4 new monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
