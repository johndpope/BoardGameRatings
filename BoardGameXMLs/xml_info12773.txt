			<description>The only six-player game in the Jamie Swise murder-mystery party game line (the rest are all 8 players).  From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the regulars of the Last Chance Mission just couldn't get into the holiday spirit.  Early on the morning of December 26th, this person garroted mission &amp;quot;resident&amp;quot; John Lancaster.  Was it the flamboyant &amp;quot;Reverend&amp;quot; Bobby Wilson or the eccentric Pigeon Annie.  Perhaps punkrocker Billy Bedlam or Wilson's faithful assistant, Holly Farr did the deed.  Maybe Shopping Bag Mary or the mysterious Luther Dibdahl was the culprit.  Cast yourself and your friends as these characters and learn the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Time: December 26th, 1977&lt;br/&gt;The Place: Chicago's West Madison Street District&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;6 character packets with clues&lt;br/&gt;5 invitations for your guests&lt;br/&gt;The murder plot&lt;br/&gt;A sealed solution&lt;br/&gt;A game-starting 33 1/3 rpm recording&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
