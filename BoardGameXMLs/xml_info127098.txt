			<description>Statistical basketball simulation. Game designed with the intention that each match-up is quickly resolved (using charts and dice as usual in these types of game). The designer hoped that this brevity would allow a player to replay a whole season in a relatively short space of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics included for the 1991/92 season plus two older seasons. Every main player in each team is rated as well as the team ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
