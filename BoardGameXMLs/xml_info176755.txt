							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doki Doki Love!</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the world of Doki Doki Love!. Love is in the air and it is your job to help your Hero find that special person in their life. Things aren&amp;rsquo;t as simple as that though, oh no, this world is full of all the Anime tropes you&amp;rsquo;ve come to know over the years. Tropes are elements that appear in multiple creative works, so if you watch Anime, you will know lots of the tropes that are used. Can you help the General Protagonist end up with the Girl Next Door? Or will the obsessive Yandere try to keep them apart? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re lucky and the Yandere isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in you, but you still need to worry about your Rival getting in your way, along with all the other guys trying to get the Girl Next Door&amp;rsquo;s attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes and Love Interests are drawn randomly, so each time you play Doki Doki Love!, you will have to find the best way to make you Hero appeal to the various Love Interests. While it may seem easy to just increase your Appeal and Encounter a Love Interest, be warned that it is not. Other Heroes will try to lower your Appeal and get in your way. Who said love was simple? You must fight with all your soul to end up with the person you want! And don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you can mess up their plans as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base set for Doki Doki Love! contains tropes found in slice of life, romance/comedy, and school Anime. Do not fret though! There are plenty tropes in all kinds of Anime, so maybe (hopefully) there will be new ones coming in the future&amp;hellip; And don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t know many tropes, you will learn more after playing this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and this game is about Anime and love, so you know some Ecchi elements will find their way into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
