			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is Ator 5th. The fifth day after the Endyear festival of 5th Age, 1st cycle, year Saturnus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brutal cold did not prevent the festivities, nor dim them. An even more brutal death on the 4th evening of the fest did, however. The discovery of the shredded bodies of Francois DeBorge and his intended wife near the town&amp;rsquo;s boatslip brought the festival to an abrupt close. Father Garner, after performing the rite of burial, sent notification to the bishop of Starstor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This morning, the fifth, a rider posted in Starstor arrived. All of you have now been summoned to the Squire's house. Squire Wiggins has made you all comfortable with tea and biscuits, and now sits perched on the edge of a chair near the fire. He is a middle aged man with a mild and pleasant face His fringe of greying brown hair is neatly trimmed. Today there are rings around his eyes and he is rubbing his hands together as if he is cold, even though he is sitting next to a roaring fire in the marble fire place that graces this reception room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as four files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        22-page DOC scenario&lt;br/&gt;        19-page DOC Pre-generated characters&lt;br/&gt;        Area map (BMP Format)&lt;br/&gt;        Town map (BMP Format)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that all four files have the confusingly peculiar file extension of .DAT (instead of .DOC and .BMP); both of the maps also are embedded in the scenario document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
