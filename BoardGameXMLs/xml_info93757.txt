							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ratfang Sewer</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The underbelly of the city is riddled with dark crawlways and treacherous passages. The locals call this foul network the Ratfang Sewer. Filth and grime abound in these damp tunnels and all manner of disgusting creatures slink about, plotting, scheming and performing vile acts to appease dark powers. This map shows a network of passageways and foul canals, detritus and trash litter the floors of side tunnels and antechambers. Gates and grates divide sections of the network and protect one large chamber that has been re-purposed as the lair of a wicked denizen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Game Mats are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal battle grids for staging encounters during your adventures! The mats lie flat for ease of play and are sold in a sturdy polycarbonate tube for easy storage and transport. The mats may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily alter terrain areas or make other notes about battlefield conditions during play. The Game Mats measure 20&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; and are marked with a 1&amp;rdquo; grid. All of GF9's Game Mats are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
