							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ozark Air Travel Game</name>
									
			<description>Made by PrestoMagix, this game was given out on Ozark Airline flights for a limited time. Ozark was bought by TWA in 1986, who in 2001 was acquired by American Airlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simple and uses colorform-like stickers of airplanes, servicing equipment and airline personnel on a three-fold nicely drawn landscape board. One to six players place the stickers to crate a collective travel plan on Ozark. In game mechanic terms, this is a very early cooperative game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
