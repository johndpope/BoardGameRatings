							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tank Trap</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rampaging tank tries to run you down.  You are a combat engineer, building concrete barriers in an effort to contain the tank.  Use either the keyboard or an Atari Joystick to move your man and build walls.  If you trap the tank you will be awarded a rank based on the amount of time and concrete you used up.  But they'll be playing taps for you if you get run over.  There are four levels of play.  Higher levels of play introduce slow curing concrete, citizens to protect, and the ability of the tank to shoot through any wall unless you stay close by.  Music, color, and sound effects add to the excitement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written in BASIC with machine language subroutines.  Requires at least 16K of user memory.  Runs on the Atari 800 and on an Atari 400 with 16K RAM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed by Don Ursem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
