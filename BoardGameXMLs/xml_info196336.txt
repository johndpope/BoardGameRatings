			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in the game control a tribe of dinosaurs - the &amp;quot;character&amp;quot; in the game is comprised of several individuals.  Each dinosaur has four Attributes - Think, Fight, Run, and Endure - with values assigned from a standard array.  Dinosaurs also have Traits and talents (for example, claws, horns, or spikes).  Play proceeds in phased rounds with each player taking a turn in sequence.  As one player gains the spotlight, other players assume the roles of Adversary and Judge.  Play proceeds with the use of tracking tokens and narrative development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the file was submitted as a text-only PDF file, it included notations to insert the graphics of the competition at specific points in the text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
