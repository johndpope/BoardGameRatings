			<description>Round the World is a real-time card game played simultaneously. The players are travel agents creating &amp;quot;trips&amp;quot; around the world for their customers. Each &amp;quot;flight card&amp;quot; shows two continents (each continent has its own color): a &amp;quot;departure&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;destination&amp;quot; connected by an airplane/arrow. You try to get rid of your own 30 card deck within exactly 5 minutes by creating &amp;quot;trips&amp;quot; card by card with matching colors from card to card until the trip is complete and can be &amp;quot;booked&amp;quot; (saved for scoring).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players play at the same time, everybody to their own speed and rhythm. Holding your deck in one hand, you draw  the top card as your sole &amp;quot;hand card&amp;quot; and add it to the ones you placed before in front of you to create &amp;quot;trips&amp;quot; - or put it under the deck again. When you add a card, you may pick up the card from the other end of the trip and continue using this as your &amp;quot;hand card&amp;quot;. You may also add cards to your opponents' trips - and take cards (you desperately need) from them. But beware: all cards not &amp;quot;booked&amp;quot; (still in the deck / incomplete trips) are scored negative - so with your deck emptied too soon your opponents are able to lengthen your trips without completing them ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game consists of two rounds of 5 minutes plus two simple scoring phases. The focus of the game is on your perfect timing within the 5 minutes, keep an eye on cards with landmarks (better for scoring!), and on your opponents &amp;quot;offers&amp;quot;. There are variants included shifting the focus and making the game more challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
