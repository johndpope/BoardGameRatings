							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire: The Eternal Struggle â€“ Storyline Rewards 2015</name>
									
			<description>Among the core concepts of Storyline events is having the players contribute to the narrative of the World of Darkness as well as to the design direction of future cards in V:TES. Over the past several years, we've had unfinished business with respect to realizing these narratives in game form. The following cards represent the participation and contributions that you, the players, have made in the Storyline events, as well as the subsequent playtesting and feedback. We are grateful to all of you, and we look forward to providing more opportunities for you to help steer the direction of V:TES!&lt;br/&gt; As mentioned previously, we're still waiting for one piece of artwork to be delivered. As soon as the piece arrives, we'll update the Storyline Rewards .pdf file to include the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
