			<description>Dragons, &amp;quot;The Family Game of Frenzy,&amp;quot; is a family-style card game where up to eight players simultaneously attempt to get rid of their deck by playing their cards to sequentially build &amp;quot;dragons.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game's core mechanic is a type of simultaneous, speed-based card play similar to that used in solitaire.  Players have five card slots in front of them, from which they play cards into the center of the table onto piles which comprise dragons made up of first a tail, then the numbers 1-10, and then a head.  When players have played a card from one of their slots, they then quickly replace it with one from their deck.  Players may play on any dragon stack in the center, which leads to a great deal of frenzy as players try to monitor their own play stacks, keep an eye on the multiple dragon piles that are constantly growing, and try to avoid allowing other players to gain an advantage in building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules introduce complexity in scoring, the color sequencing of dragons, battles between players for simultaneous card play, and two-headed or two-tailed dragons.  A notable feature of the game is its giant fold-out play mat which includes markings for card play and card slots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
