							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for the Universe</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Millions of years in the future, admits a universe dying a cold, premature death, mankind has overcome great challenges. They have conquered and outlived every alien race. They have overthrown a millennial reign of a cruel quasi-immortal tyrant. They have occupied all the remaining habitable galaxies of the Universe. But their greatest challenge is now themselves. The Human species has evolved into two different peoples: the Morlocks and the Eloi. And now they battle each other to determine which of them shall be masters of the universe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;One player plays the space fleets of the Eloi. The Eloi are a gentle, yet determined people, under the vigilant care of their Empress. They seek to liberate the six galaxies from the cruel Morlocks. One player plays the space fleets of the Morlock Empire. The Morlocks are a fierce and technologically advance people. The only way they wish to serve the Eloi, is on their dinner tables. Each player uses an identical deck of cards. Six sided dice will also be required.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Goal: To win, one player must possess all six of the inhabitable galaxies of the Universe. To capture (or recapture) a galaxy card, one must win a battle by destroying all of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s ships.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
