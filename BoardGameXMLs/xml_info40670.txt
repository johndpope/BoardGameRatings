			<description>From game box inside:&lt;br/&gt;4398 THE THREE GAMES OF PITCH-A-RING CROWN THE KING AND RING TOSS&lt;br/&gt;These games may be played by two, three of four persons.&lt;br/&gt;Directions For Playing Pitch-A-Ring&lt;br/&gt;Remove from the box, and inset the tall post in center socket (wooden post 9&amp;quot; long) of wooden frame (two wooden interlocking pieces 11&amp;quot; long). The player takes his position at such a distance from the box as may be agreed upon, thus bringing one of the four posts directly behind the tall one (4 shorter posts 7&amp;quot; long).&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn pitches all the rings and endeavors to make the highest score according to the following plan. Each hoop that goes upon the tall posts counts 50, and a hoop on any of the other four posts counts 5. The hoops that do not go on to any of the posts count nothing. The players may take as many turns as shall be agreed upon, each player throwing all the hoops at each turn (4 wooden hoops 6&amp;quot; diameter).&lt;br/&gt;Crown The King&lt;br/&gt;This game is played precisely like the preceding, only it may be placed in any position, and a hoop upon the tall post counts 10, and a hoop upon any of the other four posts counts 5.&lt;br/&gt;Ring Toss&lt;br/&gt;In this game the short posts are dispensed with, the tall post is inserted in the socket in center of the frame. Each player, in his turn, pitches all the hoops. Every hoop that goes upon the post counts any number that may be agreed upon, as 10 for example, while all others count nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
