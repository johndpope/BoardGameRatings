							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Weird Little Games, Volume 1: Being Weird Together</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weird Little Games is a collection of, you know, weird little games. Specifically role-playing games, ranging from more or less traditional to weird story games to freeform. It includes six complete games, plus some bonus stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schoolgirl RPG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An intensely random comedy RPG based on the rules of Maid: The Role-Playing Game. Be a (randomly-generated) Japanese schoolgirl RPG, and let random stuff happen, randomly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AnimeCon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A freeform RPG about going to an anime convention and what you find there. It turns out anime fans are people too, good and bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fullmetal President&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the President (or a member of the cabinet), get in your power suit, and save America from tyranny! Or to put it another way, roll a bunch of dice and narrate how stuff explodes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melancholy Kaiju&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a storytelling game about giant monsters who feel kinda sad. No, really. Take turns playing cards and narrate your kaiju dealing with the little triumphs and failures of everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raspberry Heaven&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A heartwarming game about the lives of high school girls, in the style of manga like Azumanga Daioh and Hidamari Sketch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saving Throw&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A satirical mini-RPG based on Chick Tracts, those tiny evangelical Christian comics you may have seen virtually anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus #1: Entanglements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A system for building relationship maps to give a long-term campaign a rich starting point that you create collaboratively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus #2: Ewen&amp;rsquo;s Tables Sampler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A selection of 12 different random generator tables from the Ewen&amp;rsquo;s Tables series of PDFs. Not the absolute silliest thing you could do with six-sided dice, but up there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
