			<description>Dwarf Thief is a promo card for DIG: the Card Game that can be added to the deck for more game play variety.  Simply shuffle the card into the starting deck and play.  The pertinent rules are included on the card itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card Text: &lt;br/&gt;Always costs 6 Gold Coins. Play in your Play Area. Steal 2 Gold Coins from any 1 Player during each Dig Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:  The Dwarf Thief does not dig or mine; instead, simply play him face-up in your play area as soon as you hire him. From then on, during each Dig Phase, you may steal 2 Gold Coins from any 1 player. So, for example, if you hire the Dwarf Thief on Day 2, you can feasibly net 10 Gold Coins (2 Gold Coins per day on Days 2-6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
