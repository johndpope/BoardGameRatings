							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rommel&#039;s Quest For Jesus Tel el Elisa July 10-15, 1942</name>
									
			<description>The area the Australians had taken on July 10th included the coastal ridge from Point 26 up to Point 33 and extended from the coast, south to the railway line. The surrounding terrain was flat and open, offering little or no cover.  In such a flat expanse, ridges and rises a mere twenty or thirty yards above sea level give commanding vantage points to their occupants. The height advantage is so slight that one can scarcely appreciate it until actually upon the feature. The 26th Brigade began the difficult task of digging in while reinforcements of artillery, anti-tank guns and machine guns were quickly brought in. Rommel now gave his inevitable response; an all out counterattack to retake this vital ground using threadbare units. Over the next five days, holding this salient would prove extremely tough, with some places changing hands several times. At times the shelling on Tel el Eisa itself made it too hot for either side to occupy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is 12 hrs, with 400 yard hexes. Units are company and platoons for AFVs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Australians had nearly ruptured the Italian line on July 10, Rommel diverted many of this available troops to stop the hemorrhage as it threatened his rear area. However, the coastline ridge of hills and the Hill of Jesus (Tel el Eisa) barred their success. Once the Australians had secured their advance and held the hills, Rommel had no choice but to try to seize them back and from the 10th through 15th, this is what he did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
