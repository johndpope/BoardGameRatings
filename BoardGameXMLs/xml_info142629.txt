Few to no details have been released about about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Featuring an ensemble cast of heroes and villains, Shadow of the Eternals will span over 2500 years of history throughout Egypt, England, Hungary, and the United States. Players will question the perception of reality as they try to balance the mechanics of combat, magick, and sanity events to progress through the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadow of the Eternals will take players on a memorable journey throughout time; weaving historical fact with disturbing fiction to create an experience unlike any other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pilot episode of Shadow of the Eternals begins when detective Paul Becker is called to one of the bloodiest massacres in Louisiana state history at Pleasant View Hospital.  The massacre is survived by two individuals who seemingly have no recollection about who they are or what has transpired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Becker&amp;rsquo;s interrogation of the suspects brings us to Hungary 1610 AD at Čachtice Castle &amp;ndash; home to the noblewoman Erz&amp;eacute;bet Bathory. Bathory is also a notorious serial killer; torturing and killing as many as 400 young women in her obsessive quest to retain her youth. You play the role of Bathory&amp;rsquo;s handmaiden and lover Clara, who is blackmailed by the authorities into gathering information about a missing nobleman&amp;rsquo;s daughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events are soon set in motion that will change Clara&amp;rsquo;s life forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode Highlights&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Travel back to 1610 Hungary and explore Čachtice Castle &amp;ndash; the home of Erz&amp;eacute;bet Bathory&lt;br/&gt;     Use a variety of mechanics including magick, combat, and sanity to guide Clara through this horrific tale&lt;br/&gt;     Piece together a complex mystery while questioning the perception of reality&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
