			<description>The box contains two games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TWO'S GOLF shares some features similar to the much more recently released Box of Golf.  The score sheet consists of 18 hole, each consisting of 22 spaces.  The first space is the tee, the last space represents Out of Bound, and the remaining 20 in between are either various hazards (water, shrubs, sand), fairway, or the flag.  The flag is usually between spaces 8 and 20, depending on the length and par of the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin a hole, you must pick up the number of dice corresponding to your first choice for a club (3 for driver, 2 for iron, 1 for putter, 1 for sand wedge).  Ball movement is determined by the sum of the dice rolled.  Continue on making a new club selection, taking a swing, and marking off the ball movement until it lands in the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six-sided dice in game are all identical: 1, 1, 2, 2*, 3, 3.  The asterisk gives you the ability to double the sum of the dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2'S WILD is a Yahtzee clone specifically designed to take advantage of the dice for TWO'S GOLF.  Five dice are used for the various scoring combinations.  There are score pads included for that game as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
