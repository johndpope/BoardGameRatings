			<description>Players take the role of mad scientists, trying to outdo each other with inventions while avoiding catastrophic explosions in their labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is straight forward press-your-luck with dice. Eight dice, two each of four colors, are rolled and grouped according to the faces shown. Scoring dice can be rerolled to add further score, but non-scoring dice pile up and count against you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to have the highest score at the end of a round where someone passes the game threshold - 200 points makes for about a 15 minute game once you're comfortable with scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
