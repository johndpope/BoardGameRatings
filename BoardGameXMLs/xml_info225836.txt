			<description>Espa&amp;ntilde;a 20 features four complete games covering key battles fought over control of the Iberian Peninsula: Bail&amp;eacute;n, Talavera, Arapiles, and Bussaco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hans von Stockhausen's Bail&amp;eacute;n 20 (July, 1808) showcases the stunning triumph of General Francisco Casta&amp;ntilde;os&amp;rsquo; Spanish army over French General Pierre Dupont&amp;rsquo;s Corps d&amp;rsquo;Observation operating in the mountains of Andalusia. This game challenges both players: The Spanish must struggle to coordinate the actions of their large and enthusiastic but mostly untrained army, while the French must decide whether to try and hold against superior numbers or conduct a fighting withdrawal back to Madrid. With Spanish guerrillas, a baggage train full of looted treasure, and treacherous Swiss mercenaries who might change sides in the middle of the battle, Bail&amp;eacute;n 20 offers players plenty of military adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considered one of Wellington&amp;rsquo;s finest battles, Arapiles 20 (July, 1812) from Lance McMillan focuses on the hard-fought meeting engagement between his veteran British forces and Mareschal Marmont&amp;rsquo;s French army in the hills south of Salamanca. With two armies of equal strength, victory requires careful planning, precise maneuvers, and exact timing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by unexpected events. Will the British player be able to pounce on a fleeting French blunder to win the day (as happened historically), or will the French be able to simply bludgeon his opponent into submission? In Arapiles 20, the outcome of this famous battle is in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rudi Garcia's Talavera 20 recreates the major battle which occurred near the city of Talavera de la Reina on 27 to 28 July 1809. One player commands the French army under Napoleon's brother, Joseph, the self-proclaimed King of Spain, and the other commands the combined allied armies of Great Britain (under Sir Arthur Wellesley) and Spain (under Captain-General Gregorio de la Cuesta). After his attempt to liberate Madrid from the French was repulsed, Cuesta's army fell back to Talavera, which was covered by the British. Starting with a daring night attack, Joseph repeatedly attempted to push the allies out of their superb defensive positions, to no avail. As the French, can you find and exploit a weak spot in the allied lines? As the allies, can you hold your shaky alliance together and fend off the French (all the while keeping a nervous eye out for a second French army that might unexpectedly show up behind your armies)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bussaco 20: Second Edition, from designer Lance McMillan, features the battle occurring on 26 September 1810, during the early stages of the French invasion of Portugal. One player commands the French army of Marshal Andr&amp;eacute; Mass&amp;eacute;na, while the other controls Sir Arthur Wellesley, Viscount of Wellington's combined British and reconstituted Portuguese army. Historically, a distracted Mass&amp;eacute;na launched a series of uncoordinated frontal assaults straight up a steep ridge into the teeth of the British defenses, suffering heavy losses before Wellington elected to disengage and fall back to Lisbon. Can you as Mass&amp;eacute;na avoid the same mistakes, or as Wellington can you use your superior position to achieve a decisive victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
