			<description>Attention: baby animals have run away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The baby animal cards are shuffled and put face down in the middle of the playing board. Each player chooses one koala and puts it on the first playing field.&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a koala space, the player has to draw a baby animal card. If the player doesn't have that baby card already, it is put on the corresponding playing field on the board. Otherwise put the card back under the deck.&lt;br/&gt;If a player lands on the clock, the player misses one turn. When the player lands on the 'vet', the player takes the vet and may roll again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that finds 4 different baby animals first and holds the vet, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
