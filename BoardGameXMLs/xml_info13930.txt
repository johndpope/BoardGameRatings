							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flußkönig: Directors Cut</name>
									
			<description>Here is a description from Spielbox:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple of months ago, a mini edition of Flusskoenig (River King) was released. The new release of Flusskoenig &amp;quot;Director's Cut&amp;quot; expands the game with several new components that were originally planned for the first game but ended up being cut so that the game duration didn't run too long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, as is usual with NMG games, Flusskoenig &amp;quot;Director's Cut&amp;quot; will run at least 3 hours (for comparison, Flusskoenig clocked in at 90-120 minutes). Once again, the idea of the game is to transport wares via ship. The players lay out a river network at the start of the game, one that can twist and turn as desired and provide either 'realistic surroundings' or a 'fantasy world'. Players then get money and can buy expensive ships, ship enhancements and branch offices - the things that bring the points necessary for victory. Locks, toll booths, fog and low water make sure that the riverboat captains have to work hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Director's Cut&amp;quot; version expands the game with new river tiles with additional hazards, new ship types and wares, a deck of &amp;quot;truly evil&amp;quot; action and event cards, and other accessories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
