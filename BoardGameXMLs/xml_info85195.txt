							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strat-O-Matic Pro Football</name>
									
			<description>From the Strat-O-Matic Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Strat-O-Matic Pro Football?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strat-O-Matic has created the most realistic simulation of statistically accurate pro football for more than 40 years. Every player is rated with statistical precision in every phase of his talent &amp;ndash; passing, running and receiving. Offensive linemen are rated separately for run blocking and pass blocking. Defenders are rated on their ability to stuff the run, shut down the pass and sack the quarterback. The real league leaders will rise to the top in your games. The underachievers will undermine your game plan. Each player&amp;rsquo;s strengths &amp;ndash; and weaknesses &amp;ndash; will come to life before your eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all classic games, Strat-O-Matic Pro Football is easy to learn swiftly, yet challenging enough to fascinate for a lifetime. Gamers keep coming back every year for the updated teams with the latest players, and for the endless enjoyment of Strat-O-Matic&amp;rsquo;s unique blend of realism, statistical accuracy and ease of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
