			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The People have been given a warning by the good ancestor spirits of an impending disaster that will wipe the People from the face of the earth. The only way to save themselves, the spirits have foretold, is to journey into the heart of the Deep Desert, where even the People fear to tread, in search of the Promised Land. Until now, even the wisest of the tribes believed the Promised Land to be a place of myth and legend. And so your tribe has gathered up their possessions and prepared as best they could for a journey into the Deep Desert and the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the impending disaster? What will they find in the Deep Desert? Does the Promised Land exist? And will the other tribes be saved as well, or will they be the only remnants of the People who will survive to find this Promised Land? These are all questions you will answer during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
