			<description>Appeared in the August 1991 issue of Games magazine, page 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two player strategy game is based on trying to cross the board with your pieces to get into a goal area, removing it.  The first player to get 3 of his pieces into the goal wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unusual mechanic to this game is that you can move any piece on your turn, yours or your opponent's, any unblocked distance on a line.  If you move your pieces, the end space must have a different number of adjacent pieces from the space where it started, while if you move an opposing piece, it must end adjacent to the same number of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
