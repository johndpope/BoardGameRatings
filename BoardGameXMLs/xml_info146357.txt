							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dust Tactics: Dust-48 &quot;Recon Mickey&quot;</name>
									
			<description>As the war rages on all fronts the Allies feel the need to have more efficient recon troops: scouts that can get to the enemy before the main assault. These highly trained soldiers needed a new vehicle to do their job safely, and they were rewarded with the Medium Combat Walker M2-H &amp;ldquo;Recon Mickey&amp;rdquo;. This lightly armed walker should not be treated lightly! As its turret was removed, it gained tremendous speed while still mounting a few machine guns for close ground and air defense. The highly trained crew of a Recon Mickey is very capable of calling in an airstrike or an artillery strike on enemy positions, making it invaluable to any Allied army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Dust-48 models are official models by Dust Studio but are not yet legal for tournament play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
