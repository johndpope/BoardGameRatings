							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gloop</name>
									
			<description>A meteor crashed down upon the world releasing a primordial slime upon the world. The slime showed signs of limited intelligence like that of a K9. So you have taken it upon yourself to protect and raise the little creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gloop is a 1-3 player game where you fight off Hostile slime eating monsters, while tending to the needs that Gloop may have, to complete a hidden goal that will come up later. You accomplish this by accomplishing each event that turns out over the course of the game.  They range from hostiles that want to eat Gloop to satisfying Gloops current mood by doing what the card asks of you.  The goal must be accomplished before the event deck runs out for you to be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
