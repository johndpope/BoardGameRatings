							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ghost Light (Version 1.2)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Light is a unique game that focuses on Ghosts existing in an afterlife.  Players generate a Ghost (Character) with various attributes.  The game does not presuppose any religious background to the afterlife, but instead presents a unique setting.  Ghosts have an Age, but this reflects the number of previous lives they have had, from 1 to more than 50.  A Ghost's power is based upon their Age so players should share Ghosts of similar Age.  Age yields &amp;quot;Emotion Points&amp;quot; which are used to purchase ranks in various Emotions.  The Emotion Rank determines how many dice are in a success roll pool.  Some Ghosts have Skills, Quirks, Merits, and Flaws which are primarily narrative tags.  Ghosts attempt to effect the material world by using raw emotion and stimuli.  The system uses a standard unopposed roll versus Difficulty or an opposed roll against roll.  Ghosts can gain in experience and power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note &amp;quot;Ghost Light&amp;quot; was used for the initial version (this version), but &amp;quot;Ghostlight&amp;quot; was used for subsequent versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
