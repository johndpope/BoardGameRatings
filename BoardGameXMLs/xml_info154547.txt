			<description>Pleiades, an early adaptation of dominoes to triangular pieces, was granted a patent in 1879.  The game consists of a central six-pointed star piece, each point being marked on both outer edges with a number of dots from one to six, and thirty-six triangular tiles marked along their edges with numbers ranging from one to six.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin the game, the tiles are placed face down and shuffled, and two or more players draw an agreed upon number.  The player who has drawn a tile with three sixes goes first, matching a tile to one of the central star's numbered edges.  The players then take turns matching their tiles to the original in order to create a hexagon shaped star adjoining the central piece.  If no match is possible, a player must pass.  The player who completes the hexagonal star gets one point, and the next player begins another star by matching a tile to the central star.  If no player can match a piece, that star is blocked and play begins on another.  The player scoring the most points (there are a maximum of six) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
