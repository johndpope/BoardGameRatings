							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Il Domino Della Giornata</name>
									
			<description>A language learning game, designed to study the conjugation of Italian verbs (both regular and irregular). With the 48 tiles the game tells the story of a day in the life of the Grilli family. Each tile has a picture on the left side and a text on the right side. In the text the verbs are all in the infinitive form, and have to be conjugated when the tile is played, but it can be checked in the instructions whether the correct form was used.&lt;br/&gt;All the tiles are numbered. The game starts with the tile number 1 and based on the description tile number 2 needs to be found and so on.&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played solo or in large groups (e.g. Italian classes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
