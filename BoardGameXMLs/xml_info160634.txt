			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sports Flip! is a falling piece puzzle game in which players must group tiles of the same type of sports ball together, then clear them from the screen by landing the appropriate piece of sports equipment ('bats') on top of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The balls and bats used in the game are: tennis balls and rackets (yellow pieces), cricket balls and bats (red), soccer balls and boots (green) and baseballs and bats (blue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each piece that falls is composed of two tiles which may be bats or balls, and these can rotated through 90 degree increments with Z and X keys.  Pieces are moved left, right and dropped with the arrow keys, and the up key flips the piece, changing balls into bats and vice versa, hence the name of the game.  You only have a limited number of flips available, displayed at the bottom of the screen.  Points are awarded for the number of tiles cleared, and combos of clearances score highly.  Play continues until the pieces stack to the top of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
