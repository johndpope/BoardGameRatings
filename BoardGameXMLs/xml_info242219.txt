			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of genuine books on psychology, and related disciplines, such as psychiatry, that could be found on a bookshelf. The list has the book's name, author, publication date, original language, if not English, and some notes on the topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the books are professional in nature; others cater to a wider audience. Publication dates go from the end of the nineteenth century, at the beginnings of modern psychology, to the beginning of the twenty-first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The list can be used to flesh out an appropriate bookshelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30. Instinct and the Unconscious: A Contribution to a Biological Theory of the Psycho-Neuroses by William H. R. Rivers (1920, a series of lectures on psycho-neuroses and the treatment of those from the war, and republished papers based on clinical experiences)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
