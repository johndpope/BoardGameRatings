			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Battle of Enpebyn, not all of the dwarves from Solanos Mor marched back to their Enclave. A substantial number of dwarves turned south instead, marching through the Coryani Empire, their purpose and destination unknown. Now their true mission is revealed, as adventurers and explorers have been called to the very edge of the Fellglade for an expedition into Malfea itself. Will you join the first group of non-Elorii in a thousand years to deliberately violate the borders of what may very well be the most violent and xenophobic nation on the face of Onara?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: This adventure occurs at the same (in-game) time as LA-SP5-09: Emissaries. Therefore, players should not play the same character in both adventures. The order in which the two adventures are played does not matter. This adventure draws on material that was first presented in LA-AP4-01: Queen's Castle. Play of the prior adventure is helpful, but not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STANDARD adventure is designed for 10th to 20th level characters (APLs 11-19).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
