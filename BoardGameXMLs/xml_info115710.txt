			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the west of the city of Burden's Peak is a large, fertile plains area. Scattered across the rolling plains are small farming villages that rely on the fertility of the plains to keep them supplied in crops that they sell in Burden's Peak. They don&amp;rsquo;t make much money from them, but without the crops, these families might well be destitute and starve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in the streets of Burden's Peak, the PCs are approached by a frantic young girl. The frightened girl is crying, and begs the PCs to come help her small village. She tells the PCs that &amp;quot;monsters&amp;quot; came, stole their crops, ransacked the village, and abducted some of the residents. She says her father sent her to Burden's Peak to find help while he looked for his wife who came up missing in the raid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
