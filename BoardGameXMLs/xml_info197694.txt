							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Over the Top: The Eastern Front</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2364: The war, mostly on the continent of Magos, between the Elven Compact and the Alliance of Many. Now nearly a year old, the Great War has seen trench lines divide Magos and war divide her nations. Across the continent the magic of Magos&amp;rsquo; antiquity mixes with the industry of her today, producing monstrous mechanisms for a conflict with no end in sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the east of Magos, the ancient monarchies of Alheim and Durwuz Ruf have plunged their countries into the world war which has engulfed Magos. The Eastern Front of the Great War is a grim frontier battle, stretched across the broad and wild borders of Durwuz Ruf and forced by geography into a grim and narrow point with Alheim constantly tittering on the brink of conquest. The Dwarvern army of Durwuz Ruf has become notorious for its hard-fighting infantry and bear-mounted cavalry. The Easter Front features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A companion to existing background in the Character Primer and Guide to the Past.&lt;br/&gt;    An overview of the geography of the Eastern Front, and details of precisely how its warfare differs from the Western.&lt;br/&gt;    All new monsters and magic items specific to Over the Top&amp;rsquo;s World War One themed setting.&lt;br/&gt;    A brand new class to suit the Eastern Front&amp;rsquo;s frontier-like battles, the Scout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
