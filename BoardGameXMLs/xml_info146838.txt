							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Miskatonic University: The University Guide Book</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome To The University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world sees Miskatonic University as a solid New England institution. Its professors and departments are on par with those of any Ivy League school, among the best in the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founded posthumously in 1765 by seacaptain Jeremiah Orne, Miskatonic University grew from the acquired assets, and debts, of ailing Arkham College. Orne laid claim to the older 1690 institute which he (from beyond the grave) invigorated with new life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He had accumulated many books and curious objects during his voyages along the eastern seaboard and to the Caribbean and South America. His curiosities were to stock a museum; his money funded a college; his books became its library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISKATONIC UNIVERSITY provides a coherent setting and background for running investigations using the CALL OF CTHULHU roleplaying rules. Chapters include Welcome To The University, Exploring the Campus, The Library and Exhibit Museum, M.U. By Department, Administrative Trivia, People At M.U., Social Life, In And Out Of The Academic World, and It's The End Of The World As We Know It. It also features a complete index, and an array of handouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
