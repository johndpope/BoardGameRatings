							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lair of Putzuputzu</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local landholder, Lord Mulligan, will contact the party with a proposition. Asking around before meeting him will reveal that while the lord was known to be wanton and cruel in his youth, he has become a well-loved philanthropist in his old age. Lord Mulligan will confess to the party that he long ago made a deal with a demon: Mulligan&amp;rsquo;s soul in exchange for power and wealth. However, Lord Mulligan has calmed with age, and now longs for a second chance. Should the party accept, he will use his link to the demon to send the adventurers on their quest to: The Realm of Putzuputzu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
