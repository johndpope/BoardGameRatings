			<description>SimplyClever.Cards Arithmetic combines traditional playing cards, math flash cards and the multiplication table from 0 to 12. The deck has 52 cards in 4 colours numbered 0-12, and 4 jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The jokers have mathematical operators *, +, - and = so you can make your own calculations using the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to function like a regular deck of cards, SimplyClever.Cards Arithmetic allows you to play any regular card game you want to - but with a mathematical twist! Game examples: 500, Blackjack, Bridge, Casino, Crazy Eights, Durak, Egyptian Ratscrew, Go Fish, Hearts, Memory, Old Maid, Poker, Rummikub, Slap Jack, Snap, UNO, Whist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key mechanic is that each card lists 5 multiplication products at the bottom, below the main card value (ranging from 0 to 12). Mathematical versions of regular card games are created by combining three cards such that the product of two card values can be found among the 5 listed on a third card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E.g. if you take one card numbered 11 and one card numbered 12, you need to match these with a third card that has the product 132 at the bottom. These three cards can represent different equations such as multiplication 11x12=132, division 132/12=11 or even fractions 1/12=11/132.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
