			<description>You and your best buddy, Kaka, are two young dudes cruising the back streets of ancient Egypt looking for a cheap double-hump wash and blow dry for your camel, Phredd. Unfortunately, being somewhat shy of means (i.e., broke), you are unable to afford the more reputable establishments. Acting on Kaka&amp;rsquo;s dubious suggestion, you&lt;br/&gt;head out to the edge of town to a place your mother told you never to go: the old, abandoned tower built by that nutcase, K&amp;rsquo;Dak. K&amp;rsquo;Dak was a washout from pyramid building school. He just could never get the pyramid concept straight. Big on the bottom and small on top. How is this hard? Anyway, his attempt at building a small summer&lt;br/&gt;pyramid for the pharaoh ended up as a six-story, straight up and down tower. The pharaoh was not amused and K&amp;rsquo;Dak was banished from the community in disgrace. That should have been the end of it, but K&amp;rsquo;Dak had in mind one last futile gesture before he left. He returned to the tower, hid small amounts of gold throughout the structure and then set up a booby trap for anyone who tried to retrieve the gold. However, before he could spread a story of a fabulous treasure residing in his tower, he was run out of town by the authorities and never seen again. The pharaoh intended to condemn the place for demolition, but got distracted with a border war and K&amp;rsquo;Dak&amp;rsquo;s tower was largely&lt;br/&gt;forgotten. And now, you and Kaka are heading to this questionable monument on the outside chance that there is something inside that you can barter for a camel makeover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;K&amp;rsquo;Dak&amp;rsquo;s Tower of Confusion and Camel Wash is a game of exploration. You and your opponent climb through an abandoned tower hoping to collect enough treasure in order to pay for a bath for Phredd. Things go just fine until one of you reaches the top layer, at which time the tower starts shaking itself apart. You then have to get out before the whole structure collapses on you while still finding enough treasure to make the expedition worthwhile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
