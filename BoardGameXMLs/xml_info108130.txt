			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware the Wishtaker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When human technology hits a snag, there can be all kinds of Hell to pay. When the Hellish technology that forms Villain-Net goes bad, though, even Hell may have trouble footing the tab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the machinations of Hell meet with the spiritual enigma that is the Slimeys, no one could predict that the outcome would be a being so powerful and so dark that it could alter the balance between good and evil itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She is called the Wishtaker, and once she takes your wish from you, she has only begun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement for Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game picks up where Villain-Net leaves off , and goes into a dark and horrible place. It also relies on material from our supplements Inner Darkness and Yiffy, Yaoi, and Yahooey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Readers are cautioned: once the Wishtaker enters your Hot Chicks campaign, no one there may ever be safe again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
