			<description>Face an unlikely dilemma: you can &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; one of these famous people. Who will you choose? If the choice is between Hugh Grant and Brad Pitt, you might think you can&amp;rsquo;t lose. But what if your choices are Yosemite Sam or Elmer Fudd? Janet Reno or Julia Child? Thankfully, this game comes with a Celibacy Card, but this escape route may only be used once per game. The object of the game is to correctly predict what the other players will answer. There&amp;rsquo;s betting and scoring, but the real fun is choosing! Comes with 360 Challenging Choices, 50 Voting Cards, two game booklets, a Who Do Board, a score pad and a pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
