			<description>WISH YOU WERE HERE...? is a travel trivia game based on Thames Television's holiday program of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turns to answer questions valued at &amp;pound;25, &amp;pound;50, &amp;pound;100 or &amp;pound;200.  The correct answering of a question earns money in the form of travelers' cheques and the opportunity to throw the dice to win one of six tokens that are collected on a postcard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to have a complete (i.e. with all six tokens) Wish you Were Here...? postcard and &amp;pound;2,000 or more in travelers cheques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
