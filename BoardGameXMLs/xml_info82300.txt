			<description>3D Deathchase is a 1983 computer game written for the ZX Spectrum by Mervyn Estcourt and published by Micromega in the UK and Ventamatic in Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a motorcycle-riding mercenary as he pursues two other motorcycles, one blue and one yellow, through a forest. Each enemy motorcycle destroyed is worth $1000 (i.e. points) to the player.  The player's motorcycle is equipped with forward-firing guns with which to shoot its quarry. The projectiles can be controlled mid-flight simply by steering the bike.  If both enemy motorcycles are destroyed, the player moves to a night version of the same level.  If both enemy motorcycles on that level are destroyed, the player moves on to a daytime level of the next stage (with more trees to avoid).  There are also tanks and helicopters which appear on the horizon and can be shot for bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place over eight stages. When stage eight is completed, the game returns to the start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical response&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It received a positive reaction from the gaming press, garnering praise for what was then an advanced form of 3D gameplay.  A contemporary review in the ZX Spectrum gaming magazine CRASH described 3D Deathchase as &amp;quot;an extremely simple idea for a game, and utterly compelling to play&amp;quot; and awarded the game 92%.  In 1992 it was nominated as the best Spectrum game ever in the magazine Your Sinclair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remakes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Leyden's remake, Death Chase 2002 was highlighted in Edge magazine's Retro special.  It was described as 'pleasant enough' but lacking the feel of the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'PlayStation Home' Alternate Reality Game 'Xi' featured a minigame based on the premise of '3D Deathchase' in which a player controlled a motorbike to weave through a forest of trees and pursue a helicopter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;3D Deathchase&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
