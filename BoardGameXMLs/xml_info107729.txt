			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest tank battle of World War II re-created down to every tank, every gun, and every infantryman!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The History&lt;br/&gt;In the summer of 1943, Hitler launched Operation Citadel, the massive north-south pincer assault against the Kursk salient.  The Russians, alerted by their intelligence network, were well prepared for the attack.  The battle that followed was to be the largest tank battle of World War II.  Germany's IX Army, responsible for the northern strike, advanced only six miles and was immediately repulsed.  The IV Panzer Army, attacking from the south, was more successful.  Before being defeated, it was able to penetrate 25 miles to the town of Prokhorovka, just 50 miles short of Kursk.  OBJECTIVE: KURSK is the grand-tactical simulation of this southern conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;Consider its scope: 12 Panzer and Panzer Grenadier divisions and 9 Soviet armored and mechanized infantry corps - a sum total of more than 4000 tanks!  It is the first computer game ever to resolve such a massive battle down to every tank, every gun, every infantryman!  How did we do it?  By harnessing the power of the computer to its fullest.  Our sophisticated program takes care of all of the number crunching and administrative headaches so you won't have to.  Not only is a game of such detail and scale practical, it is also fun and fast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting early in July 1943, this game gives the Germans 11 days to take their objective: Kursk.  As in the real battle, the task is anything but easy.  If you're playing the Germans, your advance will be impeded by the endless minefields that your engineers must clear.  Then, there is the rain - the frequent, awful downpour that turns the Russian countryside into paralyzing gullies.  All this before you even worry about the 2000 T-34 and KV-1 tanks of the Russian Army waiting for you!  Your only advantages are the superior morale of your troops and the fact that you move first.  But perhaps, these two factors - coupled with your skill and cunning - will be enough to change the historical outcome of the Battle of Kursk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Gary Grigsby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
