							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barney&#039;s Hide &amp; Seek Game</name>
									
			<description>In this game, the objective is to move Barney around four themed levels and locate five children and five presents that are hiding throughout the level. Unlike action games, the player is not allowed to die (a lack of a proper health bar also indicates Barney's inability to die). Should the player find all the children and presents in different levels, they would be rewarded with a &amp;quot;special surprise&amp;quot;. During the surprise, the purple balloons are popped while confetti and streamers are drizzled in the presence of excited children in addition to Barney and Baby Bop. Barney's Hide and Seek has a certain medieval/fantasy look because modern technology does not appear in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When nowhere near an object to interact with, Barney can blow kisses in the air complete with flying heart symbols. Locating a child results in giving him or her a hug. Barney can even fly on balloons, float on clouds, and jump on nearby platforms. Sound quality can be questionable on certain parts; &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot; tends to be one of the words that the game has trouble vocalizing correctly. The inability for Barney to die is indicated by him refusing to fall off floating platforms; instead there is a safety lecture handed out by Barney so kids can learn to be careful like him. Cloud jumping is only possible when the traffic light is showing a green signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Barney's Hide &amp;amp; Seek Game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
