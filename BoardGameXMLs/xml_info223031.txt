							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lord Orchaos&#039; Lair</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orchoas the Orc leader of savage Dark Hill Clan has been taken control of by a parasite (created by the chaotic gods) that enter his mouth in a drink drawn from the water in his new lair. The parasite latches on to his tongue it releases a venom that numbs the tongue slowly drains the blood and replaces the dead tongue as it grows once merged with the body it begins to influence the host till it becomes the dominate force and cause as much chaos as it can. This has driven Orchaos insane as the parasite tries to take over and he is acting more fierce and reckless then an average orc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
