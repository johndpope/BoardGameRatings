			<description>Somewhat based on the obscure 1961 game show, players (or teams for more than two players) begin with $5,000, a 24-square playing rack, and 24 shutters valued at $0 to $1,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team selects a word or phrase for the other team to guess. The mystery word or phrase is secretly entered letter by letter with a wax pencil onto the 24-square rack and then the squares are covered with the shutters. Players strategically place the shutters and the shutter value is secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players then take turns calling out numbers to be revealed on their opponent's rack. Players must pay (to the opponent) the value on the shutter they call out. A correct guess earns $1,000, while a wrong guess costs $1,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until five phrases have been guessed or someone runs out of money. In the case of the former, the player/team with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
