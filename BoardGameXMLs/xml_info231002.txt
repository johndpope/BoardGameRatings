			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arogan the Arcane has a book coming out. It&amp;rsquo;s rather lengthy, and almost incomprehensible to anyone without a higher degree in transmutation magic, but he is convinced it will change the world. Its title? Lex Monstrorum: A Practical Guide to the Identification and Subjugation of Beasts, Aberrations and Other Fantastical Beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arogan has been labouring away at this enormous tome for years, and it&amp;rsquo;s nearing completion. Just a few more experiments to make, and his research will be complete, along with his reputation as a wizard of great renown. Should a few mishaps happen to occur during some of his more dangerous experiments, that is surely a price worth paying for science?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
