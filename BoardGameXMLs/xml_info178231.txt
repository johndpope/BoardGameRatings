							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Honnoji</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box (translated):&lt;br/&gt;Japan's largest coup, the Honnoji Incident, happened before dawn on June 2, 1582. Inside the burning temple, Oda Nobunaga is said to have committed suicide but his body was never found....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;Honnoji uses tiles to select action locations, including movement, tile pickup, fighting, and recovery. The tiles are placed in a grid in front of the player, and the actions that happen are determined by the relative locations of the tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the temple burns, you must move your samurai through the temple, collecting treasures (tiles) and avoiding other samurai and the fire. The winner will be the player who has collected and (managed to keep) the most treasure at the end of 6 rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
