			<description>Infect is a 1-4 player turn based strategy board game where you play the role of an unnamed disease and try to destroy the world. The game features several play mode and levels of play to learn the game at a steadier pace. It features unique strategic elements not seen in other card/board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a mostly card based game but not classified as a trading card game (Like Magic the Gathering) nor a deck building game (Like Dominion). It's a good, plain, draw a card, strategy card game and you have to adjust as the game goes on depending on what you draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds where each player takes a turn. The turn order unfolds in 7 steps and you play with 5 stacks of cards: Symptoms, Resistances, Transmissions, Locations and Objectives . A basic turn is composed of these actions :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Get your turn's energy&lt;br/&gt;    Draw some cards&lt;br/&gt;    Play the cards in your hand&lt;br/&gt;    Attempt to kill&lt;br/&gt;    Attempt to infect the world&lt;br/&gt;    Complete objectives&lt;br/&gt;    Discard unwanted cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To infect, you must first play cards from your hand that you draw on each turn. Laying down a location makes it possible to infect it, but you also need one or more symptom to make that happen. Getting some transmission vectors and resistances will help you along the way to reduce negative aspects or increase the infectivity of your disease. As the game proggresses, you will play objective cards and complete them to get victory points which will eventually make you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
