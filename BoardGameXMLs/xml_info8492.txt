							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La Battaglia dei Cinque Eserciti</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;So began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it was very terrible. Upon one side were the Goblins and the wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a classical wargame. The rules are quite simple: on one side there are Men, Dwarves and Elves trying to defend the gates and the slopes of the Lonely Mountain. The Free People are few but can use the advantage of the terrain (mountains and rivers). The game is played in turns (12): the Free People must defend the gates and try to survive the dark hordes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each units has a movement value and a combat value (attack and defence); the combat value of the defender can be modified by the terrain. The leaders (King of Orcs for the goblins; Wizard, Dwarven Hero and the kings of Elves, Man and Dwarves for the Free People) are really strong in supporting the troups and could really change the odds of the battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goblins could also win the game killing all the troops and leaders of one of the Free People army (Elves, Dwarves or Men).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close to the end, the Eagles and the Bear-Man come to help the Free People.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
