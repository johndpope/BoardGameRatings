			<description>The Usual Suspects is a deduction game playable with common components.  Players attempt to deduce which of twelve spies are innocent - with no knowledge, initially, if any spies are in fact innocent.  Players record their suspicions during the game, and score them only when the game ends, such that everyone remains involved until the game is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was released to the public in the Re: Geek of the Week #69 - Joe Huber thread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
