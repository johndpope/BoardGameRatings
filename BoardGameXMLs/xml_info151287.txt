			<description>Flash Point: Fire Rescue - Critically Wounded Victims is a Kickstarter promo given to backers of the Flash Point: Fire Rescue - Extreme Danger Kickstarter campaign. The promo consists of three special POI tokens with a victim and a black cross that can be added to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A critically wounded victim cannot be carried until they have been treated by the medic. Once treated, they act as untreated victims in that they are carried rather than led.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critically Wounded Victims cannot be treated by the medic more than once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
