You can play with 11 &amp;quot;football miniatures&amp;quot; (from Miggle Toy, or kaskey kids for example), or with 11 tokens representing players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gridbowl is a game of PROGRAMMATION : each turn, you use a PlayBook card. This PlayBook card gives the type of movement for each specific player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your opponent does the same with his own PlayBook card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Playbook cards are chosen, players from each team act alternatively.&lt;br/&gt;So there is a lot of suspense in GriddBowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you must anticipate opponent's moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
