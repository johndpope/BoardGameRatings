			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Gnomes are the plucky smaller cousins of dwarves. They are noticeably different in several physical aspects, as well as demeanor. Gnomes have friendly, curious eyes, and large, sensitive noses, which are a point of pride; the larger the nose, the greater the prestige. They wear long beards and mustaches, and decorate themselves with fine jewels, as well as many small pockets filled with toys and contraptions. They also enjoy illusion magic and chicanery, using it to entertain and protect themselves... This short pdf has been created to allow gamers to play a Gnome character from 1st to 9th level in Labyrinth Lord(TM) and other Basic Edition rpgs. Included is a description of the race class, some suggestions for their proficiency with contraptions / mechanical devices as well as their use of Illusionary Magic (including a suggested spell list by spell level). Now you can play a Gnome!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
