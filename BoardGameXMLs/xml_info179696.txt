							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Child&#039;s Game of Barbarossa</name>
									
			<description>Why &amp;quot;Child's Game?&amp;quot; is usually the first thing that's asked, and after the subject matter is explained that question is usually followed up with &amp;quot;Is that really a topic for a children's game?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are multiple answers, from the ironic to the literal. We've taught kids how to play wargames on this: a 11-year-old and two 13-year-olds. It's also a good game to start a novice wargamer on. It's not too complicated and the rules are pretty easy. A better question is &amp;quot;Why would two old wargamers who've played all the monster games design and play a game like this?&amp;quot; Because it captures the ebb and flow of the East Front, it's playable in 2 hours, and the outcome is rarely decided until the final turn if the players are evenly matched. It's pretty likely that neither player will quit in 1942 or 1943 either. But enough of that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is 11 x 17, and there are about 75 counters of equal game-play value, but of widely varying &amp;quot;flavors&amp;quot; from the &amp;quot;5th Ski Brigade&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;Stalingrad Front.&amp;quot; The map is a grid of squares, somewhat resembling a checkerboard over which the map has been superimposed. Movement is along rail lines and overland, but bad terrain cannot be entered. Turns are quarterly. Combat is resolved without dice, and the CRT varies from turn to turn. There are subtleties in strategy and movement that become more apparent after a couple of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are on-line for inspection. See the publisher's web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
