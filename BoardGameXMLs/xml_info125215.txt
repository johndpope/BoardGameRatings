							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crossroads</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Autumn has descended on the land. A fact that becomes especially visible in places dotted with broad-leaved trees like this spot where a number of gravel paved paths meet. The leaves of the trees flanking the roads have turned a hundred shades of yellow and orange in the past few days and it wont be long now until the trees shrug of their foliage entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three small roads meet in this place. Old and weathered wooden signs indicating where each of them leads. At the center of the crossroads a circle of soft ground has been set aside from the roads by stones just high enough to provide somewhat comfortable seats and an especially tall tree grows at the circles center to provide this resting spot with shades during the hot days of summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
