			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While digging through my old Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons folders looking for cool stuff to post, I stumbled across this map: a monastery and repository of knowledge that's been sacked by a Big Bad and his horde of minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the adventure, the PC's were on a quest to uncover the location of several artifact swords, and that quest led them to this location: a monastery (built into the side of a mountain) that also served as the oldest library in the land, holding knowledge that extended back in history for hundreds of (human) generations. Unfortunately, the place had recently been attacked by an evil wizard, Eregul, who had set up camp within - accompanied by his pet dragon and his humanoid horde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
