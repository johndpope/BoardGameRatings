			<description>The Great War is over, but its scars have yet to heal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you play a pistol-packing elf or magic-slinging private eye? Fast-driving bootlegger or tango-dancing troll?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the Roaring 20's and everyone wants to forget the horrors of a war that spanned continents and dimensions. But the changes it wrought are not so easily dismissed. Humanity struggles to understand a world of re-awakened magic and folklore come to life. The fae, failed invaders from the lands of faery, find themselves adrift in the unfamiliar modern world, living relics of the past. It is an era of jazz and exploration, of art deco and danger; a time when the fists and courage of individuals can determine the course of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fae Noir is a role-playing game set in the chaotic, pivotal decade of an alternate world where creatures of mythology returned from self-imposed exile at the height of World War I. This, the core book, contains everything gamemasters and players need to run adventures in the gritty world of Fae Noir, including an all new game engine and one of the most flexible character creation systems anywhere. Fae Noir - make the 20's roar louder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
