			<description>The game is divided into two parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first half of the game, players run their 'horses' around the paddock to train them (by collecting different coloured hurdle tiles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When training is complete, all players enter the Steeplechase Race by playing their hurdles around the track to hinder their opponents.  Horses require a certain event on a spinner to make a jump... each hurdle makes it more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to cross the finish line in the big Race is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
