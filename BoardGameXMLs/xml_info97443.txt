							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Murder on the Zinderneuf</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1936. The player takes on the role of a famous detective who is traveling across the Atlantic in the world's most prestigious zeppelin - The Zinderneuf. A murder is committed during the trip and it is up to the player to solve the crime. However, in twelve hours the zeppelin will land and the killer will be able to vanish without a trace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played from a top-down viewpoint. Actions are selected via a small pop up menu at the top of the screen. The game length is fixed at 12 in-game hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose from a set of different detectives with varying personalities. The game also features different murderers and victims which makes it highly replayable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
