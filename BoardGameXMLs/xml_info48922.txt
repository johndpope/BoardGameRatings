							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terrible Swift Ford</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's been over three decades since the Nuclear War ushered in the Second Dark Age. For thirty years, the survivors have struggled to restore some measure of law and order to North America. The Southwest now stands ready to start the tedious process of recivilization, but the Second Civil War threatens to uproot this fledgling society before it can spread its brances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the First Civil War, the Second Civil War pits American against American. But this time, the soldiers will fight their skirmishes on the long-neglected highways of the Southwest. The cavalry will ride to battle not on exhausted, half-starved horses, but in super-charged Fords and Chevrolets armed with rocket launchers and twin machine guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Terrible Swift Ford' is an action-packed, fast-paced 32 page adventure scenario for use with the TIMEMASTER(tm) role-playing game. Inside you'll find all the maps, historical background, characters and plot encounters you'll need for hours of high-speed adventure!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
