			<description>From the box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn about time as you help your mouse climb to the top fo the clock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game:&lt;br/&gt;To correctly match the activity cards with the clock and reach the top of the clock first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 Clock playing board&lt;br/&gt;2 Clock hands and pivot&lt;br/&gt;16 Illustrated activity cards&lt;br/&gt;18 Clock cards&lt;br/&gt;4 Mice and plastic stands&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game&lt;br/&gt;To correctly match the activity cards with the clock cards and reach the top of the clock first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play&lt;br/&gt;1. The hands are attached to the clock face.  The playing board is assembled and placed in the centre of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Four activity cards are dealt to each player, picture side up.  Any leftover cards are discarded, along with the matching clock cards.  The remaining clock cards are spread out face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Each player chooses a mouse counter and places it in the 'start' area of the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The first player begins by turning over one of the clock cards on the table.  They read aloud the time and look to see if it matchs the time on one of their activity cards.  If a match is made, they move the clock hands on the playing board to the correct time, move their mouse forward one space and keep the clock card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. If the time on the clock card does not match any of the player's activity cards, the clock card is returned to the table, face down, and play moves onto the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. If the clock card shows 'one o'clock', each player must move their mouse back one space on the clock board.  All players also return one of their clock cards to the table.  The matching activity card is then back in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7.  Play continues until one player has matched all their cards and has reached the top of the clock playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning the game&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have match all their activity cards with the clock cards and reached the last space at the top of the clock playing board is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
