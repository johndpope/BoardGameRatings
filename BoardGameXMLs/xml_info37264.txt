			<description>AT THE BEACH, IN THE CAR,OR AT HOME...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...this game is for anyone who loves Cape Cod, but especially for those who are looking for a fun way to explore the Cape and experience it as they never have before. As you meander around the map, you'll be asked questions, like any trivia game, but the answers lead to wonderful little-known beaches and natural areas, local legends and language, working farms and festivals, historic sites, golf courses, colorful establishments and more, all of which are waiting to be enjoyed every day in towns all over the Cape and islands if you know where to look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
