			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 16 inch by 20 inch, floor plan of a Tactical Room , with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The humans near their end. Our control of this planet will be absolute!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Alien Commander just before an explosion rocks the facility&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Room is a small interior map of a science fiction hallway that leads to a tactical command and control room in the south part of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Room is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War&amp;rsquo;s End:  A bipedal alien race has been systematically wiping out a human colony of a fringe world. The genocide is nearly complete with the last pockets of humanity&amp;rsquo;s resistance fighting for their survival in the largest colony city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of human resistance fighters have volunteered to attack the main alien base on the other side of the planet. The hope is that most of the alien warriors are fighting on the front lines, leaving their command and control lightly guarded and vulnerable to a surprise attack far from the front. Perhaps the colony is doomed and this mission is a suicide run, but if the colonists can kill the alien leaders and make taking the capital costly enough, then the aliens will be too depleted to repeat this atrocity on neighboring colonies before support from the core worlds reaches the sector to stop the alien incursion into human space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group can play either the human resistance fighters assaulting the facility or the alien warriors trying to defend their commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
