			<description>SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Arc Rise Fantasia​ (アークライズファンタジア) is a fantasy role-playing game developed by imageepoch and published by Marvelous Entertainment for the Wii. It is imageepoch's first game not developed for a handheld game console. Arc Rise Fantasia was released in Japan on June 4, 2009, and in North America on July 20, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;The game is a turn-based role-playing game. The player and the enemy both move and fight during the same phase of battle, but the turn order is determined by the actions taken. Parties consist of three characters who each share a single AP gauge, which empties as various actions are performed. During certain parts of the game, the active team may be made up of four members instead of three, though the fourth can only be controlled by the AI. Multiple attacks can be chained together in combos, and the player may execute a special attack called a Trinity Act when each of three characters uses a certain ability. There are also summon beasts in the game called Rogress (ログレス).&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arc Rise Fantasia&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
