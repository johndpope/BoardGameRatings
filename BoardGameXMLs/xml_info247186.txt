							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TooT!: A Nerdy Little Game</name>
									
			<description>A TooT! is a playable card or group of cards. Yep, that's it. But, the logic and definition of a TooT! allow for some TooTs to combine into a single larger TooT and this allows for some intriguing, challenging and fun games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ALL games, a only a SINGLE TooT! is allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TooT! Includes 57 play cards, 1 die, 2 basic rules &amp;amp; sample sheets and instructions for 4 games - Progressive TooT!, TooT! Pursuit, Fluke TooT! &amp;amp; Speed TooT! From Missing Piece Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the introductory Progressive TooT! game, players are first dealt 4 cards.  Cards are arranged to play a SINGLE TooT! that uses the most cards.  Any remaining cards are pointed AGAINST the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rounds PROGRESS with 5 cards, then 6, then 7 etc., up to 10.  The player with the lowest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In TooT! Pursuit, players take ONE card for their turn and see if they can use it and any other cards that they have accumulated, to make and leave ONE TooT! that all players must add to.  If they are able to make a leave a TooT!, regardless of how many cards they used - they earn a point.  Most points when cards are gone- WINS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fluke TooT! players roll the die, take THAT number of cards and try to play cards into a SINGLE TooT! that all players add to.  The player with the fewest remaining cards when all cards have been played - wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IN Speed TooT!, players draw 7 cards.  Get set - GO!  First to use ALL cards in a single TooT! wins.  Can't do it?  Grab more cards if needed but, you MUST use them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
