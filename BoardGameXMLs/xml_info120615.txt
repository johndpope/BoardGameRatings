			<description>The game is a sort of fusion between hold'em and scrabble. In each round, players must form the longest words possible by combining the cards in their hand and those on the table. Card system &amp;quot;challenges&amp;quot; imposes additional conditions on each spin: requirement to use a letter, the fastest wins, the longest word wins the cards etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the deck is exhausted, the game ends when a player has got rid of all your cards, or that nobody can play anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scoring:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Each card is worth 1 point earned.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The one who got rid of all your cards double their points.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The other players take off their total as many points as cards remaining in their hand. The player with the most points is declared the &amp;quot;winner!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
