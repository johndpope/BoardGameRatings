			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WELCOME TO THE CITY OF SPIRITS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Meriquai Falls, where Native American culture blends seemlessly with modern contemporary society to form one of the most beautiful cities in the United States. It is also home to one of the largest concentrations of metahuman activity in the Midwest. Between the schemes of Galvakar and his Imperions and the genocidal plots of the Manitou and his Totems of Retribution, the crazed antics of the Pooka King and the dark secrets of the Night Sparrow, there is plenty to do for an intrepid hero in Meriquai Falls. Save the city and perhaps, in so doing, save the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEET LONGHORN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born of humanity's greed and disrespect for nature, fueled by his desire to avenge cruelty to bovine everywhere, Longhorn is a juggernaut of a villain to contend with. Easily the strongest creature alive in Meriquai Falls, Longhorn can wreck devastating damage through his mighty sinews alone... let alone the vast army of cattle he commands. Can your heroes stop this rampaging berserker?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meriquai Falls - Longhorn includes HERO System 6th Edition stats for the villain Longhorn, as well as plot seeds to get him quickly into your Meriquai Falls campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
