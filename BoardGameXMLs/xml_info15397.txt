							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sound Alikes A game using homonyms</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to score the most points. Roll the dice to determine the order of play. The highest roll gives the clues first. There are 2 groups of words: one group has 2 homonyms and one group has three homonyms. The group of 2 is worth 10 points and the group of 3 is worth 20 points. Keep score on the points provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player going first chooses a card with 2 homonyms and reads the clue to the player with the second highest roll of the dice. That player has 10 seconds to say the homonym. If he/she cannot, the next player in order has a chance etc. When that card is done the player with the second highest roll reads the clues to the other players. After all have read a clue with 2 words, a card with 3 is read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when time expires (agreed upon) or when all the cards are read. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
