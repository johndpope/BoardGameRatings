			<description>A somewhat canasta-like word card game for 4 players in two partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck has 56 letter cards, in various colors.  Each letter of the alphabet appears  at least once, in red.  If there's a second card, it's blue; if a third, it's green; if a fourth, it's brown.  (There is a fifth 'E', which is also red.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the draw pile is exposed to start the discard pile.  In a turn a player: &lt;br/&gt;1. Draws either two cards from the draw pile, or the entire discard pile.  If the latter, the top discard must be used immediately to form a new word, and the rest are put in the hand. &lt;br/&gt;2. Plays any words out of hand that have at least 3 letters.  Previous words may be lengthened to make new words by adding letters at either end; if an opponent's word is lengthened, it becomes your.  You may also start a word in hopes that your partner could complete it in his turn; incomplete words may not be stolen. &lt;br/&gt;3. Discards 1 card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once he has spelled at least two full words, a player may go out by emptying his hand.  The game also ends when the deck is exhausted, and the active player ends his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each word scores 1 point per letter, doubled if the word has only 2 colors in it, tripled if only 1 color.  One point is subtracted for each card left in the hand.  The team with the higher score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
