							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing (often simply referred to as Big Rigs) is a third-person racing video game developed by Stellar Stone and published by Activision Value for Microsoft Windows PC systems; in 2004, GameMill Publishing was instead chosen to distribute copies of the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the packaging of Big Rigs states that the main objective of the game is to race their Big Rig to safety in order to deliver illegal cargo being carried by the vessel, while avoiding the local police force, in actuality, there are no police in the game, and no such objectives are presented within the game itself. Much of the game instead centers on the player racing their truck against fellow drivers to the finish line; however, the player's computer-controlled opponent vehicles have no AI and never move from the starting position. In addition, due to a lack of collision detection, there are no obstacles to negotiate within the game, and the laws of physics can be violated frequently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing received unanimously negative reviews; much of the criticism for the game was directed at a lack of collision detection, frequent glitches, its visuals, severe lack of functionality, and lack of a general plotline. As a result, the title is currently regarded as the worst or one of the worst video games of all-time. Despite these criticisms, the game sold fairly well, selling nearly 20,000 copies in total.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Big_Rigs,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
