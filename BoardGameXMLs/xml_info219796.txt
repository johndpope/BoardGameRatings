							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Player&#039;s Book for the Role Playing Game of Alternate Realities</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player's Book is - by far - the most complete and polished part of the game.  It consists of seven enumerated sections.  Note that several minor versions of the book exist, mingled in the same manuscript folder.  The sections are enumerated though there is overlap in topic and the numeric organization seems peculiar.  The sections include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Section 1 - Character Building&lt;br/&gt;        Section 2 - Movement and Combat&lt;br/&gt;        Section 3 - Skills and Improving Skills&lt;br/&gt;        Section 4 - Masteries&lt;br/&gt;        Section 5 - Equipment&lt;br/&gt;        Section 6 - Talents and Attributes&lt;br/&gt;        Section 7 - Skills and Improving Skills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters first gain a Profession from Warrior, Healer, Technician, Enforcer, Shaper, or Catalyst.  Characters receive a point pool by random roll - the points are then distributed into Talents by player fiat.  Available Talents are said to have a pool value and include Prowess, Fighting, Endurance, Knowledge, Perception, and Insight.  Characters also have Abilities, Skills, Masteries, and Power Resources.  The distinction between Abilities, Skills, and Masteries are qualitative knowledge.  Character also gain equipment (transportable to the dream world).  The rules indicate the character should, finally, be &amp;quot;personalized&amp;quot; through descriptive tags.  The distinction between the non-dreaming and the dreaming character components is not well defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The document is noted (on almost every page) as &amp;quot;(c) 1984 TSR&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General comments. The manuscript is available for public access in a controlled reading room environment (photography, copies, etc., are not permitted). The loose pages in the manuscript are stored in a folder and the pages are partially unsorted and intermingled. The page count indicated here is a &amp;quot;best estimate&amp;quot; because there are numerous duplicate pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
