							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yakitori</name>
									
			<description>Ever dreamt about being a yakitori chef? Serving up meat and veg skewered, Japanese-style, onto sticks? Grilling on the open flames and hot coals while the sweat drips down the back of your neck and the customers get more and more merry? No? Well now&amp;rsquo;s your chance to give it a go anyway. Maybe playing &amp;ldquo;Yakitori&amp;rdquo; will be the first step on a life changing career change!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yakitori is a card game for 2-4 players. The aim of the game is to gather the ingredients to put together sticks of meat and veg before cooking them and serving them up to customers. Each customer wants something different &amp;ndash; from quail eggs to beef, from asparagus to chicken, carefully seasoned with salt or sweet dark &amp;ldquo;tare&amp;rdquo; sauce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
