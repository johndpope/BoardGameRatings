			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scorched is an adventure roleplaying game inspired by Mad Max, Fallout, and a long line of gritty post-apocalyptic fiction. This is a game of survival and chaos, a world where society has broken down and life is a struggle. Post-apocalyptic America is rife with madness and death, radiation and sickness, famine and war. The players take on the roles of survivors or adventurers, those seeking to plunder their enemies, right great wrongs, rebuild the world, or simply live until the next day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to new classes, races, items, and rules, Scorched Earth introduces vehicles as a major fixture of gameplay. Seamlessly blend gunplay and explosions with high stakes car chases and collisions. In the wasteland, a good motor can be just as valuable as a reliable weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scorched Earth uses the Pathfinder rules system and requires the Pathfinder Core Rulebook to play. The information provided in this book exists to give players the tools they need to create characters who survive in post-apocalyptic America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scorched Earth Campaign Setting contains information on the settlements and gangs of post-Apocalyptic America, as well as new creatures and dozens of NPC stat blocks. It also provides adventure seeds and other great goodies for your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
