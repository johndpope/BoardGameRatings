							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Where are the Villagers?</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Raventown was recently visited by a hated merchant wizard.  Mr. Fuzz is what the fuzz is all about.  In the past he has been accused of using his magic on townsfolk for his own ends.  He's been to jail several times.  But now after a two days visit he left.  However, 19 villages disappeared with him.  The townsfolk are sure Mr. Fuzz used his magic to kidnap them, and now the bounty for Mr. Fuzz' head is bigger than his reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
