							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bubble Guppies Fin-tastic Field Trip Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;8 place to visit, 4 games to play! Use the 4 double-sided game boards individually to play a fast-placed, token-collecting game. OR, put them together to make your very own game board and the race begins! Collect tokens from each area and be the first one home, to win.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bubble Guppies Fin-Tastic Field Trip Game is a spin-and-move game where players move their characters around the track, collecting tokens. The board is modular and may be reassembled in different configurations. Each section represents a particular location, such as a museum, farm or supermarket. The object of the game is to visit each location and collect a token from each before returning to the starting space. To make the game more challenging, tokens can be placed face-down to add a memory element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also three other versions to play the game included. In Gil's Game, players must claim tokens held up by a game leader by matching them to pictures on their board. The first player to fill his or her board wins. Molly's Memory Game is a re-theme of the classic matching game Memory. In Mr. Grouper's What's Missing? Game, players take turns playing the role of Mr. Grouper. Mr. Grouper lays out five tiles. After looking at them, other players close their eyes and Mr. Grouper removes one tile. Players in turn try to identify the missing tile. The first player to identify the tile wins it. The next player to the left then becomes Mr. Grouper. The player with the most tiles at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
