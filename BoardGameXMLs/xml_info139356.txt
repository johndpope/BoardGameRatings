			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;THE FRENZY CONCEPT&lt;br/&gt;These rules were written to give fast game play, making it ideal for games of action and high-octane adventure. The system allows rapid decision making for all settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1994 after watching John Woo's oriental gangster classic The Killer (1989) it occurred to William E. Worthey and myself that no RPG available could allow us to play out the events we had seen. Most had too many rules that would disallow much of what occurs in the film. They also would slow down the rapidly unfolding action sequences. So we came up with the ideas that you now see before you. We were pleasantly surprised at just how easy, flexible, and exciting the results were.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since then (Frenzy was first published in 1995) other games have come along but Frenzy still holds its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
