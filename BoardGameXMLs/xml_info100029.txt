			<description>A simple die-rolling game for children, where everyone has to visit different shops and fill their shopping list first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone has a shopping list with five different things on it. The number of items also ranges from one to five. Shops are colour co-ordinated - bakery is orange, market green etc. There are coloured squares on the list as well - bread is next to orange square, tomatoes next to green etc. All the shopping lists are different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on a shop and doesn't have the item from it yet, he/she has to ask for it and also name the correct quantity: &amp;quot;One loaf of bread, please&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Five tomatoes, please&amp;quot;. They then get the picture of the item to put on their list. If they already have the item, they miss their turn and play passes to their left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four squares on the board without any shops, two showing people shopping and one someone having lunch. These squares also mean that a player misses their turn. However, if a player lands on the &amp;quot;Checkout&amp;quot; square, he/she can ask for anything on their list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
