			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroth is a castle and small town held by the Earl of Heroth in the Kingdom of Kanday. The largest settlement in Noreashire, Heroth is located at an important crossroads just three leagues west of the Thardic Republic and seven leagues south of the Kingdom of Rethem. The castle and its surrounding manors occupy a clearing in the center of the Forest of Narath, a relatively pristine wilderness and royal forest unpopulated except by a few small bands of outlaws and brigands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroth article describes the town's history, government, religion, and economics, and provides details for some of the settlement's craftsmen and other locations. Includes full-color GM and player maps as well as floor plans for the Crossroads Inn and Caer Heroth, the earl's castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a H&amp;acirc;rn Classics article and was originally published in 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
