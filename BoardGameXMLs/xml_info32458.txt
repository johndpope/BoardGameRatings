			<description>This is the original 3M release of Mr. President, and is an entirely different game from the 1967/1971 release, which can be found at Mr. President.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version of Mr. President, which can be identified by the tan (rather than maroon) box and 1965 Copyright date, is a much simpler game.  States are awarded using a Hols der Geier/Raj-like system, wherein players choose a card from their hand and the high card wins, with tied states carried over to the next turn.  Play with 3 or 4 is individual, rather than partnership, with the player carrying the largest number of electoral votes winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even within this edition, there are two versions, with one using a chalkboard and the other a dial scoreboard for tracking electoral votes. These versions also have somewhat different rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The 1965 edition has rules for a short game, a long game, and a nominee game. In the latter two games are played. In the first the players of each party compete against each other to determine which is the presidential candidate. In the second the parties compete in the general election, with the cards played summed by party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The 1966 edition keeps the short and long game but removes the nominee game. Instead it offers the option of scoring by popular votes instead of electoral votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
