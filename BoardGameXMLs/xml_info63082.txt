			<description>&amp;quot;Ombre&amp;quot; is the first game where the trump suit is decided by bidding. It is played with a standard deck of cards without the 8s, 9s and 10s. Each player is dealt 9 cards, and after that they bid how much tricks they can take. The highest bidder plays then against the two other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game represents a battle of the 17 th. with it's officers and troops, so it can be said it is the first card wargame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a game original from Spain known firstly as &amp;quot;Triunfos Hisp&amp;aacute;nicos&amp;quot; later circa 1700 it was known as &amp;quot;Juego del Hombre&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Mediator&amp;quot;. Again circa 1800 changed his name into &amp;quot;Tresillo&amp;quot;, and from that time is known as &amp;quot;Rocambor&amp;quot; in the former spanish colonies of latin america where today is still played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Spain almost no one plays it any longer, as before was a gentelmen game and became unpopular in the 20 th. century, but it carries to be played in Lima.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funny enought there are as well clubs in Dennmark were it is known as &amp;quot;L'Hombre&amp;quot;. It is my personal opinion that the spanish ocupation army of Dennmark in the age of Napoleon comanded by the Marquis de la Romana have something to do with the expansion of this game in Jutland!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenshō karuta, Unsun karuta and Sunkun karuta are all rooted in Ombre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
