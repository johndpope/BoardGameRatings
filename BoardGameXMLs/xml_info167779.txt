			<description>ABOUT SUPERHOT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUPERHOT is a unique, stylish first-person shooter game where time moves only when you move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this simple mechanic we've been able to create gameplay that's not all about reflexes - the player's main weapon is careful aiming and smart planning - while not compromising on the dynamic feeling of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your time. You have as much as you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It started out as a 7 Day First Person Shooter (7DFPS) game jam project made by a group of friends in August 2013. After releasing the prototype of SUPERHOT to the Internet, it quickly became very popular - the game was featured on sites like RPS, PCGamer, GiantBomb and more!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the support of our fans, SUPERHOT went through the Steam Greenlight process during a single weekend. This allowed us to expand the team and start remaking the prototype into a full-blown game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 14th, 2014 we launched a Kickstarter campaign which was funded within the first 23 hours. In the end we received over $250,000 from our community - many thanks to all who backed SUPERHOT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's target release date is June 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
