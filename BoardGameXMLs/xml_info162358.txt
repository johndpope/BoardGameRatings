							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Street Dice, Racing For Pinks</name>
									
			<description>Street Dice is a 2 - 4 Player game. Players all start with a car and use the dice to race each other. If you lose your car in a Race you must Borrow, Earn, or Steal another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME SET UP:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Separate the dice and the cards and place them on the table like in diagram 1. Deal 1 Car card to each of the players in the game. Place the other 3 with the pink side up in the middle of the table like it shows on the diagram.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-4 Player:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players roll 2 of their qualifying dice for a chance at  the 1st turn. The player with the highest total will get the first turn. In the case of a tie, the players tied will re-roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the order is decided the game play begins.(Turns will continue as the game progresses to the left.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RACING:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting the Qualifying Combo: On the player&amp;rsquo;s turn they are automatically in the dig(the race). Player 1 rolls their 3 qualifying dice to set the combo for the others to get into the race. After the combo is set, player 1 says, &amp;ldquo;On your mark, get set, go!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qualifying: The other players roll their 3 qualifying dice as quickly as they can to qualify for the dig. Once someone rolls the right combo they yell out that they have it. If there is a tie Player 1 re-rolls another combo and the tied parties re-roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only 2 players race in a dig. Once the qualifying is done the 2 players each draw a Start Stage Card ad place it face down in front of them. They also get the 9 start stage dice (Red, Yellow, &amp;amp; Green) and place them in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start the Race: One of the other players not in the race will start the race by saying, &amp;ldquo;On your mark, get set, go!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting Stage: Both players then flip over the Starting Stage card and begin to roll the combo&amp;rsquo;s associated with the card. The dice can only be rolled with the same color. Players roll the 3 red dice first and try to roll the combo shown on the card. If the player rolls 1 of the three dice in the combo they move the correct die to the side and continue rolling the other dice until the combo is rolled correctly. Then the player moves onto the yellow dice and finally the green dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast Start Bonus: The first player to finish the Stage Combo draws a Fast Start Bonus Card. Fast start bonus cards work in two ways, but always help the one that draws the card. The bonus card will either have a plus or minus symbol on the card. If it has a plus it will also show 1 or 2 dice that need to be rolled by their opponent after they have finished rolling their 10 race dice. If the card has a plus the player places the card face up in front of their opponent. If the card has a minus then the player removes 1 or 2 cards from their necessary 10 race dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race Dice: After the players finish rolling the stage dice they move onto the 10 black race dice. As they finish the stage dice the players draw a race dice card and flip it over to reveal the combo they must roll to advance. Just like the starting stage if the player rolls any number of the ten dice in the combo correctly they move the correct dice to the side and continue rolling the other dice until the combo is rolled correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finish Line Bonus:  Just like the Fast start bonus this card works 2 ways. There is only a plus 1 or a minus 1. If it is a plus one the extra die is shown on the card and their opponent must roll that extra die after they have rolled their 3 finish line dice to win the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finish Line Dice: There are 3 checkered finish line dice. Each player draws a finish line card after they finish their combo on their 10 race dice. The combo for victory is on the card and who ever finishes that combo first wins the race and wins their opponents car and pink(title).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYER WITHOUT A CAR: If a player does not have a car they cannot qualify to race until it is their turn again and they get a car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEXT TURN:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the race play moves to the next player to the left. If they have a car they roll their qualifying dice to initiate qualifying for the next race. If they do not have a car they have one of three chances to get another car. If they get a car they then roll the qualifying dice to initiate a race. If they are unable to secure a car it is the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Borrow a car from Leg Breaker Lou: His car is in the middle of the table face down with his die on top of it. To borrow the car the player must roll the die and land on any number except for Lou&amp;rsquo;s face. If the player rolls Lou&amp;rsquo;s face they are not allowed to borrow the car and their turn is over. However, if they do borrow the car they immediately roll the qualifying combo to initiate a race. Moving forward in the game with Leg Breaker Lou&amp;rsquo;s car; each time the player qualifies for a race they must roll the Leg Breaker Lou die before the race begins. If they roll Lou&amp;rsquo;s face they get their legs broken and must forfeit the car and qualifying is started over for the other players. They must wait until their next turn to get another car. If Leg Breaker Lou takes his car back it is placed face down on the table under his die again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steal a Car: The car is in the middle of the table with the Popo die on top of it. To steal the car the player must roll the die and land on any number except for the Popo&amp;rsquo;s face. If the player rolls the Popo&amp;rsquo;s face they are caught and can&amp;rsquo;t steal the car and their turn is over. However, if they do steal the car they immediately roll the qualifying combo to initiate a race. Moving forward in the game with a stolen car; each time the player qualifies for a race they must roll the Popo die before the race begins. If they roll the Popo they get arrested and must forfeit the car and qualifying is started over for the other players. They must wait until their next turn to get another car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earn a Car: The car to earn is in the middle of the table face down with 2 dice on it. To earn the car the player must roll the 2 dice and roll 7, 11 or double $. If the player rolls the dice correctly they earn the car and they immediately roll the qualifying dice to initiate a race. If they don&amp;rsquo;t get the correct roll, their turn is over and it is the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    IF A PLAYER ALREADY HAS A CAR THEY CANNOT TRY TO EARN ONE OF THE CARS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Ability:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each car has a special ability that can be used once in a game. When the player decides to use the special ability, they turn the card sideways. The move is valid for that turn only and cannot be used again by that player during the game. If another player wins the car and uses it in a race they can use the special ability once as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING THE GAME:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game a player must hold 4 cars in their garage at the same time. After you have 4 cars you are the Street Dice Champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
