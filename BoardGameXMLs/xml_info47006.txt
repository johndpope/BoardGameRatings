							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ordo Nobilis: Mythic Europe&#039;s Nobility </name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kings belong to a select caste separated from the commonality of man by birth and by God's anointment. A powerful rebellious subject may hold his king prisoner &amp;mdash; and may even have him murdered &amp;mdash; but will never stoop to treating his monarch publicly with anything less than the utmost respect and courtesy.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ordo Nobilis is a survey of Mythic European nobility. It looks behind the stereotypes, presenting a detailed picture of the noble life by defining what a noble is, what various noble ranks and titles mean, how nobles interacted with each other, and how they interacted with broader society. It examines their concerns and interests, how they lived, what they did with their time, and how they did it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ordo Nobilis includes a number of new mechanical options for combat (especially knightly combat), introduces a new system for monetary record-keeping based on the Mythic Penny, contains a system for resolving legal conflicts, and presents three scenarios that take full advantage of these options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
