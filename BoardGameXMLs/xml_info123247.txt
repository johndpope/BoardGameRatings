			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clutch of Dragons (Deep Shadows)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never, ever deal with a dragon. Shadowrunners have heard that dictum so often, they frequently say those words in their sleep. But what the aphorism forgets to tell you is this&amp;mdash;what if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tension between dragons has been growing, and the big lizards are throwing every weapon they have at each other, including shadowrunners&amp;mdash;especially shadowrunners. Extractions, industrial sabotage, theft, wetwork&amp;mdash;there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of work in all of those areas, and dragons are finding ways to hire the help they need. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll hide their involvement in the run, or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll bribe the runners with large piles of nuyen or blackmail them with their past activities. Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll just tell the runners they have a simple choice of working for them or being eaten.&lt;br/&gt; Whatever tactics they choose, the dragons are going to be active and aggressive, and if runners want to survive, they better be on their toes. They need to know who the draconic players are, what they&amp;rsquo;re up to, and what might happen to them if they fall into a dragon&amp;rsquo;s grip. They need to be ready for anything, because when dragons go at each other, the world shakes, the earth beneath them burns&amp;mdash;and far too often, shadowrunners die.&lt;br/&gt; The Clutch of Dragons provides the information gamemasters and players need to involve draconic plots in their games, from profiles of individuals dragons, their plots, and their lairs to information about the latest efforts to build anti-dragon weapons. This is a critical reference for any players who want to test their skills against the machinations of dragons&amp;mdash;or who want to see just how much trouble they can survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
