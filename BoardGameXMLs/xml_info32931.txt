							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mish Mosh: The Jewish Word Game</name>
									
			<description>Mish Mosh - The Jewish Word Game includes rules in both Yiddish and English for the titular game Mish Mosh, which has striking similarities to Scrabble.  There are also &amp;quot;student rules&amp;quot; that include three variants requiring increasing education:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Identifying the Alphabet - Simply select a letter from your tray, say what it is, then place it on the matching letter on the board.  Congratulations!  You just earned 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Mish Moshing&amp;quot; the Language - Build sentences out of English words written somewhat phonetically with Hebrew letters.&lt;br/&gt;     Historical Mish Mosh - This variation can be played by any number of players.  One player thinks of a &amp;quot;a famous Jewish Historical person&amp;quot;, then spells his or her name with the tiles.  (e.g. ABRAHAM)  The next person must think of another whose name starts with the final letter of the previous one.  (e.g. MOSHEH).  This is an elimination game like HORSE:  Each time you fail, you &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; a letter of MISH MOSH.  Once you have spelled the whole name, you are out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tile has both the traditional print letter and its handwritten equivalent.  There are no tiles for &amp;quot;final&amp;quot; forms of letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
