							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ship Simulator 2006</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ship Simulator 2006 the player can steer different contemporary ships like a container vessel, yacht, small container ship, inland cargo ship, harbour patrol ship, tug boat, tower boat or taxi boat. Lastly, the player can be captain of the RMS Titanic (yes, the famous one) and of all ships present in the game, this one is the most elaborate, allowing the player to walk around on several parts of this virtual (partial) rebuild of it's historical counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not an arcade game but a simulation. Meaning, that when operating the bigger ships, it can take several seconds to notice any change in course after turning the wheel, like it does in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ships with 3 real life harbours: Rotterdam (The Netherlands, and besides being one of the biggest harbour in the world, the home of the developing compagny), Hamburg (Germany) and Phi Phi Islands (Thailand). It features 40 missions in which players much steer a boat either as fast or accurately as possible, of course without causing any damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
