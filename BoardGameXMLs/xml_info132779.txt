							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aeronef Over the Aegean: Wrath of the Syren</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In comparison to the, often tumultuous, clashes over Western Europe and the Atlantic, tensions in South Eastern Europe did not gain international attention. Nevertheless, the intersection of the Tsar&amp;rsquo;s domain, Austro-Hungarian territory and the Ottoman Empire was a nexus of instability fuelled by long standing ethnic and religious differences as much as foreign policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aeronef Over The Aegean: Wrath of the Syren is a mini-campaign of linked Aeronef scenarios following the adventures of Hungarian Baron Lantoz as he takes his flagship, the Syren, on a mission of vengeance, against the Turks, for his slain family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three scenarios provided will present different challenges to both players: The Hungarian player must preserve his ship and crew from one battle to the next, choosing which engagements to pursue and which to avoid. The Turkish player must battle through some deliberately unbalanced scenarios initially, keeping an eye on the overall picture. The scenarios themselves are short with limited numbers of vessels, enabling players to resolve this mini-campaign in a single evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
