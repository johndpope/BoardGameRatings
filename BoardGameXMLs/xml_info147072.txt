			<description>Contents:&lt;br/&gt;One Board&lt;br/&gt;1 rules sheet&lt;br/&gt;4 letter racks&lt;br/&gt;100 wooden tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word game. Separate the vowels from the consonants. Up to four players draw 3 Vowels and 7 consonants. After everyone has their starting 10 tiles, the remaining tiles are mixed together and left face-down as a draw pile. Words are formed vertically or horizontally but two words going in the same direction cannot be formed if it does not leave a space between the letters of both words. The box illustrates this rather well. If you cannot make a legal play, you draw one tile. If you can now play a word, you do so. If not, draw another tile, and so on. If you cannot make a play after drawing three tiles, your turn ends. The winner is the first player to get rid of all his tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, on the board there are some coloured squares. Should your word cross such a square, you must do the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yellow field: Randomly pick a tile from the right neighbour.&lt;br/&gt;Red box: Give the left neighbour a random tile.&lt;br/&gt;Blue field: Take three tiles from the existing stock.&lt;br/&gt;Green field: You must swap one of your tiles with another player. Both players choose a tile for the swap and the tiles are swapped face-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
