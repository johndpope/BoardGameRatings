			<description>Developed and published in 1940, Modern Warfare looks to be a self-published game as no publisher is listed and the game is copyrighted by the designers.  The rules boast 3 games in one, the main game is Modern Warfare, a &amp;quot;game that fills up a long standing demand for a war game and introduces you to our latest mechanical inventions and the rapid development of their uses as weapons of destruction in the present day war operations&amp;quot;.  Additionally there is a wargame, called &amp;quot;Trench Warfare&amp;quot;, based on the old styles of warfare and finally a simple &amp;quot;Hit and Miss&amp;quot; game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Warfare uses large (1.25 inch) lead Soldiers, Aircraft, Tanks and Artillery as units in the game and they are initially placed in one of four lines (3 main lines and the reserve).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main game begins with the firing of a single  artillery piece on each side for 4 turns (a spinner is spun for combat results and movement) followed by an artillery barrage (both artillery pieces fire on each side) until one side loses both their guns.  Then the winning side gets 3 more shots and moves and attacks with his air and tank units in the first line.  The other side then moves all air and tank units in the first rank.  This alternates until one side has lost all their units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winning side retires their remaining air and tanks to the reserve and the infantry then fights alone...  Terrain can be destroyed on the map (indicated by placing a red square on the destroyed item).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fascinating instructions with detailed play throughs and fairly complicated rules depending on the unit type and position (line) the unit occupies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
