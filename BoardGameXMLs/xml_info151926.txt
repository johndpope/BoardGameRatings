			<description>YOU DISTURBED THEIR ETERNAL SLUMBER, YOU EVOKED THEIR VENGEFUL WRATH, NOW YOU MUST ESCAPE FROM DOOM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transported back in time to Egypt during the treasure-hunting craze of the 1920s, you barely escape from a crumbling tomb only to find yourself surrounded by the mummified guardians of the stolen treasure. Will you escape with your life? Or join the ranks of the dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this endless runner and first-person shooter mashup, it's up to you to run as far as possible before succumbing to their ceaseless chase. But the power is in your hands! Collect emeralds during your escape to purchase useful weapons and upgrades, like the dual revolvers and crossbow, which will turn the odds in your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accomplish goals to unlock even more perks! The more you play, the farther you'll run! It's an action game of high adventure right at your fingertips: run, dodge, and shoot your way through savage sandstorms and dusty temples. But be careful, in the cursed desert the treasure hunter is the hunted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
