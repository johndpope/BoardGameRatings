			<description>Wakfu is a French Collectible Card Game, named after the Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game that reimplements Dofus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a hero, among 12 that have different stats and abilities, and a dimensional bag, in which 4 cards are safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists in playing new cards from hand to put new characters, equipment or zones in play, and performing one single attack against one single target. The defending player may block the attack with his own characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards, once in play, can be used either as resources to put new cards in play, or to activate their special abilities, or to attack. Either way, when used they are rotated and are not available until next turn. A rotated card may not be used to block the opponent's attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each attack, some experience points may be awarded to either player. The heroes may level up when they reach 6 experience points, and again when they reach 18 experience points. There are two possible ways to win: either kill the opponent's hero, or level up twice with one's own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free translation from the back of the starter box:&lt;br/&gt;Chose your hero and his dimensional bag and explore the world of Dofus and Wakfu. Develop your crafting skills, create powerful items, feed your pets and earn XP... create your own ideal game! Tournament play is awaiting you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
