							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mammoth</name>
									
			<description>Players take on the role of mammoth herds by moving around Pleistocene Park and transforming the board from invading brambles and trees to beautiful flora and grasslands. Mammoth is a tile laying game that appeals to ages 10 and up. Players place tiles to grow their specific color of flowers and to increase the size of their path as their mammoth moves through the plains. The game has both competitive and co-operative versions of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin the game, players place their mammoth to begin a field of colorful flowers. At some point during the game they can also place their other prehistoric mammals to claim a path. Then as they take their turns players place an octagon tile or square tile to increase their color grouping or path.  They can score maximum points placing a tile directly next to their mammoth and growing more color groupings instead of just their own.  The last round starts when the last octagon tile is played. The winner is the player who gained the most points by successfully transforming the barren tundra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the co-op version of the game the players work together to accomplish a random color and path goal.  The players play as scientists planning how they are going to guide their mammoths through the park.  Players discuss what actions they want to take and then reveal the available actions for the turn.  Players then choose their actions without discussion and then complete them in turn order.  If the players succeed in accomplishing their goals and reach a required point total before the last octagon tile is placed, the scientists are successful and have transformed the bleak tundra into a beautiful plain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
