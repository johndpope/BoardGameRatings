							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Spells: D&amp;D Spells in Savage Worlds</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;What follows is a collection of spells converted from their original form- as presented in the Basic/Expert Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (Moldvay/Cook) boxed sets- into Savage Worlds terms. These represent my personal interpretations of the spells- yours may vary or differ completely. I offer these only as an example of how to adapt D&amp;amp;D spells to the Savage Worlds system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In completing this collection I tried to stay within the guidelines of the powers in the main rulebook- rarely was a new power needed- a little imagination and creative fudging of existing powers often yielded positive results. Above all, the guiding principle of these conversions was &amp;quot;Fast Furious Fun&amp;quot;. The only outside sources used where those published by Pinnacle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have not divided the powers according to their original D&amp;amp;D levels, simply because it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary- levels do not easily translate into Savage Worlds Ranks. An alphabetical list seemed more suitable. All of the spells from the Basic and Expert rulebooks have been converted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
