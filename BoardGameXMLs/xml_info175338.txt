							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Average Modern Pool Hall</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It wasn't hard to spot Brannon Kelly. The leader of the Southies was a tall, thin man with red hair and a bent nose that spoke volumes about his short time on this earth. Around him was his crew decked out in jackets, ball caps and tattoos sporting the Irish Flag and a smattering of Gaelic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeing Jacob across the room, he nodded and offered a smile. The smile on his face quickly faded as he spotted the rage in Jacob's eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You,&amp;quot; Jacob screamed as he pointed at Brannon. &amp;quot;You're the reason my partner's dead. Now its your turn to join him!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave. Grab a copy of Modern Floorplans: An Average Modern Pool Hall today, and keep an eye out for future releases!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a classic pool hall with a small bar, 10 public tables and a semi-private table in the back. This is the perfect place to meet a local gang boss, hook up with a contact or simply kick back and relax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
