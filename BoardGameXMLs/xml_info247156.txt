							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guardians of Wayword</name>
									
			<description>Guardians of Wayword is a dice-building tabletop game set in a unique world of fantasy that contains characters from many gothic horror and fantasy settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting up the game, player will randomly select a &amp;quot;Big Bad&amp;quot;, Scenario, and the soldiers and lackeys of the &amp;quot;Big Bad&amp;quot;. Their tokens go into a bag that is drawn and played from on each Player Turn. Then, players select a Guild to represent, and take turns drafting their Agents, Items, Scrolls and anything else useful for the Game. This creates their personal inventory to create their dice pool as the game evolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game, players will increase their Agents and Inventory's power and influence in the game. Each die bought makes your Guilds ability to resolve threats, respond to morale loss and fight the horrors of the dark! Players dice are bought from the cards they drafted at the beginning of the game as well as a few public Agents players can recruit from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of a player's turn, they pull a token from the Threat Bag and add it to the city space furthest from Wayword. As each city space fills up, threats begin flooding closer and closer to the city of Wayword. Along the way, Civilians may be injured, cities and locations may be destroyed but the real threat comes from foes reaching Wayword. If Wayword collapses, all the players lose. The Threat Bag also includes the &amp;quot;Big Bad&amp;quot;, who may get so fed up with his Troop's ineffectiveness, that they show up to cause their own brand of trouble! On top of all of that, the variable Scenarios in game may affect any aspect of play, from doubling Threat Bag draws to letting threats and foes move further towards Wayword but faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Guilds build up their Agents and Inventory, they will defeat these baddies, stop these threats and rescue these Villagers. All of these things are worth Popularity Points (Victory Points) from the people of Wayword. If players confront and defeat the &amp;quot;Big Bad&amp;quot;, the game comes to an end and Wayword can rest easier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
