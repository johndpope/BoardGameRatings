			<description>Hatchi is a retro-looking iPhone app sure to get the nostalgia burning for all those who cared for a virtual pet back in the 1990s when they were at the height of their popularity. Just as with the keychain-sized pets of the 90s, iPhone users now will feed, clean, play with and generally look after their pets to ensure they grow up to be healthy, happy little Hatchis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hatchi monster will go through several stages of growth, and will develop differently depending on the quality of care the player provides. Successfully raised Hatchi monster will be smarter, happier, and require less attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
