			<description>&amp;quot;Siping (四平): China's Madrid&amp;quot;  is a two to three players operational wargame simulates the four battles in Siping during the 2nd Chinese Civil War from 1946 to 1948.  &lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Siping is a city in former Mandchuria - Siping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player commands the CCP（中國共產黨）and the other player commands the KMT（中國國民黨）. Each turn represents one day and each hex is about 2.5 km across. There are five kinds of basic units, including infantry, artillery, cavalry, tank, and HQ. The scale of the basic unit is one regiment size. Players activate the divisional HQ to command every unit in range to barrage, move, fire, and advance after combat respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose the command chits they plan to use in every turn. Then one player draw one command chit to activate units in the same division. Then units can barrage adjacent enemy units, move toward different terrains, then attack adjacent enemy together. Use CRT to resolve barrage and combat result. Occupy target hex and eliminate enemy units can get victory points. Player who gets more points win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To occupy city hex can increase your supply points which can use to barrage heavy artillery or get replacement units. Every scenario has asymmetrical setup forces, different victory condition, reinforcements, and tactic chits to better simulate the history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five scenarios in this game: &amp;quot;Liberation in Siping&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Defense of Siping&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Siege of Siping&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Battle of Siping&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Return to Siping&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 A1 Color Map&lt;br/&gt;    1 A4 Player Aid (Siping map area zoom)&lt;br/&gt;    333 die-cut counters (5/8 inch)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTES: Rules in Chinese translated in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
