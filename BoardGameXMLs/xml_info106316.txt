			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arma&amp;euml;th is a typical fantasy adventure similar to the King's Quest series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The country was once ruled by the wise dwarf king Arma&amp;euml;th whose people lived in harmony with the elves. But Menankar hated all of them and the master of dark forces raised his evil creatures and used his minions to conquer the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After long years of war the evil forces were defeated by the combined arms of the dwarves and elves. Since their kingdom has been ruined they left it and retreated into a secred kingdom called Dol Armaeth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old lands have long been claimed by the humans. Once of them, Killian, now starts his adventure in search for the legendary Dol Armaeth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
