			<description>&amp;quot;Board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players. Abstract simulation of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. (Russia&amp;rsquo;s fifth war against Turkey (The Ottoman Empire) in the 19th Century.) One player is the Turks, the other is the Russians. Victory: Destroy all opposing units.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the units. Each player starts with twelve units (representing 20,000 men each). Each unit can sustain three hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play controls how units move, attack, and defend. In addition, Recruit Cards may be played to bring back lost units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
