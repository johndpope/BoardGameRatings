							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Era: Survival - Rule Book Primer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity battles for survival in the dangerous world of Gaia, where Infection and Mutation are a daily threat. Organising itself into factions with different ideas about how to best survive the dangerous world they inhabit, they clash with each other as often as Infected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Rulebook Primer contains a briefing on the background for the world, character creation, the list of equipment available for starting characters and the complete rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details about the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Era d10 ruleset is designed to allow you to experience this universe in a way that is as unobtrusive as possible without being misrepresentative. By choosing your skills carefully, your character can dominate in any of 5 forms of combat, talk their way out of any situation or protect their teammates from harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules could be described as &amp;quot;A Success-counting dice pool system where you roll Attribute + Skill in d10s and the difficulty of the task determines which numbers count as Successes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In case that was a bit too brief or jargony, here's a bit more detail:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is based around multiple dice - the more skilled you are, the more dice you have - and a variable goal based on activity difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an Attribute and Skill system, which each define their own areas of influence, you roll your dice depending on what you're attempting - whether Dexterity + Engineering for a precision piece of work, Intelligence + Engineering for a more theoretical problem or Luck + Engineering for a complete long shot, you'll be able to adapt to your circumstances and focus on your strengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although you roll more dice the more skilled you are, the number you are attempting to reach varies depending on the difficulty of the action - if shooting someone in clear conditions, the GM would ask for a 7. If someone was laying a mine, more likely a 6. Firing over your shoulder at someone 30 metres away, while crouching behind a low wall would definitely be a 10!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
