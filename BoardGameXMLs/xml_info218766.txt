							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lonely Pony</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Festival of Wishes has been a tradition in the small town of Silvershine for generations. Each year the townsponies gather and tie their wishes around the settlement&amp;rsquo;s wondrous cherry trees as they blossom. Legend says that any wish made on this great occasion will be granted, yet for a pair of young friends, all has not gone as they expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, both the cherry trees and the mayor&amp;rsquo;s daughter, a pony by the name of Glittermane, have fallen ill as the Festival draws near. In desperation, the mayor reaches out to the PCs, pleading with them to find the druid Meadow Lark, who only recently moved away from town. Perhaps she can cure the sickness that has stricken both the trees of his beloved town, and his even more cherished daughter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lonely Pony is a stand-alone, family-friendly Pathfinder Roleplaying Game adventure set in the Ponyfinder campaign setting for 1st level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
