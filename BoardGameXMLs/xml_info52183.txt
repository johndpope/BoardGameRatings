			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You want it, we've got it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, the science fiction role-playing game you've been waiting for, Macho Women with Guns!  The game that shamelessly panders to your basest instincts!*  Where you can take the part of what else but Macho Women with Guns!  Blast aliens to bits!  Blast more aliens to bits!  Journey across the galaxy looking for aliens, and then blast them to bits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Or, integrate the truly universal theme of Macho Women with Guns into your other campaigns.  Like heroic fantasy, where you can use your strength and sword to hack -aliens- monsters to bits.  Or post-holocaust, where you can blast mutants to bits, or even the roaring twenties, where you can blast Bthulhu to bits.  The possibilities are limited only by the quantity of ammo you can carry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Macho Women with Guns is the game that knows what you want, and why you buy it.  Get it now!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note that the version described here says &amp;quot;Second edition, May 1989,&amp;quot; but is not the same as the 2nd Edition RPGItem; I believe this is actually the second printing of the first edition.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
