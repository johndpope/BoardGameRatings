			<description>From the packaging text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Twist &amp;amp; Hold 'Em Poker Cube features an entire deck of cards on one cube. Your 'hand' is the side that's facing you and the cards are 'shuffled' by turning the rows cube-style. Take anywhere for fun for the whole family!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pressman #1493 is basically a Rubik-style cube with stickers having playing card denominations on the faces. Also included are two six-sided dice. One of the dice lists a series of rotation instructions, and the other is the usual pip layout. Both dice have faces in six different colors that correspond to the centers of each face on the main card cube. The values of the central cube spaces increase by twos from 2 to Q (12) and progress through all four suits (hearts &amp;amp; spades are represented twice). The edge pieces are always two cards with a numerical difference of two and are always different in color. Similarly, the corner pieces progress in increments of two, half of them clockwise and half counterclockwise, and always two black and one red or two red and one black, with like colors never in matching suits. Rules for playing variants of Texas Hold 'Em, Black Jack, Vegas, Spades, Chicago Hi/Lo and Rummy are provided, but others could probably be adapted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
