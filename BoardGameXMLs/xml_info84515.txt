							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chronicles of Anyaka: Let Sleeping Dragons Lie</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is the fourth in the &amp;quot;Chronicles of Anyaka&amp;quot; series of modules. They are written so that they can be used as single adventures dropped into your campaign or as a series of modules that can take characters from the beginning of their career all the way to legendary status. This fourth module finds the characters gaining knowledge of the events that surrounded Anyaka's kidnapping as well as a new threat that has seemingly popped up overnight. In the wake of Anyaka's successful return, her mentor, the&lt;br/&gt;paladin Aurelius, sends a thankful note to the PCs. He also warns them of a new threat centered in the coastal city of Bluffside, one that seems to have arisen as a direct result of their successes in the caverns beneath Eston Manor. By the end of the adventure, the PCs should find themselves in possession of an important key to stopping the Cult of Shandrulaar as well as the burden of a frightening glimpse of the future that could be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Let Sleeping Dragons Lie&amp;quot; is a d20 fantasy adventure suitable for four characters of 8th level. This adventure requires the PCs to do a fair amount of investigation in between bouts of combat, so characters with Charisma-based skills will be useful to the party. A rogue who knows the inner workings of thieves' guilds might come in handy, as might a cleric when the characters descend into the crypts to face the undead horrors therein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
