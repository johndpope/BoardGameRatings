			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some programs are easy to describe and some are hard. This one is hard. A simple description does not really give credit to the software for it is a real fun game. On the other hand it is very difficult to bring it to a successful conclusion. If a game is too difficult, then it loses its appeal - too easy and it is boring. This game is played on the screen on which is displayed various railway tracks and four stations. Going round the tracks are five trains. Tracks may be connected to others by way of about 10 sets of points. The speed of the trains may be altered and the points may be controlled, thus the direction of the trains is under your command and the purpose is to get four of the trains into stations. We say four because the fifth is a &amp;quot;rogue&amp;quot; train - a runaway train - and you have to get all of your other trains out of the way. You cannot control it. Our difficulty in describing the game really arises because, although it is a simple game in conception, it is a difficult one for playing. The graphics are excellent (particularly the title one). Your skill is judged by time. Assuming that you do not have a crash then a player who can park all of his trains in the station in a lesser time than another is the winner. As with all our programs this one has been test played by a number of people (this sort of &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; is why I'm in this). Engine Driver comes with sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
