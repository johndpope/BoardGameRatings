							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dick Tracy (NES)</name>
									
			<description>Dick Tracy appeared in three video games released as tie-ins for the motion picture, one for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Bandai, one for the Game Boy (also by Bandai) and also one the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega Master System by Sega themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NES Version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bandai released their version of Dick Tracy in August 1990. The objective is to solve several mysteries without accusing the wrong person or shooting too many unarmed villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level starts out with a case to solve, and some possible clues. The player drives Tracy's vehicle through the city, avoiding snipers and other cars, to various locations mentioned in the clues, where the action shifts to a side-scrolling adventure game. If the player goes to the right location, he will find, during the course of his side-scrolling fighting, a clue icon that provides additional clues for the case, or the player will be able to speak with a character from the comics who give clues. There is one car chase in each level. Once the player has collected enough clues, he can drive to the location where the perpetrator is and arrest him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the side-scrolling mode, Tracy can jump, duck, punch, shoot from his pistol or collect more powerful weapons (with limited ammo). These include full-auto Tommy Guns and tear gas, the latter of which eliminates all on-screen enemies. If the player shoots unarmed crooks, then some of life energy is lost. The game provides two ways to restore health. One, if the players is down to 1/2 a life point, he can visit one of the police stations and recover an additional half-point. The second requires a &amp;quot;first-aid&amp;quot;, an icon found in some levels that looks like a heart,and is used by pressing B and Select at the same time. The game is considered very difficult to win, but there is a password feature to help players continue at a later time, as the game does not have any extra &amp;quot;lives&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;continues.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dick Tracy (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
