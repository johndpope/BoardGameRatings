			<description>&amp;quot;Spiele Minis&amp;quot; is a series of small surprise boxes (i.e., you don't know what you get) from Ravensburger. They are meant to be carry-on or gifts, suitable for children (&amp;quot;Mitbringspiel&amp;quot;). Some of the cubes contain actual games, others contain magic tricks, puzzles etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 24 playing cards (with 4 animals each on a 2x2 grid), 4 animal cards and 4 double action cards.&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives an animal card. Their objective is to try to get that kind of animal surrounded by other animals. On their turn a player draw one card and then place it next to another already placed card in a 5x5 card grid. The requisite is that at least one animal on the new card is touching the same animal on the previous card. When all cards have been placed the game ends. Then players receive one victory point for every one of their animal surrounded by other animals. &lt;br/&gt;The double action cards are a variant in which once in each game a player can place 2 cards on their turn instead of only one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
