			<description>The history of mankind is just starting. First antecedents of man are entering the scene full of wild prehistoric plants and bizarre creatures. You are one of them, a leader of a large group of anthropoids. A mysterious force of evolution makes you grow, multi-play and evolve at surprisingly high speed. For a quick evolution you need a lot of meat so you focus on hunting mammoths. The more mammoths you hunt down, the more quickly your brain grows.&lt;br/&gt;With a bigger brain you can do more things&amp;hellip; You can improve your hunting skills and face your enemies more successfully. The best hunters will achieve the desired goal of evolution, becoming a modern human &amp;ndash; and thus securing immortality of their species. Those less successful, whose development froze at a lower level of evolution, can at least go to have a chat with their relatives in a zoo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief summary of the game, the goal and the end of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The player determines by means of the cards of commands, where his pack should go. Packs go across the landscapes and they try to hunt down as many mammoths as possible (by going across cards with pictures of mammoths on them), so that they have proteins to grow their brains more quickly and to rise on the evolutionary meter. By doing this the skills of the pack will grow and evolutionary advantages can be acquired. The winner of the game is the person who will be the first to complete his evolution by reaching the level of a human homo-sapiens. At this moment the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
