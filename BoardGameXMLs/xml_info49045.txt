							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trashumantes</name>
									
			<description>For a long time, when summer arrives all shepherds take their flocks and go into the mountains in search for a better grass. They not only take care of theirs flocks, they have been ready for all the problems they will arose. Trashumantes is a funny shepherd's race to get the better mountain pastures in the seasonal migration (trashumance) of their herds. When summer arrives the shepherds gather their herds and move to the mountains to get the newly snow-free pastures... but they must keep an eye not only on their herds, but also on the dangers they can come across!  The objective of this game is be the first to take your flocks to the mountain, in a &amp;quot;push your luck&amp;quot; game with events cards and a combination of effects for the dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game published by the Spanish project &amp;quot;Pastor&amp;quot;, focused in raising awareness on the now endangered centuries-old task of trashumance, the seasonal migration of herds to better pastures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
