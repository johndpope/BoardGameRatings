							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reaper Madness</name>
									
			<description>From the Deep Dish website:&lt;br/&gt;Languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern safety equipment and medicine has made a mockery out of the process of natural selection. Millions of humans that should have died were saved and thrown back into the gene pool. As a result, the human race is becoming weaker instead of stronger. You are a Reaper Second Class who has been assigned to setting things straight. It is your job to trim the herd by presenting the dumbest of the dumb with ample opportunities to do themselves in. Distinguish yourself, and you will be rewarded with a long overdue promotion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal in Reaper Madness is to kill the most Meatbags (useless humans) by the end of the game. Your weapons are mundane objects and the stupidity of your victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;Kegger Edition&amp;quot; the setting is a frat party, the perfect place to harvest dozens of drunken partygoers. Future editions will follow the Reapers to new hunting grounds in their quest to rid the world of Meatbags that should have killed themselves off years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
