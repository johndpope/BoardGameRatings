							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribe Details Generator</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribes exist in almost all games and genres. Some view them as noble savages in tune with the world; others believe them to be uncivilised animals, with the truth being something else entirely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This generator, or series of tables, is designed to help flesh out any needed details you require for your tribe. Use all of them or just one, they are entirely optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each aspect of a tribe, a question is asked. This is normally something that can be answered in a few words or a sentence or two at maximum. When coming up with your own ideas try to stick to this guideline as much as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may find that when rolling on all of the tables that you get odd results that at first glance do not make sense, such as a mountain based tribe trading in horses. Use this as a sour of inspiration for truly original tribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various aspects covered are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ceremony&lt;br/&gt;     Clothing&lt;br/&gt;     Combat&lt;br/&gt;     Favoured Colour&lt;br/&gt;     Favoured Weapon&lt;br/&gt;     Headdress&lt;br/&gt;     Known for&lt;br/&gt;     Leader&lt;br/&gt;     Magic&lt;br/&gt;     Movement&lt;br/&gt;     Population&lt;br/&gt;     Possessions&lt;br/&gt;     Race&lt;br/&gt;     Relaxation&lt;br/&gt;     Symbol&lt;br/&gt;     Tattoos&lt;br/&gt;     Terrain&lt;br/&gt;     Totem/Spirit Animal&lt;br/&gt;     Trade&lt;br/&gt;     View of outsiders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, if you need a name for your tribe, then the Tribe Name Generator by Ennead Games is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
