			<description>Operation Afghanistan is a solitaire game of Combat during the Soviet-Afghan War. The player assumes the role of a commander of combined forces in Afghanistan. As commander, you are responsible for securing your Area of Operations (AOR) by successfully conducting various military operations in order to locate and destroy the enemy. Although there are many units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;The objective of Operation Afghanistan is to successfully complete a number of missions and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for the Soviet Forces. The player can choose to play a short game (4 Missions), an average game (6 Missions), a long game (8 Missions) or a full Tour (12 Missions). Once all Missions have been resolved (successfully or not) the Player totals his VP and compares this with the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Afghanistan contains many colorful Unit Counters. Soviet forces include Spetsnaz, Desantnik, MI-24 Hinds, MI-17 Hips, BTRs, BMPs, Automatic Grenade Launchers, Mortars, DsHKs, Leaders and Air Support. Afghan forces include Mujahedeen, CIA trained Mujahedeen, Recoilless Rifles, and Mortars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OPERATION AFGHANISTAN may be purchased at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
