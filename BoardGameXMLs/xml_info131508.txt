			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tomcat Fridolin is very curious, so he looks at all the people on the playground and in the market very carefully. Filled with fascination, Fridlin observes the faces of both children and adults, and he sees that they show very different feelings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Was ist da los?, children travel with the tomcat Fridolin into the world of feelings. During the game you'll look at the depicted children and explain the many different behaviors, emotions, and situations they're experiencing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
