			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;This is a Sports Management Simulation game similar to the typical Soccer Management Simulation Games that are popular.  However, this one covers American Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically you are the General Manager of an NFL Team, you must draft a team, set the play styles and tendencies, and choose the depth charts for your team as you play toward a championship game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to this, you must set ticket and concession prices, as you set salaries for your players to try to keep them all together, all while trying to stay under the league set salary cap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
