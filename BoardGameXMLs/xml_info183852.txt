							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">I.S.P. Dragonfly</name>
									
			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE I. S. P. DRAGONFLY is a game of awful crimes, desperate negotiations, and the hope of redemption. This is a game for any size group of adults who are not easily offended. The subject matter is centered on wants and needs of people who have committed grave crimes. If the group you&amp;rsquo;re playing with has limitations, or certain subject matter they wish to avoid, it would be a good idea to discuss that prior to beginning and come to an agreement. It is to be noted that this game also requires a bit of public speaking - so that should be considered by anyone who does not care for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note: A Game Chef 2015 Finalist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
