			<description>Chaos Code (カオスコード Kaosu Kōdo) is a fighting game developed by FK Digital and published by Arc System Works. The game was released for Sega's RingWide arcade system board on August 4, 2011. A port for the PlayStation 3 was first released on December 19, 2012 on Hong Kong's PlayStation Network, followed by subsequent home releases in both Japan and North America in 2013 and Europe in 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a standard 8-way lever and four button (weak punch, weak kick, strong punch, strong kick) system. Characters can be customized prior to the fight, such as selecting two &amp;quot;edit special moves&amp;quot; from four possibilities to go along with the character's built-in attacks. Players can also select between &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;step&amp;quot; modes, placing the focus respectively on speed and technical play. The game makes use of a couple of systems that can quickly change the flow of battle:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destruction Chaos: A high level super move that, if successfully connects, can eliminate half of the opponent's life gauge.&lt;br/&gt;Exceed Chaos: Place the character into a special status which removes limitations on combos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chaos Code&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
