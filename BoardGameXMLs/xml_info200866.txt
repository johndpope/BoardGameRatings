							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goat Simulator - PAYDAY</name>
									
			<description>Introducing Goat Simulator: PAYDAY, the latest in goat simulation technology. Being a goat has never been this realistic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Beat people up and take their money - use your goat crew to smash &amp;amp; grab, then blast away all your money at Mahatma Gambling, the Indian casino - just like in that Al Cappuccino movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- PRANKNET - The static contract database lets goats pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Crimean, and you get to run his errands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Buy things - use your easy-earned cash to buy different things. Mostly masks. Okay only masks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- More masks - because obviously we haven&amp;rsquo;t been clear enough. You can even wear that mask with the American flag on it, whatever that character is called i don&amp;rsquo;t know, i just write the damn text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- FOUR AWESOME GOATS, seriously these guys are like they&amp;rsquo;re from an Al Pancake movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Be a camel, or even a dolphin in a wheelchair, there are no limits here (except the 4 playable goats).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Unlock new, even dumber stuff. Because this is friggin&amp;rsquo; Goat Simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
