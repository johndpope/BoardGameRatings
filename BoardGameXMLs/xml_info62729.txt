							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Things We Think About Games</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Hindmarch and Jeff Tidball think a lot about games. At their commentary website, Gameplaywright.net, they think out loud about what it means to play games, make games, sell games, and love games. They are gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, with fellow game designers and notable game players, they think out loud on paper in the first Gameplaywright book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things We Think About Games collects dozens on dozens of bite-sized thoughts about games. From the absurd to the magnificent, the demonstrable to the dogmatic, this collection spans both the breadth of games- board, card, roleplaying and more- and the depth of gaming, offering insights about collecting, playing, critiquing, designing, and publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
