			<description>Nine cards, each with one number from 0 to 100, are arranged face-up in a 3X3 grid. Players simultaneously try to create equations using at least three cards in the grid and as many math symbols as necessary. A player keeps the cards he uses to make an equation, and those cards are replaced in the grid with new ones. Play continues until the deck runs out. The player who has collected the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
