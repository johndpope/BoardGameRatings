							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Best Defense Round 2</name>
									
			<description>From the first page of the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has long been a fragile peace between the shadowy forces of Netheril on one side and the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr and its eladrin allies on the other. The Shade Princes, War Wizards, and High Mages have studied each other's strengths and weaknesses for thousands of years. The only thing that has kept the sides from each other's throats is fear of the utter devastation that an all-out war between such magical giants would cause. Now something has disturbed the precarious balance. The power of Shade Enclave is growing; not even the greatest heroes could prevent the fall of Elturel. If the forces of light don't strike back now, it may soon be too late...&lt;br/&gt;This is Round 2 of a two-round continuous-play Living Forgotten Realms battle interactive set in Netheril for characters of the Heroic and Paragon tiers (levels 1 &amp;ndash; 20). This adventure is part of the Desolation series.&lt;br/&gt;Battle Interactives are combat-intensive. Players who do not enjoy combat encounters are less likely to enjoy this adventure. We recommend that event organizers try to run at least five tables of this event, and that at least three of the characters at each table be members of the same Adventuring Company. This adventure may only be run at Wizards Play Network (WPN) Public Play events. It is not sanctioned for Private Play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
