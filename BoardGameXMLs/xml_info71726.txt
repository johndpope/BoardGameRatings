							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Het Lepel Spel</name>
									
			<description>This game is an advertising collateral for the Dutch movie, Lepel. It is a basic roll-and-move game where players become a character from the movie and race to the finish line on the track on the board. Along the way, landing on a yellow square simulates events in the movie and requires referring to the instructions to see what advantage is gained or penalty has occurred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The movie appears to be about a boy, Lepel, whose parents are supposed to be on a trip around the world in a hot-air balloon and who is looked after by a nasty grandmother. After she denies him a gift of a balloon from a department store salesmen, Lepel runs away and hides in the department store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
