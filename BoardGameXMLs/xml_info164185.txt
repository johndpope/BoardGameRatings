			<description>Card game of chance. 36 cards:&lt;br/&gt;15 cards form the 'board'. 9 are number cards from 0 to 8. 18 cards will form the deck that is cut to decide the number 'rolled'. 2 rules cards and an advertising card make up the total number of cards in the game. Finally, there is a supply of classy looking counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Banker. The other players may bet on any of the cards forming the board. When everybody has finished betting, the main deck is shuffled and cut and that is the winning number. Players either lose their bets to the Banker or collect their winnings from the Banker. End when you like. The one with the most 'money' is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
