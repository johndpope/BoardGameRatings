							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War Against Russia</name>
									
			<description>War Against Russia is a free Print and Play game covering the German assault against Russia. It is an introductory wargame designed to introduce people to wargames. The map covers the area between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. The game covers the time frame of May 1941 to May 1942 with each turn representing a month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn the players will move units, attack, and check supply. Supply lines are determined by counting hexes from roads, cities, and the edge of the board. (The number of hexes ranges from three to six, depending on the weather.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weather is determined each turn and can range from clear to muddy, snowy, hard frost, or subarctic. Each type of weather affects movement, and attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is determined by rolling on a Combat Results Table. Movement is determined by the unit movement value combined with the terrain effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
