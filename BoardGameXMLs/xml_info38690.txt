			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using miniature figures mounted two per base. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The decisive battle of the 1745 Jacobite Rising took place at Culloden in April, 1746. The English army had been strengthened by reinforcements from the continent, and well trained by the Duke of Cumberland. They were well prepared to fight the Jacobite forces of Prince Charles. The Jacobites were outnumbered, low on supplies, and poorly led in the battle. They were subjected to a deadly artillery barrage, and outflanked by the English. The battle was a disaster for the Jacobites, and ended the rising.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
