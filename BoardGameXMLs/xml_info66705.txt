			<description>War In Hell: The toy soldier game of Apocalyptic Conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This game is intended to be a Complete Fantasy Game, with unbelievable beings struggling for unattainable goals. The rules and structure aims only to be internally consistent, and players have to determine tactics and actions based solely on the briefings and rules presented to them - they have no &amp;lsquo;historical reality&amp;rsquo; (whatever that is) to appeal to.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game draws heavily on Judeo-Christian source material - particularly medieval notions of hell and demonology - for its inspiration, but it is not intended to be a realistic depiction of the similar elements of that belief system, and any offence caused to Christians is entirely unintended and accidental.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The key thing to remember in playing this game is that it takes place in an alien environment that is truly incomprehensible to mortal humans. What you see and experience is only your feeble mind attempting to make sense of the unknowable. If it seems like some sort of weird hallucinogenic dream then perhaps that is the nature of the world we are simulating.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game is played on a table-top using toy soldiers. Absolutely any toy soldiers can be used, from any period and any scale from ancient Egyptians to starship marines. The terrain is a representation of the landscape of hell. Hell is what you make it, so there are no guidelines - anything that fits your conception will do. Sometimes we play using multiple tables, each representing a Circle of Hell - but much depends on how much space you plan to take up and how many players are taking part.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
