							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">8-Bit Swordsman: Clash For the Prism of Punishment</name>
									
			<description>The Prism of Punishment awards its bearer with unfathomable strength and power, but it must be earned through a trial of strength and the bloodshed of your opponents (some Human, others not so much). The combatants take turns playing cards for movement around the arena, attacking their opponent, and scoring points. The first player to earn 15 points (and not have Curse: The Second Journey successfully played on them in response) has earned enough Shards to fuse them together to complete the Prism and earn victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features and Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    4 player tokens&lt;br/&gt;    10 rocks which hinder moves/attacks, placed by the players on the field prior to beginning the game.&lt;br/&gt;    72 Cards, 2 Types(Equipment cards for moves/attacks, or Curses: cards which hinder opponents while poking fun at/giving a nod to old-school rpgs.)&lt;br/&gt;    2 double-sided game mats, printed and designed to form a storage box!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
