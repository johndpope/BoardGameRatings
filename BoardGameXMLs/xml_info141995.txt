							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Andy Pandy and Teddy are Fast Asleep</name>
									
			<description>Game published in the Andy Pandy's Annual, aimed at pre-school children. One player is red and the other player is blue. The red player travels along the red line and the blue travels along the blue line. Both lines are equidistant from the winning space in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moves are determined by the throw of a die. When the blue player lands on a yellow square, he goes forward two spaces. When the red player lands on a green square, he goes forward two spaces. If either player lands on a grey square, that player has to go back three spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the centre illustration of Andy Pandy and Teddy having a sleep on a garden bench, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andy Pandy was created for the BBC television slot that later became Watch With Mother. In 1952, 13 episodes were recorded and these thirteen shows continued to be broadcast for 18 years! In 1970, the BBC made another 13 shows, this time in colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
