			<description>Translated, Our Five Senses.  This is an educational game (entirely in French) to help kids learn about their senses.  You roll and attach the puzzle pieces that correspond to the sense you have on your play board (hearing, smell, touch, sight, or taste). This game also comes with a corresponding educational guide for parents to assist them in helping children explore their five senses. Comes with 5 player boards, a die, and 6 puzzle pieces per board that attach to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
