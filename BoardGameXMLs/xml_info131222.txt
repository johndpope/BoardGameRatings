			<description>Abracadabra (Who are you? A creative liar or a walking encyclopedia?) is a party game based on the game Dictionary. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works: pick a card from the deck, see the word on it and read it out loud. This word is most likely UNKNOWN to you but painfully SIMILAR to a word that you most likely do know.  &lt;br/&gt;Your task is to summon your deepest knowledge or, even better, your acting skills, and convince the other players that you know exactly what the word means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is an Enchiridion? A collapsible folder? A Mexican food? A rare-earth metal? Do you have your own version?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only one word, but everyone will have their own interpretation of what it means. You have to convince everyone that YOUR definition of the word is correct. The key to Abracadabra lies in a player&amp;rsquo;s ability to improvise the definitions and persuade all the other players that you really do know what you're talking about. Players earn points by convincing other players that their definition is correct, or at least close to correct, by betting on the most accurate definitions and by actually getting the definition right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
