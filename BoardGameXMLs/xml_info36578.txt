							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes &amp; Hordes II</name>
									
			<description>A solo card game pitting the player's heroic bands of men, elves, and dwarves against evil hordes of monsters. The game culminates in a climactic battle which the heroes must win to prevail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom deck containing approximately 120 cards. There are four types of cards: Heroes (forces of the men, elves, or dwarves), Hordes (forces of the goblins, undead, and dragons), Traits, and Events. The Heroes fight in three groups segregated by race. The Evil Hordes also fight in separate groups until all cards have been drawn from the deck, at which point the remaining Hordes form into a single unit which the Heroes must destroy to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
