							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horrific Haunts</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haunts, first introduced in the GameMastery Guide, are a fascinating option for GMs to keep in their toolboxes. Mechanically they are very similar to traps, but in flavor they are more similar to undead. Haunts allow a GM to add significant spookiness to an area, and give that atmosphere important in-game effects. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to tell players the walls of an old crypt are bleeding, and quite another when the blood is accompanied by a horrific shriek and you inform the players they each need to make a save against fear. However, like any new rules system, haunts could only receive so much support when first introduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Genius Guide to Horrific Haunts is designed to expand the options available to a GM who wishes to employ haunts, offering a bit of advice on the effective use of haunts, provide a few new options that can be applied to any haunt, and give a few new ready-to-go haunts for a GM to add immediately to a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
