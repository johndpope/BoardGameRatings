			<description>Each player takes one of one hundred and twenty cards with a quote on it by a famous author at the time. The rules have a story with blank sections and the players have to fit the correct quote into the appropriate blank. The game was devised to amuse because players (particularly children, will frequently put the wrong quote into the right blank (and vice versa).&lt;br/&gt;The box says &amp;quot;A little fun now and then, is relished by the best of men&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
