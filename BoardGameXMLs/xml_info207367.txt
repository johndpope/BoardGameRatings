							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill the Bill</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new semi-cooperative card game of political negotiation, deception and voting in which players are politicians from the two big parties but who also try to push forward an individual hidden agenda. This game was initially designed as a game-base learning tool at the London School of Economics and Political Science to introduce students to collective decision-making, game theory and market regulation. The game scales well at different player counts and plays under 1 hour. Gamers and non-gamers alike will enjoy Kill the Bill. It rewards experienced players who manage well their hand of cards and use them in the appropriate way and at the right time. However, the game can be also thoroughly enjoyed as a party game with a strong take-that component in which negotiation and bluffing skills may compensate the lack of experience playing the tactics cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;In Kill the Bill, players are members of a high profile Committee in the U.S. Congress who try to pass legislation benefiting both their political party and their own secret individual agenda. Each year 3 bills are discussed and voted by the Committee. The goal of the game is to become the most popular politician by the end of the fourth year (round) so to become the front-runner in the next presidential campaign. &lt;br/&gt;Players obtain points by passing bills which are favorable to the interest of their party (party scoring track), or favorable to their individual agenda (agenda scoring track). Moreover players get (and lose) popularity points throughout the game as effect of the political tactics cards played. Skillful persuasion and negotiation are important to success. However, in politics things are never straightforward. A wide range of political tactics (cards) are available to players who can unexpectedly turn decisive votes in their favor. Building alliances across the party lines, having a long-term strategy in mind and showing tactical flexibility are important in &amp;quot;Kill the Bill&amp;quot; too. Players must be ready for blackmail, bribery, deception and treason. Sometimes the end justifies the means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn order&lt;br/&gt;Each round consist of 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;1-Preparation (new tactics cards are dealt -draft in the first year, Committee Chair is selected and bills presented)&lt;br/&gt;2-Logrolling (negotiation) phase: players try to persuade each other to support or oppose certain bills&lt;br/&gt;3-Political tactics phase: tactics cards are played&lt;br/&gt;4-Voting phase: bills are voted and scoring tracks adjusted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
