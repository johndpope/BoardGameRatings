			<description>In Welches Tier passt hier?, each player places an engine tile in front of him/her. The wagon tiles, each of which contains an animal, are placed face down on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player picks up a tile, looks at it, and makes the appropriate sound of the animal. If it is an animal that fits to his/her train &amp;ndash; each wagon can only be followed by a wagon containing a certain other animal &amp;ndash; it is placed at the player's train; if not, it is returned to its place. Later, players should remember where to find the tiles they currently need. There are some conductor cow cards; these serve as jokers and can be placed behind any other wagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When three conductors have been added, the game ends and the player with the longest train is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
