			<description>Code Age Commanders: Tsugu Mono Tsuga Reru Mono (コード・エイジ コマンダーズ ～継ぐ者 継がれる者～) is part of the Code Age series, a franchise created by video game artist Yusuke Naora and designed to span different interweaved titles in multiple platforms and media. The series consists of this game, the mobile phone game Code Age Brawls, and the manga Code Age Archives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of the game depicts the struggles of people surviving in a fictional &amp;quot;intraglobular world&amp;quot; menaced by an impending destruction, mysterious warped creatures, and different factions warring against each other. The game focuses successively on the viewpoints of four main protagonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Code Age Commanders is an action role-playing game divided in missions, in which the goal is to fight enemies called &amp;quot;Coded&amp;quot; to reach a certain area of the map, where a boss must sometimes be defeated. The player controls one character while other allies are computer-controlled and must not die for the mission to be successful. Between two missions, the player can select in a menu numerous optional cut scenes to watch and which reveal the memories of the Coded defeated, while stages already completed can be re-explored. The game features four successive main playable characters, and items and skills learned by one is each time passed to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons are equipped on both hands of the characters and are used with the circle and cross buttons. Pressing both buttons in succession is necessary to execute combos. The other buttons are used to lock focus onto an enemy, guard, dash, or manually change the camera angle. The number of attacks and blocks is limited by an energy meter for each arm, which decreases after each move but replenishes with time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third meter increases after each combo and allows when maxed out to perform a &amp;quot;Code Drive&amp;quot; attack. Executed with the triangle button, a Code Drive triggers a brief close-up sequence in which a blue circle appears around the character. If the player presses a second button before the circle shifts to red, a powerful special attack will be unleashed. If the enemy blocks the Code Drive, a second, shorter close-up sequence is triggered. Enemies can also perform Code Drives, in which case the player's button press allows for protection rather than attack. Executing Code Drives frequently can cause the weapon used to upgrade, or the character to go into a &amp;quot;Code Crisis&amp;quot;; a mode which reduces speed and renders immune to attack, but slowly drains hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Code Age Commanders&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
