							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Immortal Saga</name>
									
			<description>The Immortal Saga is a collectible competitive card game set in the distant past on ancient Earth. The gods have discovered an unbound power that they receive through human worship, and they thirst for it more than anything else in the universe. We were once used to collect raw materials for the divine sky-chariots to haul away into the heavens, we were nothing more than creatures created by the gods for slave labor&amp;hellip; until the divining occurred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We rebelled against the creators. Fed up with our defiance and costly ignorance, the golden ones ascended into the heavens, much to our surprise. Then, slowly at first but with increasing frequency, our children were born with gifts. We learned that the gods wanted to apologize and through freeing us from their whips and even granting our children the power of the ascended, the beings we once dreaded, were loved as fathers and mothers. We came to accept them as divine beings, for does not a father or mother disciple their children before they are allowed to make decisions that affect their lives? The gods are benevolent and we even have come to depend upon their charity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All they ask is for our worship and the rains shall fall, the crops shall grow and we shall be at peace&amp;hellip; or so we thought. Without worship, the gods cannot function and if one loves their god and their way of life, they will fight for it. So, our leaders, mortals and Immortals alike, have created vast armies to spread the word of our benefactors, the supreme beings that rule over us, like omniscient parents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters are played by Immortals that have been gifted by their god&amp;rsquo;s, powers of immense potential and limitless possibility. For their gifts, the gods require the Immortal peoples to pontificate the benevolence of the heavenly-ones through words, actions and deeds. Some Immortals find that politics of leadership and the courts are their strong-suit but more often than not, they take to the fields of battle to vanquish the antithesis of their deities. Killing mortals and Immortals, the demi-gods of war shall know no bounds and shall be bound only by their master&amp;rsquo;s will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players create characters through an easy but in-depth creation process. Each character has a school where he learned to use his powers, skills that he picked up to help him during his adventures, techniques which are the moves he uses to engage his foes, equipment to deal damage and blunt attacks, and of course his deck of power. Characters move upon a semi-randomized board as they try to knock their opponents out cold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
