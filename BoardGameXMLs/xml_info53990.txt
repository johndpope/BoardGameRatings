							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Halls of the Mountain-King (d20 3.5 Version)</name>
									
			<description>an adventure for 8th to 12th&amp;ndash;level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all open design projects this adventure is only available to it's patrons, and patrons of the following project that choose to purchase it. This is the first open design project that has been designed for a dual release for OGL (3.5) and GSL (4.0) versions, patrons were able to sponsor one or both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Halls of the Mountain King is an untraditional dungeon, an homage to all the great delves, from the Mines of Moria on&amp;mdash;with a few new twists.&lt;br/&gt;The dwarves of the canton of Rygar were a hardworking group, whose mining lured them everdeeper and whose pursuit of ore led them into dangerous territory. This dungeon goes from a snowy mountaintop spire and an airship dock down through the great halls and works of a vanished clan, and into the depths of the earth. The rumors of a huge mass of gold lured miners and speculators into the mountain, but when winter came, the old mines were suddenly a much more difficult place to survive. The passes are snowed in. The airships struggle to arrive with supplies. Deadly new creatures, a sinister brotherhood, and secrets kept locked away for centuries all boil to the surface in a series of challenging and original encounters that take the party from 8th to 12th level.&lt;br/&gt;Now the party is asked to go up into the Ironcrag peaks and see whether the easy money is, perhaps, not so easy after all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
