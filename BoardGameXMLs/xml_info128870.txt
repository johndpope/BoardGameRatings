			<description>In Zombie in my Pocket, a cooperative game for 1-4 players, players start in separate areas, fending off zombies and trying to find their friends. As they progress through a house, a hospital, a warehouse, or other locations, they find important items, fight zombies, and (perhaps) suffer terrible death. Once everyone has found each other, they meet in the graveyard and make their way to bury the evil totem to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Zombie in my Pocket &amp;ndash; solo version&lt;br/&gt;    Zombie in my Pocket &amp;ndash; 1-8 player competitive version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
