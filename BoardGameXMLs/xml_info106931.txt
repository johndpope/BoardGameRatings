							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">In Hunting a Monster</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the brave princes of the earth who guard against the wicked and dreadful Anathema-kings of old. They are the thin scarlet line between the most civilized Realm and the barbarians at the gate. Without their ever-watchful-eye and powerful dragon- touched hands, Creation would be defenseless against the evil foe. They know their enemy. They stay one step ahead of the wretched. To serve is an honor, and to retire is a glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are the shikari - the warriors who form the Wyld Hunt. This is a story of a circle of shikari, a group sworn to defend the Realm and destroy the foul Anathema, wherever they may hide. This is a story of what happens when duty goes wrong. What happens when the indomitable hunt is hunting the wrong target? When they are ready for one demon-breed but end up against another?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, most important, what happens when the hunters must hunt their own?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
