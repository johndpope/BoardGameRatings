							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">It Came from Beyond the Still</name>
									
			<description>A Word from Grandpa McCoy&lt;br/&gt; &amp;ldquo;It all started when Junior spotted something strange over in the cornfield. Ma grabbed Sonnie boy and Suzy got the shotgun and out we went. Me and ol besty was ready to be good close personal friends with whoever was breaking into the still. We heard some noises by the still and that&amp;rsquo;s when Drunk Bob got that look in his eye that he gets when he goes out on his weekly Men in Plaid meetings. The look that says I&amp;rsquo;m going to kick the crap out of some varmints. He was madder than a hornet stuck in molasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So there we were looking around in the still and at first we thought it weren&amp;rsquo;t nothing noways but then outta the corner of my eye I could see the varmint! It were grayer than the night is before a bonfire and had big blue green colored eyes like the Hatfield&amp;rsquo;s above ground swimming pool. I swear there&amp;rsquo;s something livin in that thing. Anyway listen here the thing were an alien surer than it were anything else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We were scared but we grabbed our lead and went out for the glory. Drunk Bob tossed a cocktail at them and the thing lit up one of them like roman candle. Sonnie Boy had his potato cannon and he fired at that robot thing they had. Well the taters bounced off but some of them got stuck in its feet and sure enough them mashed taters caused it to trip over into the catfish pond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had them alien varmints on the run but they left shooting and kept trying to probe one of our cows. That&amp;rsquo;s when we heard the sirens of them revenuers. The authorities are always trying to come and steal our shine. It makes me madder than a tick on a bull&amp;rsquo;s rocky mountain oysters to think of them government types. Anyway if they come back we&amp;rsquo;ll be ready for them &amp;ndash; the aliens and the revenuers.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hold in your hands the ultimate game of hilarious aliens versus hillbilly combat. It Came From Beyond the Still is a skirmish-level tabletop miniatures wargame in which two or more sides engage in mortal combat for life, liberty and the booze. So tell your kin to be prepared and to play responsibly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Came From Beyond the Still is a stand-alone game that is playable in about an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
