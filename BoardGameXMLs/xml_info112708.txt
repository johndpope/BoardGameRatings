							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Straddle</name>
									
			<description>Straddle is a skill-action party game played on a giant planisphere (5 ft x 6 ft plastic playing mat) and combines a fun mix of practical and observational astronomy. Playing like Hasbro&amp;rsquo;s classic Twister game, the object is to touch a star or constellation using only your feet or hands and be the last player not to touch any other body part to the mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player stands at a corner of the mat in socks or bare feet. The umpire spins the spinner and calls out the body part and the star or constellation, for example, left hand Orion. The first player puts his or her left hand on the constellation Orion. Using the supplied star charts, the umpire can help a player determine what stars are in the constellation. Play continues to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player touches the mat with any body part except a hand or a foot, that player is eliminated. Be the last player not to touch any other body part to the Straddle mat to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
