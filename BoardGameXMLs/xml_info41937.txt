			<description>It's an ice cream party! And what's as fun as eating ice cream? Stacking them as high as possible, of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your children will love to play Scoops: The Card Game while learning to share and take turns. They'll have so much fun that your children will forget who's winning!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card Game is a 2-6 player game for your living room table that's fast, fun, and makes less of a mess than a real ice cream party! A luck-based game for children. Cards depicting two ice cream scoops are drawn and must be played on a matching scoop atop one of the players' cones, not necessarily one's own. The tallest cone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
