			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point B is a Science Fiction Role-Playing Game, designed to be played by 2 or more people. Point B begins with a particular starting position of future human history, then send the players through a shift in their understanding of the world. In its standard form, Point B is designed to be run by a game referee or umpire, called the GM (game master). All the remaining players take on the role of characters in the world overseen by the GM. For those familiar with free-form and GM-less games however, the setting and ideas of Point B can be easily transformed into your favourite system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
