			<description>Krump is an abstract strategy game for two players that is played on a 6x6 board. Each player starts with twelve units placed on the back two rows. The goal is to capture eight of the opponent's units. One player is black and the other is red.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units are moved with a combination of movement cards and movement pyramids. Players choose movement cards each round and then place movement pyramids on the cards. A card can have any number of pyramids placed on it, but the pip count of the pyramids can't exceed the number on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns during each round placing movement pyramids and moving units. When a pyramid is placed on a card, any one unit or stack that contains a unit of that size is able to move. Up to two units can be in a stack at one time, but a stack can not be broken once it is formed. Each unit and unit stack type moves differently, for a total of six different movement patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement options early in the game are limited. As more enemy units are captured, however, players gain access to additional movement cards and can use the captured enemy units as movement pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
