			<description>The game consists of two matching sets of tiles (in two colors) with coats of arms on them. One of the sets is openly spread out on the table, while the other one is dealt to the players. When the game starts, each player opens his/her own tiles and tries to find the matching tiles on the table, grab them and put them on his/her own tiles. The coats of arms are rather similar, so mistakes happen. &lt;br/&gt;When the first player has covered all his/her original tiles, each correct pair counts one point, each wrong pair counts minus two points and plus two points for the &amp;quot;rightful owner&amp;quot;. The first player to reach 50 points after several rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
