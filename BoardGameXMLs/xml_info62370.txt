			<description>This game is essentially for five players. It is played with a standard deck of cards. Each player gets eight cards, the remainders are placed on the table. At each turn a player captures one or more table cards by pairing them with one or more cards of the same rank from his hand (there are some other ways to win cards as well). When he can no longer do so he must throw his hand in by adding his cards face up to those still on the table and ceasing play. Play continues till all but one player have finished. The last player and those who have won more than eight cards get money from the pot, those who have won less than eight cards pays into the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
