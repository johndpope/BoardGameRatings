			<description>Children's card game featuring Benjamin Bl&amp;uuml;mchen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a hand of cards, each player adds a card to the face-up stack pile. The card added must be either the same colour as the previous card (thus changing the number) or the same number (thus changing the colour. Being a game for youngsters, after they have made a legal play, they can then add any other card from their hand to the stack (so, in one turn, they should be able to use two cards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to use all their cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
