							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blooded Slayer Class</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Blooded Slaughterer is what remains from a warrior who was exposed to a terrible ritual known as the Sanguine Pact. Within, the subject of the ritual finds their humanity yanked away, leaving only a shell of the person they once were. In the place of a soul is a greater understanding of how what lies inside the body works: the organs, muscles, tendons, and all other viscera that pulse and stream within.  They are vicious fighters that range from calm and collected monster hunters to maniacal killers bent on destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This class guide will you show you how to bring this unique class to D&amp;amp;D.  It emphasizes combat and allows for a unique roleplaying experience as a broken person in search of their former humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Subclasses:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sanguine Growth Mutation- These Blooded Slayer's see their bodies reshaped by the pact. Many of them succumb to their metamorphosis and become complete maniacs, others utilize them effectively and learn to live with them. Brute force is their primary style of attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tainted Neuron Mutation- The Sanguine Pact manipulates the brains of these types of Blooded Slayers, giving them unique types of power through blood magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pact Seizure Mutation- These Blooded Slayer's embrace the pact and manage to remain unchanged anatomically, but instead allow the Pact to manipulate their body for them. The Pact sporadically seizes the Slaughterer's brain in combat to unleash precise strikes and deadly criticals.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer Summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
