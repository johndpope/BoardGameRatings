			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing Timetripper&amp;trade;, the game with a past and an attitude. History appears right before players' eyes as they travel back in time to remember important events, pop culture and legendary personalities. Players are asked to guess the year of key milestones in current affairs, music, politics and entertainment. Every player guesses on every question in a race to earn letters and be the first to spell fun words, such as Pink Panther or Mellow Yellow, to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
