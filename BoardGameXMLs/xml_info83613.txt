			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Vakantie Racer the player and his whole street has won the first price in a streetlottery.  They won a vacation on the camping Walhalla in Monaco.  But there is one problem, only one place is free for the next 20 years, so now all the people have to race to get that last spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player chooses one of the five characters with who he wants to complete the race.  Then they have to start a race in 6 parts from Maastricht to Monaco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
