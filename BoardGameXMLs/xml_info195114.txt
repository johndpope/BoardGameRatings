			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WizArt is a strategy card game for 2-3 players where you try to acquire knowledge from 3 different magic schools (the cosmic, the elemental or the temporal) in order to graduate as a mage faster than your opponents. To win the game, you must play cards and invest knowledge crystals. If you played well, you will then be able to level up at the beginning of your turn and acquire more power. Depending on the cards that you play, you will be able to use crystals of your opponents. If you reach mage level 5 or if you have eliminated all other players, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WizArt is an exciting strategy card game with a lot of player interaction which is easy to learn but hard to master. It takes about 30 minutes to play and is suitable for players who are 8 years or older.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
