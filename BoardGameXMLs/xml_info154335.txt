							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grand Tour: A Racing Adventure Game</name>
									
			<description>An entry level bicycle racing game with dice rolling being the first stage in movement with a small hand of cards available to adjust the final movement total each turn. Use of the cards adds some of the color of racing and can be a major factor in the flow of the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The race has three stages including a time trial on a two sided board. The first and third stages are started at opposite ends of one side of the board and the time trial uses the second side. Points are earned at sprint lines and at the finish of each stage. Wind, pothole and water puddle spaces provide obstacles to the riders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes the double sided board, 6 rider miniatures, 120 Grand Tour Cards, 30 Feed Zone cards, 2 D-6, a pencil, notepad and the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
