							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dice Bowl Football</name>
									
			<description>Dice Bowl Football is a two-player game where opponents coach teams in a battle of wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with twelve special dice representing offensive plays, defensive formations, and special teams. Each coach calls a play, and dice are rolled depending on the calls. The offense chooses a play based on risk vs. reward. If the defense anticipates the play correctly, they roll more dice and have a better chance of stopping the offense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no complicated charts to search through after each play is called. The outcome of the play is read directly from the dice. Quickly the coaches move on to the next play, and the action is never bogged down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this simplicity of play, the game contains all the moves and strategy of a real football game. Everything that can happen in football can happen on your game table, from Onside Kicks to Long Bombs. Aside from offense and defense, there are also dice for special plays, penalties, and kicking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes everything you need to play a game: 12 dice with customizing stickers, card decks representing the playing field, scoreboard, and game clock, 4 scoring rings, 2 field markers, a large cloth bag, and instructions for playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field is built by laying out the provided standard-size cards, which means that all components fit into a large cloth bag. This makes it easy to take Dice Bowl along to tailgates, picnics, and parties. Dice Bowl is a great family game with a nice mix of strategy, gamesmanship, and a little luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
