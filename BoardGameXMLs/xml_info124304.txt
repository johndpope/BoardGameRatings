			<description>An expansion combining both Empire Builder and Eurorails.  Players start with a Freight train on each board as well as a Freighter to transport Commodities from one continent to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trains and Freighters must be in the same Port at the same time to transfer a Commodity, unless a Warehouse is built to store Commodities, ($10 in a Port).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the Trains, the Freighter can be upgraded to a Heavy Freighter to increase its load capacity from two Commodities to three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freighters take three turns to cross the ocean.  Transatlantic deliveries pay double.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This variant is included in Train Gamers Gazette 2(1).  Warehouses, Freighters and Port cards need to be photocopied onto cardstock and cut out before playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
