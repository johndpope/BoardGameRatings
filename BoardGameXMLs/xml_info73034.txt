							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triune Rolepaying Game Quickstart Rules v.1.1</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set of quickstart rules gives a sufficient overview of the Triune RPG to allow a group to start playing the game immediately. The information is relatively brief to keep the document small and easy to read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this PDF are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Setting Outline that introduces you to the 22nd Century setting of Triune, in which Heaven and Hell are connected universes to ours.&lt;br/&gt;     Character Generation which covers the salient points in generating a player character, and assigned them faiths and prayers. &lt;br/&gt;     Rules explaining how the Effort System works, and the key rules to playing in a game of Triune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notable additional rules sections that are missing (and will be detailed in the main releases for Triune) include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Specific details on various aspects of the Triune setting.&lt;br/&gt;     Handling character progression through experience.&lt;br/&gt;     Common gear that is available to an enforcer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
