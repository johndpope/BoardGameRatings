			<description>From the publishers homepage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honor. Skill. And Exceptionally Sharp Blades&lt;br/&gt; They are legends. They are dangerous. They are feared. They are to be avoided&amp;mdash;unless you have one of them on your side. They are street samurai.&lt;br/&gt; That title covers a variety of skill sets, from the accuracy to nail a target from a thousand meters away to the stealth needed to sneak into a tightly guarded environment and cut someone&amp;rsquo;s throat before they&amp;mdash;or their security&amp;mdash;know you&amp;rsquo;re there. Street samurai know they need to use every tool at their disposal if they want to maintain that all-important edge on their competition. Luckily, some new tools just became available.&lt;br/&gt; The Way of the Samurai is part of the Shadowrun Options line, which provides optional rules players and gamemasters can use to add flavor to their game and their characters. With new gear, new cybersuite packages specifically targeted at street sammies, new Qualities, and character archetypes showing how these tools can be put to use, The Way of the Samurai is a vital tool for street samurai anxious to stay at the top of their game.&lt;br/&gt; The Way of the Samurai is for use with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
