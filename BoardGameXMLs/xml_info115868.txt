							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mansion on Misty Moor</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in Burden&amp;rsquo;s Peak, the PCs are approached by a local cleric of the church of the Raven Queen. He has heard of the PCs exploits, and requests that they lend their courage and abilities as a service to the Raven Queen.&lt;br/&gt;The cleric introduces himself as Beldric, and then tells the PCs a strange story:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six years ago, a man and his wife had reached the pinnacle of wealth. They had a fantastic mansion built to the northwest of Burden&amp;rsquo;s Peak, just outside the safety of the large walls, and proclaimed it their retirement home. All was well for several years, and then local girls started to go missing. These girls were mostly homeless or runaways, so little alarm was raised. By the time people began to take notice, more than a dozen girls had vanished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
