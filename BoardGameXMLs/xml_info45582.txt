			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;TIME LORD A universe of infinite possibilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TIME LORD is the Doctor Who role-playing game, and with TIME LORD anything is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume contains all the information you need to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     understand the rules of the game&lt;br/&gt;     play the role of any of the seven Doctors or any of their twenty-nine companions&lt;br/&gt;     create original settings in which your friends can adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't know Doctor Who?&lt;br/&gt;Part One of TIME LORD contains a brief history of the world's longest-running television science fiction series, and an abridged short story that demonstrates the unique appeal of Doctor Who.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've never heard of role-playing games?&lt;br/&gt;Part Two of TIME LORD introduces you to the concepts behind this fascinating and incresingly popular hobby, and contains a complete mini-adventure for one player that leads you effortlessly through the basic rules of the TIME LORD system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devised by two experts in both the Doctor Who television series and role-playing games, TIME LORD is built round just one basic rule and is therefore one of the easiest of role-playing games to learn. Complete beginners can start playing almost immediately. The open-ended nature of the game system, onthe other hand, and the richness of the Doctor Who heritage allow for the creation of fiendishly complicated and challenging games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the introductory chapters and the rules of the game. TIME LORD contains an encyclopedia of Doctor Who information - details of the Doctors, their companions and opponents, Gallifreyan technology, and the TARDIS - as well as a complete ready-made adventure, advice about creating your own original adventures, and appendices covering advanced topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TIME LORD: complete mastery of space and time&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
