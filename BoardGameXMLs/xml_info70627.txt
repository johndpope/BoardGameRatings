			<description>&amp;quot;Gensō Suikogaiden (幻想水滸外伝) is a two volume series of spin-offs from the Suikoden series of console role-playing games. Suikogaiden Volume 1: Swordsman of Harmonia (幻想水滸外伝Vol.1 ハルモニアの剣士, Gensō Suikogaiden Vol.1 Harumonia no Kenshi?) was released in the autumn of 1999; Volume 2: Duel at Crystal Valley (幻想水滸外伝Vol.2 クリスタルバレーの決闘, Gensō Suikogaiden Vol.2 Kurisutaru Barē no Kettō?) was released in the spring of 2001. Both volumes are visual novels, rather than role-playing games the other Suikodens are known for. The games were only released in Japan and never translated into other languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The events of the game intersect with those of Suikoden II, but are more of a side story, hence the name gaiden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nash Latkje, the protagonist controlled by the player and an agent of Holy Harmonia's Southern Border Defence Force, has been assigned to obtain information to either verify or disprove a rumour concerning the appearance of one of the 27 True Runes in the Jowston City States. During his travels, he encounters Sierra Mikain, a female vampire, who decides to accompany him on his journey. As a result, he soon becomes entangled in the larger conflict involving the events of Suikoden II.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gensō_Suikogaiden,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
