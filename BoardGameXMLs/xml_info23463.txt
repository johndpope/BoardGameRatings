			<description>Each player receives a truck and a barge and can pick their personal port of call from these four cities: London, New York City, Hamburg, or Rotterdam. Barges await at the docks; trucks start in the middle on individual tracks. Dice are rolled moving trucks along track to warehouse, where they will unload their cargo onto the waiting barges. In-between, however, are points of difficulty: Pilot Station, where one must be certain his Captain is aboard the ship by rolling the green faces on the dice; Point of Application, where one must be certain all papers and formalities are in order by rolling until the green faces on the dice appear; and the Rail Road Overpass, where, again, the green must be rolled before continuing on to the waiting barge. The first player to unload three containers may call himself and his port the best and fastest in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
