			<description>POLITICAL ROULETTE is a roll and move board game about winning a General Election in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players represent one of four political parties, with players completing circuits of an outer ring of the board (the Campaign Trail) as directed by the roll of a die, acting in accordance with the squares upon which their playing piece lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to establish a majority in the opinion polls of the fifteen areas shown on the map in the central part of the board.  To gain a majority players need votes.  Votes are obtained or lost in a variety of ways:&lt;br/&gt;-  by throwing the die&lt;br/&gt;-  votes added by holding the TV Charisma Vote&lt;br/&gt;-  a vote subtracted by being in &amp;quot;Bad Press&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;-  votes added or subtracted by the instructions of some of the Policy Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player controls 8 of the 15 regions he may call a General Election, and if he wins it he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
