			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;NOISES IN THE DARK&lt;br/&gt;or Touching Snap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test your Fifth Sense--Touch--in this game of mirth and laughter.  Switch off the lights--'read' by touch the word embossed on the card--then imitate the noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIX SETS OF TWELVE NOISES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Eupax Game -- Copyright by Wm. Sessions Ltd.&lt;br/&gt;The Ebor Press, York&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round a judge is declared. The judge then picks out one noise from the box. He gives an identical copy of the noise to each player. As the lights are out, the players cannot read the card. However, each card has the word written in raised bumps like braille. It is then a race to figure out the word and make that sound. Whomever makes the correct sound first wins the round. Additionally, the judge can pass out 2-3 words. Then the players must make all those sounds to win the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
