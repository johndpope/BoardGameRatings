			<description>This is a space race game consisting of a playing board depicting the flight to the moon, six different coloured plastic space ships, a set of instructions, and a dial with spinner. The first player to reach the moon and then make the return journey to earth is the winner. The game board is marked with a variety of bonuses and hazards that have consequences for the players as their moon probes make the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
