							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Irradiated Player&#039;s Handbook</name>
									
			<description>Irradiated is post-apocalyptic sandbox based, tabletop, roleplaying game. All it takes to play is the guidebook, some paper, and a handful of dice. The game itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t aim to give you a reason to adventure, but rather it gives players all the tools to create their own treasures, obstacles, and reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s older version is available to play for free, by either downloading the guidebook&amp;rsquo;s pdf and printing it out or using a pdf reader. More features and expansions are available to download for patrons, including special traits for races, an entirely new playable race, the newest version of Irradiated, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
