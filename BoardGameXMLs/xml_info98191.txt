			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Konix Speedking was a unique joystick that you held in the palm of one hand and used the other hand to control the stick. The fire button was on the side of the base, which you pressed with the index finger of the hand holding the joystick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was produced by British hardware company Konix in the 1980s and used for home computer systems of the time, such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad and Commodore 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
