			<description>World Series Baseball '95 is a Major League Baseball video game by Sega that allows players to put teams involved in the 1994 Major League Baseball season in either exhibition, regular season, or playoff mode. In addition to this, the player can also create two customized teams with their choice of their favorite players (no luxury taxes unlike the modern baseball games). At the conclusion of the regular season, players are recognized as MVP, Cy Young, Triple Crown, etc based on their regular season statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;World Series Baseball '95&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
