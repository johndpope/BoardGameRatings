			<description>DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Crisis Expansion Pack 4 introduces the keyword &amp;quot;Unity&amp;quot; for ongoing cards that get better as more teammates have them in play. The pack focuses on the Teen Titans and includes six superheroes from the Titans, original members of the group who are now all grown up and have something to prove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another fresh twist to gameplay comes in the form of personal crisis cards, which may directly affect only one character, but can still take down the whole team if players don't work together to solve the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
