			<description>This is a fairly basic biography/trivia game.  Included are 200 photos of celebrities: movie stars, musicians, sports heroes, and political and military figures.  Each card has multiple questions on the back about the pictured person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to identify the person in the picture and then answer questions about that person. The questions asked are determined by a roll of two 6-sided dice. Rewards and penalties are also determined by the number on the dice roll. For example, if the player roles a 7, they answer Question 7 on the card, and receive 10 points if correct PLUS any bonuses indicated next to Question 7. Every time a player fails to answer a question, the opportunity to do so moves to the next player and the value for the correct answer goes up 5 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Quizmaster&amp;quot; role is first determined by a roll of the dice. This person queries each player in turn, and notes their score on the scorecard. Once all players have been quizzed, the Quizzmaster role then rotates clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accompanying 94-page booklet contains additional biographical information about each celebrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
