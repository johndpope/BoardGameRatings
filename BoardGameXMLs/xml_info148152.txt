							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mine Processing Plant</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mine Processing Plant is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, floor plan of a Mine Processing Plant, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You think you can just work us nearly to death in the mines, poison our well to try and finish us off, and get away with it?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is a map of the exterior of a Mine Processing Plant with an accompanying mine rail surrounded by mountains. The Mine Processing Plant is a three-part building with a nearby separate stand-alone tower. Mineral processing or the act of turning mined ores into useful high grade mineral material is done at this plant such as turning iron ore into iron pellets for commercial sale and use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product can be used in any time period after the Industrial Revolution. The techniques used suggest 1900s or later, but it would certainly be possible for this facility to exist in a steampunk or higher tech late 1800s era setting. This map can be used in modern settings or in lower technology worlds in near or far future Sci-Fi settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The local mine company has been dumping its waste improperly to cut costs. They want to get the mine stripped of all resources and get out of town, hopefully before the local communities notice. Unfortunately for them, people start getting sick in the nearby mining apartment town after drinking well water. When some of these people die, the miners pool their resources together to hire a group of investigators (the player characters). The player characters need to sample the well water and figure out what is wrong with it. The well water seems to be poisoned by a high degree of sludge, slime, and other silica. The player characters can get to the waste dump by either figuring out where the water comes from that enters the well (such as pre-mining survey maps of underground rivers in the area) or by tailing a waste dump truck if they think to follow it out to the dumpsite. When they arrive at the waste dump, they see a pool of filth and slime that is barely contained at all by a circular rock wall built around it. It looks like a circular dam that might overflow and burst the next time another waste disposal truck arrives. When they go to confront the mine owners, they find them preparing to collapse the mine and packing their bags. They have also hired some mercenaries to cover their egress from town. These mercenaries are located in the towers and building rooftops as lookouts and snipers (or on the walkway as lookouts as well). It is up to the group to intimidate or persuade the mine owners to do the right thing if possible or use force to bring about justice for the town. A possible complication is that the mercenaries decide to double-cross the mine owners for their remaining money even if they decide to do the right thing&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
