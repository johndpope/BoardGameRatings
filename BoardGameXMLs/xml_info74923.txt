			<description>From the introduction: &lt;br/&gt;After the successful slaying of a vampire lord and his minions, the party and many other heroes from the city are invited to the house of Lord Teron, the city&amp;rsquo;s highest noble, for dinner. The town has been busy for the past week with orders from the great house ranging from food and wine to new tapestries, dinner ware, and exotic fare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A change of pace for the city, especially after the horrors recently faced at the hands of the vampire lord, spirits are high, and the people look upon the invitation and commerce from their lord&amp;rsquo;s house as a positive turn in the health of their community. The party can enjoy a few days of relatively widespread celebrity within the city, as they were major contributors to the defeat and death of the vampires. People buy them drinks wherever they happen to be, and they receive a lot of attention from entrepreneurs, shady or otherwise, who wish to capitalize on their new found celebrity. The party receives their invitation to dine at the lord&amp;rsquo;s table from a messenger, and they are commanded to &amp;quot;dress appropriately&amp;quot;to meet such a dignitary as his lordship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
