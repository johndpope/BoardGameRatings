			<description>This game is basically a vehicle for memorizing Scripture to overcome sin and temptation.  Players use the spinner to move around the board.  After landing on a &amp;quot;Wisdom Card&amp;quot; space, a player has the opportunity to collect 1 to 3 Wisdom cards if he can memorize &amp;quot;Commands of Christ&amp;quot; (Bible verses) printed on the cards.  A Temptation space causes a player to go to one of the 3 pits, where he must memorize a verse for overcoming temptation.  If the verse can't be quoted within the allotted time frame, a Pit card must be drawn and acted upon with negative results such as making the player lose cards already collected.  The player with the most cards collected at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
