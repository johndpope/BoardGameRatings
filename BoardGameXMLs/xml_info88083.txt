			<description>Jihad is a variant kit based on &amp;quot;Belisarius&amp;quot; published on S&amp;amp;T 224.&lt;br/&gt;Original game, &amp;quot;Belisarius&amp;quot; was published in the Decision Games Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #210.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Jihad !&amp;quot; is a wargame simulating the early expansion of Islam in the period of the Caliphs Omar and Othman (634-656 AD) when is 100 years after the parent game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Jihad !&amp;quot; is a two player game. The Caliphate player controls the forces of the Islam. The Kingdom player controls various non-caliphate kingdoms. Each player&amp;rsquo;s forces are represented by military units and Stratagem markers. Players must use a combination of military strength and cunning strategy to maintain and increase their power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are based on the Charlemagne (S&amp;amp;T #189) and Xenophon (S&amp;amp;T #203) games. And this system was later used in Khan (S&amp;amp;T #229).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
