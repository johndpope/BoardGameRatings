							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sorcerer</name>
									
			<description>From the Instruction Manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many centuries ago, the Earth was ruled by Sorcerers and Wizards. They possessed mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.&lt;br/&gt;To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING is done by hitting the Forces of Evil with an energy charge and picking up treasures. Each time you hit a force of evil with your energy charge you get 30 POINTS. When they disappear a treasure will materialize. Touching the treasure gives you 80 POINTS. Successfully moving through the lightning storm will cause a treasure to come out of the sky. Don't forget to pick up each treasure since once you have moved to the next screen you can't go back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DIFFICULTY is determined automatically by your score after you select the Practice, First Level or Second Level of difficulty. In the Practice Level you are able to get into every screen meeting all of the Forces of Evil. In the First Level of difficulty you must achieve higher scores before you gain access to more Forces of Evil and Treasures. When the game begins you have three different screens in which to move. These screens repeat until you reach 1000 points at which time another screen containing more Forces of Evil opens. With each additional 1000 points earned another screen with additional Forces of Evil opens. After 4000 points are earned surprising things start to happen to one of the sets of Forces of Evil. With each additional 1000 points the changes continue making the game harder and harder. Only truly great game players will discover what finally happens to the Forces of Evil before you reach the ultimate score of 9999.&lt;br/&gt;The Second Level of difficulty has the same features as the First Level but all of the Forces of Evil are much more evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
