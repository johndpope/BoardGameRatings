							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">New Jack City</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the fastest growing suburb in the country. You and your opponents are cast as very irresponsible real-estate developers charged with the task of building houses, shops and factories to make quick money before larger interests notice the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Jack City is a city-building game where players place tiles that contain residential, commercial, or industrial properties. Players must place tiles by matching the roads and construct them using workers known as builders. Builders start counting down when the property is connected to the electric grid. Constructing large properties offers bonuses which allow you to outpace all other players. To win a player must earn more money than all other players by constructing buildings before the city's&amp;rsquo; electricity grid becomes maxed out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
