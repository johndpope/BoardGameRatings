			<description>&amp;ldquo;Mad Max style post-apocalyptic gang-warfare road combat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a random assortment of six vehicles, each of which has a random piece of equipment (mostly weaponry of some sort) which can be used a random number of times as determined by the roll of a six-sided die. The road is a track 100 spaces long with randomly distributed obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is designated as the Slow Gang, the other player is designated as the Fast Gang. The Slow Gang vehicles start at one end of the track and must try to reach the other end. The Fast Gang player may place his vehicles on any space on the track. The Slow Gang player wins by getting at least three vehicles to the opposite end of the track, otherwise the Fast Gang player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
