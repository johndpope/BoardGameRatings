			<description>Dark Galaxies is a tactical dexterity game of spaceship combat. Players maneuver their ships and fire lasers and drone missiles by flicking discs across the play surface. Unlike many other flicking games, Dark Galaxies emphasizes the importance of ship orientation; how you position your ships will determine which weapons you fire, where you take damage, and what your movement potential is going forward. It takes only minutes to learn but offers a deep combat experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Galaxies is currently in prototype and is slated for publication in 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
