							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kampen om Rai</name>
									
			<description>This game is included in a series of books called &amp;quot;Drageherren&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;The Dragon master&amp;quot;, an easy-to-read fantasy series by Josefine Ottesen). The basic game comes with the first book in the series and the rest of the books will have small expansions to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game plays a little like the old Titan boardgame, with each player having secret armies on the map. Each player got one treasure hidden in one of his armies, and the goal is to get both of them to Rai (the capital in the middle of the board) and keep them there for 3 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two players will try to get his armies into the most favorable terrain which is different for each unit. Each army got one leader and two units (hidden at the start of the game) and the combat is simple dice rolling. The board is made in the same way as in Settlers of Catan, and  uses hexes with various terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kampen om Rai&amp;quot; was published as a &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; set in book 1. Followed by 10 sequels with 10 expansions total.&lt;br/&gt;Some expansions inlcude more players, more cards and the &amp;quot;veteran unit&amp;quot; extra cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book 8 opens for sea battles and sea monsters&lt;br/&gt;Book 9 and 10 contributes with a boardgame map (poster-like)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
