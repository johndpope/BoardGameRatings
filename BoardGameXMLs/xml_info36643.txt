			<description>Initially created as a joke for my girlfriend's birthday, this trivia game is real fun to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in teams of two players each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One team is selected to start playing and then the game is played clock-wise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a team&amp;rsquo;s turn, a dice is rolled and the counter representing the team is moved half of the dice result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then a card is drawn and the team has to answer a question about my girlfriend (may be adapt to any person you want prior to play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the team answers correctly to the question, it may advance again its counter based on the result of a new dice roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The better you know the person, the quicker you will advance in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team that finishes first after three complete board turns is the winner of the game, and receives a &amp;quot;Very Best Friend Diploma&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some special cards will add unexpected events as they are drawn :-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
