							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Six Guns and Zombies</name>
									
			<description>Six Guns and Zombies is board game that has been in the works for two years. Each player begins the game controlling a cowboy that is pre-generated. The cowboys start the game in the end of a canyon near their home town just after being caught in a flash flood on their way back from a cattle drive. Throughout the canyon they see materials scattered all over and someone remembers the payroll was on the chuck-wagon and probably in one of those piles of rubble. Suddenly the players begin to eye each other suspiciously as each decides they want all the gold for themselves. To make matters worse some of the other members of the cattle drive, the ones that didn't survive are getting up and moving towards the cowboys with a hungry look in their eyes. Most of the cowboys are armed with a six gun, but these zombies are endless and their ammo isn't. Now the cowboys must work together against the army of undead in order to survive, but in the back of each cowboy's mind is the payroll, and the chance that one of their fellow cowboys will turn on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the game is to escape the canyon alive. However if multiple players escape the canyon then the player with the most gold is declared the winner. For a single player game the player must search all twenty boxes and escape the canyon alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages: 8+ &lt;br/&gt;Games will last approximately a half hour to an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
