			<description>Cyberbots: Fullmetal Madness, sometimes known simply in Japan as Cyberbots (サイバーボッツ), is a fighting game produced by Capcom in 1994 where the pilots of mecha battle each other. The mecha, officially known as &amp;quot;Variant Armors&amp;quot;, in this game are the same ones featured in the fighting action game Armored Warriors. It was ported to the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation. The game only saw limited distribution in arcades outside of Japan, and none of the console ports were released overseas. Tech Romancer (produced by Capcom and ported to the Dreamcast) is considered a spiritual sequel for this game, Jin and BX-02 Blodia are present in the game as an unlockable bonus character/mecha.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game the player first chooses the pilot and then the mech (Valiant/Variant Armor or VA for short) they'll use to fight. The mechs determine the gameplay of the game, but the pilot is what determines the storyline the player will see. Near the end of the 21st century Earth begins to become over populated leading to many people living in man made space colonies. The primary army of Earth, &amp;quot;Earth Force&amp;quot;, has been conducting experiments and their work, along with the actions of the playable characters will determine the future of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise in Cyberbots is similar to its predecessor Armored Warriors, albeit it features only a maximum of two playable characters on screen as opposed to three. Cyberbots is a very innovative game, attributed to its amount of selectable options, parts, and mecha that permit the player to format their play style to their preference. Similar to the Armored Core series, different legs (which affect movement abilities), arms (which affect reach and melee capabilities) and weapons can be mixed and matched between the selectable robots available to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in Cyberbots is similar to other Capcom-created fighting games, with a medium-sized command list of executing various attacks available to each individual robot. Battles are a duel-formatted affair with players and the computer fighting against one another to proceed to the next battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cyberbots&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
