							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mind&#039;s Eye Theatre: Laws of the Resurrection</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WE ARE THE IMMORTAL. WE ARE THE UNDYING.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the world was in balance between the material and the spirit. Then Set's jealousy threw all into chaos with the murder of Osiris. Osiris returned to the world, and by his return, he brought with him the secret of immortality. Now his children, blessed by his secret, stand against the chaos and corruption that Set and Apophis have wrought on the world. The Shadowlands writhe in the grip of unnatural storms, abd the land of the living shudders under the burden of unbalance - the time to act is now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SONS OF OSIRIS, DAUGHTERS OF ISIS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laws of the Resurrection covers all the material that players and storytellers need to create, play and storytell the Amenti, one of the mystical immortal mummies of Egypt. Within lie secrets as old as the pyramids, from the mystical paths of magic to the roads of the Underworld. Behold a world of spirits and gods, as old and secret as the sands of Egypt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
