			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Time to Kill: Factions Combat Compendium is a supplement for the Factions role-playing game. Combat is a brutal, uncaring animal. This beast cannot be controlled, but with a lot of training and a little luck, you can make sure your enemies are the ones it tears to pieces - and you get to walk away from the battlefield on your own two feet. A Time to Kill is a faster simpler Combat System designed to bring this brutality home to your Factions campaign.&lt;br/&gt;A Time to Kill features a hybrid of the Phased and Non-Phased Combat Systems, and takes you step-by-step through the easy conversion process. In addition to collecting all of the previously published weapons and armor into a single volume, A Time to Kill introduces an impressive amount of new material, including...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    New Simplified Armor Rules&lt;br/&gt;    Non-Lethal Damage for Chemical Irritant, Concussion, and Stun Weapons&lt;br/&gt;    New Round Declarations, such as Full Sprint, Group Defense, and Held Action&lt;br/&gt;    New Combat Maneuvers, including Beat-Attack, Charge, Choke, Counterattack, Disarm, Feint, and Knock Out&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for Dodging Ranged Attacks, including Firearms&lt;br/&gt;    Simplified Spray Attack for Fully Automatic Weapons&lt;br/&gt;    Throwing Weapon Rules&lt;br/&gt;    Hand to Hand Weapon Balancing Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;    New Medical Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
