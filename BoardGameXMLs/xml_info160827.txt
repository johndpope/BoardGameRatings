			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever created an amazing place for your campaign only to discover that you don't immediately have a collection of NPCs to fill it? Or have your PCs ever stumbled into a place you haven't had time to fully develop as a living, breathing part of the campaign?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, why not take out a handful of dice and roll up an instant NPC! Or in this case, an &amp;quot;Insta-NPC&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Insta-NPCs product line is designed to offer one or more tables to roll on to figure out a little something about the NPC you're pulling together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say I need an innkeeper for the place the PCs will be staying and want some idea of how that individual behaves. I can flip a coin (heads = male, tails = female), roll a few dice and end up with Male, Fear (Motivation), Derisive (Attitude), and Exhausted (Appearance)... That might lead to a description such as &amp;quot;The innkeeper greets you at the door with a warm, disingenuous smile. He&amp;rsquo;s  exhausted from the previous night&amp;rsquo;s revelry and more than willing to rent you some rooms, but his contempt for you is barely concealed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue, you get three tables - Motivation (20 items), Attitude (20 items), and Appearance (100 items), plus four sample characters you can use right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
