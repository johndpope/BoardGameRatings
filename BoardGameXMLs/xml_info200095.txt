			<description>Peace was once kept between the races by the Order of the Paladins in the service to the King. That was until the chief paladin gave-in to corruption. After summoning Undead armies he destroyed the kingdom. Since the fall of the central government the races of the land have scattered and formed themselves into various factions. The factions trust none but their own and seek to prevent another from ruling over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Races of War&amp;quot; each player controls a faction and tries to defeat their opponent's faction, thus ensuring their survival for another day. Each faction has a unique array of creatures with varying abilities, spells and attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns advancing creatures across the board. The pieces all look the same from the back, but have identifying numbers on the front. The identity of the pieces is only revealed when they are involved in an attack or use other abilities or spells. Be the first to locate and capture your opponent's commander and the rest will surrender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
