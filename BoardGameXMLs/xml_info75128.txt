			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is a steampunk Victorian era England. A time traveller on a reconnaissance mission from the distant future became stranded in England of the late 1800s, and his technology came into the hands of the Royal Society led by Baron Fortesque (based upon Charles Babbage), a grand inventor. Fortesque then retro engineered many of the futuristic contraptions, creating an entirely different, alternate timeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos Engine is a top-down run and gun computer game developed by the Bitmap Brothers and published by Renegade Software in 1993. It was first released for the Commodore Amiga, with an enhanced version available for AGA Amigas, and later ported to MS-DOS, and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Atari ST, Amiga CD32, RISC OS and Sega Mega Drive platforms. USA releases of SNES and Sega versions were retitled Soldiers of Fortune, and the character The Preacher had his clerical collar removed and was renamed The Scientist. A sequel to the game, The Chaos Engine 2, was released in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometime during the last century, an experimenter with time, space and early computers created a bizarre machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inventor was Baron Fortesque. The machine was...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos Engine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although primitive, the machine became incredibly powerful and went crazy, turning ordinary humans and household pets into razor toothed, armour-plated killing machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter six hard nailed mercenaries for hire. The Thug, Preacher, Mercenary, Gentleman, Navvie and Brigand. These ball breakers are armed to the teeth with over 25 weapons and a host of special, destructive devices peculiar to their class. Select two characters to form your party and enter the World of Chaos. The sprawling adventure covers four graphics [sic] worlds and 16 levels loaded with fiendish traps, puzzles and secret passages. Get your hands on sawn-off shotguns, molotov cocktails and a huge amount of armament and buy, blag or blast your way through hordes of different monsters to do battle with the ultimate killing machine, THE CHAOS ENGINE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
