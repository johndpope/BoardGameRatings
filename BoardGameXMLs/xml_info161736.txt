							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zedkiel&#039;s Chapel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two brave adventurers rescued Zedkiel the scholar on his way home from the tavern. A large bat-like creature had attacked the man and certainly would have slain him had Ulad and Frango not intervened. A month later reports of another large bat-like creature surfaced as several townsfolk were killed one night under a full moon. Ulad and Frango grew suspicious and discovered something horrid had happened to Zedkiel. The man eluded them until the pair of adventurers discovered the strange abandoned chapel Zedkiel was using as a hideout. The characters have a choice to make - seek out and destroy Zedkiel or aid him against the vigilante townsfolk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pocket-Sized Encounter compatible with the Swords &amp;amp; Wizardry rules system for 2nd to 4th level character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pocket-Sized Encounters from Iron Tavern Press are shorter scenarios designed to be dropped into an existing campaign with minimal preparation.
