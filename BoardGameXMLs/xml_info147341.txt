							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterama!</name>
									
			<description>In Slaughterama, you are a vigilante hero who sets out to rid the land of evil, while also acting as clerk of your very own medieval store called a Bazaar. Traverse a unique board made up of tiles and fight a variety of demented foes. Once defeated, rob them of their treasures and use them to buy weapons and magic at opponent&amp;rsquo;s shops. There are also traps to avoid, the risk of becoming a zombie, snipers to watch out for, &amp;amp; magic portals that open up as the game progresses. This is a multi-player game, in fact, the more people playing...the more insane it becomes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slaughterama is a new, innovative table top game that is easy to learn yet quite challenging to win. There&amp;rsquo;s a good balance between luck and strategy, and the gameplay is fun NOT frustrating. With a variety of game mechanics at work, Slaughterama offers an engaging experience that is unlike anything else on the market today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amount of Players: 4 players (more by adding future deckpacks)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Kill all 10 of the monsters in your deck before your opponents kill the ones in theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting: A &amp;ldquo;medievalish&amp;rdquo; alternate universe where anarchy &amp;amp; chaos go for breakfast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duration: Customizable.  A normal 4 player game on average takes about 90 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mechanics: Dice rolling, pawn moving, simple RPG fighting system, card playing, buying/selling goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
