			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the 21st century is indeed the Information Age, the Data Savant is an individual perfectly adapted to suit the era. Indeed, some neurobiologists and cognitive psychologists believe the abilities demonstrated by the Data Savant is evidence that the human brain is capable of evolving far more rapidly than ever thought possible to deal with an environment overloaded with information-rich stimuli. Others argue that there have always been those rare human beings possessed of extraordinary mental gifts, able to mentally manipulate data as easily as children rearrange toy blocks. These researchers argue that it is only in recent decades that those who display such genius have been properly categorized and recorded. Whichever hypothesis is correct, the Data Savant displays some truly amazing abilities, making his service much in demand. This six page PDF is an easy-to-integrate PC class and just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world and gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
