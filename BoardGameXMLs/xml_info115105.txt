			<description>From the Designers:&lt;br/&gt;You are twisted.  I can&amp;rsquo;t believe you actually want to put these adorable kittens in a blender! I guess that&amp;rsquo;s none of my business. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re more of a dog person. Sure, kittens are curious by nature, but when they get in a kitchen full of dangerous appliances, it is up to you to save them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fast-paced card game has players working to save all of their own kittens before the unthinkable happens. But sometimes the only way to save your precious litter of kittens is to let those curious little cats learn the lesson of why you should never play in a Blender!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the box: A portion of the proceeds will be donated to a no kill cat shelter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;Save your kittens and send your opponents' kittens to The Blender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup &amp;amp; Play:&lt;br/&gt;Put the game box top on the table, open-side up and place the oversized Blender card inside, face-up: that's The Blender. Place the oversized Box card face up in the base of the box: that's The Box. Leave a little space between The Blender and The Box: that's The Counter.  Assign each player a Kitten color (red, green, blue or yellow), shuffle the deck, deal each player 6 cards and it's time to start saving adventurous kittens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, players play two cards and then draw back up to 6. Kitten cards may be played into The Blender, The Counter or The Box.  All other cards are played face up in front of the player so that all players can see which cards have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can play Kitties on the Move to move kittens to or from The Blender, The Counter or The Box; the number on the card specifies the number of kittens that can each be moved 1 space. Playing a Blend card will destroy the kittens currently in The Blender, save the kittens in The Box, and move the kittens on The Counter into The Blender unless countered by another player's Blend &amp;quot;Pulse&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can move kittens around with other cards as well. Kittens in the Blender moves all of the kittens on The Counter or in The Box to The Blender. With These Cats in the Blender a player can move all cats of a chosen color from The Counter and The Box to The Blender. Kittens in the Box moves all kittens in The Blender or on The Counter to The Box, while Cats on the Counter moves all the kittens in The Blender or The Box to The Counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total chaos reigns when the Dog's in the Kitchen as each player gives her hand to the player in the direction indicated on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all 16 of the Blend cards have been played. Saved kittens are worth 2 points each, blended kitties cost 1 point each. Highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 1 oversized Blender card, 1 oversized Box card, 110 playing cards (64 Kittens: 16 in each of 4 colors - red, green, blue and yellow; 18 Kitties on the Move: 6 of each number; 16 Blends: 8 Regular Blend &amp;amp; 8 Blend Black; 4 Dogs in the Kitchen: 2 left &amp;amp; 2 right; 2 Kittens in the Blender; 2 Your Cats in the Blender; 2 Cats on the Counter; 2 Kittens in the Box), rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
