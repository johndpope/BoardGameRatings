			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Castle Triskelion is a &amp;quot;mega dungeon&amp;quot;, a sprawling multi-level complex which an entire campaign can be based around. This Introduction explains the basics of what this is and what the area looks like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The castle may be placed in any adventure setting and modified as each dungeon master sees fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publication of the Castle Triskelion is an on-going, multi-document process that is likely to go on for years of real time. Each level, above and below ground, will be fleshed out, and each level will be a separate publication. As time goes on some sections may be &amp;quot;re-stocked&amp;quot;, that is to say, a new set of encounters and items for that level may be published, which will address the idea that adventurers may clear the monsters from a section, leave, and when they come back something else has moved into that space. This provides versatility and flexibility to the DM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, new monsters and items will appear, and additional &amp;quot;new material&amp;quot; documents will be published, containing that new material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introduction of each new section of the megadungeon will include a list of the publications required to run that section. Note that all Triskelion documents are free publications, and will continue to be free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
