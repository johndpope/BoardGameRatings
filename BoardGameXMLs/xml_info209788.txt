							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Plant Corruption</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn Your Enemies To Mulch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corruptions, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Horror Adventures, give players a new way to indulge their dark fantasies and take the role of gothic monsters, infecting themselves with some taint or darkness, and presenting the tantalizing question of whether to struggle against the corruption, or embrace it, and allow themselves to bask, however briefly, in its dark power. While Horror Adventures presents 11 different corruptions to choose from, there are many more potential sources of corruption that could potentially be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents the plant corruption, a brand new corruption featuring unique progression rules, and 10 new manifestations that are flavorfully connected to plants and fungi. Further, the book introduces the black spore plant template, which can be applied to any plant and gives it, in addition to other abilities, the power to infect victims with spores that deliver the plant corruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
