			<description>Kalevite Maa (&amp;quot;Land of Kalevs&amp;quot; in translation) is not sophisticated game yet it provides entertainment for parents and children alike. The object of the game is to be the first player to collect three items depicted on a secret quest card. The items - tokens with a picture of an item - are randomly distributed on the game board face down. Players take turns by moving their pawns on the board by one step. If the move ends on an unexplored token the player will claim the token unless the token is a monster in which case the monster has to be defeated first by rolling dice. Some items - sweets, to be precise - boost a player's speed or combat ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kalevite Maa is a promotional boardgame. It is published by a sweets producer - &amp;quot;AS KALEV&amp;quot; - and 3/4 of the relatively large boardgame box is actually filled with sweets. Yet, it is an interesting and engaging game with components of outstanding quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
