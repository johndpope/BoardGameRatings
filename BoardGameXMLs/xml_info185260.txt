			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strange imagining of post-WW1 planes with an amine feel.  You play one of three characters with specific shooting patterns to their WW1 planes against a confusing array of other WW1 planes,  WW2 planes (and tanks), and stuff that looks like alien spacecraft, all shooting blue and pink weapons that slowly move across the screen towards you.   The animation and action are similar to other shoot 'em ups from this era, like Crimzon Clover, but this game has a button to convert all enemy bombs into coins.   There are 5 levels (and bosses), although the game difficulty changes depending on how many coins you have greedily (貪欲 Don-Yoku) taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
