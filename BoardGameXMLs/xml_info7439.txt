							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Samsonite Basketball Game</name>
									
			<description>Samsonite - yes, the luggage company - published a series of sports games in the late 1960's.  Each game comes in a very large box (approximately 15&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;) and features card play on a board resembling the sports field or court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Samsonite Basketball, players play cards attempting to move the basketball down the court and make a shot.  Each card features a different result based on what the player is attempting to do: for instance, &amp;quot;Shot from key ... 2 points and defensive foul&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Shot from inside: offensive rebound&amp;quot;; etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
