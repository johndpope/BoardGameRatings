							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crown of Arthain</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A suspense-filled 20 level quest for one or two players with battle action at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your brother have been long gone from your father Arthain's mountain kingdom. So you have forgotten the many caves and passageways in which Arthain's magical crown could lie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the dying king has summoned you and your brother to come and search for the crown. To the finder goes the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But between you and the fabled crown stand formidable obstacles. Evil elves whom you must trick into helping you. Pernicious trolls who sabotage you at every turn. Monsters who could destroy you. The forbidding terrain of the mountain kingdom. And, of course, your very own brother, who is rotten enough to do anything he must to foil you and claim the crown for himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to search for clues. Battle dragons. And summon all the daring, strategy and knightly resources of your royal bloodline. Who said it's easy to become a king?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
