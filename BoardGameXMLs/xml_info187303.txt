			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quasar is played with one GM (Game Master) and one or more players, each of whom has a PC (Player Character) through which he acts during the game.  The play takes place via the imagination, where the GM is responsible for setting up the atmosphere and resolving issues that come up during play.  Typically, a gaming session (or a series of sessions) are run by the GM under the guidance of a scenario.  The scenario is basically a story, of which only parts are made known to the players.  Additional information usually becomes available during the course of play.  The GM uses the scenario to set up the atmosphere, provide an adventuring hook, and determine what the characters see during play.  An adventuring hook is simply the means by which the characters are drawn into the scenario.  It could be as simple as someone hiring them for something, or as subtle as something happening around them, wherever they are.  The scenario defines locations, objects in those locations, creatures that occupy or pass through those locations, and NPC (non-player characters) which the players interact with.  It is the GM's job to adjust the reactions of the various creatures and NPCs depending upon the actions (or lack thereof) of the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DOC, RTF, and HTML versions have identical content and vary only in minor formatting issues and file format.
