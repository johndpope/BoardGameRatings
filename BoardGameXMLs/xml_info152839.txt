			<description>This is a party game that combines Charades and Chinese whispers, with every player involved in every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains a playing board, rule sheet, approximately 4,000 mimes, 6 playing pieces, 5 dice and an egg-timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, they role four of the dice to select a mime from the lists provided by putting the four numbers on the dice together.  Each number on the list has a choice of three categories - nouns, verbs and media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a mime is selected, they then select any other player to take out of the room and mime it to them (within a set time limit) using the normal rules of Charades.  No speaking is allowed, so players have to hope their mime is good enough for the other person to get it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After doing the mime, the first player comes in and selects the next player to go out.  The person who received the mime the first time now has to mime it to the new player...and so on until all players have been outside.  The last player then comes back in and announces what they think is the answer.  Points are then scored and players move around the board until one reaches the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
