			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fate Codex is a mostly-monthly e-zine featuring Quick Start Adventures and more for the Fate roleplaying system. The project, funded through Patreon, grows and swells as more patrons support our work. We've been lucky to have lots of folks pledge, and we're now entering our third year of production!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our backers have enabled us to not only hire great authors, but also to include great art in every issue. Issue 5 of Volume 3 features Alex Innocenti, Mike Mumah, Manuela Soriani, and Juan Ochoa! There's some great work in this piece and over 10,000 words of awesome Fate content, ready to be thrown into your next game of Fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we're bringing this content to you on DriveThruRPG, so you can find and download your issues easily. Since every title is saved to your library on the site, you'll always have The Fate Codex right at hand when you need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this fifth issue of Volume 3, we've got:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new building block from Don Bisdorf, A Plague of Pulps, in which mysterious documents hide precious arcane secrets.&lt;br/&gt;    A systems piece from Brendan Conway, Escalation Dice, that shows you how to introduce a new dice mechanic as a major cost&lt;br/&gt;    An essay from Felipe Real on adding Improvisational Mysteries to Fate that will keep your players guessing&lt;br/&gt;    A new Quick Start from Andr&amp;eacute; La Roche, Innocence Lost, in which disappearing children herald a deepening urban fantasy mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Huge thanks to our great production team--Sally Christensen, Brendan Conway, Justin Rogers, Amanda Valentine, Shelley Harlan, Tara Zuber, and Thomas Deeny--for keeping us on task for this issue and pushing this thing forward. We hope you enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
