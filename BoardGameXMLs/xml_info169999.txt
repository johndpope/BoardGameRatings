							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The 2015 Election</name>
									
			<description>A light political game involving vote placement and based on &amp;quot;The 2010 Election&amp;quot; but aiming to cover the May 2015 election. It attempts to model the movement into four party politics and the rise of the SNP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two players (Labour and Conservatives) place population markers derived from opinion polls (run by Press Cards) in 32 representative Constituencies. The Constituencies are grouped by type (rural, industrial, suburban) and by the three home nations (England, Scotland and Wales - Northern Ireland is dealt with separately). Other parties are placed according to rules that mimic their strengths and weaknesses by random draw from the Scrabble bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each phase of the game different placing rules apply as you move from placing your hardcore supporters (who tend to be in safe areas) up into the floating voters (who can be anywhere) on Election Night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last we abandon further fiddling and offer (for a mere sum of &amp;pound;5 via paypal; to charles.vasey@gmail.com) the next in the series from the 2010 Election. This time we are trying it in advance of the actual event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game kit (for it is a mere primitive PNP) is a number of pdfs and spreadies giving you the map of UK represented as blocks of constituencies, the counters, and the press cards. It is pretty much an experience game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be an update after the actual Election.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdfs should resize for Letter printing, but if not I'll save in Letter and then copy over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
