			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hexlinx is an intriguing game of geometric strategy in which players start each turn with 6 tiles, then score points by trading, switching, and connecting  them to build a honeycomb grid of interlocked rings.  Each ring must include 6 different color tiles.  When all the tiles have been drawn and no player can form any more rings, the game is over.  Highest score wins. &lt;br/&gt; Uniquely simple yet challenging, this exciting game of logic requires strategic planning (and a little luck) to win.  For a variety of gameplay, some optional Rules can be used -- and because there are 2 methods of scoring points (standard and advanced), Hexlinx is FUN for children and adults of all skill levels !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
