							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">East Europe Sourcebook</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information is vital to any military campaign.  Without it, armies blindly wander without real objectives, blundering into the enemy by chance, with no opportunity for advance planning or preparation.  The East Europe Sourcebook for Twilight: 2000 gives you the information you need to know about the central theater of the Twilight War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eastern Europe was, without a doubt, the &amp;quot;center stage&amp;quot; of the Twilight War.  It was in Eastern Europe that the armies of every major belligerent met; it was in Eastern Europe that the war lasted the longest; and it was in Eastern Europe where the devastation of war was the greatest.  The East Europe Sourcebook provides a chapter on each of the nations of the region, giving a short summary of the nation's history, geography, and ethnic make-up.  The state of each nation as of the year 2000 is described, and its military forces plotted on an individual situation map.  Nations covered include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, and the splintered remains of the former nation of Yugoslavia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 30 military vehicles are detailed, illustrated, and described in game terms, including the major vehicles used by the nations of the region, all fully updated to Twilight: 2000, version 2.2.  The vehicle pages concentrate on the non-Russian members of the Warsaw Pact, covering Romanian, Yugoslavian, Czech, Hungarian, and Polish military vehicles ranging from the Hungarian FUG scout car to the Romanian TR-85 main battle tank.  If that weren't enough, the East Europe Sourcebook also includes a detailed full-color map of Eastern Europe, and two short adventures set in the region: The 8-Ball Division and Czech Mate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
