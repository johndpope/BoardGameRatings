							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Munsters Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Munsters Card Game is a game based on the popular 1960's tv series The Munsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a four player game, players are dealt 10 cards. Each player then puts one card face down on a yellow space found on the game sheet. On their turn, players put one of their two markers on a small number space (1 to 7) or on a Bonus picture space (All 0's, All 1's or All 2's). Once each player has placed one marker, the process is repeated so players can place their second marker on an unoccupied space. Cards are then turned face up and the total value of the four cards is added up. If there is a marker on the winning number, its owner wins the round and picks up the four cards which he places face down in front of him. When all four cards are the same, this is a Munster combination. If a marker is placed on this combination, its owner collects the four cards and a 10 points bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scores are added once all cards have been used. One point is scored for each face down card in front of the player and 10 points are scored for each Munster combination. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
