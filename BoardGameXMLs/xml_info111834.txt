			<description>From the application's &amp;quot;About&amp;quot; file&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a classic hex and counter game converted for Android.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a map of North Africa divided into hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hex can be controled by one of two players: One player represents the Italian (and later the German) forces, while the other represents the British Empire forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a number of combat formations (units) which they may move around the map in an attempt to win the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units have a name designation at the top, a symbol representing the unit type in the middle, a combat strength in the lower left and a movement rate in the lower right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory can be achieved by capturing more objectives than the enemy - a major victory if you capture them all: Objectives depend on the scenario, Allied objectives are shown by green circles, Axis by yellow, while a joint objective is both colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Full version has eight scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Italian invasion 1940.&lt;br/&gt;2. Rommel arrives 1941 and storms across the desert, but cannot take Tobruk.&lt;br/&gt;3. Operation Crusader - Rommel is defeated and Tobruk relieved.&lt;br/&gt;4. Gazala - Rommel's masterpiece.&lt;br/&gt;5. Mersa Matruh - The pursuit of the 8th Army into Egypt.&lt;br/&gt;6. First Alamein - Auchinlek halts Rommel.&lt;br/&gt;7. Alam Halfa - A desperate last throw of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;8. Second Alamein - Montgomery annihilates Rommel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All games can be played 2 player or as either side against the computer/phone/tablet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The demo version has 1. and 3. above and is free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
