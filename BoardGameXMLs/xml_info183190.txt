			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automatic RPG is the RPG where you can let your Heroes do their own thing. Why? Well, because in this game, Heroes level up and earn EXP all by themselves! All you have to do is spurn them along from time to time and watch them grow into full-fledged Heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Story Outline -&lt;br/&gt;Chronic depression, unstable government and extreme weather.&lt;br/&gt;Rising prices and unemployment. You even ruined the morning&amp;rsquo;s sunny-side up, and got turned down by the girl you like. All of this the evil doings of the Demon King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King, realizing the Demon King&amp;rsquo;s evil handiwork, ordered the &lt;br/&gt;legendary Hero to defeat him once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Points:&lt;br/&gt;● No need to constantly guide your party. Just watch as they fight all by themselves.&lt;br/&gt;● You&amp;rsquo;ll get EXP even when not playing the game, so your team will get much stronger just by playing a little each day!&lt;br/&gt;● Gameplay hotter than you&amp;rsquo;d expect with over 70 different items!&lt;br/&gt;● A lukewarm story of a Hero and his allies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automatic RPG is a time-killing, clicker-style game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is completely free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
