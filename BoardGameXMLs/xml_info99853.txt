			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblin Friend is a mini-adventure designed for four 4th-level heroes, but may easily be scaled for lower or higher levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It rarely snows in east Texas, and when it does the snow quickly melts shortly after sunrise. However ice storms are much more common, and when such a storm strikes, it generally shuts down all city services, roads, and power lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This winter, just outside of Pinebox, several experiments have escaped from a top secret military lab located in an underground base in north-eastern Golan County, Texas. Taking advantage of the ice storm, one of these unfortunate creatures has evaded pursuit by military and other forces. Unfortunately for the heroes, they are the first to encounter the creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
