			<description>Key Whiz is a family oriented board/card game for 2 to 4 players. Each player has a game board, game pieces, and are dealt 4 to 6 cards depending on the number of players. Players take alternate turns moving one piece at a time from the start square and along the board with the ultimate goal of being the first to reach the payoff with all game pieces. Along the way are doors that must be passed thru using keys (card combinations such as a single card, pair, 3 of a kind, or 4 of a kind). There is a fair amount of strategy involved, and often times movements can be planned well in advance. Two of the major features are WHIZ CARDS (count as double) and BONUS PLAYS (additional moves) created by passing through a door. The two-player version is excellent for tournament play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
