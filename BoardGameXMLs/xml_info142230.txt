			<description>&amp;quot;Get the Cheese!&amp;quot; is probably the cheesiest card game you ever put your hands on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a non-collectible, non-customizable easy-to-pick up yet quite strategic and fun card game for 2 - 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose one out of four unique, whacky Characters, each of them coming with a 30 card deck filled with helpful, equally whacky and way cheesy &amp;ldquo;Pals&amp;rdquo;, strange &amp;ldquo;Stuff&amp;rdquo; and dastardly &amp;ldquo;Deeds&amp;rdquo; and go on the hunt for the Cheese! Play your Pals, Stuff and Deeds wisely and attack your opponents in order to be the first player to get a hold of 20 Cheese or win by owning the &amp;ldquo;Master Cheese&amp;rdquo; when the first deck is depleted. Every card can be played alternately for its &amp;ldquo;Master Cheese Effect&amp;rdquo; so there are plenty of ways to mess with the Master Cheese. Get it, free it, hide it, protect it, sell it or even steal it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each cheesy Character has its own special abilities, strengths and weaknesses and offers different strategies on the road to victory. Which one will you choose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Will it be the Jurassic Overlord Zombiesaurus Rex with his flaming rage and hordes of Zombie Dino Minons?&lt;br/&gt;    Will you choose the shifty Galaktor, the Alien Megabrain from Dimension Dork, who likes to mess with the other players&amp;rsquo; cards, hands and minds?&lt;br/&gt;    Will Pun-Pun, the Nuclear Powered Panda Pirate be your choice, who commands a chessy crew of beastly pirates and loves to get some cheesy bootie?&lt;br/&gt;    Or will you fight as General Turtozoid, the Heavy Armed Tank Turtle, with his army of aquatic critters whose orders are to free, get and protect the Master Cheese?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out by getting one to three friends aboard and start fighting the cheesiest card fights you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. Can you take the cheesiness??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
