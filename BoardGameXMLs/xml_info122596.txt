			<description>Object of the game is to earn maximum points by getting rid of his letters. To do this, form new words from words already installed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a number of letters: 12 letters each with 2 players, nine letters of 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;Based on number of players, each laying one or two 3-letter words on the board. These are the starting points they placed horizontally: 2 bases each with 2 players and one each in base 3 and 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player must add one of his letters to one of the words posed by changing it to form a new word and the player gets the points corresponding to the number of letters in the word and receives these points in chips.&lt;br/&gt;- If the player can't reconstruct any word, it can exchange a letter from his game with a letter from the deck. In this case, it passes.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player places his last letter.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points in chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some more game-variants included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
