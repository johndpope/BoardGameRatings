			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this scenario you are all privileged geniuses who share an apartment in Pasadena (Los Angeles) and common interests, like superhero comics, science fiction series and video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you are renowned scientists, and are able to calculate the probability of the existence of parallel universes, you have no idea how to relate to the world, and especially with girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arrival of Penny, a neighbor that has moved into the apartment across the hall from you, has changed your peaceful and quiet life. Soon, your sentimental and obsessive-compulsive disorders, surface. Every time you see her, you show that you are unable to issue a single coherent or articulated sound and in her presence. It is your crush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
