			<description>This is a card driven horse racing game.  The majority of the included cards have one of the horse's number. First, the cards are shuffled and a number of them are dealt to the &amp;quot;Odds&amp;quot; area of the board and are used with a set of dials to determine the odds for each horse. The players then place their bets. Then the cards are dealt to the race part of the board that has very nice pictures of happy looking horses ready to run.  The first horse to have 5 of its cards dealt from the deck for a 5 furlong race is the winner. The horses need one card per furlong to win a race.  Cards can be added to the deck that cause horses to run slow for a race, thus requiring an addition card.  Cards can be added to the deck that represent a horse not clearing a hedge row in a steeple chase race. There is an alternate way of running a race included.  Running times for each horse are assigned via a chart that uses the quantity of the horse's cards that are turned up to determine that running time.  In this race the lowest time is the winner.  Each game consists of a set of three races and during the set one player represent the Racing Committee or &amp;quot;The House&amp;quot;.  Under certain circumstances this player receives the purse and in others he must add to the purse from his own money.  The similarities between Pace and And They're Off leads one to believe that Pace was used as the bases for &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3112/and-theyre-off&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3112/and-theyre-off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
