			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes, villains, legends &amp;hellip; the folklore of America features all of this and more. In this volume you can find pirates and soldiers, lumberjacks and steel drivers, mountain men and lawmen, cowboys, Indians, inventors, and eccentrics. All of whom are just waiting to be included in your campaign! And don&amp;rsquo;t let the time period fool you, just because these characters existed in the 18th and 19th Centuries, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t use them in your Pulp Hero, Champions, Dark Champions, or even Star Hero campaigns! After all, these characters are Larger Than Life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Larger Than Life features 20 archetypes, ranging from Blackbeard the Pirate to the man who invented the 20th Century: Nikola Tesla. In addition, there are a total of 24 full character sheets, each with a detailed history and description of the character in question. But that&amp;rsquo;s not all! You also get over 120 biographies of other people related to each archetype, as well as famous ocean-going ships, famous outlaw gangs, Paul Bunyan&amp;rsquo;s entire logging gang, and other historical trivia. Each archetype also comes with at least one template, allowing you to build your own version of that archetype. So what are you waiting for? Dive in and start discovering those tidbits of American history you never new existed. But watch your step, because after all, these characters are&amp;hellip; Larger Than Life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
