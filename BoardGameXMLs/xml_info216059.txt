							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exile In The Forest</name>
									
			<description>An adventure game of ancient India set in the world of The Mahabharata.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five Pandava brothers are exiled to the forest for 12 years before they can claim the throne of Hastinapura. But there is no doubt their evil cousins will not relinquish it when they return and so those 12 years must be spent gathering allies and weapons to prepare for war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll be exploring a map, dealing with events as you move, and defending against attacks with lots of dice. There are four kingdoms whose allegiance you seek and you can do quests for each one of them as well as personal quests to improve yourself for the coming war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player character can upgrade their number of attack and defense dice as they complete quests and survive events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only twelve years to get prepared for the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you have three movement you can use. For each step, though, you might have an encounter. These can be combats or skill checks or stat loss. Your turn ends when you can't go any further, or don't want to. Many areas can only be utilized if you begin your turn there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll work together to build up reputation with four neighboring kingdoms. There are a variety of ways to do that and they can be different each game. You must also complete a personal quest. To win the game at the end of twelve years (three turns per player per year) you must have ten reputation with each of the four kingdoms and every player character must have completed his personal quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
