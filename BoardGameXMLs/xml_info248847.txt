			<description>Chimaera&lt;br/&gt;Issue 5&lt;br/&gt;September 1975&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue has the first mention of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (Original Edition) in the periodical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Just recently everyone seems to be talking about and playing the game 'Dungeons and Dragons' and I have become intrigued.  I would like to find out more about the game but as games players in this area are few and far between I don't want to fork out that sort of money for a game I can't use.  Do any of my readers have a copy of the rules and do you consider that the game could be played postally?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
