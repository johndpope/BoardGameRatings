			<description>Simple game with a spinning top to knock over four &amp;quot;bowling pins&amp;quot; and score points. Two pins are on 5 points and two pins are on 10 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scoring board is enclosed in a wooden frame. A twist is that between where the top is dropped and the scoring &amp;quot;bowling pins&amp;quot; are four pegs which are fixed to the board. These pegs cause the top to bounce around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The top is a wind-up top in two parts. The bottom metal part of top has the round top with a metal spindle. The spindle fits into the wooden upper part which has a spring inside the center hole and a pin on the outside edge to interlock with the bottom part. Thus one can wind up the top and holding the top between two fingers you can push the top loose by pushing down with a third finger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
