			<description>The world is covered in darkness, with only glimpses of light penetrating the cloud cover on very rare occasions. Mysterious shadow creatures infest the landscape, and have forced whatever was left of the previous civilization to abandon this world in hopes of starting over somewhere new. Unfortunately, their spaceship never left and has been stuck in orbit for who knows how long.&lt;br/&gt;You were one of the lucky few that escaped, however now as luck would have it, your stasis pod has been ejected to save power for the thousands of other escapees still in orbit, and you're about to wake up in a very hostile environment. It will take some tinkering and scavenging to survive, but we know you can do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
