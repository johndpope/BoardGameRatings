			<description>Princess Maker 2 is the second installment in the Princess Maker series of life simulation games developed by the Japanese computer game and anime production company Gainax. It has been translated into Korean and Chinese; an English-language beta version exists, but was never formally released. In this game, you are a war hero who raises a girl to the age of 18. At the end of the game, your daughter goes into a line of work; what this work is, how much talent she has for it, her marital life, and her overall happiness all depend on your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a fantasy world presumably modeled after medieval Europe. The starting year is given as 1210 K.D. Your character is a famous warrior who defended the kingdom from an invasion by Lucifon, the Prince of Darkness (a corruption of Lucifer); consequently, you are known throughout the land as a military hero and receive an annual salary from the palace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One night, your character receives a communication from a god whose identity is determined by the birthdate you select at the beginning of the game. This god bestows upon you a child of the heavens, and it is your duty to raise her from the age of 10 to the age of 18, at which point she will enter a line of work; the most desirable outcome is that of a royal princess, hence the name of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your daughter has a set of statistics that fluctuate depending on the activities you assign to her schedule, including various part-time jobs, schooling, adventure, and free time. It is these statistics that ultimately determine her final occupation, her skill level in her line of work, and her overall happiness in life; her marital fate is also decided, in part, by these statistics. The game also makes use of some invisible statistics to determine the occurrence of certain special events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The god who visits your character is your daughter's patron god. That patron determines her starting statistics in such a way that is loosely related to the god's role in the Roman pantheon; for example, a girl born under Mars begins the game with an advantage in fighting reputation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Princess Maker 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
