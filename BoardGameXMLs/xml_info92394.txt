			<description>Gyakuten Kenji 2 (逆転検事2, lit. &amp;quot;Turnabout Prosecutor 2&amp;quot;) is an adventure video game for the Nintendo DS handheld game console by Capcom. It is the sixth game in the Ace Attorney series, and a sequel to Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gyakuten Kenji 2 features the same three main characters from its predecessor: prosecutor Miles Edgeworth; detective Dick Gumshoe; and Kay Faraday, a teenage girl who is also an avid thief. One case of the game takes place at Gourd Lake, a setting from the first game of the series, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The character of Shelly de Killer from Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice for All returns in one case. A new female judge, named Hakari Mikagami, is introduced and serves as Edgeworth's rival in this game; character designer Tatsurou Iwamoto wanted to create an older woman he could look up to. Mikagami is part of a &amp;quot;Prosecutor Purge&amp;quot;, following the actions of weaker prosecutors to justify removing them from duty; the game starts with Mikagami attempting to take a case under Edgeworth's command to another prosecutor, Yumihiko Ichiyanagi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features gameplay largely reminiscent of its predecessor, Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, with the &amp;quot;Investigation&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Logic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Confrontation&amp;quot; modes returning. A new element involves &amp;quot;Chess Logic&amp;quot;. During conversations with certain characters, the player must find a weakness in the conversation within a limited amount of time. The player is given two choices of dialog. At times one of these pieces will show a chess piece; the player, if they believe they have an advantage in the conversation over the other character, can select the chess piece option. If the player does not yet have the advantage, they will lose some of the time meter, and will have to continue asking other probing questions in order to further build up their advantage. However, if the player does have an advantage, as represented by the relative strength of the chess pieces shown, they will succeed in overthrowing the character's conversation and progress in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gyakuten Kenji 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
