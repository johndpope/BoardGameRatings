			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alarms flash and klaxons sounds as every available Time Corps agent rushes to the field.  Somehow a full-scale nuclear war has broken out in 1970 and the disruptive Time Wave spawned by that fiery destruction will wipe out the Time Corps in a matter of days unless the cause behind the change in History is found and fixed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even new recruits like yourself are being rushed through training to aid the reconnaissance effort.  After a quick drill on Time Corps procedure, you're sent to a Time almost 20 years after the bombs stopped falling to find out what happened from the survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you go back, masking your uncertainty as to what to do, to try to find the key.  But a lot has changed ... from geography, politics and economics to music, shopping, and computers.  What is cause and what is effect?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Miss Him, Miss Him, Miss Him&amp;quot; is a 40-page training module and adventure for use with the Timemaster Role-Playing Game, with historical background, characters, and exhibits for hours of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
