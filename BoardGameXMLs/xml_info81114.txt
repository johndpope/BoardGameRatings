			<description>MechCommander 2 was the follow up to the original Mechcommander real-time tactics video game based on the BattleTech/MechWarrior franchise, developed by FASA Interactive and distributed by Microsoft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-player takes place on Carver V, a planet previously held by House Liao. At the time of the storyline's start House Steiner and House Davion, tenuously united as a single state in 3063 as the Federated Commonwealth, is now breaking apart due to Archon Katrina Steiner's controversial seizure of power. The Federated Commonwealth have claimed a few territories in Carver V, killing Mandarin Cho, Liao ruler of the planet in combat. All the Houses on Carver V are avoiding any military action that could endanger the peace. A suspiciously well-equipped bandit force is threatening Steiner territory, and the House uses a quite unusual countermeasure - a mercenary team. Player takes the role of their commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;MechCommander 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
