							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Waking the Dead</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For twenty years, the residents of Kings, Illinois have avoided the run down, two story house at 313 Second Street. Local rumor has it that the abandoned house was once home to a coven of Satan worshipers. According to legend, four evil women once lived in the house, performing dark rituals and fornicating with demons. One Halloween, during a black ritual, the local residents allegedly saw green lights glowing from the windows of the house and heard women screaming. The next day the house was abandoned and boarded up. The witches were never seen or heard from again, and the house has remained unmolested for two decades--until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waking the Dead includes new system information, including rules for creating the bizarre Accursed Zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geared toward advanced characters, Waking the Dead is suggested for 4-6 PCs of 4th-7th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
