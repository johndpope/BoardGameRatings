			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ship of Things to Come!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If we're ever to dwell among the stars, the odds are good we'll be using spaceships. Fortunately, this month's Pyramid will help ensure you're not caught empty-handed and star-struck! This armada of adventure includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Reign of Steel: Deep Space,&amp;quot; where GURPS Reign of Steel author David L. Pulver takes that setting nearly two decades into the future . . . and deeper into space. Learn about spaceships (in GURPS Spaceships format) from the various robot factions and get an extensive look at the desperate world of 2064.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Smugglers' Blues,&amp;quot; a look at moving high-risk, high-profit items from Point A to Point B, with insights into how the art of smuggling might change at future tech levels.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Strange Objects at Rest,&amp;quot; a collection of four systemless sleeper ships and generational spacecraft, which prove that sometimes it's best to let sleeping pods lie.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Vehicle Imbuements,&amp;quot; a system that expands the options of GURPS Power-Ups 1: Imbuements to the realm of transportation. Let your vessels dodge, speed, ram, or self-repair like never before!&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;The Captain's Boat,&amp;quot; an optional GURPS tweak that helps starting heroes afford expensive starships . . . by making them Patrons!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month's Pyramid also beams aboard a Random Thought Table that sparks your customization creativity, plus an Odds and Ends that expands space-time options by allowing innovative players to design the look and feel of a campaign. With this issue of Pyramid, you'll be exploring the final frontier like never before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
