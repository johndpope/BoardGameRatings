			<description>This cardgame is a multi-player solitaire. The deck consists of 96 cards (hence the name), 6 of each in the numbers 1 through 16. You can be as many players as you like, but each players will need his own deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player shuffles his deck and draws the cards, one by one, telling the others what he drew, so all players will get their cards out in the same order (similar mechanic to Take it Easy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The point is to build stacks of cards going from 1 to 16. When the last card is drawn points are awarded for how many complete stacks you've managed to build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
