							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultimate Prestige Classes Volume 2</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nobody needs to have prestige classes explained to him or her any more. The question has now become 'which one should I have?' rather than 'how exactly does this work?' Professional games designers and individual gamers alike have been working hard to realise their visions, whether they involved the creation of a class they have always wanted to play but had never been able to find, or the building of a non-player character whose abilities had to be just right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Prestige Classes Vol 2 is our second serving of prestige classes, compiled from quality sources and carefully selected for detail. rules consistency. playability and originality. These sourcchooks are designed to be slotted seamlessly into any fantasy-based d20 games system and offer the best of the best that have appeared in terms of rules and options for fantasy d20 games. as well as new material that can both be easily includcd into any campaign. Players and Games Masters will find a wealth of options to enrich their characters and antagonists.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
