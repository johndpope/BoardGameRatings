							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Manstein&#039;s Last Battle</name>
									
			<description>This is a long-waited sequel game of Struggle of Army Group Manstein.&lt;br/&gt;The game starts just after the battle of Kursk in Summer 1943 and ends in March 1944.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the same engine as its predecessor. Each player selects his chits each turn, then draw chits one by one and activate part of the force designated by the chit.&lt;br/&gt;The Soviet player must break the German defense line until the end of the game. The German player must keep the defense line until the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;The interesting new idea is &amp;quot;no retreat&amp;quot; order by Hitler. There are 6 cities which have no retreat order at the start.  If German player lose one of them while it still has this order, the game immediately ends with Soviet sudden victory. So, German player must defend them or release the order by sacrificing their reinforcement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
