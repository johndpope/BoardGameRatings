			<description>In the first half of the 20th century in Mexico, local promotions bring to light new masked heroes with the birth of a new cultural phenomenon: Lucha Libre! Impersonate those pioneers in their conquest of the crowds by inventing and popularizing new match types!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A race for innovation takes place: inventing new match types rewards you with Glory Masks, but popularizing an already invented match makes you steal it from your opponent. When a player popularizes 3 matches, the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a given turn, players are invited to choose between actions to build their Promotion or to propose a match. When choosing to build, a player can draft the best available Luchadores to join their Promotion (among other actions). A player will draft a Luchador to collect members of the same family or to gain advantage in matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When proposing a match, rivals have to match the status of your chosen luchadores in order to answer your challenge. If a successful Luchadores matching is made, players will go head to head in a dice rolling battle to earn the 3 count!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Promotion having the most Glory Masks at the end of the game is declared the winner! Bonuses are given to the first player having completed the race to collect each family and for each Championship Belt earned. In that regard, the game proposes multiple strategies and paths to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
