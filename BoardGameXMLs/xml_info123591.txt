							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Blizzard (Savage Worlds Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a dark and snowy night. The snow is falling like heavy ash from a well-stoked fire, and there&amp;rsquo;s no sign it&amp;rsquo;s letting up any time soon. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s coming down harder as the day turns to night; the snow so thick it&amp;rsquo;s almost blinding in the headlights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your eyes burn with the intensity of your gaze as it tries to pierce the veil of falling snow. Ahead you catch the glimpse of an animal in your headlights a second before you strike it; its eyes wide with fear as you register that you just hit a deer, and now the vehicle is skidding out of control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hard haul, and you are tired, and you&amp;rsquo;re caught in this blizzard. A sudden accident leaves you stranded in the middle of nowhere on a less-than-well-travelled road. The temperature is dropping down dangerously low, the storm is kicking up, and the thought of trying to weather through this storm is nerve-wracking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lights on the road ahead give a moment of hope and when the SUV pulls up, it&amp;rsquo;s a kindly looking older gentleman that introduces himself as Dr. Ramsey, but you can call him Doc, and he&amp;rsquo;s inviting you to his place for the night. His whole family is there, and they&amp;rsquo;re about to have a late dinner as soon as Doc returns, and there will be plenty, even with the PCs as guests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place at Doc&amp;rsquo;s house, and the PCs learn very quickly that not is all as it appears at the Ramsey household. The PCs will have to fight for their freedom as they watch the entire family transform into werewolves and begin to hunt the party down slowly and methodically through the night&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this 29-page adventure, you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Fully Detailed victorian mansion&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for Silver Acclimated Werewolves&lt;br/&gt;     A one-shot adventure, a bridging adventure to be inserted into a campaign, or the kick-start to a supernatural game&lt;br/&gt;     Variation based on the number and power of your characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
