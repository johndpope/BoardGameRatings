							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Rotk√§ppchen-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>One player plays Rotk&amp;auml;ppchen (Little Red Riding Hood), the other plays the wolf.  Little Red Riding Hood runs through the forest and trying not to be seen by the wolf. Game goal is for Red Riding Hood, to reach the blue and white box in the corners and then come to the meadow in the middle of the plan, without being seen by the wolf. The wolf has won, if he even sees Little Red Riding Hood. The cards are stacked face down and players take turns, depending on the card, Red Riding Hood may move in all directions, the wolf may move only horizontally and vertically. The wolf sees Little Red Riding Hood if an imaginary line between the two sites is not running on a dark green tree field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
