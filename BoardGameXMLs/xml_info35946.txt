			<description>A game of archaeological adventuring set in the 1930&amp;rsquo;s and 1940&amp;rsquo;s. Save the damsel, defeat the villain, and recover the ancient artifact before your adversaries can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players choose their adventurer type from a variety of professions, such as Archaeologist, Daredevil Pilot, Occult Expert, Private Investigator, or Soldier of Fortune. Each profession confers a special benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through drawing and playing cards, the players conduct research, travel to exotic locations, acquire weapons and other useful items, and attempt to escape dangerous encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, be the first player to visit five locations, the last of which must be an Ancient location, which represents the successful recovery of the ancient relic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
