			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever watched a movie or read a book and thought to yourself, &amp;quot;If I were the hero, I would have done that differently?&amp;quot; Wouldn't the stories turn out better if you could be the hero? Well, now you can be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword of Roshon is a very special kind of story called Interactive Fiction. Now you can do more than just pretend to be the hero, you can even make decisions yourself. But beware &amp;mdash; if you make the wrong decision the hero may suffer the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can read the story over and over again, each time making a different choice at different points. The story and the ending will be different each time, depending on how you choose. Your decision can make the story turn out to be happy or tragic. It's your decision that makes the difference. Good Luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
