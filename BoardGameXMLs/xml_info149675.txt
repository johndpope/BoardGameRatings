			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all magic items should have earthshaking abilities. Such items are common in most campaigns despite the fact that 99.99% or more of all its inhabitants could never afford to purchase them. In a world where magic is as common as it is in most games, everyone from the lowliest peasant to the richest noble would desire access to it, in the same way that people in our world want the latest devices and accessories. That is where trinkets come in. These are defined as magic items with very low powered effects that are affordable to aristocrats and better-off experts. Even the occasional high level commoner may have a trinket or two. Trinkets usually offer little in the way of power, but can make the life of their possessor easier in many ways, boost their earnings, or just improve their standing with the neighbours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ebook contains 59 trinkets to add realism to the equipment of non-adventuring NPCs as well as a number of ways of introducing them to a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wondrous Creations 8: Trinkets is a magic item sourcebook compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and suitable for GMs and players of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
