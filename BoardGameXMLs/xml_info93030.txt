							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lost Souls Revised</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost Souls lets you mock death in the comfort of your own home. Return from the dead as a lost soul striving to collect Karma. With daring and wit, you&amp;rsquo;ll be reborn a higher being. But don&amp;rsquo;t lose your Will to Live too soon, or you may come back as pond scum! Only an ingenious use of your supernatural powers will see you through the postmortem mayhem of Lost Souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost Souls was the first role-playing game for adventures in the afterlife. Intuitive, consistent and highly playable rules make it easy to learn and fun to play. The unique premise and fascinating characters are unlike any other game. With Lost Souls, death is only the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publishing History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lost Souls was first published in December 1991 by Marquee Press. The first edition was inexpensively printed with spiral binding and a black and white cover.  Good reviews and brisk sales made an update obligatory. The second edition was published in December 1992 by Sage Lore, but after a little while was subsequently sold by Marquee Press. In March 1994 Marquee Press published Cemetery Plots, the first and only supplement for Lost Souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Marquee Press closed its doors, I revised the rules by incorporating Cemetery Plots into the main rulebook, eliminating inconsistencies between the two, and cleaning up some of the typos. I made this edition available online briefly in 1999. The rules presented here were updated again in 2007 and include many new enhancements and clarifications, especially involving character creation and setting up a campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for playing a mortal medium, last seen in the 1992 edition, have now been split into their own supplement called The Mortal Coil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
