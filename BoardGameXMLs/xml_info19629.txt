			<description>A portable electronic device that plays a competent game of Scrabble. Up to three players may challenge the device. Each player enters one's own name and subsequently the turn order in which they will play. The players can decide to draw their own tiles or let the device do the randomizing. If the device assigns the tiles, the players may ask the device to suggest a play by using the &amp;quot;Hint&amp;quot; option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players keep track of the gameboard using the paper pad provided or use their own gameboard. The device has a LCD readout that is only eight characters by four characters and cannot display the entire board. Players use the arrow keys of the membrane keyboard to scroll around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All standard Scrabble rules apply. The device will challenge any word played that is not in its 12,000 word (politically correct) vocabulary. The human player is final arbiter however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device is powered by four &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; batteries or an AC adapter. Two Advanced Vocabulary Modules were available. Each module added 16,000 words to the machine's vocabulary to bring the total to 44,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
