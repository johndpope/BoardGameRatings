			<description>From the mission coordinator:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elven Blood is a compilation of 5 Convention Mission Pack adventures that can be run as a mini-campaign. They start off in Seattle where the runners get mixed up in a power struggle with the Ancients, and then moves down to Portland in the Tir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For now Elven Blood will be a limited print run at the convention, testing the waters to see how these do as a print product. We will have the adventures available in PDF though once convention season is over (since we're actively running these adventures at the cons).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BLOOD WILL OUT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowrunners have a lot of rules, and each and every one of them can be overruled by the proper amount of nuyen. So when shadowrunners talk about &amp;ldquo;never trusting an elf,&amp;rdquo; that&amp;rsquo;s more of a bargaining position than anything else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luckily for them, some elves have plenty of scratch they can use as a persuasive tool. And for the tasks they have in front of them, they&amp;rsquo;re going to need it. There&amp;rsquo;s money waiting for runners if they&amp;rsquo;re willing to venture into elven territory and take on a host of odd jobs. Jobs like: Tracking down reagents from cranky critters. Messing around in the affairs of T&amp;iacute;r royalty. Dealing with a number of different punks and thugs, none of whom like you. And intervening in a leadership challenge of the most powerful elven street gang there is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elven Blood is a compilation of five different Missions that have been written to premiere at summer conventions. They can, however, be played by anyone. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re playing at a con, in a game store, or in the comfort of your own home, Elven Blood has an adventure for you. Taking you from the mean streets of Seattle to the wild lands of T&amp;iacute;r Tairngire, Elven Blood offers exciting and inventive adventures for all Shadowrun fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elven Blood is for use with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
