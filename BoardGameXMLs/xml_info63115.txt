			<description>The game board (actually a cloth) has 5 x 5 squares. Each player has four cowries that are used as playing pieces. The goal is to reach the center of the game cloth. Four additional cowries are used as dice, with the movement being the number of open sides showing after throwing the cowries (if none is showing, movement is eight). Two cowries in one square block others and can only be eliminated by another pair. The first player to get all four cowries into the middle is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
