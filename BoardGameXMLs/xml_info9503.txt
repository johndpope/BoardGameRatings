			<description>This is a promotional game published by CONI (Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano - the Italian Olympic Committee) and UNAPROA (the Union of fruit producers of Italy) to be printed in 50.000 copies and distributed for free in youth sport clubs. The aim was to underline the importance of a balanced diet on sport activity.&lt;br/&gt;Players go around the map collecting several kinds of food. When they go to a sport competition, if they have a complete and balanced diet they have a bonus on their dice roll. Fruit is a joker (you can understand it if you think about who published it!).&lt;br/&gt;Some questions about sports can allow players to get a few gaming aids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
