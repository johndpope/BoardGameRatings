			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the N.G.o.M. (New Gods of Mankind) basic rule system for Gods, Armies, and Tribes. This system allows for gods and armies to be added seamlessly to your gameplay, expanding your story, and giving a tribe for your heroes to belong to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In New Gods of Mankind, you will create a character&amp;mdash;a deity&amp;mdash;and play out the god&amp;rsquo;s actions and responses to a setting and plot described by Fate. There is no clear-cut winner or loser; you are successful if your god grows in strength and power, and unsuccessful if your god is forgotten or your followers are extinguished. It is your goal to become the biggest and most powerful god you can. The other players are trying to do the same, however, and you will also have other, far more experienced deities and spirits trying to kill off or convert your followers so you do not succeed.&lt;br/&gt;More importantly, you &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; if you and your friends have fun, even if your god is crushed and forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is my desire to give you a condensed version of the New Gods of Mankind ruleset I created with several others back in 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules will be readily adaptable to any game system. My goal is to see you use part or all of these rules for your next game. I want people to create their own worlds and have fun writing stories with their friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
