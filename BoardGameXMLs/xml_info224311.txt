			<description>Intrigue and Politics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;True power comes not from wielding a sword, but by controlling an army. The world of politics can be as ruthless and unforgiving as a battlefield. Politics is part of many roleplaying games, but usually as an afterthought, not the focus of the game. When it is, it is usually as a resource game; attention shifts from the player character to whatever they are controlling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item includes the rules needed to play (a simplified version of GUMSHOE), as well as setting and other details.  Alternately, the materials can be utilized with the full version of GUMSHOE and used as a sourcebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
