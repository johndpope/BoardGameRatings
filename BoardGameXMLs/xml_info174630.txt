							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cards: The Attackening!</name>
									
			<description>Cards: The Attackening! is a limited collectible card game (LCCG) for 2 - 5 players. Games take anywhere from 15 - 45 minutes, depending on how many people are playing. The game works on a system of sharing decks. I.e., instead of everyone bringing separate decks, there are three decks in each copy of the game from which every player draws. Specifically, Cards: The Attackening! consists of an Attackener deck (characters); Arsenal deck (Pets, Weapons, Armor, Evasions, and miscellaneous Items); and Twists of Fate (scenarios that affect gameplay - e.g., SciFi Attackeners gain a certain advantage while attacking.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by every player drawing three Attackeners, three Arsenal cards, playing their first Attackener and then rolling to see who draws and plays the first Twist of Fate. The player with the highest roll chooses three Twists of Fate, and choosing the one that benefits them the most. That player then draws one Arsenal card, plays one, and attacks an opponent by rolling a die. Damage is determined by the amount rolled (1 is a miss, 2 is half damage, 3-5 is full, and 6 is double). If the opponent does not evade the attack, they take the damage and the move is passed to the next player, who follows the above steps to complete their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an Attackener's health is depleted, the person who beat that Attackener collects the card as a trophy. The person who was beaten chooses the next Twist of Fate, but does not play their next Attackener until it is their turn to play. This gives them a few rounds of immunity while play continues. The game is over when one player has collected three trophies from any player in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
