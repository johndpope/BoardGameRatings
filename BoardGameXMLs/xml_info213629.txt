			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Encylopedia Eldoria is a comprehensive campaign setting for a fantasy role playing world, compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It is a culmination of material created by its author for running campaign games and tournaments over a thirty year period. It contains information on mythology, history, geography and culture, providing GMs with the perfect background for their players&amp;rsquo; adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Encyclopedia Eldoria contains all the core source material that you need to start a role-playing campaign based in the fantasy realm of Eldoria. It has been written to be easily used in conjunction with most role playing resources and material currently available; the contents being largely descriptive in nature, rather than being rules heavy. You can use Eldoria as presented, tweak the content for your own style of game or use ideas and concepts in the book to enhance your own campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second edition and includes revised art-work and new and expanded material, including more varieties of the strange crystal Averaach; information on how magic works in Eldoria; and details of Tas Stones, ancient monuments that allow adventurers to instantly travel long distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
