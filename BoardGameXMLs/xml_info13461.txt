			<description>This game was published for the 1990 equestrian world championship event in Stockholm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is, very loosely, a Monopoly variant. Players roll and move (counter-clockwise, for some reason) around the board. For each completed turn you get a badge, and when you have three, you have won (although it is possible to lose them along the way).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of card that can be picked up along the way. One are &amp;quot;veterinarian checks&amp;quot; which (after some flavor text) allow you to move on, force you to move some steps backward, or (occasionally) start the last turn around the board over from the start. The other type of cards (&amp;quot;challenge cards&amp;quot;) have trivia questions on them, and unless you have a serious interest in horses, the chances are very slim that you will be able to answer any of them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: &lt;br/&gt; - game board&lt;br/&gt; - 18 badges&lt;br/&gt; - 6 playing pieces (cardboard, with a plastic foot)&lt;br/&gt; - six-sided die&lt;br/&gt; - 64 challenge cards&lt;br/&gt; - 44 veterinarian cards&lt;br/&gt; - rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
