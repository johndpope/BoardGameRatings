			<description>Efina is a very special young girl. She's curious. She's optimistic. She has the power to make lies manifest as physical beings, and then she eats them for sustenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She's also a dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LiEat is the classic story of a vagabond and his dragon protege traveling a curious world, buying and selling secrets, all the while trying to uncover the truth about themselves. Along the way, they'll discover a web of hidden mysteries, meet a variety of colorful characters (including other dragons) and learn about the past events that brought them to where they are today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This amazing trilogy has been beloved by JRPG enthusiasts and, for the first time ever, can be enjoyed fully in English! With support from the original developer and the fan translator, PLAYISM is proud to help bring LiEat to the world at large!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;Indie JRPG by the Japanese indie developer and illustrator Miwashiba (also called △○□&amp;times; or △○□&amp;times; (Miwashiba))&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
