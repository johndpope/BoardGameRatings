							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cardboard Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Baseball simulation game that recreates player performance based on simple stats found on everyday baseball cards.  Game uses a standard deck of cards for quick play resolution.  The player simply flips a card, refers to a specific pitcher stat as dictated by the chart and if the pitcher fails that check goes on to do the same for the batter.  The game advertises itself as not one trying to replicate pinpoint statistical accuracy but attempts to make baseball cards come to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
