							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Salmon Run: Fishermen Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Salmon Run Fishermen Expansion is retail compilation of 4 Kickstarter expansions for Salmon Run, but in a zipped bag format.&lt;br/&gt;It includes:-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Salmon Run: The Fishermen Board&lt;br/&gt;     Salmon Run: The Fork/Cataract Falls&lt;br/&gt;     Salmon Run: Grizzly Bear Expansion&lt;br/&gt;     Salmon Run: The 5th Player Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Description from Product Front]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The salmon are back for another run! New dangers await along new stretches of river. Hungry Grizzly Bears await your arrival while the lure of the fishermen may get you hooked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Salmon Run Fishermen Expansion contains 4 new river boards (2 double-sided boards); a custom-made die; 3 new Grizzly Bear Cards; and adds all the components needed to support a 5th player!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADDITIONAL RULES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fishermen Hex:&lt;br/&gt;The Fishermen hex is a new obstacle on the river. A salmon may move freely onto the Fishermen Hex. Upon entering the hex marked with a &amp;quot;hook&amp;quot;, the player must roll the die. On an even roll there is no effect. On an odd numbered roll stand the salmon pawn on its tail to show that it is &amp;quot;hooked&amp;quot;. A hooked salmon may not move until it plays two Swim cards to free itself.&lt;br/&gt;No movement results from playing these cards.&lt;br/&gt;Both Swim cards must be played on the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;This counts as 2 card plays for the turn.&lt;br/&gt;A hooked salmon may still play non-swim cards normally.&lt;br/&gt;A hooked salmon is unaffected by the current.&lt;br/&gt;If a current moves a salmon into the fishermen hex, that salmon must roll to see if it is hooked.&lt;br/&gt;Bears may move freely to or from the Fishermen hex and are unaffected by it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grizzly Bear:&lt;br/&gt;The Grizzly Bear is considered a Bear card and is used to move the same bear tokens as the original Bear card. The Grizzly Bear does not add fatigue but instead makes players discard two cards from their hand randomly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
