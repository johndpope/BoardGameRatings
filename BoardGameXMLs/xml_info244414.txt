			<description>There is a fire under the cauldron and magic in the air!&lt;br/&gt;In this children's game the players can act, guess and cast spells. Use your magic wand to determine who gets to act, and pull an acting disc straight out of the bubbling cauldron! Then the other players get to guess what you have turned into! The acting player and the one who guessed your character right get a scoring disc each, and the first player to have collected five scoring discs wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
