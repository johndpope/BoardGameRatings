			<description>In Axiom players compete in the art of knowing dictum and slogans. It can be played with two players to a maximum of six teams consisting of many players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is simple. You're being asked a question. If you know it you can progress three steps forward on the score board. If you know it after you've given a set of choices, you only take one step forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who reaches the end of the score track wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
