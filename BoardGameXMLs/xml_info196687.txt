			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster of the Week product line takes its inspiration from the television trope of the same name: a convention by which a weekly television production might introduce a new freak, villain, or beastie in every episode, allowing the episode&amp;rsquo;s themes and topics to revolve around the latest &amp;ldquo;big bad.&amp;rdquo; Monster of the Week aims to arm GMs with creatures and villains perfect for such a role. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to populate a memorable encounter or a villainous story arc, our Monster of the Week is made for maximum creepfactor and memorable &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo; power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this installment&amp;rsquo;s pages you will find the true and terrible description of the barang beetle swarm &amp;ndash; a mass of bewitched vermin who crave to nest and lair inside of living flesh. Taken from real-life Visayan mythology and superstition, barang describes a kind of witchcraft by whichevil spirits are bid to dwell within familiar vessels &amp;ndash; typically beetles, specially prepared and cared for by a mambabarang: a practitioner of the dark arts. To that end, you will find more than baleful beetles below. Included here are insidious spells for a mambabarang villain of your own to cast (perhaps an alchemist, occultist, or witch). But be warned: dabbling in these abandoned arts is sure to take its toll&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
