			<description>From the back of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunt the Dragon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A young red dragon is getting bolder. As its terrorizing grows more successful, evil power groups in the Delimbiyr Vale desire to harness its might. Can you do Loudwater a great service by denying the Zhentarim this powerful resource?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Denial of Resource is an adventure for the DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS game. It can either be played as a stand-alone adventure, or as part of the LEGACY OF THE GREEN REGENT campaign offered by the RPGA. Designed to challenge 5th-level D&amp;amp;D heroes, this adventure pits against a twisted foe using half-elf bandits to further its own equally twisted ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this adventure, a Dungeon Master also needs the Player's Handbook, the DUNGEON MASTER'S Guide and the Monster Manual. This adventure is set in the FORGOTTEN REALMS game world, and it may also be useful, but not necessary to also have a copy FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
