							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows in the Weald: Elksbane</name>
									
			<description>Elksbane is a four-counter expansion to Shadows in the Weald appearing in the sixth issue of Yaah! Magazine. It introduces a new hero, Borr Elksbane, and his two Direwolf Hirelings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Borr is very frail, and doesn't pack much of a punch. He's not someone that can last long on his own, and in fact is at his best when he's helping others to be at their best. He allows your Party to reposition itself and to move quickly, while his tough Direwolf Hirelings slow down the enemy. It's all about getting the most out of your Party as a whole, and that often requires a bit of finesse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion includes three new scenarios, as well as rules to use Borr in all five base game scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
