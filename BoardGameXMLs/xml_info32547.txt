							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS: So Full of Fire</name>
									
			<description>An expansion for the Advanced Tobruk System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So Full of Fire-Band of Brothers at Brecourt Manor and Beyond includes 2 scenarios of the assault by elements of the 101st Airborne Division on four German 105mm Gun Emplacements on June 6th, 1944. The first scenario depicts the initial assault by Easy Company as seen in the film &amp;quot;Band of Brothers&amp;quot;. The second scenario is the mop up operation with the 101st supported by armored elements newly arrived from Utah Beach. &lt;br/&gt;Two additional scenarios depicting actions by other units of the 101st on D-Day are also included, for a total of 4 scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 12&amp;quot;x19&amp;quot; large hex historical map showing the area around Brecourt Manor and 56 &amp;quot;Screaming Eagle&amp;quot; personnel counters are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: So Full of Fire is not a complete game. Ownership of ATS games containing standard German and American personnel counters and standard American AFV and German Late War AFV counters is needed to complete the scenario countermix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
