			<description>A game of interstellar conquest available free at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.angelfire.com/games2/warpspawn/Insur.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/games2/warpspawn/Insur.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map consists simply of ten worlds/planets/star systems. Each player begins with one loyal world with a Governor and a hand of 7 chits drawn from the pool. The pool consists of 10 of each type of unit (except for two of the installations, of which there are only 5 each) and 2 each of several (optional) special chits that allow the holder to execute special actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different types of units: Personalities(in two types: Public and Espionage), Military Units and Military Installations. There are 4 kinds of Espionage personalities, from Assassins to Rebel Leaders, and 3 kinds each of Public Personalities, Military Units and Military Installations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit has a set of possible actions to choose from. A Governor's actions, for example, are: Recruit-5; Deploy (Personality, Troops)-5; Subdue Uprising-3; while an Assassin has only one available action: Kill (Public Personality)-3. The number following each action indicates the chances out of six that the attempted action will be successful. Recruit allows you to draw a chit from the pool into your hand, while Deploy allows you to place a unit from your hand into play. Loyal worlds have a list of actions just as units do: Recruit-5; Deploy Base-4; Deploy Personality-4; Repair-2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the movement phase, a unit may move from its current world to any other world on the map. Military installations may not move. Troops cannot move on their own, but must be transported by Star Cruisers. Star Cruisers may be ordered to blockade a world; any enemy personality moving to a blockaded world risks being destroyed by the blockading cruiser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is achieved by gaining the loyalty of all ten worlds or by eliminating all enemy units from the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
