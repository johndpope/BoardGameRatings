							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saturankam</name>
									
			<description>Saturankam is an ancient game from India that is similar to Sadurangam and Ashtapada. It is played on a 9x9 board of cells with a winding path that spirals to the center. The middle squares along each edge and the square in the center of the board are safe places where pieces cannot be attacked. Movement is determined by two four-sided dice. The object is to enter pieces on the middle square on one's own side of the board and race them to the center. Each player has two pieces. Pieces that are not on safe squares can be hit and must be reentered, as in Pachisi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
