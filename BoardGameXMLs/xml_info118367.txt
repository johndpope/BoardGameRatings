			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Before you stretch the lush fields of the central plains. A large herd of bison graze lazily in front of you and small creatures dart in and out of their feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: How large is the herd?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Large enough that you can't see anything beyond it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: All right guys - who wants to go on a scouting mission?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vast stretches of fertile plains commonly populate the maps of many fantasy worlds. Farmers and towns dot these landscapes but they often feel like flat, empty spaces. To give these places more of a lively feel, your friends here at Healing Fireball Publications have created a collection of tables to add the missing grazing buffalo, stalking predators and small vermin back to these places. Two Bit Tables: Plains and Savanna Animal Encounters provides a group of tables containing more then 100 animals native to the plains, steppe or Savanna that can be added to those environments to add a little color to the plains of any world. This product includes 4 pages of tables, all for a mere 50&amp;cent;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
