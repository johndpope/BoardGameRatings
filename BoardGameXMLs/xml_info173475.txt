			<description>From Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OPTIONAL RULES FOR &amp;ldquo;RACE-BASED&amp;rdquo; TALENT TREES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the Strong, Fast, Tough, Dedicated, Smart, and Charismatic character classes, Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World features a post-apocalyptic-specific class, the Post-Apocalyptic Hero, which is intended to represent a typical inhabitant of the radiated wasteland, one geared towards survival and scrounging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Post-Apocalyptic Hero does a good job of bringing out the flavor of a &amp;ldquo;wasteland survivor&amp;rdquo;, in large part due to the talent trees specific to that class. But this article is intended to delve even further into PA-specific talents, presenting an assortment of new talent trees based on the various player races of Darwin&amp;rsquo;s World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike typical talent trees, which are keyed to a given class, racial talent trees are available to any character of that race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
