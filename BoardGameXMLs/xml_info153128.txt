			<description>&amp;quot;A Matter of Honor, Sire&amp;quot; is the fourteenth game in the Pocket Battle Games series from LPS, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This battlefield was one of the missed opportunities for the Coalition.  Bernadotte's subordinates challenged his honor in getting him to the battlefield, arriving late and in the wrong place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Matter of Honor, Sire&amp;quot; is a mini-game, postcard sized. Rules at the back, map front and 17 double sided counters along the sides. &lt;br/&gt;The game is a hex and counter game where troops are activated though a standard deck of cards: black activates French units, red Coalition. How many and all is determined by the specific card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved by comparing combat strengths of the units and drawing cards from that same deck. Whenever a joker is drawn, the turn is over, the deck is reshuffled and a new turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coalition player wins if they are the last to control the Leipzeg hex, otherwise the French win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
