			<description>Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a video game created for the NES by Rareware &amp;amp; published by LJN Toys Inc. in 1989. The single-player game is loosely based on the film of the same name and had combined elements of graphic adventure computer games with some more traditional action adventure gameplay. A different version of the game was also released for various computer systems in 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in Santa Maria in 1947. As the game begins the player takes control of Eddie Valliant, with the framed Roger Rabbit cartoon character always following Valiant. The player wanders around an urban city of Hollywood entering various buildings, and caves in order to speak with people, some of whom are from the film, and picks up various items left on the ground and inside drawers and chests in order to find out who framed Roger Rabbit. The second half of the game takes the player into the infamous Toontown with more buildings and caves to explore in an effort to find Marvin Acme's lost will, and prepare for a battle with the nefarious Judge Doom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit_(Nintendo_Entertainment_System),&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit_(Ninten...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
