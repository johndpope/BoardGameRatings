							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ghosts in the House</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghosts in the House is a Call of Cthulhu  campaign suitable for 3-6 beginning characters. The adventure emphasizes data collection and discussion over running and screaming, and thus it is suitable for beginning players as well as experienced ones. The first adventure is very long (it takes place over 3 weeks or more); the subsequent adventures are much shorter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign starts with The Man in the Hat, a long and involved situation involving the discovery and elimination of an alien being feeding on a creepy diet. Next is A House Full of Ghosts, a not-quite-triumphant return to the home to deal with the natural aftermath of the alien&amp;rsquo;s absence. Next is The Hole in the Attic, dealing with an unrelated problem in the home. And, finally, the campaign wraps up in The Last Gasp, which is precipitated by the discovery of what may be the egg of another alien. The Man in the Hat should take several group meetings to run; the other adventures should be easily wrapped up in a single session each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
