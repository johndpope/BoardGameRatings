							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Harsh Winter</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;A holiday themed adventure for the Mythic Russia roleplaying game from Firebird Productions. The Mythic Russia book is required to play the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is inspired by one of the many tales of Ded Moroz, or Grandfather Frost, from Russian folklore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A harsh winter has befallen the village of Nikolaevsk, near Lake Peipus. Teutonic Knights were in the village when Ded Moroz came to visit and the haughty knights openly mocked this &amp;lsquo;old, hoary man&amp;rsquo; representation of Morozko. Angry at the Teutonic Knights for mocking him, he froze them in their steps. One knight, little more than a squire escaped the freezing, however. He remained behind at the Order&amp;rsquo;s camp to guard the supplies. By the time the adventure begins, he is becoming nervous and scared, working up the nerve to head into the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morozko&amp;rsquo;s anger did not stop with the Teutonic Knights; however, the god was infuriated that the town did not defend him against the knights. To teach the village a lesson, Morozko sent the worst winter ever to strike the village, and there is no promise of spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the heroes arrive, they find the village and surrounding area covered in snow and the people clinging to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
