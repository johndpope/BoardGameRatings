			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Light in Darkness - A dark, survival horror scenario for Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition, set in the Pacific Theatre during World War II. Includes 8 pregenerated characters, special-purpose insanity cards and weapon cards, maps, and other player handouts. Designed to run in 4-5 hours for 3 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;June, 1945. The US and Allies continue to make progress in the Pacific against the forces of Imperial Japan. Heartened by the recent capitulation of Germany, hopes are high for a successful defeat of Japan. A group of Navy Seabees rush to repair a runway on a jungle island recently liberated from the Japanese. Exhausted from the hard work, they find themselves resting in the shade of a strange, native stone statue, watching the Marines make their way back to the USS Hutchins for deployment to the next island. But who is this VIP, codenamed 'Daybreak,' that just landed on the airstrip? And why did the MPs order you to make yourselves scarce while he landed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
