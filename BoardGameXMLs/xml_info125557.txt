							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dr. Playwell&#039;s Controlling Your Anger Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;Help kids take control of their anger before it takes control of them. This game teaches children how to recognize and change the things that make them angry, how to compromise in situations where there is a conflict, how to talk about their feelings rather than act on them, and how to self-monitor their emotions. The bonus activities in this game help children learn positive ways to handle frustration in their day-to-day lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appropriate responses to the question or activity on the back of the card allow the player to collect cards, and the first player to collect two from each &amp;quot;suit&amp;quot; wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game is also part of the Dr. Playwell's Amazing Card Games Collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
