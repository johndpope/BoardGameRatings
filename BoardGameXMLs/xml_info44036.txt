			<description>Join the madcap adventure of robots on the run!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bots of Widenet YT are being crushed by Cel Tron Stroma, the titanium fisted tyrant-bot, who tells them all bots are equal. An underground movement, the Conspiracy Of Robots For An Unsupervised Free Trust, has begun and the member-bots are searching for a way off the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single copy of Run Robot Redux contains almost all you need to tell stories on Widenet YT. All you need to provide is a handful of friends and two handfuls of dice (of the d10 variety).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on the title: although the title page looks as if the game is called Run Robot Red! (redux), this is actually not the case.  The author explains on p. 5 that the actual title is as we have it listed, and it appears that way on the publisher's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
