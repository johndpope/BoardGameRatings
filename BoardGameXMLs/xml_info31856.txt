			<description>&amp;quot;Exciting Tracks!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents one of six large mammals found in the Finnish nature (wolf, lynx, elk, bear, wolverine and rabbit). From the starting area, paths of circles lead to a picture of each animal. The game is divided in two phases; in phase I, players try to collect the footprints of their chosen animal, being occasionally hindered by Wind or Snow. Phase II starts as soon as one player has collected all 14 footprints of their animal, and in this phase the players use their collected footprints as &amp;quot;stepping stones&amp;quot; to reach the picture of their animal on the board; naturally, in this phase those who managed to collect more prints in phase I have a better chance of success. Winner is the first player to reach their goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by WWF Taktinen Luontopeli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
