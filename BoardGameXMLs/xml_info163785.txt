							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloodlines, Traits, and More</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 45 pages of character options in three PDFs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Barbaric Traits presents 36 new character traits, and they're not just for barbarians. Indeed, these traits can help flesh out any character that hails from some savage frontier where honor and sharp steel matter more than manners and shiny coins. Inspired by the works of Robert E. Howard and a certain cartoon barbarian with a sun sword, these 36 traits are divided evenly between Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social categories. Now your savage hero can become Blood-Mad, utter a Motivational Expletive, practice Poisonous Sorcery, or benefit from knowledge gained as a Barbaric Ambassador (to mention just one-ninth of the traits packed into this PDF).&lt;br/&gt;     Want more bloodlines for your sorcerers? Want more sorcerer/wizard spells? Then In One's Blood is for you! This 25-page, black-and-white PDF includes Aquatic, Divine, Giant, Ooze, Plant, Psychic, and Vermin bloodlines; 15 new spells, including conqueror worms and ooze shape I-III; and 1 new monster, the behemoth pudding.&lt;br/&gt;     Latina Facta includes 15 new feats based on Latin sayings. Versatile Performance Redux introduces an alternate Versatile Performance class feature for bards that uses terminology related to acting, music, and dance to represent bardic talents. Strike at those who've hurt you or yours with Caro Putridas Es! or reveal the truth with Lux et Veritas. Enjoy your bard's ability to disrupt his enemies with Dissonance or step lightly with Body Flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
