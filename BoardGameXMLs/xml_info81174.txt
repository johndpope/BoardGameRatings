			<description>Jeep Jamboree: Off Road Adventure is a Game Boy racing game that involves Jeep Wranglers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A first person perspective is used like in the game Test Drive. The object is to race laps around a muddy race track while trying to get first place. There are twenty tracks to race in; each with a timer that forces the player to race fast. There is an option to either do a single race or a multi-race tournament against a computer opponent or through a human playing while using the Game Boy link cable and another copy of the video game. Items in the background like electric lines and rocks help provide a road-like feeling to the races. All measurements in the game are done in metric. For example, a racer might be driving at a speed of 130 kilometres per hour (81 mph) per and the game will recognize the number in kilometres instead of miles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a single-player race, the player will race to the finish line against a field of approximately nineteen other drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jeep Jamboree: Off Road Adventure,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
