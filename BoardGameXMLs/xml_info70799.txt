							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New Game of Cash</name>
									
			<description>The game uses a squared board for play, and involves moving a square of card around the board. Holes punched into the square reveal the designs on the squares of the board below. The idea is to use the card square to reveal coins (which are then matched by examples from the pot) with the intention of arriving at pre-determined sums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the individual who achieves his or her sum correctly. The values are in pounds, shillings and pence, and the coins are made from card printed in gold and silver to represent the correct look of the original coinage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
