			<description>The abstract strategy game Quot has one simple rule: you must control surrounding spaces to claim new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts by using 13 of the 20 unique two-sided mats to construct the board. You will never play the same game twice, so you will always be challenged to adapt your strategy to the layout of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each board space displays a value from zero to four. This value indicates how many adjacent spaces you must control to claim that space. Take turns competing with your opponent to take spaces that allow new moves while also limiting your opponent's options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quot encourages players to anticipate their opponent's moves and develop a strategy to secure the largest area as possible. If you claim enough space to run your opponent out of possible moves, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
