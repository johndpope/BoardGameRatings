			<description>Assassinate the shogun, then vanish without a trace in this interactive fantasy novel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the high-stakes game of politics between two feudal lords, you are a ninja village's chosen warrior. Earn glory for your clan as you battle your enemies, becoming a master of magic, combat, and stealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choice of the Ninja is an epic interactive fantasy novel by Katherine Buffington, where your choices determine how the story proceeds. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but driven by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you bring peace to your village, or return home in shame? Will you serve your daimyo obediently, or defy his orders for the greater good? Or will you use your powers of invisibility for personal gain? The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
