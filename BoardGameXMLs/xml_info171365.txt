			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;MVP Date before it's too late!  MVP Dating prepares you to be the best in the game by giving you chances to gain and use Morals, Values and Principles (MVPs) in dating scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of MVP Dating is a roll-and-move game. The object is to master the outer &amp;quot;date-for-fun&amp;quot; path by accumulating three &amp;quot;dating experiences&amp;quot; chips and gaining 5 morals, values and principles (MVPs) cards.  Players may use MVP cards to avoid negative &amp;quot;1-on-1&amp;quot; dating experience card penalties or to dump a date.  When a player has accumulated the correct number of dating experiences and MVP cards he or she can move to the inner &amp;quot;Get Married&amp;quot; track.  when they land on a &amp;quot;Get Married&amp;quot; space and have only one date left, they may stay on the space until they roll a 6 to get married and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is designed to teach dating morals and values to unmarried teens and young adults with the ultimate goal being marriage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
