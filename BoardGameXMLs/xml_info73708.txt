			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the Cold War historians declared an &amp;ldquo;end to history.&amp;rdquo; Supposedly there was nothing left to fight about and a period of prolonged peace and prosperity seemed at hand. Sadly this was not to be. The events of September 11th, 2001 proved there were still issues to fight over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But as the War on Terror ended and the Obama administration transformed America, abdicating its role as sole world peacekeeper, other nations reignited the great power struggle ended in World War II by division of the planet into two blocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironically, the environmentalist dogma of declining world resources was the catalyst that launched a new struggle between the world powers; a struggle not for power or prestige, but to control access to the resources that everyone was assured would soon be rapidly depleted. The New World Order is dead. Long live the New World Disorder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fast playing and easy to learn, World War IV is a two to eight player game played on a tabletop where players are leaders of major powers in a struggle for world resources. Conquer earthly resources or pursue a space program to develop off-world colonies and resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system emphasizes strategy and places a minimum on die rolling. Rules include weapons of mass destruction, missile defense, cyber warfare, air, ground, and space combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each major power has its own special rules and pieces including Texas militia, Falun Gong chi-knights, Russian Spetznaz, European robotic panzers, American mobile infantry, South American guerillas, Turkish mujahideen, Japanese armed spacecraft and more!&lt;br/&gt;The game includes eleven sheets of die-cut game pieces and complete rules. Some six-sided dice (not included) are required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
