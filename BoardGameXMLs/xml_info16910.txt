							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Presidential Fever</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Presidential Fever&amp;quot; allows players to face off against each other in a two Party contest. Two to four players may compete, though the three player game essentially calls for one player on one side to fill both the Presidential and Vice-Presidential roles. Players move around the board, capturing states with campaign funds. Players must also watch to maintain their credibility rating and to build either a liberal or conservative rating when appropriate. A lack of credibility keeps your party from winning a state; high credibility allows your party to overcome a liberal or conservative bias; liberal or conservative leanings provide financial rewards in many states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike most games based on the Electoral College system, Presidential Fever combines a number of contiguous low value states into a single region (e.g., Farm Belt, Border States, Mid-Atlantic, Deep South, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
