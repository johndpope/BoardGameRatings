			<description>Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three months have gone by since the events of the first game. The Terror Mask, which has reformed after breaking at the climax of the first game, appears to Rick and repeatedly tempts him to &amp;quot;go back to the house&amp;quot;, telling him that Jennifer &amp;quot;doesn't have to die&amp;quot;. It closes by telling Rick &amp;quot;You need me.&amp;quot; Rick succeeds in rescuing Jennifer, and the House sinks into the bottom of the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Splatterhouse 2 features gameplay very similar to the first game. The player controls Rick through eight different stages, each two-dimensional. Rick's attacks remain largely unchanged, able to punch, kick, jump kick, and slide kick, as well as use several weapons scattered throughout the levels. Each level features a boss at the end, often a grotesque monster. New additions to the gameplay include a difficulty setting and a password system, taken from Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Splatterhouse 2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
