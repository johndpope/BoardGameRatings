							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Looking Glass: Hong Kong</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking Glass: Hong Kong is a &amp;ldquo;Low and Slow&amp;rdquo; city setting for many possible GUMSHOE games. This look at one of Asia's most cramped and chaotic ports features the lay of the land, including markets and masses, and three unique backdrops for the main setting - a scenic or thematic element, or just somewhere to stage a fight scene. It also details Hong Kong's factions, from organized crime all the way up to the The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and includes thirteen Hong Kong-flavoured adventure seeds. Use Looking Glass: Hong Kong in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Night's Black Agents as a modern-day equivalent to the role West Berlin plays in post-WW2 spy dramas - a speck of room to manoeuvre, just on the edge of an authoritarian state, with HK-themed alien, mutant, and damned vampires;&lt;br/&gt;    The Esoterrorists, as Esoterror operatives capitalize on on the city's key fears of disease, and the dead;&lt;br/&gt;    Fear Itself, playing on the alienating effect of isolation within one of the most densely packed places on Earth;&lt;br/&gt;    Trail of Cthulhu, with extensive notes on Mythos locations and practices of an occult bent that would sit well in the backstory of any investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement exists in a world of instantaneous oceans of information, and holds plenty of rash generalizations, needed for game play and speed of familiarization. It's not intended to be comprehensive; instead, it combines a few evocative details with broad-brush color. It is intended as a starter, a foundation for your own adventures, a framework on which to hang the fruits of your own research, similar to its sister title, Looking Glass: Mumbai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
