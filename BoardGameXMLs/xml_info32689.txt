			<description>One of the more interesting wargame designs coming out of Nazi Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 4 duplicate triangular maps of the field of battle that can be placed together to form a square board.  Each section of the map contains 90 points with various obstacles that must be overcome (minefields, hedgehogs, wire fences) or repaired (blown bridges, destroyed roads). The playing pieces are metal miniatures (painted flats) consisting of German Sappers with various implements (explosives, wire cutters, Flame-thrower, etc.) and a tank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sappers move based on a die roll, in any combination the player desires.  The object of the game is to overcome obstacles by gathering the right combination of sappers at the obstacle which is either then destroyed or repaired for the rest of the game.  The final obstacle is a bunker that sits on the intersection of all four boards and must be destroyed to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
