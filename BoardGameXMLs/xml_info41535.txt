			<description>Panzertales: World Tank Division I (WTD I) is the one of a series of games oriented around the World Tank Museum series of miniatures.  Published in Japan and written in Japanese, the game involves area movement of tanks in the later days of the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 8 unpainted PVC tanks: two Panzer IV J, two Tiger I, two T-34/85, and two M4A1/76 Sherman.  However, as this is insufficient for most games, six sheets of cardboard counters are included with tanks and armored vehicles for Germany, America, Britain and the Soviet Union.  The cardboard chits represent a wide variety of armor including some less common units such as the American M26 Pershing and German Maus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units have several characteristics, including attack strength, defense strength, movement allowance, anti-personnel strength and point value.  The single, double-sided map included in the game depicts Berlin on one side and Bastogne on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is not highly complex.  It is more a mechanism for players to use their World Tank Museum figures in a game.  It lacks several elements which were heavily involved in these and other armored engagements in this phase of the war, including infantry, anti-tank guns, artillery, and air power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
