These aquatic invaders have been waylaying ship and attacking their crews, desperately searching for something under orders from someone known as &amp;quot;The Mistress&amp;quot;. The villagers are not sure what their agitated aquatic foes are searching for...but they are concerned it might be related to the strange metallic rock that fell from the sky a few weeks back and was recovered by one of its sailing vessels, the Ēostre. These concerns solidified into real fears when a local druid, Tasmin Brindo, informs the mayor her allies in nature report that the Ēostre was under attack by a mass of aquatic humanoids, and it was last seen foundering a few kilometers up the coast from the village! The villagers are afraid these bloodthirsty foes will come for them now! They send out a call for heroes, and your party answers the call. Can your band of heroes investigate the wreck of the Ēostre, determine the cause of these attacks, and save the village before it is overrun by invaders?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place in three different phases in three separate locales. The first phase takes place underwater at the wreck of a fishing ship, the Ēostre; the second phase involves an urban battle in the village of Inverdale as the players attempt to repel an invading force of aquatic humanoids, and the final phase takes place in a seaside grotto controlled by the sea hag and her evil forces. The changing battlegrounds and environments are certain to challenge your players&amp;rsquo; skills!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains a completely original aquatic themed ONE SHOT adventure, fully detailed and ready for immediate use with very little preparation by the GM or the players!
