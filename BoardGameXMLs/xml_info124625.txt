			<description>This is a simple game in which players spin A spinner to collect Colorform pieces that correspond to their player mat. The game comes with two sets of Colorforms that depict characters from the Where's Waldo Now book. The Colorforms are placed randomly on the spinner at the start of the game. Each turn, a player spins the spinner and can collect a Colorform from the quadrant of the spinner that the arrow points to provided the sticker matches their player mat. The first player to collect all four characters for their mat wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
