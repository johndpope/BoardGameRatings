			<description>Contents : The board is a map representing two enemy territories, one lake, mountains, forests, roads, rivers, two citadels and 4 towns. Each player has 24 pawns: 8 infantry, 4 cavalry, 4 artillery, 3 engineering, 3 train, 2 infirmary. Also 2 special dices, several season cards, and map tokens.&lt;br/&gt;This is a simplified wargame, with each side trying to take the opponents citadel or his two towns. Each turn, the player has 10 points that he might use to move his pawns, then if the target is in reach, he can fire.&lt;br/&gt;The cards trigger events that affect the map (forest fires, plagues, etc.) Terrain also influences the way the pieces can move, and their vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
