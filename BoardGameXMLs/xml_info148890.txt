							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Invasive Species: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Auuuuuuuugh! Your publisher is breathing down your neck, so now it's a late-night, caffeine-fueled, rattling-keyboard-pounding race to get the first chapter of your thriller novel Invasive Species finished before he decides to tear up your lucrative contract. Through blind inspiration (drawing cards) and expert cut-and-paste editing (arranging cards on your board), you strive to complete your chapter before it's too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the card game Invasive Species, players create a story by using 36 cards that have numbered text showing where each card should go in the story. Each turn, a player draws a card and decides whether he wants to keep it or give it to his opponent. He places any kept cards on his personal board, with the goal of creating an ascending numeral sequence. When the deck runs out, players take turns sliding misplaced cards into their correct positions. The first player to correctly &amp;quot;write&amp;quot; his story wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasive Species is based on the novel of the same name by Mike Mayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
