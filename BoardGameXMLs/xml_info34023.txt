			<description>Explained in Gladstone's Games to Go, Sliders is an abstract strategy game played on a 1x9 grid with coins (or similarly small objects). Players determine the amount of coins in 8 stacks as well as the maximum movement (slide) along the grid by secretly writing down numbers and adding them together. The player to move the final piece into the 9th box (Home) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Gladstone&amp;rsquo;s Games to Go:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the appeal of Sliders is the strange sense of ritual at the beginning of the game.  Secret numbers are scrawled, then revealed, and finally, a miniature landscape of towers is constructed.  If you play in public, casual observers will first be mystified, then drawn to you.  Be prepared to let others in on the fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
