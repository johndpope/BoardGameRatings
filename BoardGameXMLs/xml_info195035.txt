			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game have several unusual abilities, including a near-immunity to permanent death and vast power.  Primarily they are opposed by deity-level powers.  The action resolution mechanic uses dice pool and and colored tokens (colored candies are suggested).  Tokens can be expended to control (to some extent) the narrative outside of dice pools.  The game is somewhat structured, with enumerated actions available to characters (typically Create, Possess, Assault, though there are others).  Players may create play cards (using index cards) during play; they are used and potentially reused during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
