							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yards: The Game of Inches</name>
									
			<description>Yards is a two-player football-themed strategy board game. The game begins where the most exciting football games end: it is sudden-death overtime, and the first team to score a touchdown or field goal wins. The game is played in drives in which players alternate driving the ball towards opposite ends of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt cards with simple patterns on them, and then set up their pieces in formations of their choice on opposite sides of a line of scrimmage. Each player, on their turn, may then choose to move one piece one space, or move several pieces at a time--but only if the pieces on the field match the patterns on the card. The pattern cards may be rotated and combined to set up dramatic breakaway plays, but only if they can outwit the defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playtime is approximately 30 minutes. Ages 10 and up. Solitaire variant also available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
