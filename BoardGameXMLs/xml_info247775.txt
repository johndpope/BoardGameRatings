Since being cast from the world of Tumunzar late in the First Age of Man, Hastur has long sought to return. The elves of the Barestir continent offer an opportunity for Hastur to maintain an aspect indefinitely on Tumunzar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone in Meawold is working to build a temple, build a host and pull an aspect of Hastur across from the beyond, where the Old Ones wait and plot their dreams of feasting on worlds. The Formene Elves detect this activity and ask the party members to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are given a list of people who have the ways and means to build a cult or are acting suspicious and asked to investigate, confront, and find the person or persons involved in this horrible plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with DNH4 &amp;ndash; Confronting Hastur &amp;ndash; 5th Edition Adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The 5th edition adventure. 38 pages of in-depth information.
