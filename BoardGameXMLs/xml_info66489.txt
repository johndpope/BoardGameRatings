			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Great Old Ones were, the Great Old Ones are, the Great Old Ones shall be.&amp;quot; That famous saying is the essence of the Cthulhu Mythos. The Great Old Ones are a cosmic evil that have existed since before time, and shall exist long after humanity has gone the way of the dinosaurs. This book illustrates the eternal struggle between man and the forces of the mythos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains nine scenarios that run the chronological gambit from prehistoric times to a distant future. Each adventure comes with six pre-generated characters for the players to use, allowing for quick play with a minimum of fuss. While each scenario is meant to be a standalone experience. Here are brief descriptions of the nine eras the investigators explore:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CURSED BE THE CITY can be described as cavemen vs. Cthulhu. While not entirely accurate, it is fun to say, and gives an idea of what the players will be up against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHILDREN OF A STARRY HEAVEN is set in ancient Greece, the birthplace of many great philosophers and thinkers. Unfortunately some great minds dwell on things man was not meant to know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THEY DID NOT THINK IT TOO MANY See the might of ancient Rome bring law to the wilds of Britannia. Witness two cultures trying to learn from each other. Behold the terrible awfulness of the Mythos and how even the mightiest empire of man is powerless before it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MASTER WU&amp;rsquo;S MARRIAGE a lovely springtime wedding, surly nothing bad can happen here. Unless the wedding takes place in Call of Cthulhu, then all bets are off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE IRON BANDED BOX set in feudal Japan, it&amp;rsquo;s like what would of happened if Akira Kurosawa directed an adaptation of a H.P. Lovecraft story. Beautiful, strange, messy, and with swords!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO HELL OR CONNAUGHT it&amp;rsquo;s Protestant vs. Catholic, English vs. Irish, and mankind vs. the Cthulhu Mythos with Saint Patrick thrown in for good measure. Who will win? The smart money is on the Mythos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A HARD ROAD TO TRAVEL set in the American Civil War, this scenario chronicles the horrors of war where brother fights brother and then everyone fights a cosmic horror beyond description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THREE DAYS OF PEACE, MUSIC, AND TENTACLE LOVE Taking place at the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969 with sex, drugs, rock-n-roll, and black magic. A terrifyingly trippy time is to be had by all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TIME AFTER TIME is a fractured scenario for fractured minds. Here the investigators will think many things, only to find them all false. Identities, locations, adversaries, even correct eras are all anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
