A pared-down take on the classic wilderness exploration adventure modules of the late 70s and early 80s, written to suit the harsh world of Freebooters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Notes from Jason Lutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Borderlands of the Unknown is a working title at this point, but RPG fans of a certain age will immediately recognize it as a reference to both Keep on the Borderlands and In Search of the Unknown, two influential adventure modules published by TSR in 1979. Jonathan is drawing on these, along with a variety of other sources, as he crafts an adventure that will utilize the systems laid out in both Freebooters on the Frontier and Perilous Journeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jonathan is a prolific game designer whose best-known product in Dungeon World circles is probably the Planarch Codex, a modular toolkit rich with great ideas for any GM (and currently available as a free pdf or print-on-demand book). The &amp;quot;Dungeons as Monsters&amp;quot; section of the Codex was the main inspiration for my handling of improvised dungeons in Perilous Journeys, and in general Jonathan's work has helped me think laterally when it comes to design, so I feel extra-honored to have him on board as a contributor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
