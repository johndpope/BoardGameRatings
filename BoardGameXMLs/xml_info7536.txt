			<description>A book that includes four &amp;quot;realistic space wargames&amp;quot;. Each game has a double A4 sized board and a page of black and white counters that need to be cutout and in some cases assembled to be stand-up starships. This game book is number 3 in the Battlegame Book series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four games are:&lt;br/&gt;Space Pirates. 2-4 players. Players control 3 ships and are racing to pick up cargoes from asteroids and return them to earth. Each ship has a speed from 0 to 5 must change speed by one unit each turn. The moon orbits the earth, and is a constant hazard. Attacks are permitted and send the loser out of control. Landing is a fine art of judging speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deadly Planet. 2-4 players. Each player has a team of astronauts stranded on a hostile planet and they have to reach specific pick-up point. Dangerous beasts roam the planet, some of which can be ridden; others exist only to attack astronauts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasion Earth. 2 players. The Ganoids are invading Earth's seas. The earth player using orbital missile satellites, submarine and surface fleets must track down and destroy the Ganoids spawning craft. It is a game of careful placement as the Ganoid player tries to over-extend the Earth player's resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galactic War. 2 players. The Krul vs the Stellar Federation. Players expand across the map capturing planets to increase their technology rating and dodging the randomly moving anti-matter cloud. Combat and conquest depends on the number of ships in the fleet. As only one ship can occupy each space, long snaking fleets stretch across the board. Some of the ships are annihilators - suicide bombers that destroy all neighboring ships. Ship types are kept secret from your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
