			<description>This 1960s title is a manual dexterity baseball game that can be played indoors or outdoors. The game consists of a thick cardboard baseball field with a base and support that enable it to be mounted vertically, as well as four 2&amp;quot; concave plastic discs stamped to look like baseballs. The field has four holes that can be punched out: three semicircles in the outfields labelled 2 Base Hit, 3 Base Hit and Home Run, and one in the infield labelled Infield Out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field can be set up anywhere by placing the box lid upside down and mounting the field inside it. The players must agree on how far away the Battling Line should be. The rules suggest different distances depending on age and skill, from 20 feet for adults to less than 10 feet for younger than 9 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn stands on the batting line and tosses the disks underhand at the field. Hitting the field on the fly between the foul lines is a single. Going through an outfield hole scores the labelled extra-base hit. Any disk that misses the target, hits the field after bouncing, or goes through the Infield Out hole is an Out. A player keeps batting until his third out, after which he scores the number of runs batted home that inning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player (any number) takes one inning as batter and then the players repeat in sequence. The winner is the player with the most total runs after nine innings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
