			<description>In this issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Solo and Duo Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immediate and practical support for Conan the Roleplaying Game in the form of exclusive rules on how to adapt this unique game to small groups as low as just two people. After all, Conan managed to traverse most of Hyboria often alone, so why not try and emulate him. The Hyborian setting and the Conan books provide numerous ideas for this style of game, and now the smallest gaming group can get involved!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     More Most Wanted - Whitey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably the worst criminals in Mega-City One are the judge killers, and the worst of these could well be Whitey, a thoroughly nasty piece of work who will provide serious opposition to any group of judges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Power Beyond Cognition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highly popular Slaine RPG has a devoted following of fans addicted to its unique, Celtic feel. Normally anybody seen wearing much more than trousers is considered something of a softy in Tir Nan Og, yet there are items of terrifying power at hand which can single-handedly alter the fates of nations. These are the leyser weapons. If that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, then we also have brand new rules for the evil and deadly Cythron race. Terrible enemies and even more terrible weapons to face them with. Lovely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Making a Soundtrack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bit of an odd one for us. With the success of the evocative OGL CyberNet game, we thought it might be nice to provide some relaxing background music to give your games a real cyber feel. Enter Stratos, techno guru and dance commander, who has put together a cracking CD to get players in that CyberNet mood. Here&amp;rsquo;s how he did it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Power Class: Avenger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mad Max meets Hawk the slayer in this month&amp;rsquo;s Power Class. These new classes have really proved popular, exploring new backgrounds for your characters, particularly focusing on popular fiction styles. The avenger will set you firmly on the course of vengeance and revenge. None of your namby-pamby paladin stuff here; avengers are out to get the job done, no matter what it takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Lock and Load&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another treat for CyberNet players who want to let their heaters do the talking. August Hahn has written a full set of rules allowing gamers to customise and personalise their firearms. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like pulling out a unique weapon and hosing down a room of bad guys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Datafile: 2089 - Union Fire Control System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICQA Field Test series has proved very popular with Armageddon: 2089 players, allowing them to outfit their Meks with cutting edge equipment &amp;ndash; at a price. That price isn&amp;rsquo;t in hard currency, but rather in front-line risk. Perhaps it is the element of danger that has made this series such a winner, or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the thrill of experimental equipment. Whatever the reason, you keep asking us for more, and at S&amp;amp;P we are always happy to deliver!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Journey to Lovecraft Country&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New contributor Fey Boss explains what to do if you ever have a few spare hours in Providence, Rhode Island. Sooner or later most of us make a pilgrimage somewhere, and if it&amp;rsquo;s related to roleplaying, then HP Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s inspiration will often be high on the list. Get a feel for Providence as well as helpful car parking tips...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rimbule the Metamorph&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A huge scenario by Johnathan M. Richards based on our Encyclopaedia Arcane: Crossbreeding book. Rimbule has been up to no good in the forest, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to your party to clear the place out and right the awful wrongs committed. Your characters will need a strong stomach to cope with some of Rimbule&amp;rsquo;s obscenities - women crossed with trout and turtles, ratmen, deformed centaurs and a few other nasties. Rimbule - not exactly the name you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a mad scientist, is it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
