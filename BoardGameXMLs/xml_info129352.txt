			<description>Two player trumps game. Divide the cards evenly and stack them face-down in front of you. Both players draw a card and reveal it.&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of possible results:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predator card (P) On the bottom of the card are silhouettes of creatures it will eat. If the card revealed by your opponent features that silhouette, the card is 'eaten'. Both cards are taken by the Predator and put on the bottom of his stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food card is a creature that could be eaten so it is vulnerable. A Food card cannot beat anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wildlife Rescue Card will beat a Predator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Man Hunter card beats all cards except Wildlife Rescue cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral (N) cards are just that. They cannot eat any card and they cannot be eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a situation arises where the exposed cards cannot beat each other then reveal two more cards and check again. This is repeated until one card takes the other and the winner of that duel takes all the revealed cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main cards are in four colours but the colours only link to a region of the world. The colour itself has no other relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is endorsed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).&lt;br/&gt;First player to capture all the cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
