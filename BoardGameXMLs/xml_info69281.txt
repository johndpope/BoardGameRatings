			<description>Commissioned by a museum, some art collectors come together to organize an exhibition in honor of 2 grandmasters.  The art collectors have 2 goals:&lt;br/&gt;- make sure that their own paintings are exhibited,&lt;br/&gt;- make sure that their own visitors stand with the most important paintings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup of the game: depending on how many players, each player receives a certain amount of visitors (tokens) and a certain number of paintings.  The paintings from each player are put together in a certain way in the middle of the table (in a circle, triangle or square).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round has 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;- phase 1: putting in or move your visitors to a painting or let them take a break&lt;br/&gt;- phase 2: a painting disappears from the table (by throwing a dice)&lt;br/&gt;- phase 3: move the guide (the painting which is visited by the guide can't be removed in phase 2)&lt;br/&gt;- phase 4: new start player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when only 2 painters are left.  The winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;You earn point for:&lt;br/&gt;- each own painting that is left on the table (1 point)&lt;br/&gt;- each own visitor on a painting (the number of points mentioned on the painting)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(description taken from the rulebook)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
