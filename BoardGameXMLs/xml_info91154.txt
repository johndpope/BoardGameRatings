			<description>Rompers (ロンパーズ) is an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. If it runs out, a strange-looking vampire named Tsukaima (who cannot be crushed by the walls) shows up and all the enemies start moving twice as fast. This game also features voice samples (in Japanese).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Rompers (arcade game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
