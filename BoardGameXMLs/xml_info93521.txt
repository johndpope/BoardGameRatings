							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Making Change</name>
									
			<description>Players buy and sell items from stores to practice making change and counting up.  Play simulates money transactions between customers and store owners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets their own store based on the side of the board on which they are sitting.  Each player is also given money and 8 chips at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, the player uses the spinner to determine which store they will shop in.  If it lands on their own store, they choose any other store to shop in.  The player then purchases an item out of the designated store using their money.  The owner of the store counts back change from their money supply.  After the transaction is complete, a chip is placed over the item to indicate that it is no longer available for purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends using a method determined before the game, such as using a time limit, using a certain number of turns, or selling a set number of items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
