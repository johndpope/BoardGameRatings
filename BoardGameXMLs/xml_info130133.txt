							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Azrael&#039;s Tear</name>
									
			<description>Azrael's Tear is a 1996 first-person role-playing video game adventure game published by Mindscape and developed by Intelligent Games. Taking place in 2001, the player takes on the role of a futuristic grave robber/archaeologist called a &amp;quot;raptor&amp;quot;, who has come to explore a recently opened cavern in Scotland rumored to contain the Holy Grail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ken Haywood produced the original concept for the game and worked with Intelligent Games's own Richard Guy on the final design. It was a richly detailed and atmospheric world with challenging puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original design called for a Myst-style pre-rendered environment. As development progressed, the team switched to real-time 3D. The game features music written by Ray Shulman and Kerry Minnear, both former members of Gentle Giant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Azrael's Tear&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
