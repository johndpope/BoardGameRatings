			<description>SPROING&lt;br/&gt;The Action Game of Unbearable Fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGES: 7 to Adult&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT: Get rid of your cards in hand, but also avoid getting stuck with the discard pile cards when the SPROING tray goes &amp;quot;SPROING!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;EQUIPMENT: 1 Special SPROING pop-up discard tray&lt;br/&gt;54 Numbered Cards consisting of: 32 Blue Cards and 22 Yellow Cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Bag&lt;br/&gt;6 Multi-Colored Plastic Chips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn discards a card in the special SPROING tray before it pops up. Yellow action cards add excitement to the game by directing players to roll dice, find color chips in a bag or count out loud before discarding a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This curious game relies on a coiled plastic tray that may be pressed down to become held in place by a sucker. The sucker holds the tray down for about 1.5 minutes (according to the makers) before suddenly releasing the tray, allowing it to pop up and scatter all cards that happened to be on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players try to play a card that is either a '1' or a number higher than the top card on the tray. The blue cards are numbered from 1 to 10, with lots more 1s than other numbers. The yellow cards are numbered from 1 to 9, but also have actions described on them that must be performed by the next player. The next player has to complete the actions before they are allowed to play their card. The actions could require players to count (for example, from &amp;quot;Sproing 1&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Sproing 10&amp;quot;), roll a specific combination on two special dice (each die has 3 blank sides and 3 sides showing a coiled spring), or draw a chip of a specified color from an opaque bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone unfortunate enough to have the tray pop up during their turn has to keep all scattered cards, which count as points against the player who owns them. The player with the lowest number of points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
