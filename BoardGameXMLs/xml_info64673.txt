			<description>A fast-moving category game in which the idea is to be Catcher and catch players out by saying their word three times before they can once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Catcher.  The others are assigned four chips and a random word in one of six categories.  Each player announces his word to the Catcher, who repeats it and memorizes it before moving on to the next player.  Once all players have announced their word, the round begins immediately.  The Catcher tries to say anybody's word three times in rapid succession before that player can respond by saying his own word once.  If the Catcher is successful, the &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; player discards a chip and the round continues.  Once one player has lost all three chips the round ends, and players score a point for each chip remaining.  The player who lost all his chips becomes the new Catcher.  The game ends when a player reaches a pre-determined score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
