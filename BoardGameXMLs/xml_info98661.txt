							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anima Tactics: Justina</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born with the terrible ability to see the sins hidden in the souls of others, Justian nearly went mad as a child. After being sent to the holy city of Albidion to be trained as a church executioner, she fell into the most absolute desperation, from which she was only able to escape thanks to the love and dedication of Damien, who trained alongside her. Now she is a solitary and terrifyingly efficient Inquisitor, able not only to wield an inhuman martial ability, but also to control the evil inside others and cause it to devour them from within. She finds dark pleasure in the hunt, and nothing makes her feel alive like vanquishing those with interior darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, in her damned eyes, very few are innocent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior - Dark Church - Level 45&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nux: If Justina suffers damage from a Magical ability she recovers an Action Point.&lt;br/&gt;Anathema: All of Justina's attacks against Mystic units use her secondary Damage attribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tears of Heaven (Ki, Attack) - +2 Damage. Roll two dice and keep the highest result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sinner's Glare (Ki, Effect) - Cast Blind Lv. 2 on an enemy unit within Justina's Control Zone. Effect 14.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suppression Aura (Magic, Effect) - Any enemy units that use a Magic ability in Justina's Control Zone automatically lose 3 LP. Upkeep: o&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penitent Shot (Ki, Ranged Attack) - Distance (16 Inches), +1 Attack, +2 Damage. If Penitent Shot causes any damage, the affected unit suffers Seal Lv. 2, Effect 15. Justina cannot Walk or Run in the turn she uses this attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
