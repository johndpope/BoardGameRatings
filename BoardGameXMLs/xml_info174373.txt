			<description>A word game, in Catalan, with just 13 letters dice (in different colours, which implies different values). A player chooses between 4 and 8 dice and rolls them (at least two different dice colours must be present). With the result she must find the highest valued word (letters in white dice = 1 point; letters in green dice = 2 points; letters in yellow dice = 3 points; letters in red dice = 4 points). Any dice not used for her word are lost for the next round. The other players also look for the best word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the rolling player has finished with her word, she receives points, while the other players receive points if they have found a higher-valued word. The rolling player keeps rolling (each round with the same dice except for those not used in the previous word) until she has less than four dice. Then is the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
