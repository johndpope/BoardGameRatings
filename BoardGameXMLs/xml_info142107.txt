							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mage Clash</name>
									
			<description>Long ago in Seven Cities of Gray, two adepts began a journey to learn forbidden majicks. Over three ages they created magical objects and potions, translated arcane cantrips, and discovered lost artifacts of four ancient mages: Arden, Balor, Canna and Dynin. In time their powers grew to the point where they, and their allies, fought each other with spells and wards across the Seven Cities for the title of Master Mage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mage Clash is a game for 2 players, lasting about 30 to 45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will need the tiles and cards for the game, 5 six-sided dice, a set of traditional D&amp;amp;D dice and 80 eurocubes in 2 colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first phase - Learning Majick - players will play tiles (Magic Items, Mystic Objects, Magic Spells, Casting Wards, Potions and Cantrips) from their hands by paying Elemental Resource costs. Each type of tile has a different power associated with it and the collection of sets allows a player to gain victory points or have the choice of Special Artifacts to be used in the second phase. Discard tiles boost a players army and mana abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase lasts eight rounds and mid-game victory points scored&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second phase of the game - Combat in the Cities - players use their Magic Spells, Casting Wards and Special Artifacts to combat each other in seven cities. Some cities have special powers of their own that affect the combat; each city is also worth victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Magic Spell has a certain number of dice associated with it. Players roll five dice, taking a subset of these, augmented by their Casting Wards. Armies act as hit points in each of the cities and players combat each other until one player wins 4 of the 7 cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase Two victory points are added to those of Phase One to determine a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best Fantasy-Themed Game category in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place - Best Art/Graphic Design category in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3rd Place - Most Colorblind-Friendly Game category in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
