			<description>Before Bob Chaikin developed his computer based basketball simulation (widely used by several teams in the NBA), he designed and developed a board game simulation. Similar in layout to Mickey Games' Fast Break, each player has an offensive and defensive card, allowing for players to match up against each other differently on offense or defense. As per the name, results are achieved through the use of dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
