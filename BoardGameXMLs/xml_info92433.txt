			<description>From Adventure Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs have been gathered by chance, fate, or some benefactor, and have known each other as broodmates for as long as a year. A&lt;br/&gt;few weeks ago, however, their their dreams took a strange twist. In place of the normal recollections regarding their draconic heritage and previous lives, each PC began experiencing darker dreams . . . nightmares of guilt, suffering, and betrayal. Betrayal of one&amp;rsquo;s closest allies. Several days ago each player received a letter playing upon that fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because each dream is read to each PC individually, the player&amp;rsquo;s initial thought should be that he is the betrayor, and perhaps he may wish to mask that fact from his broodmates. In truth, every member of the brood betrayed a group . . . but that group was never the brood, and the betrayal was always performed on the brood&amp;rsquo;s behalf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strange creature with mysterious motives, a resident of the dream city of Babylon, has entered the players&amp;rsquo; dreams and obscured them. It hopes to turn the brood against one another so that it may live in the dark and distrusting places amidst their brood mind; a fully-formed and well defended brood mind is too clear and open a construct for its purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true challenge of the adventure, therefore, will not be whether or not the PCs can overcome their foes in battle or outwit each other, but rather whether or not they can trust one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A GenCon 2005 Runner-Up Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
