							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Close Combat - Last Stand Arnhem</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close Combat &amp;ndash; Last Stand Arnhem is a highly enhanced new release of Close Combat, using the latest Close Combat engine with many additional improvements.  Its design is based on the critically acclaimed Close Combat &amp;ndash; A Bridge Too Far, originally developed by Atomic Games, as well as the more recent Close Combat: The Longest Day. This is the most ambitious and most improved of the new Close Combat releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Allies, you will carry out the world&amp;rsquo;s largest airborne operation, Operation Market Garden, to cross the Rhine and bring a swift end to the war or, as the Germans, use a hastily organized set of defense forces to prevent the Allies from reaching their ultimate goal, Arnhem Bridge. Close Combat &amp;ndash; Last Stand Arnhem comes with expanded force pools, reserve &amp;amp; static battlegroups, a troop point buying system, ferry and assault crossings, destructible bridges, static forces and much more!  Also included in this rebuild are 60+ battles, operations and campaigns including a new enhanced Grand Campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
