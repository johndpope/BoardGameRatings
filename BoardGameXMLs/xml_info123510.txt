			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Flyer Death Defyer takes place in a future in which humanity lives in Earth's stratosphere. The story is told in comicbook style sequences. The main character goes sky-diving and finds trapped dragon-like creature who saves him when his parachute fails. He then frees the dragon from the trap, becoming a super-hero of sorts. Shortly afterward, the protagonist learns that a benevolent alien race is enslaved on Earth's surface, and after rescuing a female alien named Charisma, he sets off to free the rest of them. The gameplay in High Flyer Death Defyer consists of diving off ledges and navigating a free-fall to the next landing pad. Points are scored for skillful flying and accurate landing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
