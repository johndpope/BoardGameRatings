							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killer Clowns from Hell</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Characters Will Die Laughing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For every childhood disturbed by painted faces, manic laughter, and madcap antics that suggested a tenuous grip on sanity and reality, clowns have been there. Even the seemingly charming and innocent clowns, simple whimsical pranksters and buffoons, but if mortal jesters are bad enough, how much worse are the heinous harlequins that entertain the foulest fiends of the lower planes? Killer Clowns from Hell brings you a sextet of madcap mummers, featuring demons, daemons, devils, and more ranging from CR 7 to 14, each with its own killer comedic style. While each embodies a particular type of cruel comedy, fighting one (or a deadly troupe of them) is no laughing matter. They are as deadly in combat as they are with a joke, and if the monsters themselves were not enough we also provide an assortment of magical treasures well-suited for the reckless ribaldry that these fiends represent and the sorts of twisted treasures they collect. When you unleash these Killer Clowns from Hell on your PCs, they might die laughing or they may live to joke about it later, but either way it'll be a scream!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
