			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ten hours ago, a U.S. spy plane was shot down by an unknown aggressor somewhere south of Japan. The home office believes this aggressor to be one of our long-time rivals: the Crimson Dynasty. Based on early intelligence, we believe the spy plane caught sight of an operational prototype of the Dynasty&amp;rsquo;s new sea-borne weapons platform, codenamed MANTICORE. We must know if the platform is operational, as obtain its current coordinates. Unfortunately, the Japanese are refusing to release any information about the crash until the plane&amp;rsquo;s pilot, Captain Robert McDonnell, is back in U.S. hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your mission is to infiltrate the U.S. Embassy and interview Capt. McDonnell before he's escorted home and out of our reach. There are two complications. First, the international media has been alerted of the incident, and are swarming around the Embassy, seeking a story. Our presence in Tokyo must remain as discreet as possible. Second, the Dynasty may know it was observed, and may try to silence the Captain before he can reveal MANTICORE's position. You are authorized to use lethal force only when Dynasty involvement is confirmed, and you're to do everything in your power to keep the Embassy safe from harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Captain departs the Embassy at 6 a.m., Tokyo time. You have 12 hrs. Good luck, agents.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
