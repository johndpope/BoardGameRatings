							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ghost of the Crypt</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ancient graveyard and crypt, where heroes of the First Age are buried, has been taken over by foul undead. The crypt covers the famed Sword Dungeon that hides a treasure of magical weapons. Those weapons need to be in the hands of brave souls to wield them again for the forces of good. Those who have much courage, might and magic have a chance to survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dungeon features a single, uniform map for each crypt entrance, each of which leads to a multi-room crypt, then a two level dungeon that needs cleared of evil. This is a stand alone adventure rated for levels 7-9, easily adjustable for higher or lower levels of PCs.This adventure fits well in any campaign world that has magic and magical weapons available. The text block style (of monster stats) is easily convertible to other versions and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
