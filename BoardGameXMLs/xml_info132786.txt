			<description>Maisy's Big Floor Game is a game for children from 3 to 8 years old. The gameboard is a big sheet and the game is supposed to be played on the floor. The players are represented by big Maisy Mouse figures and the racetrack is a railway with different colors. There are four special stops at the railway: sea, park, playground and farm, players get a special tile when arriving  at each stop. Movement is determined by a spinner and the spinner shows both a color and a number from 1-5. Players can decide themselves to move according to the colors or the numbers (for the bigger children). The first player who arrives at the end-station with the four special tiles wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;The game looks nice for the young children and although it is supposed to play from 3 years old seems that it can easily be played with younger children as well because all materials and figures are from big, thick and strong pieces of cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
