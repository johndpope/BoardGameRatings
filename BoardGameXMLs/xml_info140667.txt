							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cross Factors Cross Multiply</name>
									
			<description>Two games in one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Cross Factors is to be the first to cover two sets of numbers (from 1 to 12) by moving around on the board.  For example, if a player landed on the number 24 then he could cover a 6 and a 4, or a 2 and a 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cross Multiply you try to gain the most points by creating rows of three or more on a multiplication table.  This is done by first creating two numbers by rolling two dice (twice) and adding them together.  These numbers are then used as the X and Y indices (or vice versa) on the table to claim a square in the table.  On each subsequent turn the player can choose to replace one of the two numbers and thereby capture a new position on the table. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
