			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When characters are travelling through a wooded area, they may only be told that they see some trees. There are far more things to encounter in woods and forests than that, and this is a list of 100 different such things to see, hear and find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These can be used to simply flesh out an otherwise boring journey, as potential hooks for encounters should the GM wish or simply to make players think that something more important is going on when it isn't. Most encounters are fairly mundane, but some do have the potential to be irritating or hazardous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds - Croaking noises can be heard coming from the near distance. If characters track them back to their source, they find a small pond containing a lot of tiny green frogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is cover, one the front matter and around half a page the introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
