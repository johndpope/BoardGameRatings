			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the far-flung future. Four of you&amp;mdash;a Captain, a Negotiator, a Science Officer, and a Security&lt;br/&gt;Officer&amp;mdash;are on a secret but vital mission to negotiate peace with a hostile alien race. However, moments&lt;br/&gt;before entering the target system, your Science Officer realizes that you have all been infected with a&lt;br/&gt;virus that shares and shuffles memories. You&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure who you are, but you now share memories&lt;br/&gt;that belong to the rest of the crew &amp;mdash; including one planning an assassination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you are primarily the ill-fated, memory-addled crew attempting to secure a lasting peace.&lt;br/&gt;This takes place over three roughly-defined scenes (landing, meeting the aliens, and negotiating) bookended&lt;br/&gt;by an introduction and a debriefing. During all sections of the game, you will play your primary&lt;br/&gt;character by describing what they&amp;rsquo;re doing or acting it out. You may also take on secondary roles to flesh&lt;br/&gt;out the other humans and aliens you encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
