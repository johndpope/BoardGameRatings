			<description>Eliminate the opponent's pieces by mastering a shrinking and transforming playing area, and tiles that fix the type of movement of the pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn, each player moves one of his pawns, then removes from play the tile his pawn was placed on. If the removed tile creates an empty space in the playing area, the player moves either side of the row or column to form an uninterrupted row or column. If this reconstruction creates an empty space again, he can move either side of the row or column again and so on. The capture of an opposing pawn is done by moving to the tile it occupies. The winner is the player who captures all 4 opposing pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36 tiles,&lt;br/&gt;    8 wooden pawns,&lt;br/&gt;    1 rule booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
