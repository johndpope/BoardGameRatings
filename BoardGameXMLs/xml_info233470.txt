							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blue Veil Union: Criminal Uplift Laboratories</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for Exilium, the science fiction roleplaying game of post-human loss and redemption by Greg Saunders, using the Open D6 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exilium Mission Shard: Blue Veil Union&lt;br/&gt;Location: Sapphire city of Lazuli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blue Veil Union is thought to be a secretive and illegal group of radical Uplifters who develop Uplifts specifically for the black market, infamous for producing dangerous and unstable Uplifts such as the Xular. Located in a laboratory on an abandoned drilling rig near the city of Lazuli, and protected by aberrations, the Blue Veil are hunted by both the authorities on Sapphire and Unity alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions Shards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF presents a short sandbox-style mission seed for the Exilium roleplaying game of posthuman loss and redemption, and describes the origin and history of Ruyang, the shattered city, including some of the notable locations and factions as well as possible Shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that Blue Veil Union is system neutral so could be used for other science fiction roleplaying games, although some of the factions etc. may not have context outside of Exilium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
