							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Smurf Game</name>
									
			<description>The box top shows Smurfs riding logs which are floating down a river. The description from the inside game box: After a picnic in the woods, the Smurfs are on their way home.  In order to get back to their village, they will travel along the stone path and take shortcuts by riding a log up the river.  But watch out!  The sneaky Gargamel is traveling up and down the river in search of Smurfs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Smurf gets two log tokens. Using a spinner, player move Gargamel up and down a river.  The Smurfs travel on a stone path, but can also travel up the river using a log token.  Running into Gargamel while on the river causes the Smurf to be chased out of the river, losing the log token for the rest of the game and moving back to the nearest river crossing. First Smurf to finish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Smurf Gameboard&lt;br/&gt;     5 Smurf Characters&lt;br/&gt;     1 Spinner&lt;br/&gt;     8 Log Tokens&lt;br/&gt;     Die&lt;br/&gt;     Instructions on box lid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
