							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Langrisser Trading Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Collectible trading card game based off the Langrisser video game series. The main set is based off Langrissers 1-5, and has art by Satoshi Urushihara. There was one expansion set produced, based off Langrisser Millenium, but has a different artist than the main set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has many similarities to Magic, but some major differences, such as no land cards. However, you have generals and monsters that you use to protect &amp;amp;#039;yourself&amp;amp;#039; much the same way monsters protect &amp;amp;#039;yourself&amp;amp;#039; in Magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
