			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Icewind Dale; The mad mage Akar Kessell has long been defeated, along with his evil army. Most of the dwarves of clan Battlehammer have migrated east to their ancient home of Mithral Hall after the death of Shimmergloom and her dark-dwarf minions. The Ten Towns valley has prospered over the years but has also seen the leaving of many of its heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, a new menace has moved in beneath the shadow of Kelvin&amp;rsquo;s Cairn and threatens devastation to the townsfolk of Termalaine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers are visiting the frozen region of Ten Towns when they see smoke rising from the town of Termalaine. Upon entering the town they find unimaginable destruction and many casualties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Frost Giant, named Hrimnar has moved into the old Verbeeg Lair at the foot of Kelvin&amp;rsquo;s Cairn. He has demanded tribute from the poor peoples of Termalaine and let them know what happens if they do not pay him adequately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest to save a town from a tyrannical, giant overlord may spell the doom of the adventures as they face off against Hrimnar&amp;rsquo;s minions and even worse, his pet dragon, Ormrfrost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 10th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
