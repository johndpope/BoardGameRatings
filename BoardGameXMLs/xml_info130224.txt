			<description>Quick, Easy, Tactical Play! : LOTS OF CHIP GOOBERS : Player Interaction out the WAZOO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;Goobers, the most vile beings in the vast universe did it again. The planet Chano III has been a victim of the Goobers constant littering, wasting, burping, &amp;amp; farting. This is just what the Goobers do, find new planet's inhabit them ,then party party party until its core can't take anymore and begins to implode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now luckily for the Goobers, they have a ride off this rock. Now unluckily they have expanded a bit sense they arrived. There's just never enough room for all the Goobers to fit back in the escape ship!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, that's where you come in, you have the unpleasant responsibly of getting as many of the 18 Goobers you are burdened with with on that ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 different Goobers of 3 different colors at your unfortunate disposal. Each of the 6 have there own well ~special~ talent that you must best utilize to see your way to victory.&lt;br/&gt;Now remember you don't have a very long time before the ship will take off into the great outer space, so you must work diligently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who receives the least negative points (there are no positive points in a world where Goobers are involved) by the time of blast off is the one who will be most responsible for the destruction of the next world the Goobers land on (also known as the winner of this game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
