							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Legends</name>
									
			<description>The Game of Legends is a unique RPG with an important financial part. Gametime is flexible and depends on which one of the possible three endings the players choose. Regain the occupied land from the Dragon, improve your character, fight monsters, attack other players, invest and make good deals. And be the first to be strong enough to attack the Dragon and rule the land! Beautifully drawn characters and awesome graphics provide the base for the unique experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
