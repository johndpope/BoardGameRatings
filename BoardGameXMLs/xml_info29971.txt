			<description>WINNER 2006 KublaCon Game Design Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your maps, shovels, and sense of adventure as you and rival archaeologists travel to remote ruins in search of the greatest artifacts. Beware, for this journey can be a dangerous one as your rivals seek to sabotage you at every turn, and these ancient sites contain giant pits, huge boulders, and even death traps! Do you have the courage to overcome all the obstacles and collect the most valuable treasures, or will you be one crowbar short of your goal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-5 Players &lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 and up &lt;br/&gt;60 Minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Each player attempts to collect as many Treasure cards as he can. Each Treasure card has a point value listed on it (1-5 points.) The player with the highest point total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
