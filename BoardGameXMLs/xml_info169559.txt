			<description>Help put together a barnwarming party and make sure everyone has a good time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dipsy Dipsy, Ice Cream Delivery Mare Extraordinaire, has just purchased a brand new barn to live in. And you know what that means &amp;ndash; barn warming party! There&amp;rsquo;s just one small problem: she forgot to send out the invitations! Fortunately you (and your opponent) have agreed to help, by gathering all of Dipsy&amp;rsquo;s friends and customers. All you need to do is make sure that the guests arrive in proper groups and help them to bring the right gifts and and make sure someone brings the gifts and&amp;hellip;Oh dear!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to create complete sets of guests and gifts, and then to claim the set when completed. Players take turns playing a guest and or a gift on a set until it is completed. Each guest requires at least one other guest and up to two gifts in order for the set to be complete. The player who completes the set collects it, and the player who collects the most cards by the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
