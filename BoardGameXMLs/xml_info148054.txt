							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jackpot</name>
									
			<description>Jackpot is played on a 4x4 grid representing a slot machine. Players start each round by being dealt four cards each depicting one of four symbols. A turn consists of placing a tile with one of these symbols in an empty space on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the board is full players reveal their cards and score for sets of four squares with symbols matching all their cards. They can score for orthogonal rows, diagonal rows, 2x2 groups, and the four corners of the board, with different payouts for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rounds are played until someone gets to 500 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in Games &amp;amp; Puzzles #67 (January/February 1978).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
