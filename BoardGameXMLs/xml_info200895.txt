			<description>This game is subtitled The Great Game of Politics ... For the People. There is an octagonal game board with five concentric tracks (each moving closer to the center of power), along with money, Vote cards, Political Backing cards and Media cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose one of eight factions (Military, Wealth, Education, Ecology, Women, Labor, Industry, Farm) and take the corresponding Information Card (cheat sheet) and colored plastic token. They also start with $7,800, two Vote cards and four Political Backing cards. They put their tokens on the corresponding spaces in the outer (dark blue) Local Level ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and move, winning and losing Political Backing, Money and Votes along the way. They may spend Political Backing cards to change their own die roll by one space, or to change another player's roll, by one if in the same ring or more if in a higher (closer to the center) ring. Media cards provide random rewards and penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players need to accumulate both money and Vote cards to move up the rings to State, Federal, Convention and finally Campaign Trail. The winner is the first to land by exact roll on the Bigwig space in the innermost ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
