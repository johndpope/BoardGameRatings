			<description>In Car Wars, players are pit against a computer car as they race in opposite directions around a square track with 5 lanes. The object of the game is for the player to collect all the dots located in each of the 5 tracks. The computer player does not pick up these dots as it races around the track opposite the player, but is there to try and crash into the player. This makes the player lose 1 life and the race starts again where it left off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can adjust the games base speed, and also the speed of their car as they go around the track. The player can never change direction or stop entirely from going counter-clockwise. The player can only change lanes at designated places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
