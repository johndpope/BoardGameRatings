			<description>Summary of Rules (from Instructions)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gauntlet is a role-playing board game in which players (often referred to in their game role as Travelers) battle their way through a maze of hazardous tunnels and monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gauntlet may be played in four different versions: the Race Game, the Treasure Game, the Hunter Game, or the Tournament Game.  The object in each is to be the first player to have his or her traveler cross from one side of the board to the other.  When one player does, on the following turn the Gauntlet will begin to collapse, starting with the innermost square and proceeding outward by &amp;quot;rings&amp;quot; with each turn until the entire board has collapsed.  If no other players make it across the Gauntlet before the entire board has fallen, the first player wins the game.  If any other player makes it across to tie the first player, the tied player who has accumulated the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
