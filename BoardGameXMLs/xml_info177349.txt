			<description>NO! is a quick and unpredictable turn-based casual card game for 3-7 players, designed by District Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, shuffle the 100 available cards and equally split them among the players. Everybody draws one card and a random player starts the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your turn, flip the top card of your deck. Every card indicates how the turn passes from one player to the other, so the next player to play is simply the one indicated by the arrow you flipped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have at least one card in your hand, right after somebody else's move you can shout NO! and play one card from your hand on top of the last card played by the active player. This way, that card will be the one to be followed now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who flips the last card of his deck wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
