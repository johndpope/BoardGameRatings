			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would a traveling adventure be without the horses? The Horse Tile set makes it easy to keep track of player's horses, even if they become separated from the player. With mount size at 10x10 and the average PC only 5x5, it also helps to have a way to show the difference. This set of nicely drawn horses, allows for an entire party to have a choice in what they want to ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horse Tiles are lightweight, store in very little space, durable, and quick to set up. When you're done, just scoop them into a box or bag and you're ready to go. Perfect for convention gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draft&lt;br/&gt;Jousting&lt;br/&gt;Chain Barding&lt;br/&gt;2x Light&lt;br/&gt;2x Heavy&lt;br/&gt;Medium&lt;br/&gt;Plate Barding&lt;br/&gt;Plow&lt;br/&gt;2x Wagon Team&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
