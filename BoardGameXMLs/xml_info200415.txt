			<description>Adorable to Horrible is an adult party game for 2-4 players. It's a game that's easy to learn and play, so you can quickly get to the fun and debauchery! Choose one of the four &amp;quot;Adorables,&amp;quot; do your best to keep them safe in their Happy Place cloud, while you push your opponents' characters down the stony steps, toward &amp;quot;The Nasty Void!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three pawns, which are moved along a track. Each turn, a player plays a movement card, which moves a specific type of pawn along the track. Alternatively, he can play an event card with some random effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all three pawns of one player have reached the end of the track - the nasty void. The other players get points depending on how far along the track their pawns are. The player with the lowest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
