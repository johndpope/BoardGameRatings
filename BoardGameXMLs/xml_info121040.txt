			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merlin Junior's master has gone to a Sorcerers seminar, leaving him in charge. Everything was fine until Merlin Junior tripped over and broke four earthen jars, each containing a talisman holding the demon Trodor imprisoned. Now the demon is free and his minions roam the laboratory, and it's up to Merlin Junior to retrieve the four talismans and put them back in place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demon's Revenge is a classic arcade adventure game. The player must collect items to open doors, banish demons and find the talismans. Roaming demons drain energy from the character; energy can be recovered by visiting the pentagram room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
