							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The FORE! Horsemen</name>
									
			<description>After the humans went and got themselves all Zombified, the Four Horsemen are left with lots and lots of free time. Following failed attempts at other leisure activities, they are giving mini-golf a try. Unfortunately, sportsmanship is a concept Death, War, Pestilence, and Famine have a difficult time grasping...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your fellow horsemen start the game on the first hole. Each turn you roll your bones and move by matching the symbols on the board. But, winning isn't easy against cheaters like the horsemen! Use your &amp;quot;FORE! stones&amp;quot; whenever you want to instantly knock another horseman's ball back to the last hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win the game by being the first horseman to complete the 9th hole!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
