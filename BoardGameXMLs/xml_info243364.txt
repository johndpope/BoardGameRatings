							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dominions 5: Warriors of the Faith</name>
									
			<description>You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands and followers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the new additions in this iteration includes the ability to design your own Bless Effects, when you create your Pretender; a switch to real-time combat, this also makes the combat faster; winter weather for cold provinces and changes to the movement system; recruitment points is a new resource and draws on population and can be improved by building forts; and a lot more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary &amp;amp; Publisher website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
