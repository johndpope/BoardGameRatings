							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">View-Master Piramido</name>
									
			<description>Use one of the reels included to build the pyramid. Start at the base of the pyramid and reach the top to pick up a key to the underground labyrinth. Each player uses a reel to find their starting space and the path they have to take to get to the top. They use the dice to move to each space shown on the reels. The sphinxes can be placed to delay the players - needing to roll the number on the back of the sphinx to pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who has completed the route in the correct way, and if there is more than one who has done this, the one who arrived first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
