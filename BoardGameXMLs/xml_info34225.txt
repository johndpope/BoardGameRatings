			<description>In Promiseland players are a wandering tribal champion, exploring the land looking for a new homeland for their tribe.  The game is played with a standard deck of cards, a marker for each tribal champion, a marker for each tribe, a bunch of territory markers and three six sided dice.  A grid of face down cards are laid out before the players.  The players roll for their number of allowed actions each turn, moving their champion on the cards, looking at face down cards and sometimes taking them into their hands.  Cards may be used to duel other champions or collected to build a promiseland for the tribe.  Face cards may also be used for special actions, like taking an action in the middle of another players turn.  Once a player has collected enough cards for a promiseland, they must cross the board to get their tribe and bring them to the promiseland.  The first to accomplish this wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Itesser Ink sells only a rulebook, all other pieces must be provided by the purchaser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
