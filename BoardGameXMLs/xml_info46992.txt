			<description>[Note that this is not game of the same name by Mattel from 1991]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mandarin is a Halma or Chinese Checkers variation from jean du Poel and Historien Spielgalerie. As du Poel did with Go Bang Plus and Tangram Duett, he has created a new game based on the principles of a classic game and the result a new design that works very well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mandarin is played on a long-ish board, and each player places their figures (servants) on their home court. Figures can move one space or jump over others, with the goal to bring all of your pieces to the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game works well because of two additions. First, each player has a Mandarin that starts on a temple space and must end on his opponent's temple. If the Mandarin is hit, it returns to its home temple. Second, the game includes seven blockade discs. These are placed at the beginning of the game, and the rules offer four variations on how to treat them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
