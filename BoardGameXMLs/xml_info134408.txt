							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prospero Station</name>
									
			<description>Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humanity&amp;rsquo;s populated worlds and orbital stations have become dense and fractured beyond repair. The only thing keeping civilization from destroying itself is vows. Citizens are expected to take vows, and treat them with utmost seriousness. Vows are legally binding and entered into a central database. Those who break their vows are exiled to Prospero Station, to provide entertainment to the masses and perhaps prove themselves worthy of return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prospero Station is an enormously popular entertainment for billions of citizens. Individual seasons are carefully engineered amongst exiled vow-breakers with existing social ties &amp;ndash; when one citizens breaks a vow, it typically leads to others around them breaking their vows as well. This effect is contained by exile, and monetized through the show.&lt;br/&gt;The characters have been exiled to Prospero Station for the entertainment of the masses. Some of them are not who they appear to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
