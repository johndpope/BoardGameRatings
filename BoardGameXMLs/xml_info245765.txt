							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Puppers &amp; Doggos</name>
									
			<description>Puppers &amp;amp; Doggos are pack animals. In groups, they live under the dominant rule of the alpha dawg&amp;mdash;the supreme leader of them all. Yet, to survive and thrive, in a dangerous, unforgiving world, it necessitates the entire pack working together, as one. Such is the nature of puppers and doggos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Play&lt;br/&gt;Separate the &amp;quot;Alpha Dawg&amp;quot; cards and give one to each player, who is to set it face-up on the playing surface before him or her. This card is invincible and is the card all others shall be played around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the remaining deck, deal each player 5 cards and set it face down between all players. A single discard pile shall exist beside it. The player left of the dealer has first turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each turn, a player draws up to six cards (the hand limit) and then must play one card into his or her &amp;quot;pack&amp;quot; by placing it in any of 8 possible slots around the &amp;quot;Alpha Dog&amp;quot; (above, below, to the sides, or any of the four corners) that are open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a card is played, the action written on the card must be completed (if possible), and is only valid for cards played from the player's hand. The turn ends once the card's action has been taken. Play continues clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the deck exhausts, reuse the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to assemble a complete pack of 9 puppers and doggos, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
