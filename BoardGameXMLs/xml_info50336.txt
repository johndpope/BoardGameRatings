							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Test of the Samurai</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The peninsula of Wa is no place to visit. The land is poor, the people wary and suspicious. Yet this quiet backwater has been the site of strange disturbances - mysterious disappearances and omens of dire events to come. Why do the animals of Wa disappear, only to return a short while later? Who are the Blue Kumi bandits, and why are they so active? Why do the black geese fly into the Jusofu Mountains? And what fell creature lurks along the southern coast of Wa?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or does the stench of corruption emanate from the Celestial Bureaucracy itself? Could the danger, unchecked, grow great enough to doom all living creatures in Kara-Tur? Which clues will lead to the truth, and which are merely traps for the unwary...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test of the Samurai will take the players across the Wa peninsula and to the unknown land of Qui. They will encounter such legendary beasts as the feng huang (phoenix) and the chi'-lin (unicorn) as they attempt to discover the secrets of Wa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test of the Samurai is a scenario for the Oriental Adventures supplement to the AD&amp;amp;D game. It is set in Kara-Tur, the oriental world in the Forgotten Realms. Although Test of the Samurai follows the events of module OA6: Ronin Challenge, it is an independent adventure for five to eight characters of levels 6-9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
