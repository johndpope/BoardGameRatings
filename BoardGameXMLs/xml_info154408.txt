							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eccentria: The City of Trends</name>
									
			<description>In Eccentria, the players tell the story of a medieval city-state that savors the benefits of technology. Its neighborhoods, parks and city sectors are all built over a fine and innovative technological piece of hydraulic machinery. Its people live their pompous life in lavish luxury, as many trends among the society come and go.&lt;br/&gt;During this time, players find themselves, as overseers of a city sector, tasked with the duty of maintaining the city's prosperity. Thus, they're given a neighborhood in which they must expand.&lt;br/&gt;They must build buildings and invite prominent figures among the neighboring &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; to help. All this in turn affects the society as it constantly demands more and more. And as the trends change so does the path to victory and to total prestige.&lt;br/&gt;In this game each player has his own board to build buildings. As players deploy them with puzzle-like strategy, they affect the society -the core aspect- of the game that changes according to the player's decisions. By selecting specific buildings they also acquire the help of individuals that offer them versatile abilities.&lt;br/&gt;All these changes however may result into a trend change in the society and so do the victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;Whomever manages to be the most versatile in strategy and grasp the chance for success by earning the most victory points, will be the Grand Overseer and the victor of this game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
