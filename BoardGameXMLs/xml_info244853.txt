			<description>Emprise is an fast paced action economy combat card game that also doubles as a 52/54 card deck. By deploying troops and commissioning officers, your mission is to reinforce your position while repressing the enemies'. You will be forced into tense situations, sabotage your allies, rescue enemies, and sacrifice your own troops to win the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to earn victories by having enough reinforcements played at the end of your turn. However, each reinforcement can also be used for hand management, strategy denial, assaulting enemies' reinforcements, or controlling gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
