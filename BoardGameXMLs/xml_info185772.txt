							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">No King of England: A Solitaire Game of the Hundred Years War (1337-1453)</name>
									
			<description>BACKGROUND: NO KING OF ENGLAND is a semi-historical simulation of the Hundred Years War. The Game begins shortly after Charles IV of France dies in 1328. The Queen of England, Isabella of France, is unable to claim the French throne for herself, and has claimed it for her son, Edward III. France rejects the claim, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right that she did not possess. The Player represents the House of Plantagenet with the ambition of attaining control of France. As the Commander of English Forces, you must control a significant number of French Cities and Towns before the last Campaign Card is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the English Forces. The Player&amp;rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 10 French Cities and 12 French Towns before the last Campaign Card is Played. If the French control London and Portsmouth at the end of their Turn, the French win. If the last Campaign Card was played and Player does not control 10 Cities and 12 Towns, France Wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES: NO KING OF ENGLAND features lots of colorful game counters of various Combat Units including Nobles, Knights, Archers, Handgunners and Cannon. English Nobles will gather their Forces and move on the Map in a strategic manner along rout lines of key settlements (and Naval Lanes). Combat is resolved in a tactical manner that includes individual combat between Champion Knights and Archers. The game, also, includes an eventual appearance by Joan of Arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NO KING OF ENGLAND can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
