			<description>BADLAND is an atmospheric side-scrolling action adventure located in a gorgeous forest full of various inhabitants, trees and flowers. Although the forest looks like it&amp;rsquo;s from some beautiful fairytale, there seems to be something terribly wrong. The player controls one of the forest&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants to discover what&amp;rsquo;s going on. Through his journey he discovers astonishing amount of imaginative traps and obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BADLAND takes side-scrollers to the next level with its innovative physics based gameplay combined with the extremely beautiful atmospheric graphics and audio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BADLAND also features highly original local multiplayer for up to four players playing with the same device. The multiplayer is all about survival of the fittest with no rules in the BADLAND forest. It&amp;rsquo;s completely okay to push your rivals to spinning circular saws in order to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BADLAND has been designed specifically for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch and uses one-touch controls to give the player the best possible control mechanics. In addition, the graphics have been designed to fully use the Retina Display of these devices. The result is an highly immersive, addicting gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BADLAND is available on Apple App Store as a Universal App.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
