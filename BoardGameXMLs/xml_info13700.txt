							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dairyopoly</name>
									
			<description>A modification of Monopoly. Instead of Atlantic City streets, players purchase dairy farms. When a monopoly is achieved, instead buying houses and hotels, players can buy calves and cows. Instead of jail, players can be sent to dairy school. And instead of rail roads, we have milk routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone who likes Monopoly will probably like Dairyopoly. And anyone who likes Monopoly and is interested in dairies or cows will love it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
