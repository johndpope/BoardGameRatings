			<description>Amida (阿弥陀?) is a Japanese ladder climbing puzzle video game developed by Sofix and published by Coconuts Japan for the Game Boy exclusively in Japan. It was released in Japan on Oct 23, 1990 and never saw a release in another territory. The game requires players to navigate the main character safely across several pre-set bridges. Each bridge is composed of a number of obstacles that the character will blindly navigate into. The player can utilize an animated platform to redirect the main character as they move through the stage. The game features ten main levels. Each level is further sub divided into 10 separate levels (ex. 1-1, 1-2, etc) similar to other platform games like Super Mario Bros.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Amida (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
