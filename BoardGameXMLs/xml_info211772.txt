			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Gran March Interactive Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knight Colonel Jabbar began, All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. We will use the river to swiftly move forces with stealth under cover of night to a place that they are not expected. Those who defend the Hammer see the river as protecting their flank; we will use it as an avenue of attack. An amphibious landing, then swarm the walls before the defender can rally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Gran March Interactive adventure for [character levels] 2 - 8. Characters not well suited to amphibious and siege operations should request transfer to other units. This adventure should be played after GRM7-IN5: Hammerstrike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This adventure will be of particular interest to Active Duty Military and Veteran Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
