			<description>The brightly colored board makes this game look simple, but it is not. There are one red and one white dice, and a single 47-space track spiralling counter-clockwise and inward from the Start. The track includes 10 spaces where players draw Situation Cards that provide benefits or penalties. But the key to the game are the 21 spaces labelled Log Book and numbered 1, 2 or 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When landing on a Log Book space, the player rolls the dice twice more. The first red-white combination determines the section of the Log Book to consult (e.g. a 5 red, 2 white = section 52). A second roll, adding the two dice, gives the question number to be asked (e.g. a red 4 and white 3 = question # 7)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are not simple questions. The easier ones are True/False or multiple choice, but some ask for detailed knowledge of flying rules (e.g. &amp;quot;What is wrong with a pilot flying a heading of 200 degrees at an altitude of 3,500 feet?&amp;quot;, aeronautics (&amp;quot;Vfc/Mfc means ?&amp;quot;) and even history (&amp;quot;What date did the airforce take delivery of the first P47D?&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, the player must make it to the second-last square and answer two questions correctly, then roll doubles and answer two final questions. The rules say that Fly-In &amp;quot;can be a learning tool to help the aspiring pilot be more aware of the world of flying&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
