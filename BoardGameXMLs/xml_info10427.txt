							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bombshell</name>
									
			<description>It's a simple game, in which four bomb disposal soldiers (thick cardboard cut-outs) with names like &amp;quot;Major Disaster&amp;quot; try to defuse a bomb. The bomb is a red plastic shell in two parts with a spring inside. Players turn the top of the shell click by click, and eventually it will 'explode' and wound the soldier whose turn it is. Plastic bandages clip onto parts of the soldiers to show how wounded they are. Eventually the winner is the last soldier left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is quite rare; as weeks after its release, a bomb disposal man was blown up by an IRA bomb, so the game was taken off the shelves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
