			<description>Taking turns rolling the dice and moving their pieces accordingly, the players race to the center of the spirals. The first player to reach either Calcutta (on the red track) or Maskat (on the blue track) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a two player game, if a player lands on a black dotted space, he moves ahead four spaces. In a three to four player game, if a player lands on a black dotted space, he is considered on a &amp;lsquo;safety spot&amp;rsquo;. During a three to four player game, if a player is overtaken by another player, and not sitting on a safety spot, then that player must move his piece back to the nearest space with a black dot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who reaches either Calcutta or Maskat first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
