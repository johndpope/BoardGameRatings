							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from Colditz</name>
									
			<description>Back of the Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As World War II draws to its climax, you, an RAF pilot, are shot down over Dresden and after several abortive attempts to escape from other POW camps you are sent to Colditz, the ultimate challenge for would-be escapers. Heartless German soldiers patrol the battlements, indifferent to the bitter wind. No transgression of the rules, however slight, ever goes unpunished. But in the prison quarters, men from different Allied nations are plotting tirelessly, racking their brains to think of ever more devious ways to outwit the German Commandant and escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it is never easy and success is all too rare. You must succeed where so many others have failed, and escape from this apparently unassailable fortress. And, as if that weren't enough, you must then make your way through enemy territory until you reach the safety of either a neutral or Allied country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you bring off your escape from Colditz? Pit your wits against the Nazis and cross your fingers that luck is with you. You'll need it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game book, you are the hero. A die, a pencil and an eraser are all you need to set off on your adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
