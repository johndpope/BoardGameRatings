							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stars On Stripes Football Game</name>
									
			<description>Game was produced by Stars on Stripes Co, Incorporated , 406 McKenna Building, Pittsburgh, PA. On the box it says The GRANT Building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple simulation of an football game. The game has taken 14 years to develop, but it is so simplified you can learn to play it in just one minute.&lt;br/&gt;The equipment consists of two boards, three wooden dice, five wooden pegs, a &amp;quot;Bakelite&amp;quot; football and a 10 yard marker.&lt;br/&gt;First - Call your play (line plunge, off tackle, end run...)&lt;br/&gt;Second - Throw three dice and the results are always read from low to the high number. 5-4-1 will read 145.&lt;br/&gt;Third - look on the Signal chart to see what happens to the ball.&lt;br/&gt;The player must gain 10 yards in four downs or lose the ball.&lt;br/&gt;When the ball touches or goes over the Goal Line it is a Touchdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have the Game and played the game with my friend Mike about every night doing the football seasons, from 1943-1952.  I feel it was a fantastic game and very simple to play, and there were over 1500 different combinations of plays you could make, which made it a very realistic game.  If you would like a copy of the game, just e-mail me, you would need to suppy about 5 push pins, and a 10 yard marker, and marker for the football.  This game is very rare, as it was made in 1941, but to me still a great game, also you would need 3 dice.&lt;br/&gt;jdlaughead@gmail.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
