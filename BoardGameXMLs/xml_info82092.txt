			<description>Bases Loaded II: Second Season (Moero 3!! Pro Yakyuu '88 - Kettei Ban in Japan) is a video game for the Nintendo Family Computer released in 1988. It is the sequel to Bases Loaded (video game) and is continued by Bases Loaded 3. As opposed to the original, Bases Loaded II (and the sequels) was developed directly for Nintendo's consoles and never saw an arcade version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is the second installment of the Bases Loaded series.&lt;br/&gt;.....&lt;br/&gt;Bases Loaded II had a little faster play action then the original game, and the point of view once a ball was hit into play was also different. In Bases Loaded the view was from behind home plate, whereas in Bases Loaded II the view was either from the first-base line if the home team was at bat, or from the third-base line if the visiting team was at bat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One big improvement over the original Bases Loaded included the ability to modify the starting lineup and batting order for the user controlled team, and clearly defined pitcher's roles which were outlined clearly in the detailed rosters included with the instructional manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bases Loaded II: Second Season&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
