							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Narosia: Sea of Tears</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key elements of Narosia are to provide a fantasy setting that is both familiar and new. The familiarity is found in the common fantasy elements that have been a part of classic fantasy roleplaying for many years. This means many things to many people, but the goal is to take many of the tropes of fantasy gaming and put them into a context that makes some amount of sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurers are a lauded professions, dungeon crawling (including traps, greater challenges based on depth, etc.) is common source of adventure, magic has influence on the economy, and the gods walk the land. This is not the extent of Narosian gameplay, but illustrates the extent of the familiar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The uniqueness of Narosia as a setting lies in the history, the geography, and the integration of the familiar. The uniqueness of Narosia as a gaming supplement lies in focus on game utility. Every section of the material strives to present as much game-useful material as possible. Cultures, races, economy, skills, talents, perks, spellcraft, channeling, divine interaction, the good, the bad, and the ugly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
