							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">U.S. MAIL and CHECKERS</name>
									
			<description>Vintage (date unknown) board game where players spin and move along a pre-determined route on a map of North America. &amp;quot;The object of the game is to see which player can deliver Uncle Sam's mail the quickest and best.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game comes in a cardboard box about 17&amp;quot; x 9&amp;quot; with a great graphic of a speeding steam engine pulled train on the lid. In the lower left corner of the top of the lid is the Milton Bradley name and the number 4904. No date is present on the box or the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reverse of the game board is a yellow and black checker board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete directions from box lid:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPLEMENTS consist of four differently colored pieces, one for each player (these represent mail trains), and an indicator. {Spinner}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OBJECT of the game is to see which player can deliver Uncle Sam's mail the quickest and best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO BEGIN. The players draw lots for first play. Then each player chooses as his starting point one of the four cities: New York, Chicago, new Orleans or San Francisco. No two players can start from the same city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PLAY: Each player then puts his piece on the city of his choice and all spin the indicator {spinner} in turn. As soon as a &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; is spun, the player spinning it is entitles to start on his journey.&lt;br/&gt;The player may travel in either direction.&lt;br/&gt;Each circle, whether colored black, red, or green, counts as one space.&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player's piece, or &amp;quot;mail train&amp;quot;, falls exactly upon a green circle the player loses a turn.&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player's &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; falls exactly upon a circle city which is colored red, the player counts one to his score.&lt;br/&gt;No two players may occupy the same space. The last comer loses his turn.&lt;br/&gt;The player first to reach the city he starts from counts five extra to his score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO WIN. The player scoring the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
