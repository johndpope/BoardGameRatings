			<description>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 2005 video game which was released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Windows platforms. It is based on the film of the same name by Tim Burton. The game was released in the middle of the year to coincide with the release of the film in theatres. Most of the main cast from the film provided their voices for the game except for Johnny Depp, and James Arnold Taylor was used in his place as the voice of Willy Wonka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original Music for the video game was created by Winifred Phillips and produced by Winnie Waldron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first objective of the game is to help Charlie find money to buy a Wonka Bar to win a Golden Ticket. This is done at the beginning of the game while giving a tutorial of what controls will be needed during future stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main part of the game takes place in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory where the Oompa Loompas help the player through each level. By giving them commands Charlie finishes each challenge and progresses through the game. Each Oompa Loompa specializes in different tasks, such as electrical work, harvesting and welding. Candy is scattered throughout the levels and when collected it boosts Charlie's energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level is very similar to the plot in the 2005 movie. For example, Charlie must help Willy Wonka remove the gluttonus Augustus Gloop from the pipe above the chocolate river. He must roll the blueberry Violet Beauregarde to the Juicing Room and juice her. When Veruca Salt is thrown down the garbage chute, the player's objective is to follow her down the chute and save her from the incinerator. The last objective of the game is after Mike Teavee shrinks himself the player needs to fix the television-chocolate machine. Throughout the game the Oompa Loompas must help Charlie return the chocolate factory back to normal by fixing the mistakes that the self-indulgent children made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (video games)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
