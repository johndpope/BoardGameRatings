			<description>Prestige Dice Builder Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're in the Army NOW!  Maybe it was the draft, maybe it was your patriotism, but you've landed in the Army.  Your Mission is to beat the other grunts in your squad in a race to General.  Why worry about dying when you can level up in life, right?  How quickly can you gain prestige and become the General?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice to gain prestige each turn.  As they use the prestige to purchase cards they have more opportunities to gain prestige and level up to General.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
