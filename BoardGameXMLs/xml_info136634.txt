							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded</name>
									
			<description>Alien Shooter 2 - Reloaded is a modified version of the Alien Shooter 2 game. We started working on it right after release of AS2, taking into account the players' wishes. Well, here's the list of what we've done:&lt;br/&gt;1. Size of the full version installation file was reduced to 300 Mb, compared to 1Gb of the original Alien Shooter 2. Large installation file prevented users with slow connection from buying and downloading the game.&lt;br/&gt;2. Player upgrade parameters simplified. Now you don't need to develop separate skills for each weapon type, so you'll be able to complete the game using all the weapon types featured in it.&lt;br/&gt;3. Two new missions added. Now the game features 17 full levels.&lt;br/&gt;4. New individual shooting mode added - Gun Stand. You will use powerful military equipment to eliminate advancing enemy troops. As the game goes on, you will upgrade your weapon in different ways, and the right choice will let you win the battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
