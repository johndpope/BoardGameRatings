			<description>The outposts of Nexus Psi are mostly made up of Habtainers, modular prefabricated buildings which are freighted to new colony worlds in bulk. Their hypertanium and neocrete walls offered some protection against the Plague outbreak, but nowhere near enough. Now these settlements are little more than blasted-out hunting grounds for the warriors fighting over the world&amp;rsquo;s remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set contains ten assorted Urban terrain sprues and a connector sprue, allowing you to construct a range of buildings that will provide plenty of cover for a 2&amp;rsquo;x2&amp;rsquo; area. This set is compatible with all others in Mantic&amp;rsquo;s Battlezones Tile System range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 x Urban Sprue A&lt;br/&gt;    2 x Urban Sprue B&lt;br/&gt;    2 x Urban Sprue C&lt;br/&gt;    2 x Sci-Fi Accessory Sprue&lt;br/&gt;    1 x Connector Sprue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
