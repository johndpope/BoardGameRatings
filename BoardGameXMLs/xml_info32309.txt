			<description>In Kvikmyndaspili&amp;eth; (The Movie Game), players form teams (three in each team is best although two player teams can work) and act out scenes from a movie to make their team members guess which movie it is. The opposite team usually chooses the movie and one player of the team tries to act out the scene in less than two minutes. If the team members guess correctly, they can roll the dice and move along the track. Those who are deemed to act exceptionally well get The Oscar statue which gives +1 on a die roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
