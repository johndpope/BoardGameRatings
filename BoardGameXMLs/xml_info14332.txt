			<description>Richard Hadlee Limited Over Cricket Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the elements of a real-life game of one day limited over cricket.  Seems complicated.&lt;br/&gt;Lots of different dice, coloured counters etc &lt;br/&gt;Basic Rules for 2 players&lt;br/&gt;Players will be called Captains. The toss of a coin will determine who will elect to bat or bowl first. You are now in a position to set up the board to commence play as outlined in Diagram 1. The bowling captain selects any one of his five bowlers and places him at either end of the pitch in the position marked &amp;quot;bowler&amp;quot;. The batting captain selects any two of his eleven batsmen and places one on the pitch as &amp;quot;striker&amp;quot; and the other as &amp;quot;non-striker&amp;quot;. The striker is placed on the opposite end of the pitch to the bowler.&lt;br/&gt;CRITICAL ASPECTS OF PLAY TO REMEMBER a)Study the layout of the board prior to commencement of play&lt;br/&gt;b) The bowling captain moves the yellow deliveries counter prior to each delivery. c) The bowling area must be cleared before casting of the dice. d) The batsmen in play must change ends on the scoring of one or three runs. e) It is the bowling captain's responsibility to complete the scoresheet. f) The batting captain is responsible for recording his batsmen's runs on the individual batsman's scoreboard. Extras are recorded by the bowler on the scoresheet. g) The three blue dice i.e. bye, wide and runout, once selected must be cast with the umpire dice. h) Once a batsman is dismissed the batting captain must advise the bowling captain of the runs scored before removing scoring counters from the individual batsmen's scoreboard. i) If a game is shortened to a lesser number of overs than fifty, it is essential that all five bowlers bowl the same number of overs each. DISMISSALS Batsmen can be dismissed in four ways: 1. Bowled 2. Caught 3. L.B.W 4. Run Out&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
