			<description>From the website: &amp;quot;Vietnam - 1970&lt;br/&gt;After the defeat of the Japanese in the Pacific, America had to formulate a policy for Asia and the rest of the world. As allies of Ho Chi Minh's fighters against the Japanese, it is clear that the U.S. had several choices in Indochina. The decision to back the French, attempting to regain control of the region, led to America's eventual involvement, and all the consequences thereof. The war that ended in 1973 had led to all of the following: 57,661 U.S. servicemen dead, 2 million Vietnamese dead, the first military defeat for the U.S., internal turmoil in the U.S., distrust of the government and military, the devastation of much of Vietnam, and many other things. Is it possible the war could have turned out differently? It is up to you to decide...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now YOU can take over where &amp;quot;Nixon&amp;quot; failed! Send them 'Tin Soldiers' far away FROM the grounds of &amp;quot;Kent State&amp;quot; et al, and unto the &amp;quot;killing fields&amp;quot; where they belong. Using your 'A&amp;amp;A' pieces along with some others, then you too can attempt to &amp;quot;rectify&amp;quot; the situation in Southeast ASIA, where the &amp;quot;domino effect&amp;quot; concerning 'Communism' was at its height! SEE if the &amp;quot;Bombing Cambodia&amp;quot; Campaign would have truly been 'effective', OR perhaps an EXTRA couple 100-thousand 'Troops' might have &amp;quot;done the deal&amp;quot; instead. Here's your chance to &amp;quot;re-write&amp;quot; some gaming 'History', and either rise UP to the 'occasion', or 'go down' through &amp;quot;Defeat in detail&amp;quot; with THIS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
