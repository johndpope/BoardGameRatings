			<description>This game, simulating the American gridiron version of football, comes with a game board representing a football field, a football pin, two pins with colored heads to be used as a 10 yard marker, a dice cup and two dice. As in real football the object is to advance the ball over the opponents goal line for a score. Dice rolls are used for all aspects of the game. The kickoff, for example, travels a distance equal to 5 times the throw of the dice. The receiving player then rolls the dice for the return; if it's an even number, the ball is brought back the number of yards rolled, but if it's an odd number no gain is made. The offense may choose either a Line Plunge, an End Run, a Forward Pass, or a Trick Play. The greater a play's potential for gain, the greater risk of no gain or a loss of yards. A roll of doubles results in either a penalty or a turnover. When the time limit agreed upon by the players (before the game) is reached, the player who has the highest total score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
