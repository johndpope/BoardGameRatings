			<description>1862: Savage's Station (American Civil War in 3D)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game #16 of 19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Savage's Station is the fifteenth battle in the series and is the fifth in our Peninsula Campaign set of 1862. The Confederates are in a position to attack a Union rear guard at Savage's Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&amp;quot; - Wargame Shop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
