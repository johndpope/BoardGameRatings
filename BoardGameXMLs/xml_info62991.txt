							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Subbuteo Snooker</name>
									
			<description>This was one of the big sets of the mid seventies, where the box was also the pitch with the sides making a fence surround. Snooker Express contains &amp;quot;player figures, 15 red balls, 6 colour balls, 2 white balls, 1 triangle, 6 pockets, scoreboard and rule book&amp;quot;. The box states that billiards, snooker, pyramids and pool could be played. So it is basically snooker except you use a flicked player instead of a cue. The player did not stay on the pitch between flicks, and you placed him behind the cue ball before flicking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
