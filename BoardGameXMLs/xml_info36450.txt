							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harry Potters First Year Adventure</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Board game for 2-4 players. Help Harry recover the Sorcerers Stone.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player portrays a wizard who has several attributes, skills, and abilities which must be tracked during the course of the game: House Affiliation, Magic skill, Flying skill, Study skill, Chess skill, House Points, Clues, Wealth, Wand Type, Familiar Type, Chocolate Frogs, All Flavor Beans, and Other Possessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing board is broken into three segments - a straight track representing Dagon Alley, a loop representing Hogwarts, and a second straight track representing the Dungeon. Players move one space per turn on the straight segments and roll a die for movement on the center loop. Each space has a special table or tables that must be rolled on when a player enters the space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: The player with the most house points at the end of the game wins. The game ends when someone defeats Voldemort in the last space of the dungeon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
