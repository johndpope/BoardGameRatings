							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Head Hunters</name>
									
			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The natives known as the Jivaro leave deep in the Amazon. They are a very primitive group and very rarely seen. That could be due to what the tribe is also known for&amp;hellip;Head Hunting. The Jivaro are a very fierce, warlike people, who believe in taking the heads of their enemies to trap their souls and taking their power. The reputation for fierce fighting along with the head hunting discourages outsiders from knowingly entering their territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
