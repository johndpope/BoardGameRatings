							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiny Horsies: The RPG</name>
									
			<description>Tiny Horsies is a pen-and-paper RPG for parents and children that allows you to create horsie characters and live exciting adventures. You can be a Unicorn, a Pegasus, a Terra, or a Pegacorn. Wield magic, soar through the air, kick butt, charm others, talk to animals, or use a wide range of other talents in order to solve problems. Character creation is simple and even small children can create a character in a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is easy to pick up and play. No need to memorize tons of rules and a little coaching is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed for small children to play and enjoy the game. The game encourages personal interaction, imagination, and story-telling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book includes an introduction to RPGs, a guide for the Game Director, character creation rules, explanation of mechanics, a magic section, a guide for the Game Master, and an adventure to get you started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The source of the description is the publisher's website: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://relentlesslycreativebooks.com/?mbt_book=tiny-horsies-the-role-playing-game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://relentlesslycreativebooks.com/?mbt_book=tiny-horsies...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
