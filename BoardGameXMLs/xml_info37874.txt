							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartographer: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>In the mid-16th Century, Lord Date Masamune is consolidating his power in northeastern Japan. Masamune has decreed that the first person to document the vastness of this new kingdom will be honored with the title of &amp;ldquo;Shogun&amp;rsquo;s Cartographer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cartographer: The Card Game, players are ambitious mapmakers competing to complete a map of Masamune&amp;rsquo;s kingdom and win a place in the Shogun&amp;rsquo;s court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players hire Explorers and send them in one of the four cardinal directions to survey the lands and take notes toward what will eventually be a map of Masamune&amp;rsquo;s kingdom. Players may also hire Samurai, and Shinto Priests, who accompany the Explorers and help to fend off Oni, Kappa, Tengu, and other dangerous inhabitants of mythological Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explorers may also find treasure, be forced into a battle of wits with a sly Kitsune, or suffer the consequences of an earthquake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartographer: The Card Game is a free print-and-play card game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the game in the BGG Files section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartographer: The Card Game is a precursor to Cartographer: Vision of the Shogun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
