							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wolves 3: Civil War</name>
									
			<description>Large-scale battles have become a vestige of the past, depleting resources of conflicting parties. Settled space, where welfare and order had reigned, has become a cemetery for dead ships which is flooded with pirates and adventurists. Complete impunity, black market flourishing where gun and tech trade is on the move, arbitrariness and anarchy &amp;ndash; the Galaxy has become a real dangerous place. Events in the Universe and its habitant&amp;rsquo;s destiny are completely up to player&amp;rsquo;s choice and tactical decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Wolves 3: Civil War is a sequel to the popular 3D space RPG with deep strategy and tactical elements. Original large-scale scenario, closely tied with the first part of intergalactic epic helps the player influence the ongoing events and foreordain one of many endings. Free roam, free mission selection, free team forming &amp;ndash; the world of Star Wolves waits for its heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
