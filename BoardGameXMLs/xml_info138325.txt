							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bannockburn 1314</name>
									
			<description>The battle of Bannockburn in 1314 defended the Scottish nation and was a major milestone on the path to the independence. The  Scottish highlanders slaughtered the mighty English army that included more than 2000 knights and 15000 infantrymen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows to play the battle of Bannockburn as well as two predecessors: battle of Stirling (1297) and battle of Falkirk (1298). Players are given the command over English heavy cavalry or Scottish shiltrons and their goal is to eliminate units and leaders of the opponent and/or secure strategic targets of the army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missile range).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)&lt;br/&gt;2. Cavalry of player A attacks&lt;br/&gt;3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)&lt;br/&gt;4. Infantry of player A attacks&lt;br/&gt;5. Player B moves cavalry etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is determined by the terrain and the unit type. The battles are determined by comparing unit strength, which is modified by various factors (armor, charge, terrain, leaders etc.), and dice roll. Some interesting elements of game mechanics include  fatigue of units, morale and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes: three paper maps (2 made of two parts that should be duct-taped together or glued, on a single part), chits with units (punchable) and additional chits (for marking &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fatigue&amp;quot; modifiers) that need to be cut out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses the &amp;quot;Medieval&amp;quot; system of &amp;quot;Taktyka i Strategia&amp;quot;, implemented also in Grunwald 1410 (second edition) - revised and updated. Therefore it can be used with other games from the series. &lt;br/&gt;An english translation of the rules with scenario and examples is provided within the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of scenarios for this game was published in Taktyka i Strategia magazine:&lt;br/&gt;- Pięść Szkocji (No. 39)&lt;br/&gt;- Falkirk Stream (No. 38)&lt;br/&gt;- Falkirk Otimus (No. 37)&lt;br/&gt;- Szarża Gloucastera (No. 20)&lt;br/&gt;- Walna Bitwa (No. 20)&lt;br/&gt;- Strumień Bannock (No. 19)&lt;br/&gt;- Niebieska Linia (No 19)&lt;br/&gt;- Stirling Maximus (No. 16)&lt;br/&gt;- Kr&amp;oacute;lewskie Polowanie (No. 16)&lt;br/&gt;- Waleczne Serca (No. 15)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
