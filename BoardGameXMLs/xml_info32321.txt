							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Godzilla</name>
									
			<description>Godzilla was published in the Swiss gaming zine &amp;quot;AHA&amp;quot; #88/1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a 10x10 board. One player plays with Gozilla, the other one plays with 6 people/tokens from Tokyo. Each of the 6 Tokyo tokens has a different colour and wears an imaginary weapon of the same colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game begins, the Tokyo player places 40 houses, 10 monster-immune houses and his 6 tokens on the board. Gozilla waits outside the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gozilla player is dealt 6 cards showing the 6 colours of the weapons. He is immune against 4 of the 6 weapons and to document which ones, he secretly keeps 4 of the 6 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn, the Tokyo player must move 3 of his tokens by 1 space, the Gozilla player moves Gozilla by 2 spaces. Gozilla can destroy houses, but not Tokyo tokens or monster-immune houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tokyo player wins, if he can move one of his 2 tokens with a &amp;quot;sharp&amp;quot; weapon on the space where Gozilla is. Gozilla wins, if he can destroy 15 houses before he is killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
