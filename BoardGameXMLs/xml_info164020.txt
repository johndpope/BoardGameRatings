			<description>Queen Anne has given her precious gems to The Duke of Buckingham, with whom she is secretly in love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Cardinal Richelieu, the most powerful man in France, is aware of the Queen&amp;rsquo;s affections and has convinced the King to hold gala fete where the Queen may show-off her dazzling gems &amp;ndash; a gift from the oblivious King Louis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In desperation, the Queen calls upon her valiant Musketeers and loyal servants to come to her aid &amp;ndash; to find and return the gems to her before Richelieu and his nefarious spies can find them and reveal her to the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Musketeers: The Search for the Queen's Gems is a social deduction/bluffing 24-card microgame where 4-8 players assume an alliance on one of two sides &amp;ndash; the Cardinalists or the Musketeers, each vying to outwit, outmanoeuvre and out-bluff each other to be the first group to collect together all four of the Queen&amp;rsquo;s gems and return them safely to the Queen, or to present them to the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
