							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic Rings III</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For whatever reason, magic rings have become even more popular with players as of late (hmm). Don't let them down. Give them a new ring every game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic Rings I features 50 new magic rings for use with D20 fantasy settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ring of Allegiance (Good)&lt;br/&gt;This ring can only be worn by a creature of good alignment. This ring functions as a ring of protection +2 with a couple of extra bonuses. The wearer becomes protected as though under the effects of a permanent protection from evil spell (as described in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons? Player's Handbook, Third Edition). In addition to this the ring keeps track of evil aligned creatures slain by the wearer. Once the wearer has dealt the killing stroke to a total of 20 evil aligned creatures the ring will bestow a one-time bonus of 3000 experience points. This ring will bestow 1d4 negative levels upon any non-good creature that attempts to wear it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
