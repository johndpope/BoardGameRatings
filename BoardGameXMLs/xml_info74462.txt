			<description>[User Summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brandish 4 is another release of Brandish VT, but it does have improved graphics and audio, and two new characters (in addition to the three that were available in Brandish VT). Both of the new characters appear in the original game, but they were not previously playable. In Brandish 4, each of these new characters gets a chapter dedicated to them. The two characters are:&lt;br/&gt;Mermelade, the sorceress, who can transform into a cat. &lt;br/&gt;Garahad: a master of hand-to-hand combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
