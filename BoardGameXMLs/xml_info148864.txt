			<description>A traditional Dutch game from the Zeeland region, very similar to the version of the Danish-Norwegian game Gnav played with wooden pawns rather than cards, of which it is a derivative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set consists of 42 wooden pawns with a number or picture hidden under the base. Each of the 21 subject occurs twice: the numbers from 0 to 12, the trumps &amp;quot;Rider&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bird&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Cat&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Inn&amp;quot; above the numbers, and &amp;quot;Whitebread&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Mug&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pot&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Jester&amp;quot; below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player recieves a number of point tokens. In each round, each player draws one pawn from a bag and secretly looks at its value. Then the players in order decides whether to keep their pawn or trade it with the following player. If that player holds a trump, special rules for each trump applies, otherwise the pawns are traded. At the end of the round, the player with the lowest valued pawn loses one of their point tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who runs out of point tokens is out of the game. The last remaining player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not known exactly when this little known variant first appeared. It must be after the the wooden pawn variant of Gnav &amp;ndash; originally a card game &amp;ndash; gained popularity as an effect of a ban on playing cards by the pietist king Christian VI of Denmark-Norway (1730&amp;ndash;1746). On the other hand it probably did not happen very much later, as it lacks a couple of the developments otherwise separating Gnav from other games in the Cuccu family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
