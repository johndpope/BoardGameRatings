							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Downtime Spells</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Everyday Sort of Magic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fireball and lightning bolt are impressive spells, but there&amp;rsquo;s something of a bias in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game towards spells that can be used in combat. And this makes sense, because, after all, combat is at the heart of the game&amp;rsquo;s mechanics. But some groups like to spend some time exploring what their characters do between adventures, using, among other methods, the downtime rules from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Campaign. This book provides a selection of 14 spells specifically designed to be cast during a character&amp;rsquo;s downtime, allowing spellcasters to work powerful magic by devoting time and effort to it in their downtime. In this book, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Spells that make the downtime work of other characters more fruitful.&lt;br/&gt;    Spells that let you convert one type of capital into another, cheaply and easily.&lt;br/&gt;    Spells that let you predict and even change upcoming events.&lt;br/&gt;    Speed construction, which can hurry the construction of rooms and buildings.&lt;br/&gt;    Toil twin, which creates an illusory copy of you that can work as you do other things.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
