			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much is known amongst the scholars of the Ordo Xenos about the alien race of the Eldar. The Ordo has extensive files on each of the major Craftworlds of the Eldar, and although recorded instances of war with the Eldar far outweigh those of collaboration, the Eldar are unusual in that they have been known to fight alongside Humanity in pursuit of a common goal. Unlike aliens such as the ferocious Tyranids or implacable Necrons, Eldar can play far more of a role in a game such as Inquisitor; they are far from mindless brutes to be hunted down and killed. The Eldar likely to be encountered in Inquisitor will be warriors and outcasts, following their own agendas and no doubt deeply embroiled in the events portrayed by the tabletop game itself. This article aims to facilitate the usage of Eldar characters in Inquisitor, and covers everything from reasons to include Eldar in the storyline in the first place, to the esoteric weaponry and skills that mark them apart as the powerful and enigmatic aliens they truly are.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A PDF supplement for Inquisitor covering rules for the Eldar. This was originally published as an article in Fanatic but was later made available as a separate PDF for free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
