			<description>ARPIA2 (also known as &amp;quot;Arpia 2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ARPIA II&amp;quot;, ) is a massive EV Nova plug-in, featuring graphics by some of the most eminent graphic designers of this community (some created EVN years ago, others are creating games of their own). ARPIA2 adds three major storylines woven in parallel: the Regular member, the Shadow Warrior and the Public Figure.&lt;br/&gt;In ARPIA2 you get to choose your path. But beware: one choice can change the future, and the future holds many surprises Do you have what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first, it is a new system made available once you get to know Arpia (if you succeed in finding it). It soon becomes a gold mine for new ships and outfits. Though that is not the only gold mine. Due to this new application of their properties, the market in Gwaark Bacteria has taken massive proportions, and there is money in it It has always been everyone's dream to fight off entire fleets by oneself, to become a big-time rich trader, to do covert ops and to know everyone, everywhere. Well, here's your chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Release Announcement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
