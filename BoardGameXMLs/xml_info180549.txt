							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Focal Point: The Complete Game Master&#039;s Guide to Running Extraordinary Sessions</name>
									
			<description>Publisher summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of roleplaying is the gaming session, that point when everyone is gathered around the gaming table &amp;mdash; and exactly when so many of your GMing skills are most needed. To the best of our knowledge, there&amp;rsquo;s never been a system-neutral book focused on running great sessions. Until now. Focal Point is that book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of Focal Point&amp;rsquo;s authors is a veteran GM with years of experience, and each of them excels at a particular aspect of GMing. John Arcadian is an entertainer, a GM who loves props and drawing his players into the game world. Walt Ciechanowski is a storyteller, an adventure-writer who makes his living in the RPG industry. Phil Vecchione is a facilitator, an organized GM who specializes in helping his players work well together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three roles &amp;mdash; entertainer, storyteller, and facilitator -- are at the core of Focal Point. From building &amp;ldquo;sets&amp;rdquo; for your gaming table, to using flowcharts to structure your adventures, to making sure everyone in your group feels comfortable during play, this guidebook addresses everything that goes into running an extraordinary gaming session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
