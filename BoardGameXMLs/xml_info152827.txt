							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assemblage of Eternity</name>
									
			<description>Assemblage of Eternity brings the competitive feel of fighting games to the traditional gaming arena, and much like its digital counterpart AOE is designed for 2-4 players in either 1v1, 2v2, Scramble, or Tag modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After selecting their favorite combatant, each player attempts to reduce his opponent's life to zero before going to time. The game is, at its foundation, a strong game of rock/paper/scissors with the advantage of being able to mitigate and reverse engineer your opponent's capabilities. Assemblage of Eternity is built to give players who know everything about the game a huge advantage and, like its counterpart, a slim chance at losing against an opponent who just pushes buttons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game you'll find yourself learning your character, finding effective set-ups for their Ultras, and learning how to play them better. Some characters are harder to play than others, so the game includes set-ups, bios, and strategies to help new players, as well as suggested match-ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
