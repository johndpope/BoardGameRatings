			<description>Volume III in the Wild Magic Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A One Act Living City Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet another ordinary night in Ravens Bluff, or so you thought. Since the War began, those with abilities and experience have been assigned different jobs throughout the city. For whatever reason, all of you were assigned to work together as a group. You were asked to monitor the merchant district of Ravens Bluff and keep your eyes out for anything that might be considered to be a threat to the city. After you finished your patrolling for the day, you decided to have the evening meal at a convenient, but reputable establishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
