							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Love Star</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the known population of the 12 Colonies reduced to a few tens of thousands of people, and spirits low, it is imperative that families stay together, new romances bloom, and broken hearts are mended. The crew of the Rising Star remind their fellow ragtag fugitives that they possess a power the Cylons can never understand: the power of love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stories&lt;br/&gt;Unlike real-world cruise ships, the crew of the Rising Star mingle pretty freely with the passengers. For each session, there should be one storyline that&amp;rsquo;s mostly about the crew, and two that involve visiting passengers from some other ship in the fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolving the major dilemma in any storyline generates a bonus die that can be used in a key conflict in another, not-yet-resolved storyline, provided that there&amp;rsquo;s a character who can plausibly bring something they&amp;rsquo;ve learned from the earlier storyline into the later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
