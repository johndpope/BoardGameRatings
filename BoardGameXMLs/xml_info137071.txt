							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tegulis Romanis</name>
									
			<description>In Tegulis Romanis, players play as the influential families who built Rome from the ground up, working to build Rome into a glorious metropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the players will lay tiles onto the random boards which make up the landscape on which Rome was built. Each tile shows a building, which will belong to the player when played on the board but is not considered &amp;quot;built&amp;quot; until it has its required resources.  Resources are on the back-side of the buildings (the players must decide which buildings to not play so they can place resources), but resources on the board have no &amp;quot;owner&amp;quot; so they can be used by buildings belonging to any player.  Once a building has its resources it is now &amp;quot;built&amp;quot; and gains the owner points or special abilities (the player may now build in the mountains, the player draws extra tiles, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players each have the same starting pile of tiles, with another set of &amp;quot;advanced tiles&amp;quot; available to any player, most of which actually require other buildings as &amp;quot;resources&amp;quot; themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
