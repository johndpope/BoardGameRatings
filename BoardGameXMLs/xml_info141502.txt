Your objective: Achieve total military supremacy or face the bitter consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be able to maintain the morale of your troops while guiding them through 20 different campaign maps and guarantee the success of your entire armed forces? Within &amp;quot;Shadow of the Emperor&amp;quot; your strategical and logistical abilities will be put to the ultimate test, in a bid to secure total victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Lead imperial armies in a glorious campaign of conquest across 40 turn-based battle scenarios, each with its own unique objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Your arsenal: 64 different weapon systems including, army, aircraft and naval attack units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Spectacular, fast-moving, texture-mapped, 3-D graphics take you right to the heart of the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Build roads, fortifications and magnetic rail tracks. Plan your infrastructure carefully to provide vital support to your fighting units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
