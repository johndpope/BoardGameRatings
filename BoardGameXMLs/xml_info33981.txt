			<description>Mooks, Mobs, and Men of Honor is a PDF-only release for the .45 Adventure: Crimefighting Action in the Pulp Era game. It contains over 55 pre-generated characters (pulled from all three of our current titles) with backgrounds to help players get started right away. The backgrounds are all centered around the city of New Commerce, the fictional mid-western, US city where many of the heroes and villains of .45 Adventure: Crimefighting Action in the Pulp Era do battle. But don't think they can only be used there. Many of the groups have back stories that can put them anywhere in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And to top it off, there are previews of two new half-grade archetypes (Mook and Graduate Student) that will appear in the next book to be released The Gargoyle: Death Soldiers of the Jade Hood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    .45 Adventure: Crimefighting Action in the Pulp Era&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
