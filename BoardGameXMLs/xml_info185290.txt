							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Victory by Any Means Campaign Guide (Second Edition): With a Purpose</name>
									
			<description>With a Purpose is the next supplement book for the modular Victory By Any Means campaign system with a focus on objectives and goals. Campaigns have a tendency to focus on goals and exclude the story element. This expansion has a more granular scope, focusing on a commodore instead of a supreme commander. Instead of an open ended campaign, players are working to achieve victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is done by defining the major objectives given to the players from their central government. Additionally, players will receive high priority missions that need to be completed. Campaign Moderators will have more freedom to explore the motivations of an empire, becoming a true 5x game (eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate, eXplore, and eXplain). With A Purpose supports a number of players and team play for those players who wish to try cooperative campaign games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since players represent low level commanders than a typical Victory by Any Means campaign, the scope of the degree is altered. Campaign turns represent shorter periods of time and each ship and ground unit is all the more precious to pull off the work given from their central command. The area will simply have more territory to explore as these campaigns include more minor systems that may exist between all the important campaign worlds in a normal game. Players must be ever vigilant of their actions and careful to control the amount of tension in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
