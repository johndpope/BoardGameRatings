Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hottest new, next-gen MMO, Vital Hearts Online, is poised to take over the world.  But is some other dark agenda in play?  Who's behind the murders in Kansai Science City?  Is there any substance to the fringe warnings of the coming singularity?  Who programmed the strange side-quests in the beta release of the game, and to what end?  Just what is the secret at the heart of this matter?  In Vital Hearts: Tabletop RPG of Augmented Reality players - trapped in an MMO - take on a dual role: both as an avatar in a virtual fantasy, and a character in near-future japan.  Level up with online quests to delve deeper into the virtual world, then investigate the mysteries and murders that are all too real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
