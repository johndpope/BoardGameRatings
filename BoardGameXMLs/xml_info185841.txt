							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Parasite Project</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human territories are being threatened by an insidious enemy, one that the modern civilization invited without any suspicions. In the sprawling electronic jungle of technological devices, perfectly camouflaged in the environment filled with TV-sets, computers, and microwave ovens, a new species is born. The Parasite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many respects the game uses a traditional narrative approach to gaming.  However, The Parasite Project uses an unusual system to balance play-each character uses a stopwatch and must &amp;quot;run time&amp;quot; when they are performing narration.  Prior to the game, an &amp;quot;Incubation Time&amp;quot; is established.  If a player exceeds the &amp;quot;Incubation Time&amp;quot; they are overcome by the parasite and they are out of the game.  The game also utilizes Hope Tokens that can be gained and spent to influence the narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
