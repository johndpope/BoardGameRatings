			<description>Enduro Racer is an arcade game from Sega. It was released in 1986 with either a stand up cabinet with handlebars or a full sized dirt bike on the cabinet itself. Some said it is essentially the dirt version of Hang-On, hence using the similar engine and PCB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player rides the dirt bike through five stages and must avoid other riders as well rocks and trees. They can also jump over them with assist from the logs. The game's most definitive feature was the 'Wheelie' feature that allowed players to pull up the handlebars on the cabinet to perform the wheelie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sega Master System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed for the Sega Master System in 1987 and later released for the Wii's Virtual Console. The player races on motorcycle tracks against both cars and motorcycles earning one point for each one that is passed. Points can be used to buy new parts or for repairs. The game also uses an isometric view. The Japanese version has more tracks and objects like people and trees than the American and euro releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was also released on a number of contemporary home computer platforms, such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST. It was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on December 15, 2008 and in Europe on January 9, 2009 at a cost of 500 Wii Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Enduro Racer&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
