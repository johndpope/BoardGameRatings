			<description>A great economical card game from the turn of the century.  The instruction sheet reads &amp;quot;The best game since PIT&amp;quot; on the front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are passed between players as players try to collect complete circles of related society members.  Cards have comical names of people within a society, they could call them cliques rather than circles. (examples: Mrs. Get-there, from Butte, Mr. Clymer from Denver and Major But-in (the character who disturbs the social gatherings))  Each circle has a monetary value associated which is paid to the player who collects the entire circle and turns it in to the bank.  The player with the most counters (Counters represent $50,000 each) at the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are very specific and proper etiquette is enforced!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typical of the time, early games were designed with religious backgrounds encouraging high sense of morals and etiquette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
