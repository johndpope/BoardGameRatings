			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an expansion and needs Incredible Courage 100 Days Quatre Bras and Incredible Courage 100 Days - Ligny in order to be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incredible Courage 100 Days &amp;ndash; Waterloo continues a 4 game set that explores Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s 100 Days campaign that ended his reign and finished his aspirations as emperor of France. This game expands on the feature set started with the Incredible Courage 100 Days - Quatre Bras. One of the expanded items is doctrine specific rules for the various combatants. The Anglo-Allies had some specific doctrinal distinctions that must be presented to the players. There are also now cavalry regiment counters, in addition to the infantry battalion counters. And there are now leaders that have some special capabilities in the areas of handling infantry, cavalry, or artillery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 7 scenarios included in this game and 3 of them are on the smaller side in terms of unit density.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These games feature the final map artwork of Rick Barber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
