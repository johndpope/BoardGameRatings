			<description>Story: Willi the coach hurries the team along the show-jumping course. To become fit, the players race to be the first to reach the finish line with his three members. But the trainer not only looks at his stop watch, he also has integrated some obstacles. Only a player who reacts quickly and keeps his nerves can win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a board (two-sided) with an obstacle course and a shortcut, three team members per player, a die, and a timer. The timer gets started, and the active player tries to race his pieces along the track. He rolls the die, moves one of his characters the full amount, rolls the die again, moves the same or a different character, and so on until the time runs out. Then the next player gets to act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The track depicts barrels which act as obstacles; no player can land on such a space. The characters of other players are either treated as obstacles, or moved back to the next free spot if somebody lands on their space. The finish space needs to be reached with an exact die roll. The player who first finishes the race first with all his characters wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
