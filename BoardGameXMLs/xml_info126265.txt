			<description>How The Game Works&lt;br/&gt;The Heart of Sut is set in a Steampunk Universe. Each player is given a secret objective. The game continues until one or more of the players have achieved their objective. Taking it in turns each player draws the next card on their adventure. If the group fails to meet the challenge laid down in front of them they must retrace the steps and take another route. Along the way they can collect some strange and exotic equipment. Can they find the Airship to help them in their travels or find uptodate victorian clockwork technology? Only the cards will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given a Character that must complete an objective. The objectives are not publically known and are as follows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Cultist - One of the other players must be killed.&lt;br/&gt;     Greed - Must collect 40 000GP&lt;br/&gt;     Horder - Must get a unique set of items&lt;br/&gt;     Journalist - Must collect five items from different sets.&lt;br/&gt;     Hunter - Must collect a trophy from each different species of creature&lt;br/&gt;     Adventurer - The group must find the artifact (get to the end of the roads) with no other clear winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start of Game&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt four cards off the equipment deck. They may spend up to 4000GP on the equipment they have drawn and must discard the rest. Each player signifies what they have equipped by placing it on the table in front of them. Equipment usual increases the attack strength of the character. The player with the highest attack strength is given the title of Watchman and goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking a turn&lt;br/&gt;The Watchman turns over the first road card. The road cards contain one day event and one night event. Every player is expected to take part in the day event first then the watchman completes the night event alone. When both events have been completed the Watchman announce the player to their right is the new Watchman. All characters are now allowed to reequip, trade between themselves and use items. When this is finished the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If both road events are completed succesfully the card is placed down in the middle of the table to signify they are on their journey. If they fail the road card is discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Events&lt;br/&gt;Day Event: This can be anything from a Shop to a toll bridge to a raid by Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;Night Event: This can be a travelling sales man, a theif or a night raid by Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters&lt;br/&gt;There are seven different species of Monster. These are broken down into three different classes. To defeat a monster you must have an attack value greater then the monster's. If you defeat the monster you get his body as a trophy and one random equipment as loot. If you cannot defeat him alone someone else can help you but all loot is discarded. If you are unable to defeat a monster you loose a peice of equipped equipment. If you have no equipment left you die and are out of the game (Causing the Cultist to win). No one can fight more then one monster a turn. There are no limits to the number of trophies a player can carry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment&lt;br/&gt;Equipment falls in to five types Hat, Coat, Weapon, Gadget and One Shot. An equipment set is made up of a specified Hat, Coat, Weapon and Gadget. Hat, Coats and Weapons increase the characters attack value. Gadgets are usually useable by the whole group once one person has it equipped.  No one can fight more then one monster a round with the exception of One Shots. One Shots can be used once and then must be discarded. One Shots can be played on the monster or the character fighting the monster by anyone. The player can have at most four equipment cards in his hand unless he has a gadget that allows him to have more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money&lt;br/&gt;Every Monster Trophy and Equipment card has an amount of GP in the bottom right corner of the card. When the characters are at a shop then can discard either equipment or monster trophies for cards off the equipment draw pile at the apropriate cost. No change is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
