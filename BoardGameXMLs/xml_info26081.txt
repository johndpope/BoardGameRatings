			<description>The original title of this cycling game is about a gear that can be selected on a bike. This French game appeared at the end of the '80s. The game contains 4 double sided big boards representing a Tour de France &amp;eacute;tappe on each one. It's played with 2 dice, 40 tactics cards, 32 mountain cards, 26 sprint cards and 30 rouleur cards. Every player gets a team of 3 plastic cyclists. In the beginning every player gets a number of tactical cards. Movement is decided by the dice and influenced by the cards. In the mountains the number rolled by the dice is divided by two. Cyclists can also encounter a flat tire (caused by rolling two 1's with the dice), if this happens to the team leader, he can be helped by a teammate if necessary. Winner is the player who scores best in the overall classification. There is also a mountain prize for the player who has the best climber in his team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
