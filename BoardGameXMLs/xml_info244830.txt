			<description>&amp;quot;Now I shall haunt you, until you know the wrath of the flames, for this is my vengeance.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Giant was told one year ago where his life would take him, he would not have believed it&amp;hellip; and no one would have even heard of the goblin-slaying Giant. The Giant was a peaceful farmer who was content with his life, he bothered no one, and no one bothered him. That all changed after that one cursed winter&amp;hellip; when the goblin raid started from the Caves of Doom &amp;ndash; it was that same night when the goblin's fury torched 1,000 straw huts, and the air was filled with fear. It was from that same fire and pain that a hero and a legend was formed, the Giant who stood against evil and returned the favor twice over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expansion 1: The Giant&lt;br/&gt;1.    In this expansion we added one more hero and one more hero board which allows a total of 5 participants &amp;ndash; which of course intensifies the game experience and allows more people to participate.&lt;br/&gt;2.    In order to improve the game experience we added a team of sub-heroes called &amp;quot;Allies&amp;quot;. Each hero can convince (by increasing his faith) an ally to join him to his journey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The main advantage of this expansion is the variety it gives to the game.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such as: new cards, new tactics, extra accessories and even extra enemies.&lt;br/&gt;Also there are special &amp;quot;Allies&amp;quot; dice that improve significantly the hero performance. &lt;br/&gt;Beyond that &amp;ndash; the hero does not fight alone anymore; he has a team of fighters who add interest to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
