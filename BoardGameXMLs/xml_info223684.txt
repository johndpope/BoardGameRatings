							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunting for Gloomwing</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a proud member of the Clay Coyote Tribe, which roams the misty plains of Cloudsward. Recently, your tribe has fallen on hard times due to sudden scarcity of food. This has resulted in both hunger and illness claiming the lives of several tribemen, including Chieftain Oluga Trollbane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the absence of a chieftain, the elders of the tribe were tasked with coming up with a plan that could turn the tides. They decided that only by defeating Sovgrindlar &amp;ndash; Gloomwing &amp;ndash; had the tribe hope of surviving. The reason was two-folded: 1) Gloomwing was directly responsible for the sudden diminishing population of prey, and 2) selling dragon parts to the civilised world outside of Cloudsward would bring the tribe more than enough coin to pay food, medicine, and other useful resources to last the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
