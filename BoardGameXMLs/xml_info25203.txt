			<description>This game is played on a simplified map of Naples. The board shows 4 administration offices, about 100 houses of 4 different categories and clearly marked streets and places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a headquarter, where his actions begin. He will hire some tokens, send them out to claim a street, a place or occupy a house. Houses are the only possibility to earn money, but money is much needed, because every location must be defended (with money) against hostile take-overs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hiring new tokens is always possible, but the more money you collect, the more they cost.  Streets and places are needed to accelerate the movement of the tokens and can only be used by their owners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is the player who occupies 3 administration offices first &amp;ndash; or 4, if a longer game is desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
