			<description>From the adventure introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr Johnson wants a word, simple data snatch and a bit of investigative work, nothing new on the streets of Seattle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However he&amp;rsquo;s hiring Shadowrunners and if one things for certain when a Shadowrun is involved not all will be quite as it seems. Question is not &amp;lsquo;is there something interesting going on&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; just what&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the authors webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for and first run at GenconUK 2005 where at least 5 tables ran. Since run once at Conception 2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The groups at GenconUK did well, while the group at Conception did very well indeed completing the mission alive in under 3 hours. So far all the groups I have run this for have done a good job of working things out and one team had a go at the big bonus available despite the risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although extra sourcebooks are not required if you run this away from a convention setting having the sourcebooks mentioned is certainly beneficial so the players have the time to read up on one or two things if they don't know already. In a convention setting you won't have the time. No experience of Shadowrun is required but one or two players that have played a fair bit including some of FASA's campaign stuff from some years ago does help on the realising what certain things mean. If you have less experienced players make sure you explain just how important certain names are when they come up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
