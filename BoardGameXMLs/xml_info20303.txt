							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Silverton: New Mexico Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Expansion kit for the original edition of Silverton by Two Wolf. The primary addition is the small paper map adding mines and tracks for New Mexico. Also added are cardboard tokens, especially for Copper, cards to go with the new mines (and a few more disaster cards) and a new price chart.  Finally, there are new scenarios to be used with the map addition, including a scenario which uses only the New Mexico map and new optional rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The substance of this expansion kit was folded into the main package for the second edition of Silverton by Mayfair Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Silverton (Two Wolf version only, Mayfair version includes this expansion)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
