			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game that's meant to capture the style &amp;amp; tone of films likes The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity and Apollo 18.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first two rounds of play, everyone creates cameras, using them to introduce locations or characters that will appear frequently in the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In subsequent rounds of play, each player can direct an event: during this, a deck of cards is used to pace the event, with red cards equating to light or positive situations and black cards equating to dark or negative ones. The director of the scene has a small hand of cards to hand out to the other players, facing their characters with an appropriate situation as he does so, but the director can make use of the cameras in the scene to 'edit' the footage with cuts, pans and zooms, changing the cards he has and therefore the situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a reciprocal process in action, in that players decide how their characters respond to the situation they are dealt and this decision feeds back into the cards that are available in later events, weighting them towards light or dark content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
