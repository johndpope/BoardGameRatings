			<description>From the Chaosium website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle the Mythos Against the Horror of War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are four longer scenarios set in and around the Second World War. Each scenario offers a distinct setting and location though, roughly speaking, each gives players at least a glimpse of the Mediterranean Sea. There is no plausible way (we can see) of linking the scenarios into a campaign, but this is the idea: the situation of war is ideal for one-shot scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International conflict is a background particularly conducive to Mythos horror as the urgencies of survival in war create opportunities to both mask and heighten the sanity-blasting effects of contact with the Mythos. These scenarios avoid battle-fronts, but place the investigators in risky situations where their own decisions determine success or failure, life and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each scenario contains pre-generated characters for easy playability, or, for those who prefer not to use them, an indication of the scope for role-playing the scenarios provide. The scenarios are variously designed to play out in one, two, or three sessions of play though the keeper will be a better judge of how long they might take for their group. There are separate contents pages at the beginning of each scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
