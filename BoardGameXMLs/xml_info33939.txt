							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Secret Game of the Flower Fairies</name>
									
			<description>Based on the illustrations and poems of Cicely Mary Barker, this beautifully crafted game transports players into the enchanted world of Flower Fairies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to travel around the board from start to finish, passing through each of the four seasons, and arriving at the finish with a complete set of four cards representing the season which each of the four players represents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may only collect cards of their own season.  Movement happens based on the roll of a large wooden die, the instructions written on several special squares, or by playing cards out of the players hand.  The cards can only be used once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the first player reaches home, they count the numbers on the unused cards in their 2-10 pile.  The other players are allowed one more turn to get home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They may try to continue if unsuccessful, but every turn costs them one point from the cards they hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who gets home with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
