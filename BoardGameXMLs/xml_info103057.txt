			<description>A card game with a little knowledge thrown into the mix. Each player starts with 10 counters (not provided).&lt;br/&gt;Each player draws a card and places it in front of him and he contributes 1 counter to the Pool, and then the next player does the same, and so on until all the cards have been dealt and arrayed in front of each player. Now players (in turn) should look around the table and see if another card can be connected to one of his, to form the name of an Animal, Fish, Town, Bird, etc. As the number of cards to use goes down, it gets harder to come up with a right name.&lt;br/&gt;Players are awarded points (in the form of counters from the Pool) and you can play a pre-sert number of games. The player with the most counters wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
