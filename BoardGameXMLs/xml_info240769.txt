			<description>Tal'Vos is a deck building/card building game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes on the role of Admiral for their noble houses Airship and battles it out with their opponents til only one is left standing and is crowned emperor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features strategic, fast passed back and forth action seen in many CCGs, as well as deck building and card building mechanics where instead of adding new cards to their deck, players instead upgrade their cards by sleeving in clear transparent upgrades over the cards they already have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players set their speed and select an opponent to attack and play cards back and forth into either offense or defense pools. Then they compare statistics and if the attacker manages to meet or beat the defenders agility, they deal damage! After the combat round, players purchase clear upgrade cards to sleeve into the cards they just played and then put everything in their discard. After 2 turns, players shuffle their discard piles, creating a new deck with cards now modified by what they purchased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
