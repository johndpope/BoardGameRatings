			<description>In Zombies ate my Brains (ZAMB) you are a newly created Zombie just trying to get some fresh human brains to keep you in peek undead form. Those pesky living ones however seem to want you dead, for real this time. Can you eat their brains before they destroy your rotting body? Find out if you have the right stuff come the Zombie Apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZAMB is a solo card game in which you have 2 decks, one is your play deck and the other is the Humans. You also have a set of cards to represent you the Zombie- which as you take damage changes your ability to draw cards and also effects your defence and offensive capabilities. Gameplay involves managing whatever the humans throw at you and using your hand/deck you try to defeat the game as more and more threats come into play. Picking the wrong option is deadly to the undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zombies over run the world and win if there are no more human cards left to play and yet your undead minion is still in (at least) one piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a fast playing light card game which can also  be played as a 2 player format with one player taking control of the Humans. In solo play the game rarely goes over 10 minutes play time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
