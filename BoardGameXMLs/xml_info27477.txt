							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lake Winnipesaukee: Follow the Mount</name>
									
			<description>Lake Winnipesaukee is a Monopoly clone with a few small changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race around Lake Winnipesaukee, hoping to be the first to land on a piece of lake real estate.  When a lot is owned, rent can be collected.  The amount of rent depends on what is built on the lot.  If you own just one lot of a three lot group, you can build a picnic area.  If you own two, you can build camp grounds.  Finally, if you own all three lots, you can build lodges, which rake in the most rent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random lots around the lake contain actions, rather than lots for sale.  Any fees incurred by these lots are placed into the center of the lake, to be collected by the lucky player who lands on the correct lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this fashion until one player emerges as the only left with cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
