This game may be played by learners with little or no prior knowledge of privacy rights protection, as a means of becoming aware of positive actions they can take in various situations. It is also appropriate for players with some prior knowledge of the subject, serving as practice and reinforcement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first to match one Privacy Protection Card with one Situation Card correctly in every building on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Game board&lt;br/&gt;     Rule sheet/Answer sheet&lt;br/&gt;     Four tokens&lt;br/&gt;     Two six-sided dice&lt;br/&gt;     Situation Cards/six decks&lt;br/&gt;     Privacy Protection Cards/one deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
