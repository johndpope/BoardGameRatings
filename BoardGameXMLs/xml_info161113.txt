							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trouble Maker</name>
									
			<description>Trouble Maker is a pattern building game.  Players will exchange game tokens within 8 rounds to get rid of the trouble maker and earn points. When Trouble Makers of the same color form a line, then that line counts as one riddance.  If after a game token is flipped over, more Trouble Makers create a line, then the player can continue to flip over more tokens to count as riddance points.  The fun of the games is to create multiple lines everywhere and earn very high scores. Trouble Maker is a two player game, so enjoy the fun of continuous good riddance and win points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
