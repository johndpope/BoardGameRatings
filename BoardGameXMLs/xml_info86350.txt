			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;New children game where players all have to be chickens and peck grain. Just pull back you little chicken and let it do its work and eat that small ball.&lt;br/&gt;Remember, it is not just eating everything, but eating right stuff and fast. Eat 6 blue when playing with blue chicken, all other ball through back in, when all balls are gone.&lt;br/&gt;A neat little game for children. First one to collect 6 of their color balls, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
