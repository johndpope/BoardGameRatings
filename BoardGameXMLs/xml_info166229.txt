							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Fourths Home</name>
									
			<description>In her mid-20's, Kelly has moved back into her parents' house. Back to the flat expanse of Nebraska, that seemingly endless sea of rustling cornstalks peppered by rusty silos and rustier towns. A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out; she needs to get home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Three Fourths Home, players assume the role of Kelly while she is driving home during this thunderstorm. The focus of the game is its narrative, conveyed through an extended conversation Kelly has with her parents and younger brother. The player must navigate the conversation while driving through a stylized representation of rural Nebraska set against rumbling thunder and the music playing from the car's tape deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Fourths Home is a look into a specific moment of these characters' lives and their relationships with one another. The narrative touches on a variety of issues affecting Kelly and her family, including disability, adulthood, familial obligation, nostalgia, and loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutrino Effect provides the soundtrack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
