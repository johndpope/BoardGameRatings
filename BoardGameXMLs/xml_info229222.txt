			<description>Tr&amp;ouml;del-Trecker is tractor racing game. Wooden Houses in various colors are set up in a circle (there is no board). Each player has a wooden tractor and a set of cards with numbers from 2 to 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll a color die and may move to the next house of the corresponding color. In addition, you have to flip over a number card whose number is at least as high as the number of steps you move. When moving onto the same field as another tractor, you push that one one field ahead. If you land on a field behind another tractor, you move up next to that one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you cannot make a legal move, you skip a turn. When the first player has no cards left, the game ends and whoever moved furthest is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
