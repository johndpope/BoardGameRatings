							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creepy Copses</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Spaces: Creepy Copses offers a collection of three tables to inspire more evocative descriptions of creepy forests, jungles, or other thick vegetation the PCs may encounter. In fantasy literature, myths, and legends, dark woods always hide some secrets that may come out to play when the PCs are traveling or exploring... And it starts by determining which sense you use for the description, then deciding what element you&amp;rsquo;re describing and gaining some sensory detail about that element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps if your PCs are exploring what looks like a perfectly normal forest and you roll up Sight-Touch as the senses, Tree as the component, and Vibrant-Waste as the descriptors, you might end up with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beneath the tree, the nest of some small creature appears abandoned but recently lived in. A cache of tasty fruits, nuts, and leaves waits for a snack within the tiny den. It would be a waste to leave such edible wealth behind. But as your hand reaches in, your wrist becomes restrained as the opening closes and a group of small warriors surrounds you with sharpened spears ready to stab and tenderize your tough hide for their own community meal&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of possible combinations will inspire an insane number of adventurous encounters and hidden dangers. Your players may wonder if you were a member of the Great Hunt in a previous lifetime...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the next in a series of short (2- to 4-page), system-neutral supplements from Moebius Adventures designed to encourage more creative descriptions in your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
