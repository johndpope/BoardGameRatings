			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gerry the Germ goes Body Poppin' is a 8-bit game from Firebird in 1986. In the game you play a bacteria called Gerry, that couldn't get his grade called stinkploma. But to show the &amp;quot;illstitute of infectology&amp;quot; was wrong, he's gonna infect a body. The game has six screens, each a part of the human Gerry trying to infect: 1) lungs, 2) kidneys, 3) bladder, 4) stomach, 5) pancreas, 6) heart.&lt;br/&gt;In each level Gerry needs to eat up things that the human needs, like oxygen, kidney beans, toilet rolls etc. Gerry must collect those objects meanwhile avoid antibodies on all the six screens in a row to complete the game, otherwise the game restarts at the first screen agian. The object in the final screen is to reach the heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
