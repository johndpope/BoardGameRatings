			<description>B&amp;uuml;rokratie - Ausgabe Schulen (Bureaucracy - School Edition) is by J&amp;uuml;rgen Junghanel and is a strategic card game that plays like a board game and deals with excessive bureaucracy in a critical manner. Those who know many bureaucrats and use their knowledge get ahead. Just putting in an honest day&amp;rsquo;s work as a teacher isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough. You get closer to the desired bureaucrats, when the class sizes increase, by playing out new school, school board or ministry of culture facilities. The better facilities attract more bureaucrats &amp;ndash; that much is obvious. When the class sizes shrink, you can increase the number of bureaucrats by skills: new laws, new rules or certificates. To play out facilities or skills you need various cards such as party book, lobbying, intrigue, catastrophe and honest work, which you get for teaching and are therefore easiest to get in the schools. The player with the most bureaucrats wins. But there&amp;rsquo;s also &amp;ndash; although rarely &amp;ndash; justice: The player who manages to get 7 of the 10 school cards receives an award from the government and immediately wins all the bureaucrats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
