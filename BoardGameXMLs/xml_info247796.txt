							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fort Griffin: Savaged</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Wild West setting is a completely re-visioned version of DHR's Fort Griffin, Texas setting, designed for Savage Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Savaged version of Fort Griffin contains all 17 fully-described establishments, 90 NPCs (historical and fictional), and more than 100 adventure hooks (with DHR's world-famous &amp;quot;Forks in the Road&amp;quot; alternatives for many of the hooks). This whole kit and caboodle contains all new maps, Setting Rules, historical sidebars, and a passel of weird ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GM (the Dog House Gang prefers 'Judge') will get all of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fort Griffin main document - 154 pages containing descriptions of the town -- affectionately known as The Flat -- with detailed establishments, embedded maps, personalities and plenty of adventure hooks to keep players busy for ages.&lt;br/&gt;    The Flat Personality Pack - 37 pages, containing character &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot; to aid the Judge in a fast and furious game pace, whether gunfire breaks out or because a PC interaction with a prominent personality needs a quick-as-lightning Trait test resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flat Map Pack - A set of files with all the maps a Judge might need, including tiled versions for printing a tabletop map (with or without a grid) as well as VTT versions for folks who prefer one of those newfangled electronic tabletop contraptions.&lt;br/&gt;Every establishment comes with a thorough description of its history, current proprietor and other notables, as well as maps and room-by-room details. The personalities that make each place come alive are furnished with statistics for Savage Worlds. And a number of important characters have original illustrations to boot. Even if a Judge prefers not to use the stats, or decides to cherry-pick favorite elements for addition to an existing milieu, there's plenty of content packed in those pages to make Fort Griffin Savaged suitable -- and downright useful, we hope -- for any Wild West game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Griffin Savaged comes with the following establishments designed for a hootin'-hollerin' time in an Old West burg. A word to the wise, pard, things ain't always what they seem . . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
