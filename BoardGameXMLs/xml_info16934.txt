			<description>The object of the game is to move your ship from one Treasure corner of the board to any other Treasure corner. Instead of using a die to dictate movement, the game uses a shuttered Light House &amp;quot;spinner&amp;quot;. Players rotate the light house wheel in either direction until a dot appears. Opening the shutter at this point reveals a &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; that tells how many spaces the ship may move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some strategy comes into play, as circle spaces at the board's pathway intersections confer both advantages and disadvantages. A ship on a circle space *must* turn left or right on its next turn, but a player whose ship on a circle may move another player's ship if that move will put his opponent on a circle space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
