			<description>Planet Earth is struggling under high levels of pollution. Your task is to buy and invest in eco-innovations to build a successful green economy which reduces Earth&amp;rsquo;s pollution. Along the way you can win bonuses by answering fascinating facts about the world's geography, wildlife and environment. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to keep an eye on the clock though, as you need to reduce all the pollution before time runs out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Footprint is a semi-cooperative euro-style card game where players answer bonus questions and buy and invest in eco-innovations to remove pollution cubes from Earth. There are three levels of questions in the game to suit different ages and abilities (beginner, medium and advanced).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who removes the most pollution from Earth, however should players run out of turn cards before all the pollution is removed, everyone loses!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
