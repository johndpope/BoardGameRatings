			<description>user summary:&lt;br/&gt;Two Hin, a sky gnome, a kobold shaman, a pixie and a Tabi (flying apelike humanoid) are thrown together by fate after a dragon attacks and destroys a cloudclipper over the Five Shires.  They find a mysterious scroll, of which they have all recently had fragmented visions, that leads them on a quest to solve the riddle it presents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the DM Background&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place in the Five Shires of the D&amp;amp;D Mystara Setting, following the D&amp;amp;D rules and the Extra rules from the Gazetteers; Gaz 7 Northern Reaches, Gaz 8 The Five Shires, Gaz 10 The Orcs of Thar, The Creature Crucibles; PC1 Tall Tales of the Weefolk, PC2 Top Ballista, The Draconic Circles from the Dragon Magazine (170??) article of Bruce Heard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was played originally in three rounds for the Euro Gencon 1995 Championship by TSR/RPGA, but is easily playable in a limited amount of sessions. The championship version had three rounds of 4 to 5 hours. The original version was somewhat larger in the dungeon on Orlin Isle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round one is for the players and characters to become acquainted, to solve the main puzzle, and the trip to the village Thantabbar, followed by a short trip to Orlin Isle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round two is purely located in the dungeons of the forgotten keep (the Hin believe to be Faerdinel&amp;mdash;what it is not). This chapter brings the characters in touch with lost Hin history in a most shocking way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round three brings the characters to the artifact of the two Immortals Night and Mother Earth. And it will finally bring them to the lair of Gartax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is available as a set of four PDF files: an introduction, background and pre-generated player characters file and a file for each tournament round part of the whole scenario.  The page counts for the individual sections are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Introduction, 50pp&lt;br/&gt;     Round 1, 10pp&lt;br/&gt;     Round 2, 25pp&lt;br/&gt;     Round 3, 18pp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
