			<description>Golden Questions is an LDS game. The players are Mormon Missionaries who encounter various people they must try to convert with the Golden Question, &amp;quot;Would you like to know more about the Mormon Church?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board by spinning for results on a &amp;quot;Golden Spinner&amp;quot;. Each street is filled with houses where the missionaries can seek for potential investigators. The game also makes use of Mormon trivia questions which players much answer in order to earn investigator cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who converted the most investigators to Mormonism wins, but there is also a kid edition where everyone wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
