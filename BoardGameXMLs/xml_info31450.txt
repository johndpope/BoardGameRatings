			<description>Literally &amp;quot;Play of the small advertisements of France-evening&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description from A Gamut of Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sid Sackson mentions this game on p12 of A Gamut of Games.  He writes that it &amp;quot;&amp;hellip; has a delightful gallic flavor.  Players move around a board showing a map of Paris.  They acquire children by landing on the proper spaces.  The children are educated by landing on other spaces, after which they are sent out to work.  The winner is the first player who is able, by using the earnings of his children, to buy a bank.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
