							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BASH! Fantasy: Legends of Steel</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BASH! Fantasy: Legends of Steel is an update to the BASH! Fantasy RPG system published by Basic Action Games, set in the gritty Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery world of Erisa created by Jeff Mejia, using the BASH! rules written by Chris Rutkowsky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Setting: The World of Erisa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends of Steel is the name of the campaign setting which takes place in the world of Erisa. Erisa was inspired by the comic book and cartoon Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery fiction of the 70s and 80s, where Heroes could adventure in a world reminiscent of such comics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erisa is a world where decadent empires struggle to hold their frontiers against barbarian hordes, where demon-worshiping priests practice their dark arts in primeval forests, and where sell-swords, bravos and mercenaries of every stripe carouse away their fortunes in the crowded taverns and hazy lotus dens of vice-ridden port cities. There are fortunes to be won and lost, epic battles to fight, despots to usurp, and ancient evils to destroy. So grab your sword and a fast horse, there is adventure to be had!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erisa is the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; campaign world of the Legends of Steel Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery setting, but you can also use the resources in this book to create a Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery world of your very own. You can also use the BASH! Fantasy: Legends of Steel rules engine to drive a more high fantasy style campaign if you wish. Additional support products coming soon will aid you in this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE RULES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BASH! Fantasy: Legends of Steel uses the BASH! Engine also used by BASH! Ultimate Edition, and all the other BASH! family of products. The core mechanic is roll 2d6, multiply by the Stat, Skill, or Power being used, higher number wins (ties go to the Hero). Something that differs here is BASH! Fantasy: Legends of Steel is made for characters at the Heroic Scale, as opposed to the Super Heroic Scale of BASH! Ultimate Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features fast character creation, quick combat, and dozens of powers to build your character. You only need a pair of ordinary six-siders, this book and and a 3x5 card for your character, but we included a character sheet anyway! There are hordes of monsters, traps, and other dangers for your heroes to face down as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
