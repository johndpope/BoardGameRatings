			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a fantasy world not unlike our own, a madman vies for absolute power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swept to power during a people's revolution, a soldier has become an Emperor and now all the Continental Kingdoms are within his grasp. Only the naval might of the Island Kingdom and the deadly winter of the Frozen Lands slow his advance but your Queen knows this cannot last and orders every ship she can spare to embark on a Voyage of Discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unknown islands with resources and magical lore forgotten by men for millennia wait to be discovered. And far to the west there is a New World, which might bring ultimate victory to the Island Kingdom, or sow the seeds of her ultimate destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wind swells. Your voyage awaits. What direction you sail is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voyages of Discovery is a complete fantasy game powered by the Modern20 game engine and set in a sword and sorcery world that technologically resembles 19th century Earth. Voyages of Discovery is a complete setting and game system in one book, nothing else is needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It contains rules for magic, naval combat, boarding actions and individual adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
