			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed to be an introduction to Ysgarth for new players and should be playable using the Ysgarth Minirules and the additional material included in the adventure itself.  It's also easily adapted to other roleplaying systems if you just want to get a feel for the world.  The adventure is designed for a group of three players, but ought to work fine with additional players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure was published in a usenet forum and later archived on several sites.  It was presented as a black-and-white map and associated text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
