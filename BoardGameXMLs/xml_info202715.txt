							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Games</name>
									
			<description>This 1930s party game was one of a series of 30 &amp;quot;One shilling&amp;quot; games published in England by C.W. Faulkner &amp;amp; Co. Ltd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of Games consists of a box of trifold cardboard leaflets, with one side consisting of the cover illustration and two pages of ads, and the other with 24 questions arranged in three columns. As the brief instructions put it: &amp;quot;The answer to each question is the title of a well-known GAME.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example question: What a puppy does. Answer: SNAP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player would get a leaflet, and the winner would be the one to correctly answer the most questions within the agreed time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
