			<description>This seems to be an educational game about European politics. It has a clear relationship to Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eurocracy is the game about democracy in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;In the game the twelve member states of the European Community are fully integrated. There is just one state with one government and one parliament. According to their size, the member states are represented on the game board with one to four cities and/or regions. The flags symbolize the states to which cities and regions belong.&lt;br/&gt;Players are political parties competing for power. Each party is supported by two social groups. The players go with their playing piece as party leader on a continuous through Europe. By winning elections in cities they obtain Members of the European Parliament. Cities may be exchanged on a voluntary basis. Players in control of all cities of a member state are entitled to European Ministers each time they pass Brussels. The first player to form his or her government of 12 Ministers wins the game and is proclaimed European Prime Minister, provided that he enjoys sufficient support in the European Parliament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
