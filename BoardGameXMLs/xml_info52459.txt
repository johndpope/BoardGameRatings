							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phoenix Command Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Phoenix Command Expansion contains new rules for the Phoenix Command Combat System, and allows players to add entirely new aspects to their gaming. Each Section is modular, making it easy for players to use the rules that are most interesting to them, and that apply to their particular game. More than a dozen new topics are covered, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal Rules: Full rules for Animals in combat. Data is given for more than 40 different Animals, from Dogs to African Game to Dinosaurs, and special Hit Location and Damage Tables are presented for Birds, Marine Life, Bipeds, and both Short and Long-Legged Quadrupeds. Animal attacks are also given, including Bites, Kicks, Claw attacks, Rams, and special rules for the powerful Rending of a predator with its jaws locked on its target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaction Time: How quickly a combatant reacts to surprise is obviously vital. These rules simulate the reaction times of combatants of varying experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim Points: Customized Hit Location Tables are given, allowing players to aim at particular areas of a target. The tables accurately represent the modified Odds of Hitting and the altered distribution of hits resulting from aim at the Head, Heart, Mid-Body, or Legs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;40mm Grenade Canister Round: Developed for short-range combat in Vietnam, the M576 Multiple Projectile Round turns a Grenade Launcher into a Shotgun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are Sections covering: Target Identification; Effective Sustained Automatic Bursts; Tracking Full Automatic Fire; Thrown Grenade Range Modifiers; Grenade Penetration of Brush and Foliage; Overhead Ceilings and Thrown Grenade Ranges; Explosive Shock; Grenade Launcher Arming Range; Expanded Wound Recovery Rolls; and Medical Skill Level Modifiers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
