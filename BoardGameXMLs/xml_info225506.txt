			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Centaur With The Body of a Human and the Lower Half of... Well Another Human&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sneaking through the tall grass you happen to spy a ruggedly handsome man, perhaps a bit too tall as his torso is clearly visible above the stalks of grass, with wild black hair and a feral beauty about him. As you draw closer, letting your presence be known you are greeted by another set of hands, far too low for a man. When you get a full view of him you realized it a creature comprised of 50% human and... well, another 50% human. Oddly, though these numbers add up to 100% human, it falls short (or perhaps is in excess...) of what the term &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo; normally implies.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, we are gloriously releasing the &amp;quot;mantuar&amp;quot;. A mantaur is what happens if you shove the torso of a man on the headless body of a woman or vice versa. The androgynous mantuar are a racial offshoot of humanity with some unique racial traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book's short, cheap, and has 2 magnificent piece of artwork by Rui Ferreira and we hope you enjoy it&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
