			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Can you tell me your name?&amp;quot; asks the confused officer, again. He speaks Russian with a Greek accent. &amp;quot;No, unfortunately, I can't help you,&amp;quot; you respond in formal Russian.  It doesn't seem like your native tongue. He hands you a mirror. &amp;quot;The doctor says you can't have memory loss. You haven't hit your head. Tell me your name!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You see yourself in the mirror. It's your face, you just do not know it. You have burns and scratches on the face and on the body. Every breath hurts. There is something wrong with the lungs. Remarkable. Look into the eyes and it's like meeting a stranger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I'm not lying to you, mate,&amp;quot; you say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The officer speaks promptly. &amp;quot;The Americans are coming soon. They will take you.  Answer me so I can help!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A thriller about terror and identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is distributed as three separate PDF files:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     26-page scenario&lt;br/&gt;     14-page pre-generated characters&lt;br/&gt;     25-page print-and-play handouts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
