			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A puzzle-like 2-dimensional space ship flying action game. The player must control a space craft flying around in several levels, not only controlling the craft, but also managing the various engines, heat explulsion, electrical discharges and similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played alone, or with up to 2 friends. If playing on 2, one player plays the engineer controlling the ship's engines with the Gamepad (and the scanner), and the other player being the pilot, controlling the ship. On 3 players, the engineer focuses only on the gamepad, another player is the pilot and the third player controls the flashlight and the scanner/flare gun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
