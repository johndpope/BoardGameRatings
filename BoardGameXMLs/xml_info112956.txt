			<description>In this game you will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Bid in the markets, against the other players for those crucial contracts.&lt;br/&gt;- Develop different technologies to produce more valuable robots.&lt;br/&gt;- Upgrade or add to your production, increasing production capacity.&lt;br/&gt;- Make the tricky decision to invest in new offices to exploit new markets around the world.&lt;br/&gt;- Hire Sales Representatives to enter and hopefully win more auctions.&lt;br/&gt;- Make and deliver the goods within the contract deadlines or pay the missed delivery damages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also probably need to take a few loans, but be careful with the hefty interest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you make the most profit or descend into bankruptcy ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robofactory is a zero-luck business simulation economic game about manufacturing robots around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is modular and based on a large number of different and unique contract cards with different types of order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules come with many different scenarios for players to decide on the length of the game that ranges from introductory games (60 minutes), quick games (90 minutes), normal games (120 minutes) and long games (180 minutes). Players are also encouraged to set up their own scenarios by combining the many contract cards available (please note that playing with ALL available contract cards will turn the game into epic and last a weekend).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
