			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War is an evil thing; but it is not the most evil of things. For where evil reigns peace must suffer and the world&amp;rsquo;s want be lost in the wages of blood. It is here, where evil sows its seeds of destruction, that the brave must forever rise up to champion those that are true. And so it always has been, and always will be, that the wages of evil are spent upon the Fields of Battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stand-Alone Game Fields of Battle is a simple, straightforward, easy-to-use game of mass combat. It easily simulates battles between hundreds and even thousands of combatants, all in a single gaming session. Herein are all the tools you need to decide the outcome of large-scale warfare. Playable with the included Battle Unit Counters, or any type of miniatures, Fields of Battle is a flexible, easy-to-learn rules set that allows you to conduct small battles between a few dozen combatants or mass warfare between the armies of kings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
