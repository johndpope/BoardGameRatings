							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Villainous Archetypes Volume VII</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Good to Be Bad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sick of saving the world? Tired of being expected to leap at the chance to solve everyone&amp;rsquo;s petty problems? Have a thing for twirling mustaches and overly-elaborate deathtraps? Why not mix things up with a villainous character! At some point in their gaming career, everyone has considered playing an &amp;ldquo;evil campaign,&amp;rdquo; but with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game being devoted to goody-two-shoes heroes, it can sometimes be hard to find support. Want some evil options for your character? You&amp;rsquo;ve found them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents five new villainous archetypes for five different classes. Included are the cruel taskmaster, a hunter archetype that specializes in bringing out the worst and most feral aspects of her animal companion, the dark meditant, a monk archetype focused on unlocking new ways to inflict pain upon his foes, the curse oracle, an oracle archetype that inflicts horrible curses upon others, the ghost baiter, a spiritualist archetype that provokes and manipulates spirits rather than calms them, and can even feed stray spirits to its soul-devouring phantom, and the dark crusader, a warpriest archetype that focuses on killing foes in the name of evil ends, and is rewarded for each life he takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're about to embark on a politically-themed campaign (such as Way of the Wicked, by Fire Mountain Games, or the first official Paizo adventure path made specifically for evil characters), or you just want an excuse to play an unrepentant, irredeemable villain, this book has lots of tantalizing options to offer. Even GMs can get in on the fun, as several of the archetypes here are perfect for villainous NPCs as well, and can make for exciting and memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
