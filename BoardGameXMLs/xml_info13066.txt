							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vanquished Foe</name>
									
			<description>The Vanquished Foe, designed by a person or persons unknown (possibly Pete and Judy Kerestan) and published by Wee Warriors (no year given, but presumably in the late 1970s).  It is a simple fantasy wargame of dwarves or elves (or both) invading an orcish tunnel system. The map is made up of a number of square-gridded sheets and the counters are provided on additional cardboard sheets (they need to be cut out). Also included are a few pages of rules, the coversheet, and a backing sheet which also has an overall map of the tunnels to use for planning (the orcs set up doors and traps, and the invaders determine at which points to make breaches).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
