							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duckula Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Duckula Card Game is a licensed merchandise of a 1980s-90s British cartoon series about a vegetarian vampire duck.  Players are given a hand of five cards in the game.  During their turn, they must take a card from the deck or discard pile and then discard one from their hand.  The first player to reveal a hand that has a Castle Duckula card and a unique set of character cards (of the same character and numbered from 1 to 4) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
