			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is an event-based adventure in the town of Khurmish with lots of role-playing opportunity, climaxing in a vicious battle. The characters come to the town to seek out its inhabitants, or right a wrong of which they know very little. They discover that the town is under siege from a threat that just appeared, and from a threat that has been around for many years. This adventure can be placed in any campaign world. It is recommended that the town of Khurmish be placed in a very isolated area to maximize its effect as a cult town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 8th - 12th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
