			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;Laser Lords&amp;quot;, you play the role of a human abducted from Earth to save the world from Sarpedon, a being that is trying to obtain a condensation crystal to entrap the universe to keep as his own possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is given nine lives to accomplish this task. The game has seven worlds to explore and many characters to interact and share items with. There are a number of commands, including the Remember command which is of great importance in the game. As you speak with each of the characters they will say things that you will need to recall to other characters later on in your quest to stop Sarpedon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
