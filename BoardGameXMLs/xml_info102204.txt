							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conflict Roleplaying Game: False Peace Battlemap</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ancient's Atrium battlemap depicts a beautifully designed garden laced in ivory, a sanctuary of peace and harmony that invites comfort. Yet this Atrium is wickedly designed to become the center of conflict and strife. Perfectly symmetrical for tactical fairness, this map is made for strategists. Providing a visually stunning environment that can be used for fantasy (or sci-fi) role-playing settings. Any GM can make the Ancient's Atrium place of peace and well deserved rest for players, or, if you're like us, a place of unexpected conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These two oversized miniatures battle maps is symmetric balance to provide incredible strategic combat. Each in-scale structure is well-thought out and strategically situated to add different tactical dimensions to each Conflict Match or gaming session. Though designed exclusively for the Conflict Roleplaying System, this map is versatile enough to be used with any roleplaying system that uses the standard 1 inch miniature grid (i.e., 3.5, 4e D&amp;amp;D, Star-Wars, Pathfinder). This map was designed at high resolution levels and is impressively clear.  Top, bottom, and side coordinates are include for the use of Passcards (Conflict Hidden Movement System). The coordinates are easy-to-read and easy-to-follow map points to add to the accuracy of your player's moves. A must have for all GMs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Double-Sided&lt;br/&gt;-Huge 24&amp;quot; x 36&amp;quot; Map&lt;br/&gt;-Draw right on the surface with water-based pens and markers. &lt;br/&gt;-Printed on 100# Text Stock (30% PCW /FSC Certified Recycled)&lt;br/&gt;-Fade-resistant Inks&lt;br/&gt;-UV Protected Glossy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
