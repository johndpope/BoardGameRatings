							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Winds of Foul Crack</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Times are good; tables full. Loads roll in over the Caustic Plains from New Churning, where the Young Wind turns great drives and wilds grow tame. New work comes to older realms; new crafts form. Bright vistas stretch away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirit of the age? That's canny Old Wranglie. Pondering even now...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Winds of Foul Crack is an adventure with five locations, a map and a set of protagonists, all folding into a pocket format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elements together allow wily adventurers to explore a change across the wilds of a harsh plain, offering the fruits of a great mind, opportunity with pioneers and knowledge of a potentially apocalyptic event. The material is suitable for rules-light gaming and designed for easy adaptation to various settings and systems, describing the key elements with a degree of uncertainty in terms open to interpretation. It assumes that dice are used for random numbers, but also offers a diceless number generator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The package includes a copy of isophasmic light, a compact approach to gaming used in the creation of the profiles. As with isophasmic light, the adventure is laid out for use as a PolyP booklet, to make it easier to play spontaneously and on the move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
