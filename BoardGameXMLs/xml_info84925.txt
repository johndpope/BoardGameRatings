			<description>User Summry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purble Place is a starting installed game for Windows Vista and above.  It is a children's game with three different minigames, Comfy Cakes, Purble Pairs, and Purble Shop.  Each game is fun-ducational in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comfy Cakes is a rythme/building game where you must make cakes that match an order up above.  Higher difficulty levels increase the difficulty of the cakes to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purble Pairs is a game that is a basic pair matching game with different faces, houses, and cakes to match.  Higher difficulty levels increase the size of the matching grid and the diversity of matchable pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purble Shop is a deduction/guessing game similar to Mastermind where you choose different facial components and accessories for a character and are told how many you got correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, this suite of games can be quite fun and engaging for children, challenging them in thinking and mouse manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
