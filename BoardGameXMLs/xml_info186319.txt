							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Foreign King: Railroad / Catholic Against Liberals</name>
									
			<description>A small package which contains 2 mini expansions:&lt;br/&gt;- The Railroad Expansion&lt;br/&gt;- the Catholic against liberals Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook also contains rules for a 3th mini expansion: Riots, but since this was promised to be a Kickstarter Exclusive, the tokens are missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Railroad Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will rule the Belgian Railroads?&lt;br/&gt;Adds the opportunity to build railroads at a price. During the end game scoring, the longest railroad generates points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catholic Against Liberals Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which Faction will get the most Political influence?&lt;br/&gt;During the game there are opportunities to convert Provinces to your faction (Catholic, Liberal, Neutral). During end game scoring, the faction which controls more Provinces gains Points. This adds an interesting twist to the 4 player game, where 2 players will be working together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
