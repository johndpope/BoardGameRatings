							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stand O&#039;Food</name>
									
			<description>Stand o' Food&amp;reg; is an exhilarating arcade game that challenges you to feed a host of hungry patrons before they leave in a huff! As people line up at your counter, you'll slap together burgers, bacon melts and more as quickly as you can. Eventually, you'll earn enough money to purchase condiments and upgrade your equipment to serve even tastier food faster than before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stand o' Food isn't all about speed; you've also got to plan ahead. As customers place their orders, your job is to put together the necessary ingredients in the correct sequence. Since the components of the sandwiches line up along several conveyor belts, you must extract the ingredients in a way that allows you to make the next sandwich without difficulty. If you enjoy games with bright visuals, simple controls and addictive gameplay, Stand o' Food will satisfy all of your cravings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
