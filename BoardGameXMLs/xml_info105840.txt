							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Arena</name>
									
			<description>Dark Arena is an first-person shooter video game for the Game Boy Advance. It was the first FPS game announced for the Game Boy Advance, but it was the fourth released.&lt;br/&gt;A training facility for soldiers was built on a small, isolated island. Genetic splicing was performed to create Genetically Engineered Organisms (GEOs), and when the security failsafes failed, the GEOs quickly took over the base. Then, Angelina Bradshaw (the main character) and her special operations team went to eradicate the threat, but they were pushed back into the center of the base, and Angelina is the only one left alive. She then knows that she has to reach a hangar on the outskirts of the island before a nuclear bomb goes off as a last resort to destroy the creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dark Arena&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
