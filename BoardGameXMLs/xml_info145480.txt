			<description>From the Game Chef introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synanthropes is a story game about representatives of the four known sentient races of planet Earth: the Crows, the Rats, the Roaches, and the Raccoons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometime in the future, somewhere between one hundred and a thousand years from today, humanity disappeared, for reasons unknown. Long after that, synanthropes--those animals who live in ecological niches&lt;br/&gt;that humans created --evolved, becoming intelligent communities in their own right, aware that they live in Humanity&amp;rsquo;s cast-off ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play representatives from these species, each player from a different one, who came together on a scientific expedition, the first major cross-species undertaking since the end of the Resource Wars. There is a building, a skyscraper in the center of an otherwise abandoned wasteland, which has never been explored by any of your people. Your mission is to climb to the top and search for information about the Humans, their Artifacts, and possibly an answer to the question you have all been asking for generations: Where did the Humans go, anyway?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But be warned... the peace among your species is a fragile thing and the Wars weren&amp;rsquo;t just about resources, but about utter cultural incompatibility as well. Your species are just different. Your mission is as much about trust as discovery, and if it&amp;rsquo;s a failure, then quicker tempers among your people may once again call for war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
