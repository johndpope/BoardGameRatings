							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hag Ride</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone killed the Soileau sisters, Josephine and Genevieve. They owned Jo's Place, in East Caroll Parish, Louisiana. Lucille Johnson, proprietress of Jo's Place's rival juke joint, the Red Queen Cafe in neighboring Issaquena County, Mississippi, says she discovered their skins in a cooking pot in the Red Queen's kitchen. She makes no mention of how the skins arrived at her establishment without their innards. And when she saw the gruesome horror, she merely shrugged, sucked her teeth, and said, &amp;quot;Well, finally someone's done something about those hag riding bitches. Issaquena County can rest easy tonight-after we shut down in the morning of course!&amp;quot; And she laughed her deep swampy laugh, and rolled herself some Indian hop before she summoned her husband Baby Grand Anthony, the Red Queen's bartender, had him burn the skins, and toss the ashes in the Mississippi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hag Ride is a campaign frame for Mortal Coil. Set in a pair of rival juke joints in 1920s Louisiana, Hag Ride lets you explore a different sort of Southern Gothic, full of hoodoo and illegal good times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hag Ride is a fully sketched out setting in the form of a detailed theme document, with all of the world set-up choices written out in detail. The frame is customizable by your game group. You choose a tone, and pick the magic level that is appropriate for your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
