			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can never have too many friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The public playtest of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures featured a medium with access to a wide number of very unique spirits, each with a specific name and personality, as well as granting access to various powers and abilities. For the final version of the book, however, the medium&amp;rsquo;s selection of spirits was scaled back, and instead of individual entities, mediums could choose from six archetypes, each of which corresponded to a wide variety of individual spirits. Mechanically, the class is greatly improved, but there is no denying that in moving from specific, individual spirits to generic spirit types designed to apply to a wide variety of spirits, something valuable was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents 20 new spirits for mediums to channel, each of which with its own unique and flavorful background and description, as well as their own new and unique spirit powers and taboos, as well as spirit bonuses, influence penalties, and favored locations. Each spirit&amp;rsquo;s entry also includes a brief piece of fiction which is written from an in-character perspective, and can be discovered by mediums in the game to help them learn about the spirit in question. Finally, a brief section presents a selection of variant rules for GMs with reservations about adding a wide variety of spirits to the medium&amp;rsquo;s repertoire, providing several different options for incorporating these new spirits into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book, you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Big Jambu, an ancient spirit of primordial nature from before man walked the earth, and allows mediums to shrug off mortal magic.&lt;br/&gt;    Mister Turnip, a kindly spirit of home and hearth that allows mediums to cook magical foods that aid themselves and their allies.&lt;br/&gt;    Skullface, a skeletal spirit of death and desire who drives mediums to indulge themselves, and grants power over life and death.&lt;br/&gt;    The Walker, a malevolent spirit of stealth and blood who urges mediums to kill the innocent, and grants them the stealth and deadly accuracy to do so.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;and many more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
