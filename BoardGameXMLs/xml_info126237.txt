			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was supposed to be a simple heist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of well-dressed criminals arrive at a warehouse to rendezvous after pulling off an extraordinary crime. &lt;br/&gt;They know each other only by their pseudonyms - Mister Black, Mister Red, Mister Green, Mister Purple, Mister Beige, Mister Silver, Mister Grey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan is simply to sit tight until midnight when someone will arrive to ferry them - and the loot - across the bay to make a final delivery to the boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds easy, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But things take a turn for the weird; strange things happen in and around the warehouse. Things which make the criminals doubt the allegiances of the compatriots, their own sanity, and ultimately the very nature of reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is going to be a long wait for the ferryman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dockside Dogs is a one-shot scenario for Call of Cthulhu. Four to six players take on the roles of the well-dressed criminals, hoping against all odds that they will make it through the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
