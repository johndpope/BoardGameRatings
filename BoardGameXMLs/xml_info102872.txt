			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Deja Vu - and to Las Vegas, the city that never sleeps - the city of excitement! Actually, you've already had plenty of excitement in the last 48 hours. You've been abducted by two thugs from Chicago, grilled by the notorious Las Vegas mobster Tony Malone, knocked senseless and tossed into a bathtub in a cheap Vegas hotel. It couldn't possibly get any worse than this, could it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deja Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas. You will meet the nicest people you want to play with. But they don't play nice. And if you don't come up with 100,000 big ones in the next 7 days, it may be the last game you'll ever play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deja Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas is the spellbinding sequel to the interactive graphic adventure game Deja Vu. This exciting, state-of-the-art thriller, in the tradition of the award winning original, draws you right into the action. There are no cumbersome commands to type, no guessing what to do. You are totally free to explore and manipulate the objects in every detailed screen, choosing your own path through the mystery. You select from a multitude of clues that may help you save your neck - or lead to an early demise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deja Vu is like no other game you've ever experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
