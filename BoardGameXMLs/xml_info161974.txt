			<description>Parasprite Panic! is a fan-made cooperative board game based upon Hasbro's My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic franchise. The game, which draws upon events from the television series (particularly the  Season 1 episode, &amp;quot;Swarm of the Century&amp;quot;), can support from 1  to 6 players and has an approximate running time of 45 - 60 minutes. Players assume the roles of the series' primary ponies (the 'Mane 6'), who must, through the use of an action point allowance system, stem the spreading tide of devastation by abating the swelling swarm of cute but calamitous parasprites while simultaneously attempting to rescue the injured citizens of Ponyville and preventing the utter destruction of their town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
