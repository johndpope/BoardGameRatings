							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Edgy Designer: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the last of your kind: a real gamer in a hobby that has been taken over by socialists, feminists, liberals, ethnic minorities and pearlclutching fishwives. You're fighting back now, and you are not alone. You have a multitude of fans just like you, always willing to soothe your ego when people destroy your life by saying mean words at you, or harrass your targets whenever you wish to avoid the flak&amp;mdash;after all, it's just words on the internet, you know?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As edgy as your stainless steel katana, you're a tabletop gaming auteur. From violence against women to jokes about violence against women, there's no subject you're not willing to tackle, and no length you will not go to in your quest to punish the uppity minorities and hypersensitive females who have stood up against you. You've been accused of making games that many people find uncomfortable, offensive and frankly not very good, but to you it's art, a facet of life that can't be ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No matter how much they impact other people, it's your design, your opinon that matters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Edgy Designer. Bring it on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Edgy Designer is an edgy, light-hearted satire playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game which lets you fulfil your dreams of being an iconoclast game designer constantly hounded by censors and social justice warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
