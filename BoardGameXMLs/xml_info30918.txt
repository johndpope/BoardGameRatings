							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a roll and move type trivia game with the added twist of pursuing, fighting and capturing villains.  The game is based on the comic book character &amp;quot;Batman&amp;quot; by DC comics.  It includes 1000 questions covering 65 years and multiple decades of Batman history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the space the player lands on, when the player answers a question correctly they receive a power card that gives them bonuses to being either a) Batman or b) a villain.  If the player answers a question correctly from a villain space, they receive a villain card.  The player must then make his way to the currently upturned location card.  Once there, the player attempts to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; the villain by using power cards against the player sitting next to them with the added luck of a dice roll for each.  When a player captures 3 villains, he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question cards each include 5 questions representing 5 difficulty levels. i.e.:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Batman's secret identity is what playboy billionaire?&lt;br/&gt;2. True or false.  The Wayne manor grandfather clock is set to the time of death of Bruce Wayne's parents.&lt;br/&gt;3. After the Grasshopper stole the batmobile, batman installed an alarm to ensure it never happened again.  What villain was subsequently tripped up by that alarm?&lt;br/&gt;4. Selina Kyle's brother Karl is better known as whom?&lt;br/&gt;5. Several incarnations of the batmobile were designed by what stuntman?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can see, the questions get progressively harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
