			<description>BattleMage is a semi-cooperative deck-building board game. Players each assume the role of a BattleMage frantically slinging spells from atop their castle's walls in an attempt to stall an endless onslaught of invading Monsters for as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BattleMage who achieves the most honor by best defending their homeland will be awarded the title of Grand ArchMage and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will collect spell cards in a classic deck-building fashion using 3 separate resources. Each spell card has an immediate effect as well as a lasting Resonance effect. These abilities are used to try and destroy an everlasting onslaught of monsters approaching the castle walls which will move toward the castle each turn as determined by the roll of dice. Defeated monsters are harvested into players' decks by the Soul Crystals they leave behind, to even further boost each player's deck during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BattleMage is for 1-4 players (yes, there is a solitaire play variant!) and takes 45-60 minutes to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
