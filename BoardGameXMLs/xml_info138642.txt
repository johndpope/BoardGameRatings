							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Godmetals of Porphyra</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Gods were drawn to the world of Porphyra during the Calling, the world was irrevocably changed. Not only did divine magic fill the world, but lands were destroyed or displaced while new lands appeared. Many new materials also arrived with the new Gods, not least of which was the purple crystal porphyrite, but also seven metals never before seen on the world. Collectively they are known as godmetals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
