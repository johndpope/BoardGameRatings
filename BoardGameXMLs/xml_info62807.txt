							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Saar: The French First Strike (Europa Battle Scenario #5)</name>
									
			<description>Appearing in Europa Magazine #29, Operation Saar is a pullout from the magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Saar posits a French attack on German forces in Poland in 1939. &lt;br/&gt;As the designer states: &amp;quot;Due to consistent over-estimation of German military might and poor intelligence, the French made only a token effort to fulfill their obligations to Poland by a desultory advance a couple of kilometers into Germany on September 7th that was soon withdrawn. I've thought it a fascinating &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; to consider what might have happened had the French attacked before the Germans had redeployed from Poland.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Saar uses the First to Fight (1991) rules set with various adjustments, along with maps from Second Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
