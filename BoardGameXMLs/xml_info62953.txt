			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this supplement you'll discover how to build worlds and starships and to create new races. We will delve into the bizarre underworld of psiotronics, as well as studying design specs on the latest battlemechs. We'll be showing you our own version of the future, but of course you're encouraged to alter what we've designed or to create something completely your own. Webs was designed to be easy to learn and use and to be extremely flexible; therefore, you can include or remove whatever you need in order to fit or convert an existing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our version of the future is often dark and extremely gritty, but as always, your players have the potential to make things a lot better. Hope is forever the underlying theme in our campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any case, it's a big universe out there... explore it and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
