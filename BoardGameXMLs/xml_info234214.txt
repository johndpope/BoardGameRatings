			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures in Zombiewood is a card and dice-based game that pits you and other unfortunate actors against a horde of Z-lebrities. You and your friends are wanting to shoot the best zombie movie ever. The problem arises when the extras they sent you to be your zombies are actual members of the undead. As you fight your way through the horde, you figure you might as well film it too. Assemble your cast, choose your props and prepare to fight your way to the final scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a cooperative game where the players each command a different actor each turn.  They use the actor to take on the Z-lebrities that spawn during that Scene they are shooting.  They roll dice in an attempt to match the symbols required to defeat the Z-lebrity.  Anytime a player is unable to defeat the Z-lebrity, their actor is zombified and joins the growing horde to be faced in the game's final scene.  Combat must be fast, as you are trying to conserve film reel, so each combat phase is timed, and all players must be finished with their attack rolls before the timer signals the end of the scene.  Team strategy and quick thinking will give you a chance to survive to the end of your movie.  How many stars will your film earn... and will you survive to find out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
