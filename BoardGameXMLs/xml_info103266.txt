			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Star Fleet is at your command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like some future starship admiral hurtling through the vast void of hyperspace at speeds beyond comprehension, you are challenged to a battle for cosmic supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warp Factor is what every space war fan has been waiting for - the ability to command a start fleet in realistic battle simulation against alien vessels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is light years ahead of all other &amp;quot;space&amp;quot; games because it doesn't just fill your screen with pretty pictures and little substance. The Warp Factor is a high-powered tactical simulation that places you in the Captain's role dealing with the critical parameters of interstellar battle such as sensor and scanner readings, energy allocation for weapons (phasers, disruptor bolts, photon and plasma torpedoes), shields, and warp endings; and battle damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Employing up to ten ships, both sides can give individual or fleet orders, the latter allowing all your ships to execute your commands in unison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Computer, aside from being the game's perfect administrator and referee, also serves as your ever-ready, ever-capable nemesis in the multiple solitaire scenarios: The Reman Chase (replete with the Cloaking Device, Plasma Torpedoes, and Neutral Zone); Attack on Star Base; Attack on Base Station; and Dogfight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-player version is essentially free-form. With each player choosing starships from a different Empire, you can create scenarios ranging from space skirmishes to a full-scale, all-out star war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warp Factor is undeniably the most complete and detailed simulation of tactical starship combat yet designed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
