			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Near Now . As the Possibility Wars&amp;trade; turn realms against each other, an Orrorshan Nightmare seizes control of a portion of the GodNet with a diabolical plan to use the Cyberpapacy's greatest weapon against it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of New Culmont have more to fear than the Inquisition and gospog attacks. Their young women are being murdered, their bodies stripped of cyberware. And the killer leaves a taint of horror behind him unlike anything they've ever known ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bloody trail leads into the GodNet, where spectral figures have been seen and a strange, ebon-hued creature has torn apart innocent deckers. From a trial by fire to battles with horrors both in and out of the Net, the Knights must plunge into a whirlpool of fear if they wish to save the lives of thousands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
