			<description>&amp;quot;Amped 3 is a snowboarding game, the third installment of the Amped sports game franchise, developed by Indie Built/2K Sports. It expands on previous versions of the Xbox exclusive games by featuring larger levels, customizable terrains, a 300 song soundtrack, and various Xbox Live online features as well as the ability to use a snowmobile, a variety of sleds and even a hang glider. There are also substantial changes to the gameplay which provide for a more irreverent tone, such as challenges in which two players compete to amass the most injuries and a 10 hour story mode presented in a variety of different styles. It is also known for its unique cut scenes using everything from Hand Puppets to Anime.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Amped_3,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
