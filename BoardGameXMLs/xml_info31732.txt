			<description>Under the banner of &amp;quot;Our Town Trivia&amp;quot;, then this version has the almost similar layout as with what you would have for the 'trivia' genre. Unlike some others with the closely related naming sort, then those have their depiction of another nearby region superimposed upon a &amp;quot;M~onopoly&amp;quot; 'clone'. They've taken another approach for it all here, with such as including one DECK of the 'Trivia' cards that has locally generated information of people, places, or events that many another from beyond its setting might not be too familiar with as well. The *Spaces* have all manner of locales that were around at the time that it was produced, while since many have now long gone &amp;quot;out of business&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
