							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Qerth Apprentice Level Rules</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for fantasy gaming with a sense of panache? Or do you just want to slay the evil Panache and loot its corpse? Welcome to Qerth, (rhymes with 'worth') where you can have your panache and slay it, too! Qerth is a magical place full of mysterious creatures, ancient wizards, haughty elves, surly dwarves, dimwitted soldiers, sneaky pickpockets, and humble cheese makers. You and your friends will take the part of a roving band of adventurers who kill things and take their stuff. This isn't simple armed robbery, but rather Grand, Epic Adventure! Boldly foray into the unknown with your trusty blade and your hearty comrades. A whole world of wonder is yours for the slaying and looting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Qerth Apprentice Level Rules book introduces players to the Qerth setting, explains the intricate mechanics of Qerth, and gives rules for character Ranks 1-3. This book focuses on dungeon adventures, because they are the center of Qerth's economy and culture. You will need QAGS Second Edition (or the QAGS Qik Start rules, included in the PDF) and several handfuls of dice to play Qerth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
