			<description>Fast-Action Games created many &amp;quot;quick-play&amp;quot; sports simulations where the outcome of a contest could be decided with just one or two dice rolls.  These games made it easy to play an entire series of games in a matter of just a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game covers professional football.  Teams from the past (NFL, AAFC, WFL, USFL, WLAF, AFL) were extensively researched to create ratings for just about any team a person would wish to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
