							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Isle of Skye: Expansion 2</name>
									
			<description>The second expansion for Isle of Skye focuses on the &amp;quot;dead ends&amp;quot; that players create during the game as they run roads into mountains, grasslands, or lakes. When you create a dead end, you can take or buy a special tile that gives you bonus points during the game at the end of each round or a special ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other tiles in this expansion interact with these new tiles. You might place a mine in a mountain, for example, when you run a road into that mountain, and if you manage to place two mines in your landscape, well, perhaps you'll be able to connect them with a new foundry tile that will score you even more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
