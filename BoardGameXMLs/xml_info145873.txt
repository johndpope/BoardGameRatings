			<description>From the rulebook flavour text: The lightning fast reaction game with the little tiger and his friends for 2 to 6 players ages 5 and up. - The little tiger has a party and everybody has arrived: the little bear, the good looking goose, Guenter the frog and all the tiger friends. They eat, they laugh and dance with a lot of action. Of course they make photographs, as everyone wants a picture of him/her with friends to take home. Who gets the most photographs wins. And it works like this: Roll the dice, quickly look for the pictures and grab them fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Janosch Bildersuche (with Janosch being an artist and author of childrens books and Bildersuche meaning picture search) consists of 25 cards, each depicting two of Janoschs characters, and 2 6-sided dice that have stickers with these characters on them. All cards are put on the table for everybody to see. The dice are rolled. The first player to find the matching card - depicting the 2 characters that were rolled - touches it with one hand, and if correct gets to keep it. After all picture cards are rolled and found the player with the most cards is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
