			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something old lies in the frozen wastes of the arctic. Something older than the Soviet research station and the Nazis who have seized it. Something older even than the Viking long ship frozen in place; a lasting memorial to the adventurers of the past-and a warning to those of the present!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever these ancient secrets are, Hitler wants to discover them. And that means your hand-picked squad has to prevent that from happening. Here, in this barren desolate expanse of snow and ice, your team must face unnatural horror and natural disaster to prevent a discovery that could mean the opening of a new front in the war: a new front that would spell the beginning of the end for the allied effort in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ice Fang is a Weird Wars adventure by Rob Clayton Jones set in the arctic north. In addition to the mission, this ebook includes new creatures, rules for the d20 Weird Wars game by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. What's more, the book has been designed to be playable with Great White Games' Savage Worlds game system, and is one of a range of multi-statted games by Legion Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
