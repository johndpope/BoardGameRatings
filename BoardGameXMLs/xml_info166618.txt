			<description>Just Dance 2015 is the sixth game in the Just Dance series developed by Ubisoft Paris and published by Ubisoft. It was officially announced at Ubisoft's Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 press event on 9 June 2014 alongside with Just Dance Now. It is expected to be released on 21 October 2014 in North America, 23 October in Europe, and 24 October in the UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay retains the same as in past Just Dance games where players follow the on-screen dancer to earn points. New to the series is the &amp;quot;Community Remix&amp;quot; mode where players dance to songs that have other players on the screen instead of the dancers. Modes from past games such as the &amp;quot;World Dancefloor&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Autodance&amp;quot; feature will appear in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another game was also announced with Just Dance 2015 called Just Dance Now, an app that lets players play Just Dance anywhere after syncing up a device with the website on another screen connected to the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Just Dance 2015&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
