							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">E.N. Critters Volume 3: Tulenjord: Land of the Fallen One</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third volume in the E.N. Critters series of Open Gaming Content Sourcebooks, Tulenjord: Land of the Fallen One deals with cold-themed critters - creatures living in and around a floating iceberg island caused by a dead god. The immense body of the dead god fell out of the skies and crashed into the icy waters of the northern ocean, churning up the sea bottom and freezing everything around him into an immense iceberg. The introduction of his divinity into the environment transformed a great many creatures into the forms you see presented in this tome....creatures of the air, of nearby islands, and of the sea both shallow and deep. The island of ice created around his body provides a home for these creatures, and has also attracted a number of other species in its travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Volume 3 we have retained the new features from Volume 2: full color illustrations, suggested knowledge tables and counter sheets. These features will become standard for the entire series. Each critter has a table to aid GMs in determining what characters know about them on a successful Knowledge check. In addition, counters (front and back) for all critters in the book have been included after the statistics pages. The counter pages are set up to be printed two-sided on cardstock although you may just as easily print them out on two sheets of paper and glue them to the front and back of even thicker cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     More than twenty new cold-themed creatures&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed description of Tulenjord, its areas and history - the mountains, fissures, cliffs, snowfields and icy forests&lt;br/&gt;     Full color illustrations&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed ecologies and background&lt;br/&gt;     A suggested Knowledge table for each creature&lt;br/&gt;     A rules and game balance section for each entry&lt;br/&gt;     Counters for all creatures&lt;br/&gt;     Fully linked and bookmarked&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
