			<description>Jump Bug are a platform game by Alpha Denshi in 1981. Jump Bug was the first platform game to include smooth horizontal and vertical scrolling. Up to two players can play, alternating turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player controls a constantly bouncing car while driving through various environments including a city, pyramid, and underwater. Unlike most other scrolling games of the time, the main character, is jumping constantly. The height of the jump and speed of a fall can be controlled with up and down key. Player is also able to shoot down various enemies that appear on a stage. Points are gained by collecting treasure, killing enemies and jumping on clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jump Bug was ported to Arcadia 2001 (from Emerson) and Leisure Vision (from Leisure Dynamics).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jump Bug&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
