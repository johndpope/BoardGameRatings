			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So&amp;hellip;been through a lot have you? Motor vehicle accident, total humiliation, family murdered? No? Ah&amp;hellip;a bunch of guys tried to kill you. I figured it was something like that or we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be having this conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was there a moment where every cell in your body cried out and you felt every emotion at the same time? Did you feel like you could do anything and were one with the universe for a split second? That is what we call the Awakening. Congratulations, today is your birthday. Today you are no longer asleep. Instead, you have Awakened. You are a demigod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, things are exactly as you knew before you experienced the Awakening. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the basics. This is stuff you probably already knew or at least suspected. Twelve massive corporations control most of the world&amp;rsquo;s commercial, medical, scientific, and industrial production via a plethora of subsidiaries. To some extent, governments still hold megacorporations in check and the media is a mixed bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you don&amp;rsquo;t know is that you&amp;rsquo;re now knee deep in a war for the survival of our world. Good Luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Olympus, Inc where modern-day demigods and mythical creatures battle in the shadows for the future of our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Olympus, Inc  combines the vibe of the cyberpunk genre with modern espionage and urban fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the book you will find&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Several New Edges and Hindrances&lt;br/&gt;    Details On Six Of The Olympians Gods And Their Corporations&lt;br/&gt;    Three Types Of Demigods&lt;br/&gt;    List of Powers For Each Demigod Bloodline&lt;br/&gt;    Amazing Adventure Generator&lt;br/&gt;    So much more!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
