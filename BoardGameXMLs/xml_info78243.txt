			<description>The simple, yet challenging, strategic card game where you match your cards to continue your chain. But beware, as your opponents may add to your chain, breaking your chain or you may be forced to loose your links and double points.&lt;br/&gt;Source: [ The Game Crafter].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step Chain is a card game where players compete to create the longest connecting chain of cards, while trying to keep their pile of broken links (cards that could not be played) from building up. Players take turns playing cards from their hands on to their chains or the chains of their opponents. The chains must match both the color and position on the card. The basic set includes three colors and three possible positions. Players can also stop an opponent's chain from extending by playing an End Chain card which forces the player to play a different End Chain card to start their chain again. At then end of a round, scores are added up 1 pt for each card in the chain while deducting points for cards in their broken links pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
