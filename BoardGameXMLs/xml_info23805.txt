			<description>From publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the Annual Alien Conference and the aliens are stuck on the moon without transportation. This is your chance to take an alien home! Maybe not your home... but it's your job to get the aliens back to their home planets. In this trick-taking card game the highest card wins the round. Call out &amp;quot;Beam Me Up&amp;quot; when you have collected three aliens from the same home planet and a Space Racer will come to the rescue. The player who send the most aliens home by the end of the game wins the title of Star Space Traffic Controller!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in rounds with each player trying to win tricks by playing the highest numbered card. For every trick won, the player who played the highest card gets to choose 1 card from the trick to keep and add to his Beam Me Up line. The object is to get 3 cards with matching elementals in your Beam Me Up line so a Space Racer can be launched to come and transport the aliens home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
