							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Purifying Snow Monastery Gazetteer</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Purifying Snow Monastery was founded 500 years ago by a monk of the yellow order who felt that only a harsh environment can form a strong body and that only a strong body can house the perfect soul. After getting the permission from his abbot, Fei Fu wandered to the Mountains of the North and climbed the highest of these mountains to found his monastery in a cave complex. Quickly, he attracted followers among the people of the mountains due to his healing arts and deep wisdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 150 years a powerful fortress had been carved into the rock that housed the original cave and Fei's followers lived decently of the food given to them by the locals in return for their protection. It was around this time that a vengeful Emperor sought to crush the power of the monks and mutilated Tao Dao, the founder of the Steps of the Wind style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite these dangers, the monastery prospered and with the new fighting style having become a cornerstone of their philosophy, the monks were left alone for the remainder of their history. In fact they decreased contact to the outside even further and few people can claim to have seen one of the monks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
