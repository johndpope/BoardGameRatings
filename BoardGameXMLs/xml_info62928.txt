							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ralios</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once home to the grim and mysterious Stygian Empire, Ralios is now a possession of the God Learner Empire. For many years it was ruled by dukes who, as vassals of the Emperor, owed revenues and soldiers to the imperial treasury. The region still reels from a war waged by the Emperor against his dukes and viscounts, who he accused of rebellion. Now imperial functionaries administer the area directly, fuelling local resentment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the God Learners lay claim to all of Ralios, large portions of it remain ungovernable. Outlaws and troublemakers able to defend their own rights of person and property can always make a life for themselves in these places, no matter how out of favour they might be with the putative authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from the city-states of Safelster, detailed in Glorantha: The Second Age, Ralios contains a tremendous variety of nations, wildlands and conflicts.This product expands the core campaign setting beyond Safelster and into the remainder of Ralios&amp;rsquo; lands, notably the Eastern Wilds (including Saug, Delela and Corolaland) and Vesmonstran (including Ballid, Telmoria, Guhan and Ormsland).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
