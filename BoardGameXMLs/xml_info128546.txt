							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shadowrun Supplemental (Issue 10 - 1999)</name>
									
			<description>From the Editorial Verbiage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to #10. This is the big one - the giant move up to double digits. Ordinarily that would be cause to celebrate, but this is extra special, because with this issue I&amp;rsquo;ve taken what will hopefully be the big steps in pushing this magazine to greater heights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No longer do I say I when I refer to the future of the magazine, or when I talk about reading your submission and getting back to you, I now say we. For the first time in the two plus years since starting TSS, the magazine has a staff. It has more structure than it as ever had before. It has a future should I decide I no longer wish to work on the magazine. The changes have revitalized my outlook towards the magazine, and I look forward to working on many more issues. It&amp;rsquo;s a long way until triple digits, though..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also means I get the chance to delegate a bit of work around, which I&amp;rsquo;m sure the people who send in submissions and then don&amp;rsquo;t hear back from me for weeks at a time appreciate. I also have some more organization on my end regarding this, so those problems should be left in the dust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something else that&amp;rsquo;s important to some readers - there is no longer a Word or RTF version of the magazine. The reason for that is simple - issues 1 through 9 were compiled in Word &amp;lsquo;95 and &amp;lsquo;97, so distributing the Word/RTF version was no problem. The magazine is now compiled in Adobe Pagemaker, which does not produce those types of files. I apologize for this, but those of you who use MS Word know that it can be a difficult program at the best of times, and I&amp;rsquo;ve run out of patience with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to give a special thanks to the people who have been so instrumental and encouraging during these last few months, and who helped so much with this issue. You guys and gals know who you are, and I&amp;rsquo;m doubling your pay! Unfortunately, double nothing is still nothing, but I love ya!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
