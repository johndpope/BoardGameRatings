							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Edda</name>
									
			<description>The great World Tree is rotting...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forces of Asgard and Vanaheim have turned against one another.  The minions of Jotunheim and Svartalfheim have gone insane.  Diseased, toxic creatures spew forth into Midgard, and the gods, once protectors of that land, have forsaken humankind in their blind rage against one another.  Once their sacred protectorate, Midgard is now their battleground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Last Edda, players take on the role of one of six Norse gods and do battle, taking control of the monstrosities pouring out of the tainted Yggdrasil, in order to defeat their rival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Edda blends the mechanics of player combat and deck building card games.  Each turn, a player has the option of directing monsters from a common pool at his opponent, while his opponent has the opportunity to defend the attack by playing unit cards from his hand.  The turn also provides an opportunity for players to buy cards from personal and common supplies, and construct buildings and artifacts that remain in play and help you to defend and attack more effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yggdrasil, the World Tree is rotting.  The air grows colder and drier by the day.  Murmurs of Fimbulvetr and Ragnarok can be heard across Midgard.  Which of the gods is strong enough to survive the coming storm?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
