							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Future Heroes (Extreme Future)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb: &lt;br/&gt;In the extreme future, the galaxy is a crowded place. There are thousands of inhabited worlds and intelligent species, and very few of them get along with each other. But there are pockets of order and peace.  &lt;br/&gt; One of these areas is called the Core Worlds, and it must be forever on guard against alien attack, elder creatures, supervillains, robots run amok, and many other threats. The Core Worlds however are protected by a valiant group of superheroes, and they use their incredible powers to defend their future civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Heroes is a role-playing game designed to simulate a superhero comic book world, where the heroes are based in the extreme future, fighting against a future backdrop of spaceships, robots and superscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Heroes has an innovative split between abilities and powers. All heroes have a single ability type, and all their individual powers are derived from this. As the superhero progresses and gains experience they can increase the effectiveness of their powers and gain entirely new powers by training and focusing their ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powers are defined by the effect they have, so an energy blast is the same power, regardless of whether it represents a laser beam, ice powers, or lightning. This simple system allows superheroes to be quickly designed, but be every bit as complex and interesting as the heroes of the comic books. So take a look, and blast into a future fit for a superhero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
