			<description>Players again don the red hat with the iconic &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; to once again  foil Bowser and his minions. In this adaptation of the Super Mario World video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, players quest through the Mushroom Kingdom. Each player rolls a die and moves his or her player piece. Depending on what space the player lands on it dictates what they do. If they land on a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; Block they will get coins or, if they are lucky, powerups. If the player lands on an enemy space they must defeat an enemy using items or face losing a turn or coins. Finally, to move from World 1 to World 8 a player will have to successfully complete a mini-game to beat each world. Players collect coins as they journey to World 8 to defeat Bowser. Only with powerups picked up or purchased with their hard earned coins can a player defeat Bowser and rescue Princess Peach. The first player to defeat Bowser is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the mini games you have to beat various enemies using die rolls and augmenting them with powerups players purchase at Toad Houses or find along the trail. In two minigames you have to spend coins to toss them onto a slanted board to do damage to enemies or use the star road as a shortcut to other worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
