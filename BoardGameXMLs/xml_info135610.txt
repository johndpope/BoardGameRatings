							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">G.I. Joe: Battle for DC</name>
									
			<description>The date is December 8, 1987. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev are set to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The Cold War is fast thawing and only one organization can prevent it: COBRA. These terrorists have launched a massed attack aimed at crippling both the USA and USSR and making sure the Cold War continues. To achieve this, they have attacked Washington D.C. and captured Reagan. Gobachev would have been captured, but G. I. Joe, having received a last minute warning, has deployed. Now in the streets of America&amp;rsquo;s capital the Joes must save the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G.I. Joe: Battle for DC combines aspects of Battle Line and Batman: Poker gegen Joker. Players battle over locations in Washington DC by laying down cards representing various characters from the G.I. Joe universe. Each has a numerical rating from one to 12 and a color suit, allowing for card combinations that will aid you in the battle for DC. In addition, the Joes must protect Gorbachev and rescue Reagan.There are also special cards which can alter the battle and a naval control aspect that allows players to draw an extra card if they control the Potomac River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
