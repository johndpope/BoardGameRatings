			<description>Description from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;ASTEROID FIELD CHASE Han Solo made the decision to pilot the Millennium Falcon into an asteroid field in an attempt to lose the Imperial pursuers. ENDOR ATTACK The Galactic Empire established an outpost on the planet that included a shield generator complex to protect the incomplete Death Star II which was in orbit around the moon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play Star Wars Box Busters each player needs their own Battle Cube, which is a small folding diorama. Each Battle Cube has a unique combination of capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Asteroid Field Chase is exclusive to this two-pack, Endor Attack was also sold as an individually packaged item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
