			<description>Author's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Golden Oceans is set on the exotic world of Drae, a dangerous wasteland distinguished by its oceans of abrasive silt. These sandy oceans, which sparkle in the light of the setting sun, were first explored by the Draeicks, the founders of science and magic. They were the first to conquer the globe but eventually destroyed themselves during an epic conflict which destabilized their society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dark ages have passed but the ruins of the Draeicks still remain scattered in the wilderness. Riding on their shoulders, humanity has advanced from primitive hunters to a diverse web of industrial societies fighting for global supremacy. Though modern inventions promote human prosperity in an inhospitable world, today's poltical climate is one of fierce rivalry, as legions of brutish giants, hordes of insidious feys, and packs of legendary beasts fight for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sail across the Golden Oceans! Fight against a vast conspiracy of corrupt bankers or prevent an evil cult from summoning an elder demon. Retrieve the bounty on an outlaw or save the local villagers from malicious bandits. Prevent a world war with your diplomacy or accompany a scientific expedition. In the game of Golden Oceans you will rely on your equipment for survival, but most importantly you will require creativity and confidence to persevere against all odds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
