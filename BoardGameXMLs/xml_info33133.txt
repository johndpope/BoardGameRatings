							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bomber Raid</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:  The object of the game is to bomb enemy objectives and, at the same time, to spot and bring down attacking enemy bombers before they drop their bombs.   Equipment includes the game board, two dice, 2 searchlight beams and 8 bombers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place the searchlight on the board with the small end on the X about the searchlight crew and the large end pointing to the 1.  Play is alternately done and is based on the roll of a die.  The roll can be used to either move a plane or the searchlight.  A roll of 6 means the player loses his turn.  Planes may be moved in any direction but must be moved the full distance of the die roll in that same direction.  The searchlight can be moved in one direction, up or down, based on the die roll.  A plane is shot down when either it is on the same line as an enemy airplane at the end of the enemy's turn or it crosses the searchlight beam.  A score is obtained if the plane can cross over the targets in enemy territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the highest bombing total after all planes have been brought down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
