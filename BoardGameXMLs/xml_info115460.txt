			<description>Diner Dash 5: BOOM! is the 5th installment of the Diner Dash series, it also features voice-acting to give more life to the characters. It was developed by PlayFirst and released to the public on March 16, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious figure is lurking around Flo's diner, grabbing his bucket of paint and removing the word &amp;quot;Fat&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;Fat Free Breakfast&amp;quot;, which makes Flo's Diner looks like it's having a free breakfast promo. The next day, Flo and Chef Cookie are surprised by the sign, unfortunately it is too late. After she opens the diner, customers start running and overloading the diner, and as a result, Flo's Diner explodes. &lt;br/&gt;Players can play at 5 different venues, each venue contains 10 story mode level and after finishing the venue, a bonus level is given to players, in note that the bonus level goal is extremely high, and the shift time is longer than usual. At each venue, players are given a challenge to protect the tables from disasters such as: winds, earthquakes, rains, and fuse box problems however, these disasters can be avoided by buying the upgrades available in the upgrade shop. Unlike the previous Diner Dash games, players can purchase upgrades during the start of a level, these upgrades can be bought using the money earned in the previous shift. Some upgrades are permanent (example: faster chef, faster shoes, and disaster protection) but some are just for one level and cost more expensive than any upgrades (example: podium helper, salad bar helper, and extra hands) Players can also customize the diner and the venues, the venues can be customized at several levels, there are four different items to be customized, after choosing which item to be customized, players can choose one of several different venue upgrades, in the end all four of customizer options will be finished and the player is awarded with a venue medal. The Diner can also be customized, unlike venue customizer, the Diner customizer objects will unlock one by one with finishing levels. Players can also enjoy all new customer and a new feature: townies. Townies are one of Flo's customer that didn't have any patients, they come in many different forms, they can become a regular customer by dragging them to the correct group, if the player reunites them with the correct group, they'll receive a bonus points. There's also a challenge where players have to drag Hal the hungryman into a disaster table, where he must fix a small problem from the customer, after dragging Hal, player will earn bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Diner Dash 5: BOOM!&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
