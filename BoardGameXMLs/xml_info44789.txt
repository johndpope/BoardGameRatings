							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chybisa</name>
									
			<description>A collection of three previously-published Encyclopedia Harnica articles, collected into a single product.  From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chybisa&lt;br/&gt;A tiny feudal kingdom in eastern H&amp;acirc;rn, ruled by Verlid VII. Chybisa maintains a fragile independence from Kaldor and Melderyn, both of whose kings have claims on her crown. Included is a full-color Atlas Map, plus details on the history, politics, economy, and clans of this surprisingly wealthy kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burzyn&lt;br/&gt;The largest town and the royal seat of Chybisa. Burzyn is strategically located on the south bank of the Ulmerien, guarding the only bridge to cross this river. It is a rich trading center, dominated by perhaps the most impressive castle on H&amp;acirc;rn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H&amp;acirc;rnic Law&lt;br/&gt;A general review of H&amp;acirc;rnic codes, crimes, and punishments. No civilized society can function without a legal system and, even on H&amp;acirc;rn, the administration of justice is surprisingly complex. Includes clan and feudal law, royal justice, forest law, trials and enforcement, plus a list of the most common crimes and the typical punishments they bring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
