			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;As the title suggests, this game is about two things, Doom and Cookies. In the game you play the part of children trying to escape the orphanage of Mr Keaton and his wife. The orphanage itself is a large and rather run down building in the middle of nowhere. It is not as easy as you might think to escape it, as it is full of long twisting corridors and has a very confusing layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set sometime between the Victorian and Edwardian eras when technology was dangerous and few people paid much attention to Health and Safety guidelines. However, the perils that you face are all going to be of your own making, but the creation of which will reward you with cookies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
