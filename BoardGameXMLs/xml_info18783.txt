			<description>Each player chooses a candidate as a playing piece. The gameboard is a square track of fifty-nine spaces. Each player starts at a different start space, which acts as campaign headquarters. All fifty states and the District of Columbia are represented on the spaces. The other spaces permit the player to draw a chance card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On one&amp;rsquo;s turn one rolls two dice and advances on the gameboard. Rolling &amp;ldquo;doubles&amp;rdquo; earns the player a free turn. When a player lands on a state a second time, the player adds that state&amp;rsquo;s electoral votes to one&amp;rsquo;s tally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player collects 270 electoral votes, the player must still roll &amp;ldquo;doubles&amp;rdquo; to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
