							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ortho Cat&#039;s 2: Les homophones grammaticaux</name>
									
			<description>The game is on 18 grammatical homophones :&lt;br/&gt;ou/o&amp;ugrave;, on/ont, a/&amp;agrave;, est/et, ce/se, c'est/s'est/ses/ces, son/sont, leur/leurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a stack of cards face down in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;The 18 ending cards are placed at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each his turn, players turn a card over, give the sound of the ending and then read the sentence. The other players must hit on the right ending as fast as possible. The fastest player receives the &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; card. And you start over,the next player turns his card over...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the &amp;quot;sentence&amp;quot; cards have been given out, each player counts the number of cards he has won.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one with the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
