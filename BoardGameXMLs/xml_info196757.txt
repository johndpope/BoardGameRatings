			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players may control some aspect of a single &amp;quot;Main Character&amp;quot;, though one player is identified primarily with the Main Character.  This Main Character has four Traits - Work, Family, Romance, and Hobbies.  These have narrative values.  The Main Character also has a single Attribute - Self-Esteem.  This is associated (at first) with a d6.  A separate component of the Main Character is called the Shadow, primarily identified with another player.  The Shadow has Traits called Tensions and a single Attribute - Self-loathing.  This is associated (at first) with a d12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is tracked on a character sheet that somewhat resembles an accounting spreadsheet.  The various columns receive entries and during play the appearance of this sheet informs the &amp;quot;Elevator&amp;quot; portion of the game's name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
