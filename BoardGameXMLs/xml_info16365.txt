							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mickey Mouse Club Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a &amp;quot;Cootie&amp;quot; type game in which players try to assemble one of the Mickey Mouse Club characters. On your turn you spin a spinner to see what body parts you may add. The characters MUST be assembled in an upright position, so the legs must be added first, then the body, and lastly the arms and head. The first player to complete a character wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
