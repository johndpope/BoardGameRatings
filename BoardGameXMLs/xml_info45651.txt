			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WAR IS OVER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forces of Thera have been pushed from Barsaive's borders. But what of the aftermath? The Denairastas family holds Jerris in its iron grip. The orks of Cara Fahd continue to struggle as its tribes strive to become a nation in more than just name. Vivane has become a city of the living dead. King Neden of Throal has locked himself away in his chambers. The Horror Clouds are rampaging across Barsaive, leaving devastation in their wake. And where have the Horror Stalkers gone? First there was the darkness of the Scourge, and then there was the darkness of War, and the dark days seem far from over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barsaive in Chaos is a campaign supplement for Earthdawn Second Edition. It details six significant events that span the year after the fall of Vivane, outlining an epic-style campaign. Each event can also stand alone to form a mini-campaign, and they can be used in any combination. When these events are linked, the characters are placed in the center of a battle for Barsaive's social and political stability. Barsaive in Chaos is intended for characters of Second Circle and above, of any Discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barsaive in Chaos introduces Second Edition Rules for the Purifier and Horror Stalker Disciplines, and the Lightbearers Secret Society. It also includes an extensive bestiary of Undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
