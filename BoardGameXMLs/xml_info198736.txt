			<description>In 2013 the board-game known as Police Precinct ONLY came in cardboard form, BUT in 2016 that all changed.  Now you can get it in digital form too (available in both iOS and Android as a pure co-op -- Dirty Cop available in cardboard only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award winning game is widely recognized for being one of the most highly thematic cooperative boardgames of all time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Police Precinct utilizes real cops for consultants, contains real cops for characters, and is used to train real cops!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on 2nd Edition artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple games can be played and saved all at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six primary difficulty levels (from Rookie up to Chief) and thousands of additional custom levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can play in either Pass-and-Play mode or Online mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PASS-AND-PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;within this mode players can start solo games controlling 2-6 players, or play with a group of friends (in person).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONLINE:&lt;br/&gt;Within this mode players can create games and invite others to join in.  These games can be played in real-time OR asynchronously.  In fact games can be conducted in a combination of real-time (during certain phases of the game) AND asynchronous (at other phases of the game -- as players wish -- all in the same game session!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
