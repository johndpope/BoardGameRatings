							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Robot That Totally Saved Cleveland</name>
									
			<description>Using a 5 card hand, players take turns attempting to build a robot that will be used to defeat the Evil Dr. Head Case and his Mutant Monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robots are made up of three cards. A head card, a body card, and a feet card. The cards work together to build robots in fun combinations. As the players build the robots, they can end up with names like &amp;quot;A funky‐right ol'‐pulverizer&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Mr Electric the‐crushing‐bubble bot&amp;quot;. Players also have the option of attaching 1 add‐on card to the robot. The add‐on cards are things like &amp;quot;Lazers for Eyes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bulletproof Boots&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Razor Sharp Dentures&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is quick and simple to learn. Once the players have a round or two under their belt the game is fun and everyone enjoys building the robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few other features to the game like the &amp;quot;Bargain Center&amp;quot; which allows players to grab a &amp;quot;Crumpled&amp;quot; head, or an &amp;quot;As seen on tv&amp;quot; body part to finish out their robot in a pinch. Using the bargain center parts might seem like a disadvantage but be careful. That player might be holding the &amp;quot;Dick Jone's Rust Remover&amp;quot; card which allows them to polish it up and make it shiny and new.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
