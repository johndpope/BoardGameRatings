			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Middle Ages, a witch panic swept Europe, holding many nations in its thrall for centuries. Men and women believed in divine magic without doubt, miracles given as a gift from on high. If these were real, then evil must have agents in the world as well. Agents known as Witches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between 1200 and 1792 AD, when the last witch was executed in Europe, conservative estimates place the number of executions at between 50 and 100,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clash of History: Witch Trials, brings this time of panic into your historically-themed OGL fantasy games. Providing a new core class, the Witch, along with a new Prestige Class, the Inquisitor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clash of History: Witch Trials also gives a complete overview of the witch trial period, the most popular witch hunter manuals and ways to bring a witch hunt into your ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether your players are the hunter or the hunted, whether your campaign is set in Europe or is straight from your imagination, Clash of History: Witch Trials is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
