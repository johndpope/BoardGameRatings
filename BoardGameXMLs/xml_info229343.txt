							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grand History of Eberron</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Eberron is one of swashbuckling action and dark heroic fantasy, a world where magic is harnessed in the form of fantastic technology and conspiracies and intrigue abound. The result of a ground-breaking campaign setting search undertaken by Wizards of the Coast for the Third Edition of the Dungeon and Dragons game in 2002, the Eberron setting, created by Keith Baker, was eventually chosen out of more than 11,000 one-page proposals from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The features that first set Eberron apart for Wizards of the Coast and for thousands of other fans, Dungeon Masters and players alike was that it combined traditional medieval fantasy with pulp action and dark, intrigue-laden adventure. The world of Eberron possesses an incredibly rich fictional history stretching back for millennia that has been built on the deeds of countless heroes, potent magic and the suffering of a long, devastating, continent-spanning war. And, unlike in more traditional fantasy settings, in the wake of this Last War the world has emerged into an age when life cannot be painted in the monochromatic shades of black and white but only in a thousand shades of gray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This massive fan-compiled document draws from dozens of commercial sources to present a unified and comprehensive history of the Eberron campaign setting.  Note the contents are derived from commercially published materials - attributions are given, but the document is copyright-infringing as the materials are used without permission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
