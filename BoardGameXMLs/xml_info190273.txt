							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dregordia</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who...and What are the Dregordians!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though they look like 7 and a half foot tall crocodiles, they have emotions anyone could understand.  These are a people who enjoy learning from the other races.  They've long interacted with the Fae and have been a stalwart barrier against the Kal-A-Nar Empire's expension to the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A race, strange and Alien.  Some think these folk are behind the Dragon cult but that couldn't be farther from the truth. These people follow The Way and choose logic and control over transitory feelings. Its probably a good thing...given that a moment of anger could mean the dismemberment of those less hardy races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come and travel in the living jungle and along the river to Ssatay.  The harmony within is shown in the architecture, art and culture of this people - yet they have lived through generations of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains everything required to base a campaign or character within Dregordia.  You'll learn the history, weapons, art, beliefs and rituals of this strange race.  There's even a bit of politics and even a secret or two we've shared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
