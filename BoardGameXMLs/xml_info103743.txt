			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are trying to help a rabbit eat as many carrots as possible. You have access to a leash that can grab one or more dogs to pull them to either the right or left side of the screen, thus clearing the path for the rabbit. The game continues to scroll vertically throughout, there are various objects the rabbit can grab to assist, such as a whistle which freezes many dogs, and what appears to be a back pack, which give you a helicopter like ability to fly. The more carrots the rabbit eats, the more you score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
