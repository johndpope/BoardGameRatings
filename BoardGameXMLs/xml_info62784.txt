			<description>Appearing in Europa Magazine #28, El Alamein (Europa Demonstration Battle #1) is a specially numbered 4 page pullout in the center of the magazine. The scenario requires the counters, and map 19, from Western Desert, and except for a few variants, relies on the rule sets from Western Desert or Balkan Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El Alamein was created to illustrate Europa's ability to model &amp;quot;an intense, set-piece World War II battle. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Introduction points out, &amp;quot;[El Alamein] was generaled by two commanders operating under severe operational constraints: Rommel was to hold at all costs; Montegomery, however, had the luxury of a logistical base that could support his imperative. Consequently the battle, for its scale, had more violence and finality than the typical WWII action, and more clearing of hexes than we are likely to see in a single turn of Europa. The battle thus serves to demonstrate the need for some special rules to address such a situation, and provides a small test case for &amp;quot;designer's choice&amp;quot; rules suggestions...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
