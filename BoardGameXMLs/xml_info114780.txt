Survive in these lethal waters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tilt the device to control Tiny Fish. Eat cookies to gain health and avoid the toxic particles as they take away his energy.

The difficulty will increase as time passes (number of toxic elements, lack of cookies, presence of the black fish, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;★ Intuitive tilt-based controls &lt;br/&gt;★ 20 levels with different challenges (survive, clear checkpoints, follow rings, etc...) &lt;br/&gt;★ 3 star performance score on each level &lt;br/&gt;★ Game Center achievements and leader boards &lt;br/&gt;★ 2 arcade survival levels &lt;br/&gt;★ Cartoonish and colorful Retina Display graphics &lt;br/&gt;★ Atmospheric and entertaining soundtrack and sounds &lt;br/&gt;★ Tilt calibration controls (normal, tap down and auto)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
