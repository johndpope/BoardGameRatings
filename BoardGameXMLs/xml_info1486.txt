			<description>A very strange game from the Thomson Bros.  Each player attempts to collect a set of 4 items and deliver them to his home.  You go to stores owned by other players and buy them but early in the game it becomes night and then the only recourse is to steal them.  It looks like a monopoly clone on the surface but is much more chaotic.  One player plays a thief who can move pretty quickly using special paths.  One player is the Mayor who has a lot of money.  The other players play merchants who have a store and residence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 tokens are placed in each store and any player (except a thief) may enter a store and buy one.  You can only carry one item at a time but you may drop any item at any time.  You can enter stores that are closed and residences to steal items but if caught you may end up going to jail which is harsh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game falls in the light and wacky catagory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
