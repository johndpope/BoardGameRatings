							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fette Ernte</name>
									
			<description>Fette Ernte is German and means big harvest. It is a simple and fun card game for the whole family. It teaches about vegetables, farming and healthy nutrition in a playful way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will harvest most vegetables?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is it to win most cards. Each vegetable has its own strengths in different categories (eg. period of storage, vitamin c etc.). One player chooses the category for the current round and all player choose one of their five hand cards simultaneously. The player with the best vegetable card in the respective category wins against and collects the inferior vegetable cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, weather, pests and illness cards are executed first and trump specific vegetable cards. For instance leaf blight would win against potatoes. So weather, pests and illnesses  might ruin your plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
