							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Living Kingdoms of Kalamar: Information Briefing</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 563, Pekal was a nation on the brink of invasion, but plans were being made to try to insure the safety of the nation and prevent a cold war from suddenly becoming a very active and bloody conflict. Prince Kafen was unable to prevent this from happening, however, and in the summer of 565, the Tokite Army and the Kalamaran Legions appeared on the doorstep of Pekal, anxious for entry. The brave adventurers of Pekal managed to fend off the initial wave, but the navy of Pekal was severely weakened in the first blow, and the army has been recruiting heavily ever since the first incursion onto Pekalese soil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
