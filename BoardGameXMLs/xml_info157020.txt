			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devilish Duos Issue Five Introduces the wicked Mister Crime and Mister Punishment, two master criminals who are poised to take over the underworld of your favorite superhero setting! Suitable for games of any power level, these two are particularly well-suited to &amp;quot;Iron Age&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Street Level&amp;quot; superhero campaigns where the heroes range in Power Levels from 6 to 8. With Mister Crime's devious plans, however, even more powerful heroes will consider these two too dangerous to ignore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the detailed backgrounds and stats for the two main characters are short discussions about how Criminal Masterminds and Torture Scenes can be played in your supers campaigns using the Mutants and Masterminds rules to your advantage. You will also find some Plots and Ploys to use as story seeds, and a couple of minor NPC stats to help nurture those seeds along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the download are Hero Lab files for the title characters, as well as jpeg image files to print out and show your players! Also, we've included a page of standees for the characters so you can print them out on cardstock and use them at your gaming table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
