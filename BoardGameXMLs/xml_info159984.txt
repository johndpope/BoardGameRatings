			<description>From the introduction:  &amp;quot;Scutarii is intended mainly for recreating historical warfare prior to the introduction of gunpowder firearms and cannons.  The scale of the rules is designed for fighting the larger battles of antiquity, where armies would number 25,000 men or more, on an average sized table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missile and melee combat has been designed to reflect the fatigue and decline in fighting ability during the course of the battle.  While it is possible to defeat an opposing force with missile fire it will take quite a while compared to engaging in melee.  As troops take casualties, their morale will decline with one side usually routing from the field while the victor will usually only have a few losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for battlefield tactics, one thing you will find is that using multiple lines and a reserve, though creating a narrower front, will have an advantage over an army arrayed in a single battle line with no reserve.  Attacking with fresh troops against fatigued enemies will usually result in victory for the army with the fresh troops.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
