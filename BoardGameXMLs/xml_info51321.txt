			<description>This is is a promo that Frontier ran the summer of 1983. If a travel agency had this &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; displayed in a window and someone that worked there was wearing the buttons supplied in the game...they would win a free travel award from Frontier Airlines.  Secret frontier employees did the checking.  There were also entry forms in the game for other prizes.&lt;br/&gt;Game play involves spinning a spinner to arrive at one of nine destinations. Each person starts with $100,000 of seed money. At each destination, you move around a circular track and follow instructions on the spaces until you return to the airport. Las Vegas is an exception and has cards rather than a track. Once the last player leaves the ninth unique destination, the game is over. Whoever has the most money after returning the seed is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
