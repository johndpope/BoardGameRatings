			<description>Back of box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a raid by the wicked MOLEMEN, agents of the evil MUMM-RA entered the CATS-LAIR, kidnapped several members of the Thundercats team, and stole the eye of Thundera, the magical jewel which holds the mystical power of the sword of omens.  LION-O was out on a mission when the raid took place but vows that, as the eye was given into his safekeeping, he must go to the Castle Plun-dar, rescue his teammates and retrieve the eye.  Can LION-O battle his way past MUMM-RA&amp;rsquo;s henchmen in the forests and underground caverns, and return the power to the sword of omens and glory to the Thundercats name?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amiga TenStar Games Pack version introduction&lt;br/&gt;This arcade action game sees the main character stalking through an alien planet, represented by horizontally scrolling screens, hitting enemies over the head and jumping over obstacles. You can gain extra lives and weapons by striking shields and mushrooms. The action is complicated by the fact that you have a limited time to complete each level. Once that time expires, your enemies stream from all directions, making your life a whole lot harder. The graphics are clear and large including three receding backgrounds varying in colour and detail. Although the animation has a cartoon feel to it, Thundercats is a powerful adventure game in its own right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
