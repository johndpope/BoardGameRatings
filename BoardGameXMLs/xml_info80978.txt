			<description>Stinger is a vertical/side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game released by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment in 1987. It is the North American localization of Moero! TwinBee: Cinnamon Hakushi wo Sukue!​ (もえろツインビー シナモン博士を救え!, Burn! TwinBee: The Rescue of Dr. Cinnamon?), the second game in the TwinBee series, which was originally released in Japan for the Family Computer Disk System expansion in 1986 and later re-released as a standard Famicom cartridge in 1993. Moero! TwinBee was the first of two TwinBee sequels released for the Famicom, followed by TwinBee 3 in 1989, which was released only in Japan. A few changes were made to the NES version, Stinger, from its Famicom counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Moero!
