							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scummy Monkies: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>The Scummy Monkies are &amp;ldquo;The Best Worst Band in the World&amp;rdquo; and they&lt;br/&gt;have a big show today! The goal is to create plenty of stories, songs, and&lt;br/&gt;dance moves for the show and finish without too many mistakes. The&lt;br/&gt;player to do this most successfully wins the game. But beware the Llama!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;1. Take out the stickers and the colored chips and place one sticker on&lt;br/&gt;each of the chips. It doesn't matter which sticker goes on which chip.&lt;br/&gt;You get to be creative already!&lt;br/&gt;2. Take out the cards and set them in an easy-to-reach place by the game&lt;br/&gt;board. Keep the die, timer, pencil, and paper handy as well.&lt;br/&gt;3. Each player should chose one of the game pieces for themselves and&lt;br/&gt;place it on the starting space. Chose carefully! The character you pick&lt;br/&gt;can impact the game.&lt;br/&gt;4. Roll the die to determine who goes first. The player with the highest&lt;br/&gt;roll goes first and then play proceeds clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;Starting The Game&lt;br/&gt;To start just roll the die and move your game piece clockwise that many&lt;br/&gt;spaces. Draw the card that corresponds to the color space you landed&lt;br/&gt;on. Follow instructions on the card. If you run out of cards for a color&lt;br/&gt;that space becomes a &amp;ldquo;roll-again&amp;rdquo; space.&lt;br/&gt;Winning and Ending the Game&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player lands on the finish space. You must land&lt;br/&gt;exactly in the finish space. For example if you are four spaces away&lt;br/&gt;from finish you must roll a four or less to progress further. If they roll&lt;br/&gt;higher their turn has ended.&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends all the players count the cards they have in each&lt;br/&gt;category. For each card category that a player has the most cards they&lt;br/&gt;get one point. The player who reached the finish first also receives one&lt;br/&gt;point. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
