			<description>Promotional game for a house improvements company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board looks interesting, with a track around the edge of a house which has a wall taken away so that you can see workmen in every room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is not so interesting, being a close relative of games like Ludo, Pachisi and Mensch. To spice it up, if you land on a brown square you get to draw a card and must follow the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all four of their men home is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
