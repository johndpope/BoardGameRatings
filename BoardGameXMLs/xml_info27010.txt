			<description>Each player will act as quizmaster for another player so everyone can compete.  A random category for each round is determined by the Bid Wheel. Every correct answer earns the player fifty dollars. A round consists of four questions for each player. The winner of round chooses a card which represents a treasure chest and its treasure. The player also spins the Bid Wheel. The player may now choose between the known amount on the Bid Wheel (range: $250 to $2000) or take whatever happens to be on the card (range: $0 to $25,000)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who chooses and keeps the $25,000 treasure chest card is the immediate winner. Otherwise, the game goes the full four rounds. The winner is the person who has the most money after four rounds of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on a popular television series of the fifties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
