			<description>The game contains 15 wooden houses which have different colors on both sides and a hole in the middle. A wooden marker is put into each hole. The first player gets the sixteenth marker and flips over a house, hoping that it matches the color of the marker. If so, the player keeps the house and the game continues with the marker that was in the house originally. If not, it's the next player's turn. The player with most houses at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
