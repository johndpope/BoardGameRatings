			<description>Le Contrat Impossible (&amp;quot;the impossible contract&amp;quot;) is a roll-and-move game set in the &amp;quot;Gaston Lagaffe&amp;quot; comics universe. One of the running gags of the Gaston Lagaffe comic books involves a businessman, Demesmaeker visiting the office building in which Gaston work to sign contracts with Gaston's boss, Prunelle. Each time the contracts are about to be signed Gaston screws up or tests one of his inventions and the contracts are ruined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player roll dice and move around the board, attempting to collect three Contracts cards representing Lagaffe, Demesmaeker and Prunelle. Once the three cards are gathered, the player must exchange them for a &amp;quot;Signed Contracts&amp;quot; cards and take it to the photocopier to win. Cards are drawn or taken from other players according to the board space the player lands on. If a player can't give a card to another player, he receives a &amp;quot;blunder&amp;quot; token. If he has three, he exchanges his blunder tokens for the &amp;quot;mega-blunder&amp;quot; card, which prevents him from getting a &amp;quot;Signed Contracts&amp;quot; card or using the photocopier. The only way of getting rid of a &amp;quot;mega-blunder&amp;quot; card is to wait until another player gets it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
