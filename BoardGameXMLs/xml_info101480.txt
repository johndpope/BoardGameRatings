							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abstract Sea</name>
									
			<description>Description:&lt;br/&gt;Abstract sea is the first of what we hope will be a trilogy of different shoot 'em ups (shmups) done in this abstract style. This is a sort of tribute to those of you who liked the neon games, but wished they were keyboard controlled.&lt;br/&gt;You control a lone gun boat in a battle against the enemy naval force, you must survive as long as you can while trying to rack up a massive score by making huge kill combos and collecting all the bonus points dropped by enemy ships.&lt;br/&gt;This is a game very much based on style and music, we hope you enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards&lt;br/&gt;Newgrounds.com - More than 25k views&lt;br/&gt;Newgrounds.com - Daily 3rd Place - 02/27/2007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
