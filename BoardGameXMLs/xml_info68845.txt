							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steel Bonnets: Skirmish Rules for 16th Century Border Reivers</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction of the rules set:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fraser's book The Steel Bonnets gives a good history of the cattle raids back and forth across the Anglo-Scottish border during Elizabeth's reign. Having visited Hexham, capital of the Middle March last year, and toured the first purpose-built gaol in England, my interest in the Border Reivers was rekindled and I devised the following game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Being both a wargamer and a role player I was interested in developing a fast, easy set of rules suitable for a skirmish encounter while instilling a sense of proprietary interest on the part of the players with their figures. Too often, I find, tabletop generals are willing to sacrifice their regiments with gleeful abandon, heedless of the actual cost. Role playing games generate a notion of investment and caution, with characters developed over a series of adventures. Steel Bonnets attempts to recreate the care and concern a reiver patriarch would feel for his sons and gillies when they are on raid.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale: One turn equals one minute; one figure equals one man; half an inch equals one yard. 20mm or 25mm figures are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although a miniatures game, figures have individual characteristics and skills that develop over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple system includes rules for Spotting and Victory Point, as well as everything need for combat. Includes four scenarios: The Cattle Raid, Black Mail, Government Raid, &amp;amp; Gaol Break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set appear in Wargames Illustrated #78 (March 1994)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
