							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twin Stars: Escape the Brig</name>
									
			<description>Two cosmic adventurers are in a tricky scenario and must work together. By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guard tosses you into the dark cell and you hear the bolt clank into place. Your cries of &amp;quot;Come back!&amp;quot; are answered only with laughter, and heavy footfalls receding down the long corridor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness, you realize you are not alone. &amp;quot;We have to escape,&amp;quot; the prisoner says, &amp;quot;Now.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Twin Stars: Escape the Brig, two of you are locked up together and need to break free. You can dig a tunnel, but you need to watch out for the guard. There's also a pick that you can use to assist in your escape, but you need to be careful! You must escape to win. If the guard reaches the tunnel you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape the Brig is a scenario in the Twin Stars solo system by Jason Tagmire and Mike Mullins. The game consists of just 3 cards and players will provide their own dice and coins/tokens. Each scenario comes with 2 all-new characters and can be interchanged with others for a very different gaming experience. This is the first in the Twin Stars family and was originally offered as a stretch goal for Button Shy's Pod-X Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
