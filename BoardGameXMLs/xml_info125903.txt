			<description>About Thar Shaddin&lt;br/&gt;Thar Shaddin is an online play-by-post (PbP) roleplaying (RP) game, however it is more appropriately called cooperative fiction. It's an interactive story in which writers collaborate to use their own characters in a unique medieval fantasy environment which is continually being developed and expanded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We focus on writing quality and plot as well as creativity and having fun. That means a fair amount of reading is required to participate properly. You must also have some appreciation for grammar and spelling, although you don't need to be a professional writer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
