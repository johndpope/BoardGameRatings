			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quiet Haven Hotel was supposed to be just a one night shelter for Joe and Lucy Davis. But things soon start to go wrong. Lucy's panic attacks get worse and soon she disappears. And in the morning hotel changes too. Nothing is what it seems anymore. Joe is left alone, trying to understand what is happening, trapped between reality and the nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
