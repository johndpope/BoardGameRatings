			<description>From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entertaining movie mime game that's a real performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for all budding movie moguls!  Teams compete to collect the 6 items necessary to make a film - a director, a male and female lead, a script, an advertising campaign and a location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success is determined by knowledge of films, by miming talents, and by inventiveness and imagination.  Players have 1 minute in which to clue their team into guessing the selected name on the card - by whatever means they can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And in the grand finale, when a team has collected the 6 necessary cards, there's still a chance to steal success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game with simple rules that can provide hours of entertainment - Screen Play is for film addicts everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
