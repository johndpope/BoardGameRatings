			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detroit: Become Human is a cinematic adventure game by QuanticDream, the development studio behind Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as three different main characters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kara - a housekeeper android designed to cook and clean around the house, as well as take care of children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Markus - a caretaker android who begins the game taking care of an aging famous painter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conner - a special android model designed to hunt down deviants, androids who have broken away from their standing operating behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you play through the game, the various characters' stories will intersect with each other.  The game also features a number of crucial decision points that can kill off characters, changing how the remainder of the game plays out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to other QuanticDream games, Detroit heavily features quick time events, where the player must quickly press the correct button sequences to successfully navigate a situation.  Failure to do so can result in the death of a key character, or changing the path to the end of the scene.  The game does feature an easy mode for less experienced players who want to enjoy the story without worrying as much about difficult button sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
