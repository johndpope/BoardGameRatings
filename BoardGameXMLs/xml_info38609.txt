							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Granicus (334 BC)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;Philip II of Macedonia built a powerful army and used it to bring all of Greece under his rule. After his assassination in 336 BC Philip&amp;rsquo;s 20-year-old son Alexander inherited the throne. Alexander promptly crossed the Hellespont into Turkey intent on conquering the mighty Persian Empire.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The first major battle came at the Granicus River. Alexander led his elite Companion cavalry across the river to draw the attention of the Persians. It worked, almost too well. Alexander was nearly killed when the Persians counterattacked, but the tactic worked. Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Macedonian phalanxes were able to cross the river and defeat the Persian army.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. The units portrayed in the game include Infantry, Cavalry, Skirmishers (Javelins and Archers), and Commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
