			<description>&amp;quot;Voter Beware&amp;quot; (SubrogƒÅtor Cave, in Latin) is a political dice  rolling game about Food Truck politics. Bernie Salad, Hilaire, Gervais Juanson, and  Donny Sausage all wish to become President of the Food Truck Association, the political position which controls all of the menus on local food trucks. In this game, one to four players will take turns rolling four dice and assigning them to each candidate, who in turn will utilize the die assigned them based on its value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possible actions include buying influence, buying votes, enhancing your influence with a funding PAC, or delivering a nasty Dirty Trick to an opponent's campaign, lowering their stature with PACs and potentially hurting their ability to compete. At the end of each turn, a Scandal may erupt which damages a candidate's reputation with the voting blocs that they buy votes from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a unique, one to four-player political game that takes between 20-40 minutes  to play, and with simple-to-understand rules but truly difficult decisions each turn, it's perfect for a coffee shop or lunch hour either by yourself or with friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
