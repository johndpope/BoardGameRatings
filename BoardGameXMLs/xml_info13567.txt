			<description>From the Rules&amp;quot;Colonel McCauley, an expert in moon rocketry in OUTER SPACE, must send supplies in a hurry to a station on the moon. The countdown has progressed to X MINUS 10 seconds. The player astronauts man their ships and, with rockets ready to be fired, await Zero hour at the lunching pads. Which fleet of space vehicles will be the first conquer the perils of outer space and accomplish this mission? The excitement of this adventure, the danger faced in clashes with meteors and comets, makes men into space a thrilling game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality a spinner is used to determine takeoff and flight speed of your 4 ships along two crossing orbital paths from the earth to the moon. Piggyback movement on other players ships and events cards are used to add variety and a little strategy to this simple game for ages 9 to 14.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
