			<description>Super Star Soldier is a scrolling shooter video game released in 1990 for the TurboGrafx-16 system. It is the sequel to Star Soldier, and part of a vertical-scrolling shooter series by Hudson Soft. According to the company, many people believed Super Star Soldier's graphics were the best of any TurboChip game. Although the game was popular in Japan, it received less attention from the rest of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a variety of weapons including flame throwers, electricity, spread guns and heat-seeking missiles. It consists of eight levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking place 4 years after Star Soldier, the original galactic invaders known as the Star Brain corps. have returned from their crushing defeat from the Cesear star fighter and they are now led by the ultimate spaceship, Mother Brain. Earth's only defense lies in the Neo Cesear star fighter to finish what was started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Star Soldier&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
