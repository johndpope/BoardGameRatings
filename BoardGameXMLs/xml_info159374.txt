			<description>Cursed! is a card game where fortune favors the cruel. Gather a few friends &amp;rsquo;round the table and see how quickly all those years of bonding and camaraderie can be ripped to shreds with a well placed hex. Strategically protect your own good fortunes (Wealth, Health, Love, Fate, and Luck) while devastating the fortunes of those around you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in Cursed! is dealt a hand of three cards (blessings, curses, or neutrals each in one of five fortunes) and must choose to play one card on herself, one card on an opponent, and sacrifice one card to make a slight alteration to the rules of the game. When a player accumulates curses on three or more fortunes, he is out of the game (play continues until one player is left). If he accumulates blessings on three or more fortunes, he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 104 poker-sized cards in a tuck box and an optional player mat. There is also a print-and-play version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
