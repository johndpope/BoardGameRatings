							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Day of Al&#039;Akbar</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land of Arir &amp;mdash; a once peaceful desert country, dotted with oases, teeming with caravans &amp;mdash; fell into the hand of infidels. The ruler, the dearly loved Sultan Amhara, was killed in the battle for the capital city of Khaibar. He left behind one of the greatest treasure stores ever amassed &amp;mdash; jewels and coins, more than anyone had ever seen before or since &amp;mdash; and in addition, the Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deadly plague sweeps your land. The holy men say that if only they had the Talisman, they could create cures for this dread disease. Many adventurers have tries and failed to find the Cup and Talisman. Now it is your turn. Find these treasures, and save your people!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The journey is exciting, but treacherous. Do not be distracted by exotic sights and sounds, the strange foods. You must avoid being discovered by Al'Farzikh and his brigands, as you infiltrate the palace. Be wary &amp;mdash; what is most beautiful may be most deadly, and what seems useless may be priceless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
