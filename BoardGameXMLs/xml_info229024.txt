			<description>A One-Round Living City Adventure for Characters of Any Level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-five years ago an adventuring company called the Brotherhood of Mann retired in the Ravens Bluff area. The members of the company decided that the time had come to stop risking their lives and start enjoying the wealth they had nearly died earning. After several months in his new life, Mehail, an elven fighter/mage, discovered an ancient seal with mystic runes inscribed on it. He called together the Brotherhood and revealed his discovery. Leland, the company wizard, identified the seal as a symbol used to mark ancient shrines of Mystra. He recommended that the company locate the entrance to the shrine and restore the seal. Leland knew that there would be a minion of Mystra resting in stasis in the shrine and he secretly plotted with Quillion to kill it and steal its power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
