							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mean Craps Machine</name>
									
			<description>Instruction Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome - the casino is open&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of CRAPS conjures up images of back alley gambling or of James Bond.  Although these two images are very dissimilar, they underscore the wide appeal of CRAPS which many consider to be the perfect gambling game. The action is fast because many bets can be placed at the same time. As a result, payoffs are frequent. In the mind of the true gambler, it is better to have bet $30 and gotten ten back than to have bet $10 and gotten nothing back. The other appealing factor is that each player is unaffected by the bets of any other player. In Blackjack, for example, if the player to your right takes a card, then he has received the card you would have gotten had he passed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is easy to learn. One of the things you will learn rather quickly is that it's easy to lose money in this game. To be honest with you, the game is rigged in favor of the house. All casino games are. But there are usually some winnersand that's what keeps them coming back for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One other thing should be stressed here. While the computer can also be one of the players, it doesn't know how to win better than anybody else. Yes, there are people who think they can beat the house - but it's not true. The only way to beat the house is to cheat and this game plays honest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May Lady Luck smile upon you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
