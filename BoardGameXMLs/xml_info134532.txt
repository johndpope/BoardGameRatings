			<description>Introduction from the rules sheet:&lt;br/&gt;Birdorama can be played by one person as a 'Patience', or by 2, 3 or 4 players. In each case the principle is the same - to build up a 'panoramic' picture, three pieces deep, in which each piece contributes to the scene by correctly joining and continuing from its neighbours at all touching edges, as in a jig-saw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birdorama can be played by 2, 3 or 4 players. Each player takes 9 tiles (plus the 'Rarity' tile) at random from his set of 24 to make his hand. Players take turn to lay tiles (in legal positions) until either one player lays his last tile or no-one can lay a legal tile. Tiles left in the hand are then scored, and the winner is the player with the fewest points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
