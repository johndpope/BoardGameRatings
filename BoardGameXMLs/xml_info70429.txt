							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Department 7 Firearms Training Academy</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dept. 7 Firearms Training Academy is a sourcebook for d20 Modern that provides players and GMs with options for developing the shooting skills of their characters. While melee combat is a common occurrence in the modern world, it is a character's skill with firearms that will truly mean the difference between life and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is full guns and most of your serious opponents are going to be armed with some form of personal firearm, if not military-grade weapons. However, you should never forget that having a gun and knowing how to use it are two different things. A character who can't hold his own in a gunfight isn't going to last long in this dangerous world we live in. Whether you're facing down a heavily-armed SWAT team, a gang of crazed drug dealers or a highly-trained terrorist cell, you'll feel better if you know that you have the edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this PDF are twenty-one new gun-related feats and a new five-level &amp;quot;Gun-FU Trainee&amp;quot; advanced class!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
