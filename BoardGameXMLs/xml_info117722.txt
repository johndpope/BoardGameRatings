			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add some healing to your psionics with this first release in the Psionics Expanded product line!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divine power just not your style? Not interested in the bestial nature of the druid? Do you want an effective healing class without all the praying? The Vitalist is what you're looking for. This all-new 20-level psionic base class joins his allies into a single collective and then shares healing energy across it. Whether you're a mender, focusing on healing wounds, or a guardian who stops damage before it lands, or a soulthief who takes the life force of enemies and turns it into healing power, the Vitalist is the first true psionic healer for your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your character more interested in altering his form? Then the Metamorph prestige class is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psionics Expanded: Mind Over Body is over 20 pages of new material for new and existing psionic characters. With a new psion advanced discipline, new psychic warrior paths, new wilder surge options, new psionic feats, psionic powers, and psionic items, there is something for virtually any character with a psychometabolism focus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psionics Expanded is the first release of six for the Psionics Expanded: Advanced Psionics Guide which will add a host of new player options playtested by the psionic community across the globe. Designed by the only publishing company known exclusively for psionic support, this book fills in the gaps left to have a truly all-psionic party. Psionics Expanded will be released as six serialized books, with a final release compiling all six parts into a single Advanced Psionics Guide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
