			<description>Version 0.9.5 was released a few months after version 0.9b and incorporated significant changes to some areas of the rules, benefiting from extended play tests.  Version 0.9.8b, released three months after 0.9.5, incorporated minor rule clarifications and featured updated art and document formatting.  Version 0.9.8b was the final release of the &amp;quot;1st Edition&amp;quot; rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introductory material:&lt;br/&gt;MAKAI is a Live Action Role Playing Game. It's like a free-form movie where players are the actresses and actors. While there is no set script, players create a brief character history, a character sheet/card, items, currency, and any game pieces necessary (dice, pencil, character statistics). There is usually no physical contact in larps, however MAKAI is different. Unlike other LARPs, MAKAI uses foam weapons, or boffer weapons, instead of rock, paper, scissors, or cards or dice. The game emphasizes drama, negotiations, trading, mysteries, problem solving, manipulation, and delightful chaos. MAKAI is also based off of anime, but real anime in particular. It is a sort of amalgamation of different animes and manga. Most notably there is a lot of video game references you will see when you begin to read this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
