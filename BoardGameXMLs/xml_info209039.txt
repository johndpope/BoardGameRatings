							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inland Water Transport</name>
									
			<description>Inland Water Transport was produced around 1950* as a promotional piece for the transportation companies Macneill &amp;amp; Barry Ltd and their subsidiary Kilburn &amp;amp; Co Private Ltd. The companies, along with their associates the Joint Steamer Companies, were involved in the transportation of goods throughout India (and, post partition, Pakistan). The game is a simulation of this regional logistic operation, featuring elements of roll-and-move with some mitigating choices, pick up and deliver, and the acquisition of routes and ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game up to 6 players each have a steamer and a train which they can move along the waterways and railways of North East India and East Pakistan (beginning in Calcutta), with movements based on dice rolls. At each port or rail depot they can collect cargo or deliver cargo. Cargo items are unique and are to be delivered to specific destinations, with varying payments on delivery. At certain points players collect &amp;quot;report&amp;quot; cards, which function similarly to &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot; cards in Monopoly, bestowing small benefits or losses on the player. Players can also purchase ports or railways, levying charges on other players that use them. The game ends once all cargo has been delivered, with the player with the most money winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Publication date is an educated approximate - no date is given in the manual but historical research of dates when the involved companies were merged and subsequently changed names dates it must be between 1949 and 1956.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designers are sadly unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
