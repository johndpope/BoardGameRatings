			<description>Spate is a platformer. But it as much Mario as it is Dear Esther. Three things that I make Spate a unique platforming experience are the atmosphere, the drinking mechanic, and the art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visuals - Artist Eric Provan, previously of Jim Henson, Walt Disney, and Sony Animation, has created an unforgettably surreal steampunk world. Layered with rain, symbolism, and atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narration - Fully narrated by award winning Voice Actor Jack Bair&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story - Join the detective on a missing persons case that brings him to the mysterious X Zone islands. He hopes to uncover some of the island&amp;rsquo;s mysterious, but is finding it increasingly difficult to battle his own pain; the death of his daughter and his growing alcohol problem. Will he succumb to the impending madness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
