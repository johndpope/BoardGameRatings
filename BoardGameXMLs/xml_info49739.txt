			<description>A-topia&amp;reg; exposes the players to an energy rating system of appliances similar to the one used in the European Union. It adds knowledge to the information one may need to look into prior to purchasing home appliances. The battle is set between two players to achieve a household with the least energy consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a point scoring system in the game based on each player attaining special events. Once a maximum set of points are acquired by a player, it gives him/her an advantage by acquiring their opponent's best (energy efficient) appliances. The game keeps the players sharp in adding their scores and exercising their advantages over their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
