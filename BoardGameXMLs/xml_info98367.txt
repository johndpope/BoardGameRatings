			<description>Publihser's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardboiled sword &amp;amp; sorcery-it's Conan seeking for the Maltese Falcon, it's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser in the Big Sleep, set in Lankhmar, it's hardboiled crime fiction in the worlds of sword &amp;amp; sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Sword Noir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by mashing up the novels and stories of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Robert E Howard, and Fritz Leiber, Sword Noir: A Role-Playing Game of Hardboiled Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery is a new RPG from Sword's Edge Publishing. In it, characters' morals are shifting at best and absent at worst. The atmosphere is dark and hope is frail or completely absent. Violence is deadly and fast. Trust is the most valued of commodities-life is the cheapest. Grim leaders weave labyrinthine plots which entangle innocents. Magic exists and can be powerful, but it takes extreme dedication to learn, extorts a horrible price, and is slow to conjure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now is the time for your characters to walk down mean streets, drenched in rain, hidden in fog, and unravel mysteries, murders, and villainy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The print version is a 6&amp;quot; x 9&amp;quot; softcover book with black &amp;amp; white interiors running 104 pages. It is otherwise the same as the PDF version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head on over to swordsedgepublishing.ca for some sneak peeks:&lt;br/&gt; - of the art;&lt;br/&gt; - multiple opponent rules; &lt;br/&gt; - Qualities;&lt;br/&gt; - some characters and early artwork;&lt;br/&gt; - the Appendices which include the character tracker, pre-made characters, the character sheet, and a map of the city of Everthorn;&lt;br/&gt; - and an example of combat in Sword Noir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simplified version of the underlying system for Sword Noir is available free as the Sword's Edge System. If you want to give it a test drive, that's how you can do it, without the genre-specific parts or discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
