							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Suzette, The Psionicist</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her name is Suzette Trianne. She was an normal young girl, until her psychic powers manifested in a fiery day of devastation and terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She was saved by the enigmatic organization known as Demna, who valed her for her psionic talents, trained her, and recruited her to be one of their potent psychic enforcers. That's what happens, though, when you're in the world of HOT CHICKS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third in a series of Character Studies... detailed examinations of characters that occupy the back alleys and shadows of the Earth of 2015. Included are over thirty images of Suzette in various stages of dress, including none at all. She may have a bad track record of relationships going down in flames, but there's always hope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read her history, study her form, and view her statistics. She makes an ideal NPC companion, ally, and is also perfectly suitable as a Player Character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
