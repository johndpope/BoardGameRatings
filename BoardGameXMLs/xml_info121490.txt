			<description>Traditional quiz game where a player must answer a question by placing the wired connector to the slot of his chosen answer and, if correct, the bulb attached to that answer will light up. Subjects provided are:&lt;br/&gt;Who was, Where is, Translate, History, General Knowledge and one which asked you to write your own questions and answers.&lt;br/&gt;Most correct answers, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructions from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Connect the two wires to a battery - one player should place one of the perforated sheets so that the holes in it fit exactly over the little knobs. Players in turn take the left wander-plug and with it touch any one of the knobs on the question side (the left), then try to find the right answer on the right hand side. If the player thinks he has found the correct reply, the right hand plug should be placed in contact with the knob in the square which he thinks contains the correct answer. When the correct answer is found, the lamp light up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
