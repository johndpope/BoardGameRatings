			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Anybody Need A Light?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Weird West is full of strange places, but you don't have to look to hard to find some of the strangest: the boomtowns that spring up out of the High Plains like a hidden geyser. Most of these burgs fade away as quickly as they come, but while they're booming, they boom big.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That kind of activity is a magnet for all sorts of trouble, supernatural or otherwise. These towns are powderkegs, and all it takes to set them off is a single spark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boomtowns! boxed set comes with 16 extra-thick, full-color, double-sided map tiles, just the thing you need to build your own boomtown from scratch, right on the spot. These maps are scaled for our Weird Western miniatures, making them perfect for showing the posse just where they stand at any given moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crack open this box, and you also get a 64-page book which tells you exactly how to use these maps in your Deadlands: The Weird West games. Not only that, it's packed with four full-fledged boomtowns to help get the mayhem started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boomtowns! also comes with a free copy of Marshal's Log, the perfect place for you to keep all the details about the Weird Western campaign your posse is adventuring through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boomtowns! gives you lots of ways to make your games look great, run smoothly, and start off with a bang. Don't Marshal without it!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
