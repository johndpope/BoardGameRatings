							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pillow Fight!</name>
									
			<description>Pillow Fight is a casual card combat game for 2 to 4 players that takes less than an hour to play. 2 player games average about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to be the first player with 20 Movies, the Remote card, and at least 1 Pillow in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have Player cards that give them a unique identifying color.  Playing a card that matches your color is called &amp;quot;Affinity&amp;quot; and you get added benefits for doing this.  You can play Pillows, Weapons, Special Items, and Shields.  You do this by placing cards in your Action Row to be used on your next turn.  Your Action Row is a set of 3 cards that you play from on your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pillows are required to play Weapons and remain in play to help protect you until they are destroyed.  Weapons are used for attacking Players and Pillows and are always successful against Players with no Pillows.  Some Weapons, that are harder to use successfully, reward you with the Remote Card.  Thematically, this is something that is getting jostled about in the chaos and landing a really good hit buys you time to pick it up.  Special Items are used to destroy Pillows and Action cards, while Shields defend against certain Items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Weapon and Item cards successfully rewards you with Movies!  The more challenging it is to use a Weapon card successfully, the more Movies you get.  Sometimes success will come down to the luck of the roll or draw, but most often you will rely on your foresight and timing to use cards successfully.  Pillow Fight is a game that rewards you for paying attention to what your  opponents do, giving you an edge if you notice patterns in play.  It is also dynamic enough that you can easily change your strategy each hand and change the tide of the game.  It accomplished all of this with a consistent theme and simple mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
