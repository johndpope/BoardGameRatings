			<description>The object of this game is to compose the front page of the &amp;quot;Main Street Herald.&amp;quot;  Upon completion of the page, the player with the highest score, earned by completing stories and winning bonuses, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game simulates the editorial and layout tasks in putting a newspaper together: there are tiles for headlines, photos, photo captions, inside text (shown as rows of horizontal lines, as a designer would represent in thumbnail), jumps and so on.  It is a word game only in a very limited sense: some of the headlines and captions span more than one tile, so you must assemble the phrases properly for the layout to make sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The page is laid out on a game board with different regions providing different scores.  There are also methods for players to challenge one another, based on the filing times for stories, story shape, position and so forth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes decks of City Desk cards, Wire Service cards and Clock cards (one for each hour from 10 AM to midnight).  The cards trigger events and bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
