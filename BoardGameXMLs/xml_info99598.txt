							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island Fish Co.</name>
									
			<description>Fishing season and Stores want lots of fish. Out to sea we go, putting out bait, hauling in nets, watching out for Sharks, always paying attention to the weather reports. Take a risk and get that last catch in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four Island Stores put in orders for Fish of various kinds.&lt;br/&gt;Players are members of the Island Fishing Co-op, each with their own Boat, but who work together to fill these Store Orders, and return Home safely before the Stormy Season makes fishing and deliveries too dangerous to continue. They get paid for their work and share the earnings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     12 x 12&amp;quot; board, &lt;br/&gt;     4 fishing boats, &lt;br/&gt;     4 boat movers, &lt;br/&gt;     12 assorted fish, &lt;br/&gt;     4 sharks, &lt;br/&gt;     4 good weathers, &lt;br/&gt;     12 storms, and &lt;br/&gt;     16 assorted baits (4 are all-purpose), &lt;br/&gt;     the home supply depot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
