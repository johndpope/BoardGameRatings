			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By playing My First Farm, a.k.a. Mein erster Bauernhof, children discover the farm. By way of the differently shaped tiles they can check to see whether the tiles match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is made up of 24 tiles, 12 with a red and 12 with a yellow border. The tiles represent activities on a farm as well as things to be found on a farm. There are two sets of rules: one for one child, one for two children. The two children rule is that all tiles are shuffled and put into the middle of the table picture side down. On the first turn a child draws a tile and sees if its his color. If it is he can place it picture side up on his side of the table. If it is not it must be put back into the middle. On subsequent turns the child draws a tile and this must be his color and match the tile/s already placed. If not the tile is put back. A child can choose any tile in the middle including the tile just discarded by the other player. The first one having his twelve farm tiles in a matching row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
