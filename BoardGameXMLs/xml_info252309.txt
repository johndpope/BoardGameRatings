			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Guide to Jousting &amp;amp; Tournament Combat for OSR Games&lt;br/&gt;Compatible with Most Fantasy RPG systems&lt;br/&gt;plus&lt;br/&gt;Three Combat Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thunder of hooves and the roar of the crowd.&lt;br/&gt;The deafening clash of a lance striking metal.&lt;br/&gt;Salute your opponent, because it&amp;rsquo;s time to joust!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I love the swelling of pride I feel at the Invocation! The rush of excitement when I&amp;rsquo;m hitting a shield on the Tree of Shields. The pounding of my blood as my mount and I rush forward, the tilt blurring in my vision. It&amp;rsquo;s all so grand! Well, all apart from the cry of &amp;ldquo;Atteint!&amp;rdquo; and the landing hard on your arse on the hard packed earth of the list&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Sir Jeffries, Knight Errant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This guide focuses on setting forth rules for simulating medieval tournament style mounted and m&amp;ecirc;l&amp;eacute;e combat for use with OSRIC and 1E compatible retro-clones, although its rules (focused on alternating ability checks) are compatible with most fantasy RPGs. The pageantry and show of jousting and tournament combat is always a grand spectacle in most medieval campaigns based on our historical past, and this guide aims to help you and your players integrate that style of combat into your games. Whether it is chivalrous combat for sport or combat to the death, we hope to have the GM and the brave knights of their campaign straight into the action with a rules light approach to this style of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also include three different tournament scenarios, so your players will be strapped to a warhorse and hammering down a list at their opponent or charging into a tournament m&amp;ecirc;l&amp;eacute;e in little to no time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three scenarios are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    TESTING ONE&amp;rsquo;S METTLE: CHALLENGE &amp;Agrave; PLAISANCE &lt;br/&gt;    A TEST OF HONOUR: CHALLENGE &amp;Agrave; LA GUERRE&lt;br/&gt;    TO SAVE ESKARTORP: CHALLENGE &amp;Agrave; LA M&amp;Ecirc;L&amp;Eacute;E&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These scenarios taken place in three is separate kingdom&amp;rsquo;s within the author&amp;rsquo;s published campaign world, Jarlburgh, Alderburgh, and D&amp;ugrave;n Bhriste. The scenarios detail additional background information and areas for adventure for those GM&amp;rsquo;s setting their campaigns in the author&amp;rsquo;s ever expanding campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book features 22 pages of excitement and thrills, with players facing several different types of challenges in the included scenarios, and it is sure to please discerning GMs and players everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
