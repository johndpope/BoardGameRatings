			<description>The players form two teams of two players or one player can give the clue to two guessers. Players take one card which has ten passwords on it. A spinner determines which word will be the password for this round. The clue giver can give multi-word clues and use pantomime (unlike the classic version of the game which restricts the players to one-word clues and no gestures). Teams alternate turns until someone guesses the password. Any player who guesses the password is awarded the card for scorekeeping purposes. The first team awarded six cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
