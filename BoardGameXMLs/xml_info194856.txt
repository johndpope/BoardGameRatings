			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are intended to be &amp;quot;the player him or herself&amp;quot;, though with the added magical ability of transcending into another dimension where he or she can control powerful elemental beings.  The most unusual aspect of this &amp;quot;play as yourself&amp;quot; game is the length of time that character creation takes - it is a significant investment that must be completed prior to the group gaming session(s).  The process yields a lengthy journal with multiple entries which may be used during play.  The game contemplates, but does not require, character vs. character opposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the entry - which has no art - specifically enumerates art credits (presumably from an alternate published version with art).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
