			<description>Der Natur auf der Spur includes three games that challenge players to match tracks to the animals that make them and seeds and nuts to the plants from whence they originate. The game includes paired tiles showing tracks and an animal (or nuts and trees); on the front, these items bleed over the tiles so that you can match them like jigsaw pieces, while on the back these items are separate, making it tougher to know which item goes with which.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first game, players set the time on the time-tracker to sunset, then lay out the animal half of the paired tiles. They shuffle the track-half of the tiles, then lay them out. Players take turns trying to match tracks to animals, advancing the time-tracker whenever they're wrong. If they match all the animals before night falls, they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second game, players use the harder side of the paired tiles, but otherwise gameplay is the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the third game, players use both the animal and tree tiles, laying out one half of these pairs. Players take turns revealing one tile from the other halves, and every other player race to find the match, claiming the tile when doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
