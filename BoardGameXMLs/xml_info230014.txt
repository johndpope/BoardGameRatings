			<description>A card game for 2-4 players in which players are Athenian generals (Strategos) in the 5th century accumulating influence and prestige.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common set of cards of 8 different types:  Proposal (gain prestige one time), Events (multiple effects), Associates (gain prestige every turn), Prosecutions (remove associates &amp;amp; strategoi), Popularity (temporary influence gain), Reaction (multiple effects), Victory (gain influence) and Defeat (lose influence)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game controlling one leader. There are 16 different leaders available and each has a unique special ability.  If your leader is ever killed or removed from play, you must start over but keep any prestige already earned. Each player starts with 10 Influence and 10 Prestige.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round has 6 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.   Enemy Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Roll 1D6: if even Persia is the enemy; if odd Sparta is the enemy this round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.   Availability Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Flip over the top 5 + X cards of the deck where X is the number of players.  These are placed face up in the middle of the table. These cards are known as the available cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   Turn Order Phase&lt;br/&gt;Players roll high 1D6 to determine turn order this round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.   Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Players take turns (in turn order) selecting one available card until all cards have been selected. &lt;br/&gt;--- If a player selects a Popularity or Reaction card, they put that card in their hand. These are retained until needed to influence votes, or  negate an event.&lt;br/&gt;--- If a player selects an Associate, that associate becomes theirs and is placed face up in front of them. &lt;br/&gt;--- If a player picks a Proposal or a Prosecution then a vote is conducted immediately to see which player wins it. &lt;br/&gt;--- If a player picks an Event card resolve it immediately. &lt;br/&gt;--- If a player selects a Victory or Defeat, it becomes theirs and is placed face up in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.   Prestige Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Associates earn prestige for their leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.   End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Max hand size is 4 cards discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no cards left in the deck. At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
