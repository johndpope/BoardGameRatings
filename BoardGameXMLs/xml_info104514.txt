							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation: Death-Ray</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cobra has gained control of a very powerful weapon. Only the GI Joe Team can stop them from using it in OPERATION: DEATH-RAY.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the U.S. government doesn't give Cobra all its gold, Cobra says it will blow up a major U.S. city. That's no empty threat - Cobra possesses a bomb, developed by a Russian scientist, that circles the earth on a telecommunications satellite and can be detonated at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your team consists of Flint, Torpedo, Deep-Six, Tripwire, and you, Break-In. Your specialties are dismantling security systems, gaining access to heavily guarded areas, and scuba diving! You'll need all these talents in this daring mission, which races from Hawaii to Finland to a Siberian prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be smart, be brave, be careful! The lives of millions of people are in your hands, so do your very best as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
