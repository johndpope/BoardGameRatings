			<description>Keep Running! is a quick-playing game based around the legendary tale of the two guys being chased by a bear in the woods. One of them briefly pulls up, grabs a pair of running shoes from his backpack and hastily throws them on. &amp;quot;What are you doing? You'll never outrun it!&amp;quot; yells the guy who is still moving. &amp;quot;I don't need to outrun the bear,&amp;quot; replies the first (who by now has rapidly overtaken his friend). &amp;quot;I just need to outrun YOU.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between three and eight players will be able to force and fight their way to the front of the pack, leaving their friends behind as The Bear gets ever closer. Each player has a rapidly diminishing hand of cards and one must be played every turn. Roll a die to see how fast you're going, but don't forget the modifier on the card you've put down! Some cards allow you to get more in your hand, keeping you in the game longer. Others will let you attack your opponents, pushing them ever closer to that ever-chasing bear. Run out of cards and you're no longer running &amp;ndash; you're dinner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
