			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next two issues are a two-part conclusion to the Ashford Valley campaign. I started this campaign by writing 30 adventures in groups of 5. The sets of adventures should have advanced the PCs to higher levels. If played in order, the PCs should have reached 2nd level by the end of the High Bridge Road adventures, 3rd level for the Deep Forest Road, 4th for Ashford, 5th for Clifton, 6th for Tradetown and 7th for Sooton. That will make the PCs pretty powerful. However, I designed each adventure to be able to be played by 1st through 3rd level PCs, so it is necessary (and fairly obvious) that each adventure be increased in difficulty by the GM. All this was done to come to this point - the necromancer's end game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue will outline the plans and goals of the necromancer, while next issue I'll talk about the necromancer himself and some of his minions that the PCs haven't met yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
