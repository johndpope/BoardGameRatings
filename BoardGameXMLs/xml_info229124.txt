							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Furious Ascent</name>
									
			<description>Furious Ascent is a cooperative game for 2 to 4 players. The object of the game is for all players to progress as a team through four ascents to reach the mountain summit. If all players are healthy enough to reach the summit, the game is won. If any player becomes too injured to continue on during the game, it will result in an immediate loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teammates play colored rope cards in the proper order to conquer four ascents, with each ascent becoming more difficult than the last. Each of the four camp cards has different requirements on how many rope cards and how many colors can be used to progress to the next camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any player during their turn is unable to play the next card in the sequence, they must draw from the Event Deck. Events can penalize the individual player with various ailments, or the team as a whole with loss of progress in the ascent. If any player obtains too many ailments during the game, the entire team fails, and the game is lost. If all players reach the summit, the game is won!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
