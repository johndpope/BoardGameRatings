			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Mack Adam, a French brilliant scientist, is suspected of working with enemy agents. As a new recruit of the French counter-espionage agency, your task is to explore the doctor's house, collect evidence and find a way to stop the spy ring's plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SECRET DEFENSE is a graphical adventure game. Instead of using a text interpreter or an icon system, the game displays a list of all actions available in current location. The player selects an action, validate and the game displays the results. Of course, some actions are necessary to advancing the plot, others are dangerous as there are quite a few traps in the house. The game also displays a 3d map of the house (a 2d view is also available), the player's inventory and an image of the current location. There is no savegame feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
