			<description>The player controls 'Nicky', a little boy who embarks on an adventure through a fantastical land to free his grandfather from dungeon of the evil witch Zoldrane, who tries to force him to help her in making of a terrible spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nicky can walk, jump, and throw apple cores to defend himself against Zoldrane's monstrous minions. The player can pick up other items to throw at enemies, such as bouncy balls and logs that can be also used to build bridges at certain parts of the levels. Nicky is able to jump on enemies to kill them, which is often more difficult but lets the monsters drop point items to collect. The game consists of eight levels based on four separate themes, including a swamp, a forest and the witch's castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Nicky Boum&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
