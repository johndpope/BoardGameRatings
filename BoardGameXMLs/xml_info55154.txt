			<description>I designed BOB to be the last word on low to medium complexity Bulge games. I enjoy playing Bulge games but I never found one that satisfied me. So I decided to make my own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BASTOGNE OR BUST is a single-map, regimental treatment of the Battle of the Bulge. This is a PLAYER'S game! Designed on purpose to be more of a warGAME than a simulation. It addresses a number of pet peeves of mine in regard to Bulge games I'd played over the years. Some of these issues include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OFF BOARD MOVEMENT CHART [what happens to all those pieces that 'exit the map?']&lt;br/&gt;STACKING POINTS [one of the greatest mechanics of all time - why don't designers use it more often?]&lt;br/&gt;COMMAND &amp;amp; CONTROL [divisional bonuses for unit cohesiveness]&lt;br/&gt;SUPPLY DIFFERENCES [different effects on ALLIES vs GERMANS]&lt;br/&gt;INITIATIVE [essentially, the 5-1 column on the CRT is gone]&lt;br/&gt;NO OVERRUN [squads held crossroads against regiments]&lt;br/&gt;NO WEATHER RULES [weather is reflected in air support]&lt;br/&gt;VON DER HYDTE [ALWAYS gets on the board]&lt;br/&gt;STREAMLINED PLAY [I don't need water allocation points]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Referred to affectionately by wargamers as BOB, I like to refer to it as The World's Finest Bulge Game. All of the artwork was done by myself - including the counters which were hand drawn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map [printed on four 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; cardstock sheets]&lt;br/&gt;600 counters [printed on 2 sheets of 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; label paper]&lt;br/&gt;2 OOB/OOA set-up sheets&lt;br/&gt;1 OFF-BOARD MOVEMENT CHART&lt;br/&gt;2 Player Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;1 example sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the original TERRAN GAMES dtp publication of BOB showcased at ORIGINS '94 in San Jose, not the TERRAN GAMES, INC. version published a year later with all new [gorgeous] graphics by Mark Simonitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
