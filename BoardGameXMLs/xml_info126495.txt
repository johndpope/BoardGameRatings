			<description>When fugitive magician Lucas MacGuffin bungles a museum robbery, he finds himself bound to an ancient amulet, trapped in a city in high-tech lockdown, and suddenly fighting the urge to scratch himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a human, Lucas is agile and cunning. As a gigantic wolf, he&amp;rsquo;d rather smash anything in his way. Only by transforming between the two forms, cleverly utilising both sets of skills, will he stand any chance of lifting his curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way he&amp;rsquo;ll need to befriend a hilarious cast of characters, convince the city its most beloved citizen is a terrifying criminal mastermind, and hardest of all, teach his daughter it isn&amp;rsquo;t funny to fill the fridge with dog food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This addictive puzzler will win over casual and seasoned players alike. Gamers on the go can enjoy a quick, fun fix, with a seamlessly integrated hints system to keep them moving. And veteran adventure game fans will be hooked by the razor-sharp dialogue, treasure-trove of secrets and engaging story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With charming hand-drawn art, quirky quests and insanely catchy music, MacGuffin&amp;rsquo;s Curse is a story brimming with humour, personality and heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
