			<description>There are 12 horse photograph cards to complete. Players throw the dice to collect parts of each image and aim to piece together as many horses as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player rolls both dice. If doubles are rolled, the player gets another turn. To start a pony, a 1 must be rolled. Pieces must be collected in sequential order (pieces are labeled 1 thru 6) and multiple puzzles may be worked on simultaneously. A player may also sum the two dice to take a puzzle piece if it's the next one they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also steal the #1 horse part from each other if they roll a 1 and no more are available from the center of the table. However, they must take it from the player with the most ponies and only of that pony hasn't been completed up to the fourth piece. When this happens, the player who had their piece stolen must return the remaining pieces of that pony to the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the last pony is completed. The player with the most horses wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
