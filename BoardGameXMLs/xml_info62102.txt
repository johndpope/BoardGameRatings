							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horthnog and the Crimson Daggers</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horthnog and the Crimson Daggers are a hardened goblinoid mercenary company. Suitable for interaction with a party of levels 7 - 13, they add some character to the Hobgoblin people; no longer will they be nameless faces who exist only to be slaughtered by adventurers. The company can be included in a campaign in many ways: they could be hired by the campaign's existing villain, be an ally of the party in the fight against said villain, or they could even overthrow the villain and Horthnog take his place. They could be the base of an entirely new campaign, or just used in a random encounter to add some detail. Horthnog himself is perfect to use as an end boss in a heroic tier game, or as an introduction to paragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains everything you need to include the mercenary company into your games: descriptions, background, 2 adventure ideas and 15 encounter ideas using the mercenaries, including details on how to run a mass combat with the entire company. It includes 8 stat blocks for the different roles in the company, including the innovative standard bearer goblin minion lurker (leader), along with combat tactics. Finally, it includes a new skill challenge: finding a battle ground, and 9 pages of maps suitable for use with the Crimson Daggers as well as for many other combats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scrap that boring random encounter, and let your players meet Horthnog and the Crimson Daggers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
