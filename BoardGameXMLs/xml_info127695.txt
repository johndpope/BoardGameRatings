			<description>From the rules&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A domino type game, consisting of 49 card depicting seven species of birds, in which the Males (M) and Females (F) differ in their plumage. The game is played by identifying and matching the correct males and females. There is also one card for each species depicting the Young (Y).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a traditional domino manner except you are matching male and female pairs, and you are able to add a young below a 'paired' male and female (in which case you are able to take an extra turn). The winner is the first player to get rid of all the cards in his hand, or if the pack becomes exhausted and no one can 'go' the player with the least cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards have realistic artwork depicting the birds in a style similar to a bird reference book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also another game variant included in the rules, called 'Bridges' which is for two players, and involves players creating columns of matching pairs of the same species or families of the same species, and bridges between the two players columns. Points are awarded for creating 12 card columns, and for creating bridges between columns. Games continue until one player has scored 30 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
