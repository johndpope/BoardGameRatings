							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">13th Age Soundtrack</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give your 13th Age game the soundtrack it deserves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 13th Age Age Soundtrack brings you 30 pieces of music to evoke excitement, suspense, wonder and mystery at your gaming table. Keep it running in the background, play individual tracks to herald the arrival of battle, the icons or a change in location, or use it as inspiration while building worlds, characters and monsters. (Or, you know, just enjoy it as a really great album.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 13th Age Age Soundtrack by James Semple and an array of talented musicians and composers includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Themes for the icons (wait &amp;ndash; one&amp;rsquo;s missing&amp;hellip;?)&lt;br/&gt;    Themes for key locations in the Dragon Empire, or ones of your own creation that have a similar atmosphere&lt;br/&gt;    Music for frantic chases, fierce combat, exploration, resting and remembrance&lt;br/&gt;    Special utility tracks &amp;ndash; play &amp;ldquo;Chase Music&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Escalation 0-6&amp;Prime; on a loop to sustain the mood for as long as you need&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Track Listing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. 13th Age&lt;br/&gt;Prophecies fail. Demons invade, living dungeons rip towards the surface and the Empire&amp;rsquo;s protectors falter. A sweeping anthem for the heroes who will save the world, or die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Archmage&lt;br/&gt;He has preserved the Empire for centuries and created astonishing new lands. He has also threatened the fabric of reality with experiments you&amp;rsquo;d have to be brilliant or hugely arrogant to attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Crusader&lt;br/&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s the armored fist of the dark gods, crusading against demons &amp;mdash; but happy to stomp out virtue or innocence if they&amp;rsquo;re stupid enough to get in his way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Diabolist&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the demons she controls, the Diabolist doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessary want to destroy the universe. She wants to play with it, as a tiger plays with a troupe of monkeys. Those who dance best may not be eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Dwarf King&lt;br/&gt;The Dwarf King remembers when his kingdom in the deeps was the mightiest in all creation. Forced towards the surface by elven treachery, he guards the Empire from threats such as the orcs while calculating how to claim the Empire for his own. Or maybe he&amp;rsquo;s content to mine the treasures of the earth, and build great things that his ancestors would have coveted. Maybe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Elf Queen&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, the Elf Queen united the dark elves, wood elves, and high elves as one people. Now she is the only thing they have in common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Emperor&lt;br/&gt;The ruler of the Dragon Empire holds his Empire together with armies, magic, force of will, tolerably wise rule, and grand squadrons of dragons. You may not agree with him, but you&amp;rsquo;re not going to mistake him for someone who does things halfway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. Great Gold Wyrm&lt;br/&gt;This great gold dragon is the champion of the oppressed and those who fight for justice. Unfortunately the Wyrm is stuck holding the gates of the hells shut against the demons, so the Wyrm&amp;rsquo;s champions must do its work in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. High Druid&lt;br/&gt;She is the champion of the resurgent Wild, and the spiritual and magical leader of spirits of nature and the elements that were chained by the Emperor and Archmage but are now working themselves free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10. Lich King&lt;br/&gt;The Lich King is the not-quite-insane lord of the undead, a fallen tyrant who plans to conquer the Dragon Empire. He mostly understands that ruling a kingdom is not the same as destroying it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11. Orc Lord&lt;br/&gt;The leader of the hordes. An apocalyptic icon of war, disease, and endings that could be worse than death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12. Priestess&lt;br/&gt;The gods are distant but she hears all the gods of light and speaks for those who please her. Part oracle, part mystic, and part metaphysical engineer, since she created the Cathedral, an ever-expanding temple with rooms or entire wings for each of the faiths she favors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13. The Three&lt;br/&gt;Three ancient dragons cooperate to become one of the dominant evils of the world. The red dragon embodies fury, the black masters stealth and betrayal, and the blue has used sorcery to become a legally appointed governor of the Empire as well as an evil mastermind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14. The Eyes of the Stone Thief&lt;br/&gt;The Stone Thief is a terrible centuries-old living dungeon that cuts through the earth, surfacing to swallow people and places that the heroes love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15. Tales Around the Fire&lt;br/&gt;For the rare moments when nothing is trying to kill you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16. Exploration&lt;br/&gt;Descending into the ruined temple. Opening the gates of the living dungeon. Moving in the dark down a corridor that might be made of stone, but then why is the stone breathing? Wind from up ahead, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the wind from the surface. Welcome to the underworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17. The Demon Coast&lt;br/&gt;Coastlines can be bad business on the Midland Sea, home to all the evil things forced out of the ocean by the Empire&amp;rsquo;s magic. The coast just north of the Abyss is even worse, hit by tides of evil from both directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18. The Fangs&lt;br/&gt;The rivers that feed into the Midland Sea are dangerous places and this is the worst of the bunch, fast moving forks of water populated by sahuagin and sea devils and other creatures forced out of the Midland Sea by the Blessed Emperor. Another great tune for ramping up the tension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19. High Dock&lt;br/&gt;There aren&amp;rsquo;t any actual docks in these rolling western hills, and the name may or may not be a joke. For magical reasons no one understands, all the flying realms of the Empire eventually drop low and bump up against the hills or take out big chunks of the terrain in terrible skidding &amp;lsquo;landings.&amp;rsquo; Eventually the realms lift off again. If you want to hitch a ride into the overworld, head to the High Dock and take your chances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20. Omen&lt;br/&gt;This island started small. It&amp;rsquo;s growing like a cancer in the center of the Midland Sea, bulking up the worst way possible as living dungeon after living dungeon tear up to the surface, depositing their payloads of monstrous weirdness. On the bright side, there&amp;rsquo;s nobody competing for space on the beach, you should be able to catch a good thirty minutes of sun before the monsters smell you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21. Starport&lt;br/&gt;The stars come to this mountain for repair and refitting. What does this mean, you ask? We don&amp;rsquo;t know &amp;mdash; we left it open for each game table to decide for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22. Dreams of a Lost Age&lt;br/&gt;Every culture in the world has its own version of this song. The world is ancient, all have lost things they would have wanted to preserve. They summon the dreams in song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23. Chase Music&lt;br/&gt;Who is chasing who? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Put it on loop to cue frantic backward glances, quick changes of direction, and short cuts that lead to greater peril.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24-30. Escalation 0 through Escalation 6&lt;br/&gt;You can use this music to accompany the escalation die, starting at 0 and topping off at 6; or loop the low levels for relatively normal situations, then switch to high levels when power makes the air hum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
