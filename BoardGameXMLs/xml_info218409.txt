			<description>Game about World Youth Day consists of 64 cards - illustration depicting the young pilgrims in scenes typical of the events of World Youth Day: among others, adoration, during a concert or gathered around the Pope's moving in the popemobile.&lt;br/&gt;The task of the players is to direct the movement of pilgrims to be combined in appropriate groups, according to the dynamically changing criteria. The gameplay counts perceptiveness and speed.  The game is developed in a way that does not require verbal communication between players. So they can play it by people of different languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both sides of the cards are important. One of them is showing the scene with the pilgrims, the other one of the 16 features which are showed on the cards. Player one by one take card from the pile and lay out near the card pile. The top card on the pile shows what features on the cards the player are looking for. For example if the card on the card pile shows red clothes players are checking is there at least three cards with this features. If yes whoever will be the first to notice this and put his hand on the pile is the winner of the round. He will take two cards as a reward. After that next person lay out the next cards from the card pile. So feature which players have to looking for is changing continually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the person which have the most cards at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
