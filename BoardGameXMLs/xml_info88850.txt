			<description>From the developers page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first they came from the skies. In the ensuing war, Earth was laid waste, but we had won...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that was just the first strike - now the invasion has landed! Defeat the returning Titan horde in a series of epic ground battles, save the Earth, again, and command the counterstrike against their homeworld!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construct and command your ground defences in a series of increasingly massive battles across the solar system, in our frenetic arcade mash-up of Real Time Strategy and Tower Defence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a visit to R&amp;amp;D to discover the latest technology, then build a network of blaster turrets, rocket launchers and laser cannon, explosives, barricades and shield generators, refineries and reactors, and send forth your own droid army to battle the invading alien forces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
