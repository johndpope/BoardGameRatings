							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Huckepack</name>
									
			<description>A push-your-luck game involving donkeys.  The object of the game is to move your donkeys to the feeding spaces and take the best food.  Every turn each player will anounce how many spaces the would like to move.  Then they will throw the die and if the result is equal or higher than their declaration, they will move that number of spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, if the result is less, they will stay in the same space, an also they can move backwards if the result is a -1. The neat part of the game is that a donkey lands on a space with another donkey, they pile them, and the player on the bottom must obey the orders of the higher donkey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has nothing to do with other games called Huckepack, and is suspiciously similar to Die Heisse Schlacht am Kalten Buffet. No author is credited on the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
