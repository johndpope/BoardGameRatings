			<description>First published as part of the Stonehenge: Bonusspiele #1 anthology as Rollende Steine, Rolling Rocks is sort of a tabletop, Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game golf.  The players act as a team of Celtic giants, entertaining themselves by rolling rocks through the trilithons.  The method by which she rolls her stone each turn is entirely up to the player, be it flicking, using a stick for leverage, or even blowing on it.  In addition to the dexterity element, players are granted the opportunity to place and move sticks on the board in order to attempt to guide their wayward stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
