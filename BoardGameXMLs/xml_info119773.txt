			<description>Players race to complete inventions by drafting dice in real time. Build your inventions by grabbing the correct dice... you can draft dice for later by placing it in your scrapyard, but it's not as efficient that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Works is a real-time dice drafting game. A number of dice are rolled into the center of the table, and players grab them - one at a time, using only 1 hand - and place them on their player board in an effort to fill up the boxes with the correct assortment of colors. A round ends when all of the dice have been drafted, and players advance their workers into boxes that have been completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can 'scrap' multiple dice of a single color to create any die they want of that color. The further your workers are advanced, the more efficiently you can scrap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get a worker to the top of 1 (2 on the advanced board) column, finishing an invention!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game might turn into a spinoff using the dice from Tasty Minstrel Games' Martian Dice game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
