			<description>A game of interstellar exploration and colonization for 2-3 players.  When a new system is explored, a card is drawn to determine its value; there may be native forces or other things to be dealt with.  In the basic game, there are two forces - the black and the red.  The black has large numbers, while the red has a much smaller fleet of faster ships.  Speed is very important, since faster ships can retreat from combat from slower ones unless attackers move in from all six adjacent hexes. The red force also has battlecruisers, which have the speed of a cruiser and nearly the combat strength of a battleship. There is a blue fleet for a third player, identical to the red fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to spaceships, there are several types of ground forces with which to contend for control of systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map has star systems scattered across it, and many nebulae, which slow movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
