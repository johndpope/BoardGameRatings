			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to locate the hidden &amp;quot;Treasure of Knowledge&amp;quot; (Proverbs 2:4,5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete five destination requirements receives the &amp;quot;Treasure of Knowledge,&amp;quot; and thus, wins the game. This is done by traveling to various destinations on the game board and also solving two riddles during the course of the game. The answer to each of the two riddles points to one of the 93 illustrated circles on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
