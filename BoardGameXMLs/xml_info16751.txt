			<description>With the increasing volume of deliveries to be made, Santa is unable to cope. So the powers that be advertised for additional franchise holders, with the result that there are now 4 Santas. Unfortunately they all have very different ideas of what the job involves, and of the right presents for people...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 2-4 player game where each player takes the part of one of the 4 Santas and attempts to deliver 6 presents, one to each of 6 houses. Each present correctly delivered earns the player 2 points, while incorrect deliveries earn only 1. Presents left on the sleigh at the end of the game are worth -1 each!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features Xmascette missiles, brandy flamers, Turkey Cannons and other weaponry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by Games Workshop in their December 1985 issue of White Dwarf Magazine (number 72), this was a cut-out and play game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
