			<description>The ingenuity of man has never conceived anything better calculated to bring out all the evil passions of humanity than the so-called game of Croquet. It is not long before every honorable feeling, every dictate of morality has been obliterated. The hoop is the gaping jaws of hades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living Age magazine, 1898, quoted in The New Games Treasury, Merilyn Simonds Mohr, 1997&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adaptation of Lewis Carroll's game Castle Croquet. Each player brings his knight out of his castle by playing it through its castle's gate, and 'invading' the other castles with it in the proper sequence. He then re-enters his own castle and hits his tower, while his own guard is 'on duty'. The first player to do so wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
