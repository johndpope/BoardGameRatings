							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adventures of Maddog Williams in the Dungeons of Duridian</name>
									
			<description>The Adventures of Maddog Williams in the Dungeons of Duridian was released by Game Crafters in 1992. The game is a cross between a text adventure and a role-playing game whereby the player took the role of Maddog Williams, a shopkeeper from the seaside town of Marinor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maddog Williams was released on Amiga, Atari ST and PC and a sequel was planned for release entitled Escape from Cylindria. Currently the game is freely available for download from the developers' website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control the titular Maddog Williams and must guide him through eight quests spread over the game's length. The quest begins in Maddog's home, the player is able to explore before gradually finding clues on how to progress further due to the relatively non-linear nature of the game compared to other adventures. The game's environments house objects to manipulate and non-player characters to converse with for information, as well as enemies who can be vanquished through combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
