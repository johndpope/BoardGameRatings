							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imps Vs Puppies: Crate of Carnage Edition</name>
									
			<description>This set collects the base, as well as the first two expansions to Imps Vs Puppies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main version of Imps Vs Puppies is a simple trick taking game in which each player sends an Imp from their team to smash a crate.  If the Imp is sent face up, they all have unique abilities which will alter the course of the round but if an Imp is sent face down, the only thing that matters is the strength.  The winner of the round smashes the crate which may contain a puppy but on occassion, it could be a bomb or even a Ninja Kitten.  The general strategy is to put as many cards as possible in your score pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the first expansion, Hissy Fits, more advanced Imps were added to the game as well as Imp drafts and even team play.  The second expansion added more Imps as well as Hidden Agendas, new cards you can attach to Imps when playing them face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second expansion, Hidden Agendas, launched with this set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
