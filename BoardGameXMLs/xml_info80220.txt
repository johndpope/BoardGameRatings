			<description>China Warrior, known in Japan as The Kung Fu (THE 功夫 (ザ・クンフー)), is a horizontal beat'em up video game created in 1987 by Hudson Soft for the Turbografx-16.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Chinese martial artist name Wang (王（ワン）), whose style resembles that of Bruce Lee, embarks on a mission to bring down opposing enemies and the Dark Emperor, who stands atop the castle, Lu Hao Yang (洛陽閣（ルーヤンカク）) in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to walk through each stage while throwing punches and kicks at enemies and objects, which also can be done in midair. There are four stages which are broken down into three stages each, for a total of twelve stages. When Wang gets knocked out, the game starts over at the beginning of the stage he got knocked out in. Players can memorize the object/enemy pattern in order to get through the stage easier whenever Wang gets knocked out. At the end of each level, there is a boss fight. The control was essentially designed to be similar to the arcade game Kung-Fu Master, but with gameplay similar to Gladiator  without the sword nor shield held in hand. The graphics utilized very large character models that fill up the screen. They were capable of moving without any graphical flickering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;China Warrior&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
