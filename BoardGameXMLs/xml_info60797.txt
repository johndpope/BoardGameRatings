			<description>From the Publisher: &amp;quot;A very exciting adventure! Sid, Diego, Manny and their friends are at the edge of a cliff, that may collapse at any moment. In this game you must move the characters from one spot to another without knocking down the entire board (along with the other characters)that hangs over the cliff. Luck, atention and balance await for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dexterity game for kids based on the Ice Age 3 blockbuster from  20th Century Fox. On this game players roll two dice. The first tell you with character must be moved, and the second one the symbol of the spot to where that character must be moved to without knocking down the boards that hangs on a uneven surface. A nice dexterity game for kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
