			<description>Futurecade is a suite of online games developed to be a part of the Talk Science programme, released in February 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be thought-provoking, fun and relevant to teenagers&amp;rsquo; interests, the games are based on simulations of current and future technology in the fields of robotics, satellites and space junk, geo-engineering and synthetic biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These game-based scenarios engage the audience with the subject area and provide a stepping stone into deeper learning, delivered through the Science Museum website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four games in the suite are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Robo-Lobsters: &amp;quot;Robotic lobsters have been designed to destroy mines in the sea. Take control of your Robo-Lobsters and keep the harbour safe from attack!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Space Junker: &amp;quot;The Earth is surrounded by orbiting space junk. Keep our satellites safe by clearing the skies with your Space Junker craft.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Bacto-Lab: &amp;quot;E.coli bacteria can be engineered so they make useful products. Engineer your E.coli in the right order. Don&amp;rsquo;t make a mistake &amp;ndash; you might create harmful mutant bacteria!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Cloud Control: &amp;quot;The Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate is changing. Use Flettner ships to brighten clouds so they reflect sunlight and lower the Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games are presented within a simple meta game tracking a player&amp;rsquo;s score and rank, and integrating with both Kongregate&amp;rsquo;s and Newgrounds API.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Futurecade is a bold and innovative way of engaging young and enquiring minds with deeper notions of science and scientific endeavour. Currently available to play on browsers but coming to other platforms soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
