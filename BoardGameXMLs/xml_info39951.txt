							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tien Zi Que: White Dragon</name>
									
			<description>White Dragon is an entertaining pocket MahJong for two. It uses unique selection of MahJong cards, and each card is added a color code (blue, green, red, white or black) for special scoring. With exceptional game play and color code, White Dragon brings you more fun and strategy than the traditional MahJong. All you need is 5 cards on hand and little or no MahJong knowledge to play. The first player collects 30 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal / Winning the Game:&lt;br/&gt;After creating a Set, player chooses to keep one of the cards for end of the Round scoring. When one player completes five Sets, he calls MahJong and wins the Round immediately. He then uses the one card from each Set to calculate the score point. Player&amp;rsquo;s score points are accumulated after every winning round, and the player who accumulates 30 or more points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: 2&lt;br/&gt;Time: 24.7 Min&lt;br/&gt;Age: Ages 8 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 54 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three Dragon Expansions: TZQ Red Dragon, TZQ White Dragon, and TZQ Green Dragon. Mix any two TZQ games for 3-4 player game, and mix any three TZQ games for 5-6 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Hmmm.... this description is the exact same description as TZQ.... these might just be the same game with different components that are combinable for a larger game --!&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
