			<description>QUICKSingle Card Cricket is a card game with a theme based on the game of cricket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    40 bowling cards (bowling deliveries) &lt;br/&gt;    60 batting cards (batting shots) &lt;br/&gt;    60 fielding cards (fielding positions) &lt;br/&gt;    Re-usable scorecard &lt;br/&gt;    Erasable pen &lt;br/&gt;    Coin (for the toss)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game for 2 to 4 players. In the standard 4-player form of the game, the game has two teams - the fielding team and the batting team. On the fielding team one player takes the role of the bowler while the other takes the fielder role. On the batting team the two players each take the role of the batsmen.  The batting team will have ten overs to score runs, unless the bowling team can take ten wickets first. The team with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How it works: The game contains three decks of cards; batting, bowling, fielding. Each over, the batter, the bowler and fielder receive a new set of possible deliveries(bowling cards), shot options (batting cards) and field positions (field cards).&lt;br/&gt;The bowler will try to restrict runs, bowl the batter or appeal for LBW. The batter will try to smash a six. But no, you'll only be able to get a single off that one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are optional rules for a two-player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is broadly speaking a trick-taking card game where the player controlling the batsman tries to follow suit and play a lower-valued card than the bowler.  Play then moves on to the fielder who tries to follow suit and play a card that's equal in value to the batting card played.&lt;br/&gt; Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://homepages.slingshot.co.nz/~ckc/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://homepages.slingshot.co.nz/~ckc/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
