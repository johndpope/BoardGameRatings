			<description>Produced by &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.GreenBusinessOwner.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.GreenBusinessOwner.com&lt;/a&gt;, this game makes sustainability come to life in a fun, interactive way. Players are investors looking to make more than just financial returns by helping local entrepreneurs in Hawai'i develop sustainability-oriented businesses like organic farms, geothermal plants, green building companies, solar installers, and bike shops. The game is ideal for those who are interested in sustainability as a better way to do business, and can be played by 2-4 players ages 13+. It's also a great learning tool, and the parent company has produced free downloadable lesson planning materials for teachers! Check out &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.GBOHawaii.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.GBOHawaii.com&lt;/a&gt; for more info on that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a beautiful board with the map of Hawai'i, several decks of playing cards used in the game, a green business property deck of businesses you can invest in, dice, player pieces, and a stack of money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in Hawai'i, and players act as impact investors. Their goal is to start businesses that have a triple bottom line effect: make money, create good paying green jobs, and deal with three main environmental challenges of energy, food, and waste. To establish businesses, players must obtain certain resources like human resources (entrepreneurs, green collar workers, and the wild card--green MBA's). Some businesses require permits, mostly for larger developments and energy projects, and it's a humorous twist on permitting processes in local governments--full of possibilities and potential frustrations. Players must also navigate public policy and chance events that may or may not be helpful in achieving the goal of a sustainable economy in Hawai'i.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the best Triple Bottom Line (people, planet, profit) score wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
