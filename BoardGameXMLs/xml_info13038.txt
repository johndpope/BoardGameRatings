			<description>From the game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The of the game in Spycatcher is to get YOUR book published!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this you must have 'permission' from the 'government', the 'courts' serialization with the newspaper and finally the publishers willingness to print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this, you must travel around the board visiting the appropriate circles and collecting one of each of the permission cards found within.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to do this and return to the center of the board is the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
