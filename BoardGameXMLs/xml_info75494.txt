			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Teaches Typing is a video game designed to teach typing skills to children. It was published and developed by Interplay and officially licensed by Nintendo. It was released for MS-DOS in 1991, Microsoft Windows and Macintosh in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mario Teaches Typing includes three selectable characters: Mario, Luigi and Princess Toadstool. The game displays two pairs of hands which show which finger to use; for example, if the player has to type &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, the leftmost finger is highlighted. If the player makes an error, the cursor does not advance until they enter the correct key. After time ends, the exercise ends and a chalkboard screen appears, displaying statistics on how well the player performs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
