							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jal: A Race Divided, a People United</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Booster Pack for the ADASTRA setting. Booster Packs are self contained and holds only the information needed to play the item contained within.&lt;br/&gt;In this case it is the race of Jal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jal are a powerful race of Protoawakened. Long ago, a god known simply as the Progenitor granted all his divine power to the females of the jal race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Kin learned of their existence, they decided that the young race was worthy of study. Females developed powerful divine abilities, and the males showed immense arcane aptitude due to their proximity to the females of their kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kin recognized a growing divide between the male and female jal, and manipulated the males until their arcane strength was just as potent as their female counterparts' divine strength. As the race grew and developed, their power and understanding of the way of things did as well. They have joined the ranks of the beings known as Protoawakened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
