			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Games Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules were used for the Ancient games in the 1976 National Wargames Championships and were officially adopted by the Society of Ancients, the special society for Ancient and Medieval wargamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the fifth edition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous editions were updated using free amendments, but as the era covered by the rules expanded, the amendments were too numerous and warranted another edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the revision is based on feedback from the society of wargamers.  Rules passages were rewritten for clarity.  Additional explanations were provided where necessary.  Also, minor adjustments to the rules were made to accommodate the armies in the expanded eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
