			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rules expansion for &amp;quot;Horror Rules, the Simply Horrible Roleplaying Game,&amp;quot; this book takes the horror to a whole new place. Ever wanted to battle the forces of supernatural evil in chain mail armor or blast 'em with mutant superhero powers? Well, now you're in luck! Horror Worlds takes the madness, mirth and mayhem of Horror Rules and drags it kicking and screaming into two BRAND NEW realms:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dungeon Crawl, explore the darkness of Medieval Europe or your favorite fantasy realm. Strap on your sword, collect your alchemy gear, pull on your monk's robes or just grab a shepherd's staff and get ready for some thrills and chills - Old World style! Includes six new Medieval Character Types and six Fantasy Character Types, plus weapons, equipment, new Character Powers and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Terror In Tights, shrug off the commonplace and ordinary and take to the skies in this high-flying, super-powered twist that gives you the tools you need (finally) to deal with evil! Whip up a Mutie, Hero Boy, Tin Can or whatever and prepare to duke it out with all things that prey on the good, hardworking, decent citizens of wherever you happen to live. Includes six new Super Types, plus a cartload of super powers, abilities, gadgets and guidelines to make your do-gooder the best she can be. Of course, with great powers come even greater Bad Guys...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horror Worlds contains complete rules for playing both of these expansions as well as a full Adventure Script for each. This supplement is a must-have for Horror Rules fans and proves once again that it's the game that makes you die laughing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
