							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dear Mr. Hadley (the Walking Game)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear Mr. Hadley,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I write in response to your query on the Walking Game. It is a potent pursuit, but takes much time to master, though such things matter little to one as yourself. Walking is perhaps the easiest and safest way to cross through the Fog and enter the Grey. Some men, even those ignorant of our Art may perform it by mistake. To Walk through the Fog and into the Grey is something I believe all Men were born with the ability to accomplish. Even mere beasts seem to possess the rudimentary facilities necessary to cross the threshold. The trick lies in mastering oneself. To master one's self is to master the universe, or so Moore said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
