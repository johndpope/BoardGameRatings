			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michiko had a passion for extreme metal and serious talent as a player, but she was a rich girl, so no one took her seriously. Then she bought an old guitar previously owned by a 1960s rockstar who played early heavy metal. When the guitar arrived, so did a mysterious stranger who offered her the same bargain the previous owner had taken before dying; she took the deal. Now with her dark side unleashed, she can call forth demons, use dark, destructive magic, and shred with the best of them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
