							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Risk: Factions (Social)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Risk: Factions is a video game that merges the gameplay of the classic board game Risk with social gaming features, similar to EA's The Sims Social.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is based on the 2010 game with the same title released for PC and Xbox Live Arcade, but it includes numerous additions such as bonus cards, extra factions, home base management, missions, gifts, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose a faction and compete for world domination on various maps while taking care of their home base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must train troops in their home base before they can be deployed on maps. They can speed the process up by spending &amp;quot;Risk Stars&amp;quot; which can be won randomly, or purchased with real-world money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Faction Upgrades can be developed using &amp;quot;Skill Points&amp;quot; or collected items. Each Faction has unique upgrades available. Buildings can be constructed in your home base to increase your troops capabilities. Sometimes these buildings will require you to &amp;quot;Hire Workers&amp;quot; by inviting your friends to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
