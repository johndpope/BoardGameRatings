			<description>Minigolf: the Roll-a-Coin game is a game for any number of people to play.  The wooden board is reconstructed with a different obstacle on each turn, and play consists of aiming and rolling a large coin towards a hole on the opposing end.  Score is kept like golf, with each roll counting against the player as one stroke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
