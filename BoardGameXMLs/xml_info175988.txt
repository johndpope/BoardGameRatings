							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aftermath: The Beginning</name>
									
			<description>A devastating earthquake ravaged the island of The Raya Republic. The initial devastation crippled major cities and damaged most of the island's main infrastructure. The tsunami that followed caused thousands to lose their lives, including the government and most of the military. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the island is in a major state of emergency with no one to lead the people. The world is looking for someone to whom they can to send desperately needed resources. With such an opportunity, many have risen up to claim power. Will you rise to the challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aftermath: The Beginning is a game about gaining political influence by providing desperate provinces the resources they need. Players use their influence to acquire resources, use publicity to bolster their campaign or hinder their opponents, and make deals with each other to reach the final goal of becoming the next leader of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players customize the island at the beginning of each game, giving each game variance and loads of replay value. The objective of the game is to acquire the most population control through your influence. Every turn, an aid package - full of valuable resources - is sent to the island. Players bid for resources and spend them to gain influence in the different provinces. Each turn, each province has different resource needs. Each province has a population value. As players gain influence, they gain control of those provinces. The player at the end of the game with the most population control wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
