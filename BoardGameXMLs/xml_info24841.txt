							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Horseless Carriage Race</name>
									
			<description>This very early game from McLoughlin Brothers of New York was produced just as automobiles came on to the scene as viable transportation. The map showed the U.S., southern Canada, and northern Mexico with major cities such as New York, New Orleans, Mexico City, Los Angeles and Quebec depicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players race across the country. The cars are moved by spinning a cardboard rondel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was a simple spin and move game which featured spots on the board where one might lose a turn because of breakdowns or repairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
