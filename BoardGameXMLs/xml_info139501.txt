Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems, Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems, and Boeing Defense &amp;amp; Space Group's Military Airplanes Division are teamed to develop the F-22 as the replacement for the F-15. The fast, agile and stealthy F-22 will be the Air Force's frontline fighter of the 21st century with much improved capability over current Air Force aircraft. From the onset of the battle, the F-22's primary objective will be to establish air dominance through the counter-air operations. The F-22 also has an inherent air-to-surface capability. The F-22 incorporates the latest technological gains in low observables, avionics, materials, engine performance and aerodynamic design. Knowledge gained from proven weapon systems such as the F-15, F-16 and F117A formed the foundation for F-22 development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
