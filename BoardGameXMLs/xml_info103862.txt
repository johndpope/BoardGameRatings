							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spookybeans! The Gothic Comix Roleplaying Game</name>
									
			<description>From &amp;quot;Introduction:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Willkommen!&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Spookybeans, the role-playing game of gothic underground comedy comics (wow that&amp;rsquo;s a mouthful). This game allows players to explore a morbidly funny comic book world in the vein of Tim Burton, Roman Dirge, Jill Thompson, Serena Valentino, and Johnen Vasquez, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spookybeans takes place in Gotham, a large city with a whole lot of social, community, and employment issues. Although the characters in Spookybeans can be from anywhere in or out of the city, the exploits of our creepy kids and adults takes place in a section of the city known as The Hollow, a near-suburban neighborhood surrounding a gigantic 200-year old cemetery. Since the 1960&amp;rsquo;s, this area has become a cultural mecca for trendy hippies, rockers, gang-bangers, punks, and of course, Spookybeans. Life here can be quite absurd with its mixture of people, lifestyles, and the occasional weirdness like vampires, aliens, and yuppies. Ah, variety is the spice of life&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whut&amp;rsquo;s a Spoookie-Beeen?&lt;br/&gt;Spookybeans are a sub-group of the inhabitants of The Hollow, and even within this sub-group, the diversity boggles the mind. Spookybeans can be goth kids, ex-vampire hunters, alien invaders, fairy princesses, caffeine-addicted conspiracy theorists, or very nearly anything else you can think of that's just a little&amp;hellip; twisted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
