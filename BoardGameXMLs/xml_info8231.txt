			<description>Looks and feels very similar to &amp;quot;Axis &amp;amp; Allies: Pacific&amp;quot;.  Description taken from the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacific at War is a multi-player military strategy game taking place in the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. Players must fight battles successfully to win territories and therefore increase their income. The more income a player has, the more buying power he has to purchase the combat units necessary to win battles and gain territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve their goals, the players have at their disposal playing pieces representing infantry, armor, artillery, fighters, bombers and various types of naval vessels. A player must use clever strategy and planning and purchase units wisely in order to make the most of his resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese player starts the game at war with China. He must decide how much military equipment he wants to commit and for how long before the United States and Britain are brought into the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chinese player must attempt to inflict as many Japanese casualties as possible and hold out until the Allies enter the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. and Britain will enter the war simultaneously. Until then, they can only prepare the best they can for the inevitable Japanese attack...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
