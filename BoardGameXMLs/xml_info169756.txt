			<description>From the Davy Jones' Poker English rules page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yo-ho-ho! Are there three of you here? Okay, let's gamble! Each of you take out two of something as chips for betting. The chips can be anything...candies, toys, coins, stones, etc. Who loves the ocean most between you three? He becomes the first dealer. Shuffle all cards well, and deal one card to each player. Do not show your card to anyone. Put the remaining card face down at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first turn goes to the player to the right of the dealer and continues counter-clockwise. The active player decides to either PARLAY (trade cards with the player to their right) or KEEP (keep their currently held card). The next player does the same. If the third player chooses PARLAY, they change cards with the remaining card in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has had one chance to PARLAY or KEEP, a countdown...3, 2, 1...is shouted and everyone reveals their card at the same time. The highest numbered card wins UNLESS both the 3 Card and the 0 Card have been revealed. In this case, reverse the order and the lowest numbered card wins! The player with the weakest card pays a chip to the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play more rounds until one player is out of chips. After that, the dealer deals 1 card to each player and 2 cards in a stack, face down to the center of the table. If a player chooses to PARLAY, they replace their card with the top card in the stack at the center of the table. Continue playing rounds until only one player remains and is declared the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
