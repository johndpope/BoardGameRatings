			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I am an explorer, a man of action, and foiler of nefarious plots. Come read my book, Evocative City Sites, and I, Owain Northway, will guide you to a house of ill repute filled with shapechangers. I will tell you of The Intimate Shape Festhall.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evocative City Sites: a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game compatible supplement detailing small locations that you could find in any urban campaign setting. Each site is detailed with its own cartography, a 1&amp;quot;= 1 square scale map pack, two unique npcs, 5 adventure seeds, all presented in the unique, useful, and entertaining form of Owain Northway's first person point-of-view guidebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intimate Shape Festhall is a place where you can relax and indulge your every desire. you can find any companion you desire, as the attendants here can read your very mind, all in a building that could deal with any threat and possible even break a dragon under its massive weight. You will find it in a secluded spot just down from the Next Inn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
