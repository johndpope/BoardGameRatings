							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trouble at Grimhallow Manor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome To Grimhallow Manor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tread carefully in this spooky 5th-edition adventure for 3-5 players of 3rd-level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble at Grimhallow Manor is a horror-themed adventure that is; a) setting-agnostic (meaning that it can be easily picked up wholesale and dropped into other settings whether they're official, 3rd-party, or homebrew); b) fully standalone (meaning that it doesn't require other advenures or a lot of exposition to make sense of its narrative), and c) pretty short (sufficiently so that it can be run in just a handful of sessions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trouble at Grimhallow Manor is also incredibly versatile in the sense that it can be quickly adapted and modified to suit higher or lower-level groups or even parties of unusual sizes thanks to its unique 'machinations' system. The entire product is also super cheap (never a bad thing) and ultra accessible as it comes in a variety of formats (including 'standard', 'printer-friendly', and 'super printer-friendly'), and it also comes with printable art cards and a monster index (also available in 'standard', 'printer-friendly', and 'super printer-friendly' formats).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We could prattle on and on about Trouble at Grimhallow Manor but it's probably best to leave you to discover the sleepy manor-house and horrors that lurk within it for yourself. Check out the previews and, if you like what you see, pick up the adventure for yourself today (seriously don't, it's evil).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
