							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modrons, Mephits &amp; Mayhem!</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modrons, Mephits &amp;amp; Mayhem is a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5E tier 2 adventure for three to five characters of levels 5-8. It is primarily set in a modron-designed research facility that has been abandoned by its creators but retains guardians that are still active. Additionally, two groups have broken into the facility with their own goals in mind; the githyanki and their red dragon cohort are antagonistic and provide the main source of combat in this adventure, while a modron traveling with a few mephits may prove friendly although ultimately troublesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by adventure games in which the protagonists explore baroque, esoteric technological fortresses, and seeded throughout with factions that sport competing and often bizarre goals, Modrons, Mephits &amp;amp; Mayhem is sure to test the mettle of any group of players, and will provide endless amusement for Dungeon Masters seeking something different from the typical hack-and-slash dungeon crawl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 70-page adventure features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two wilderness areas, random wilderness encounters, and a massive, interlinking 3-level dungeon filled with bizarre puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;Ancient machinery powered by elemental portals, all of which can be activated, turned off, or manipulated by the player characters and the various factions within the modron facility.&lt;br/&gt;Planar creatures like githzerai and githyanki, modrons, mephits, and elemental guardians, skillfully placed into the High Moor area of the Forgotten Realms setting.&lt;br/&gt;Monsters and NPCs that have detailed (yet easy to run!) personalities and goals that will provide tons of roleplaying opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;Notes and sidebars on running the NPCs with added complexity, or simplifying the NPCs' motives to make the adventure more straightforward.&lt;br/&gt;Tactics notes for every single encounter!&lt;br/&gt;An appendix that features all monster stat blocks, and both tagged (DM) and untagged (Player) versions of the dungeon maps.&lt;br/&gt;Wilderness hex map by Elven Tower Cartography! Three interlinked dungeon levels by Dyson Logos...and one of them is a flying fortress! Cover art by Patrick E. Pullen!&lt;br/&gt;(Feel free to check out the Free Preview Version of this adventure for a look at one whole dungeon level!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
