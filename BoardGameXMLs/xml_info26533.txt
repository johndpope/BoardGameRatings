			<description>Jauram gripped his battle axe a bit tighter as the warlock's undead shambled their way up the hill. All day he and his battle brothers had been crushing the dark mages dead servants, and still the came on, endless numbers of the walking dead. If only he and the others could hold out one more day, re-enforcements were bound to arrive soon. If he and the other dwarves could just hold?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms is the newest Mini-game from Bad Baby Productions. Take the side of the stubborn dwarfs nations or the foul undead hoards of the Warlock lord, as the two battle for control of the world. A fast paced fantasy game of warfare, spells, magical items and mighty beasts, all will be under you control as you battle your foe. Can you out last, out fight and out maneuver your enemy, or will you fall to their sharp edged sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game requires Realms: Elves &amp; Orcs to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combine this with other Realms expansions to create even more massive fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
