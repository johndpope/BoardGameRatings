							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aeon Angelus Necronomicon: Evolution</name>
									
			<description>from Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is designed to be run in just three hours. No prior knowledge of Cthulhutech is needed to play this scenario, though knowledge of the Neon Genesis Evangelion and the works of H.P Lovecraft is helpful. This scenario includes everything needed to play it, except some dice (ten sided dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from The Original Concept:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is based upon my ideas for a full length campaign called Aeon Angelus Necronomicon . Thematically, this campaign is my retelling of the Neon Genesis Evangelion story through the lens of CthulhuTech. This story is ver y popular in anime and has been retold a number of times, including in both RahXephon and Fafner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the seeming difficulty of retelling a story of this scope and scale in such a short period of time, it is not unprecedented. This scenario forms part of the tradition that both Evangelion and RahXephon established in retelling their entire story in a single movie, consisting of the most important scenes edited together. Like those movies, the pace in this scenario will be frantic and the players will be scrambling to keep up with the events. However, this is intentional and both those movies help establish how this scenario is likely to feel in play. Embrace the madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario revolves around the three main Acts of what I envisaged to be the three stages of the longer campaign. Should you wish to evolve this scenario into a three session mini-campaign or a three year mega epic, it should be relatively easy to do so with the material provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
