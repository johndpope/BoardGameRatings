			<description>In Popularity Contest, 4 to 6 players play cards on their turn to try and be the most popular. Being popular is good but beware, sometimes if you are too popular, your friends will turn against you. Play cards to add or subtract from your or an opponents popularity. If you are the least popular you will be eliminated. Don't get too secure in your popularity, if you get too popular someone may give you a zero card and you may also get eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;If you are eliminated, you are not out. Eliminated players use their remaining cards to help determine the winner. Be the last person standing (the most popular) and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
