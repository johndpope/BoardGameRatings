			<description>MicroQuest #2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Death Test II is a programmed adventure for THE FANTASY TRIP.  It can be played using the MELEE and WIZARD rules -- or you can use TFT: IN THE LABYRINTH, which comprises MELEE, WIZARD, and much more.  This booklet will set up the rooms for you, give you decisions to make, and tell you the outcomes of those decisions.  You will need to supply six-sided dice, a straightedge, scratch paper, and either MELEE and WIZARD or TFT: IN THE LABYRINTH, ADVANCED MELEE and ADVANCED WIZARD.  Each room (by a lucky coincidence) is the size of a MELEE map -- or you can build the same shape out of TFT megahexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEATH TEST II can be played in several ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire - One lone player can take both sides, creating a party of adventurers and running them through.  This booklet will give instructions regarding the foes in each room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-Player - One player creates a party of adventurers and enters the labyrinth.  When foes are encountered, the other player controls them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player - Each player creates their own character with a Game Master running the adventure from the book.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
