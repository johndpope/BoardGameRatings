			<description>The aim of the game is to form as many groups of the same color of three or more balls moving along a track before it reaches the end of the track. At the bottom of the screen there is a spoon-like icon which can be moved right and left and shoots balls. In order to shoot balls from the canon upwards, the player must position the cursor over the canon, and click on the mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
