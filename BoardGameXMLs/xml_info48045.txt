			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe you know about Deadlands: Hell on Earth, the worst possible future for the award-winning Deadlants: The Weird West roleplaying game.  Maybe you've heard about the way the cities of the West and the world were bombed back into the Stone Age during the now-legendary Last War.  Maybe you think you've got a handle on the truth about what really happened, about exactly how it all went bad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, you're flat-out wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucky for you, brainer, we've got the straight dope right here between two toxic-green covers.  The Wasted West is packed full (so full, we had to add 16 extra pages for free!) with new rules for Deadlands: Hell on Earth, including things ranging from witch's spells to power armor, not to mention a passel of new Edges, Hindrances, full-color archetypes, and gear to whip your hero into the kind of waster that actually stands a chance of surviving this post-Apocalyptic age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's also &amp;quot;Jo's Journal,&amp;quot; a first-hand account of the Wasted West, straight from a Templar who's literally dying to tell you all about it.  It's required reading for any wasteland warrior worth his milrats - as long as he's interested in seeing tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
