							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CHRONOS Universal LARP System Core Rule Book</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system that every theater LARPer has been waiting for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CHRONOS Player Book is the guide for using the CHRONOS  cards to make a character, handle conflict resolution, determine success and failure; as well as how to apply the CHRONOS Universal LARP system across a multitude of worlds.  The CHRONOS book also explains the game concepts and terminology, such as Aether, Fonts, Thresholds, Skeins, Resolution Hand, and the Character Deck in relation to playing a CHRONOS game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CHRONOS Core Book illustrates how the game system as a whole works, while the individual cards put the mechanics for their character in the players own hands.  The CHRONOS Core Book serves as the underlying mechanics document for all CHRONOS games, allowing future CHRONOS Skeins to focus on genre instead of rewriting mechanics for every new game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With conflict resolution taking only seconds instead of hours, the ability to transition seamlessly between narrative table top play and theater LARP play, the versatility to run nearly any game world, plus the support of additional theme and world &amp;lsquo;Skein&amp;rsquo; decks, the CHRONOS system is what gamers have been waiting for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
