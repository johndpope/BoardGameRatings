			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You command a lonely outpost far away in the galaxy. The alert sounds. You're being attacked by alien ships from all directions. You destroy some--but they keep coming faster and faster. You'll find Space Fortress positively addicting. It always keeps your interest because of the increasing speed of the enemy assault from all sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep, deep in space lies a defense base designed to guard our home galaxy against enemy alien invasion. Its powerful laser weaponry is our only hope for warding off enemy invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instantly enemy ships appear, hurling deadly fire balls toward the fortress. Direct fire explodes the ships and neutralizes fire balls. Fire quickly before the fire ball hits and explodes the fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful defense provokes the aliens to launch more fire balls, providing little chance for retaliation. Be warned; as the battle continues, tension mounts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Randomly, an alien kamikaze ship zooms in for direct attack on the fortress. Shoot accurately or it will ram the fortress with its highly radioactive energy core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a base is destroyed, another appears (if you selected a number greater than 1 prior to beginning the game). Once all the bases have been destroyed by each player, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
