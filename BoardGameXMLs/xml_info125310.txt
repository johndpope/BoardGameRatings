			<description>The Sandbox, which literally takes place in a sandbox, is a unique game based entirely on the four classical elements and the laws of physics. The player takes the role of &amp;quot;Deity apprentice&amp;quot; and sets about creating his or her own universe through the exploration of resources such as lightning, lava, sand, glass, and many others. Players will delight at the variety of missions they'll encounter, from simple tasks like using water and sand to make mud, to more complex challenges like making a battery or building an electrical circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll have the power to create and destroy. No aspect of nature shall be beyond your grasp, you're limited only by your imagination. Play as a benevolent deity and give life to majestic mountains and beautiful forests, or embrace your vengeful side by spawning raging fires and devastating explosions. Nature is yours to command, as are various other man-made objects like light bulbs, heaters, oil lamps and diodes. And once you've created your glorious universe, you'll be able to save it and share it in the online gallery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
