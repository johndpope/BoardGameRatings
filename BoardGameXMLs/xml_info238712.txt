							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paradise Island: An Exotic Adventure Location</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well this Paradise Island might be just the place for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With loads of story hooks to help you create adventures and a whole Paradise Island with multiple locations to explore I am sure you will be able to get your players scrambling up cliffs, tangling with sirens and dealing with feuding natives in no time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you get is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 Main locations and ten sublocations &amp;ndash; locations start from the oceans and go all the way inland including, outlying mini islands and rock formations, four beaches, agricultural land, a main city, further habitations, dock area, inland jungles and swamps, a huge active volcano and more!&lt;br/&gt;23 story hooks for suggested adventure ideas&lt;br/&gt;2 Maps to help aid navigation and investigation&lt;br/&gt;Additional DM notes to help prompt and guide&lt;br/&gt;New creature &amp;ndash; Sirens &amp;ndash; capable of luring your players astray whether on land or sea! Full stat block included&lt;br/&gt;New rules for climbing &amp;ndash; to factor in when the players rope themselves together and believe that solves everything!&lt;br/&gt;Over 7000 words of descriptions over 17 fully illustrated pages&lt;br/&gt;Whether you want to use this as an extension for Chult (the fabulous Tomb of Annihilation setting) or prefer to drop this into your home campaign it is flexible enough to serve all needs. It&amp;rsquo;s also a magic paradise island and capable of moving under barely understood arcane powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a setting that owes a lot to the south sea adventure books I read as a child and also DC&amp;rsquo;s Wonder Woman and her fabulous island of Amazons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
