							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Power Ups</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Fantasy 1: Adventurers gave you powerful delvers who could cut a swath through the world and take its stuff. Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level added racial templates, rules for mixing professions, and all-new power-ups, making your adventurers even more awesome. Now Dungeon Fantasy 11: Power-Ups raises the stakes again, bringing more &amp;ndash; and more-powerful &amp;ndash; power-ups to the table that will really boost your heroes' kill counts and bank accounts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you'll find power-ups for every profession and race in Dungeon Fantasy 1-10 &amp;ndash; and for every budget. At one end are more than 50 perks to modify your spells and combat moves; at the other are more than 80 significant new abilities, priced at up to 100 points. Many options &amp;ndash; like the bard's Songs, elementalist's Storms, and necromancer's Foul Limbs &amp;ndash; offer several subtypes and specialties. And that's not even counting hundreds of minor abilities and suggestions, several new spells, and more. From the silliness of Combat Haberdashery through the sheer power of the Secret Teleportation Spell, a true munchkin is sure to see something he likes. Fortunately for the GM, these power-ups come with guidelines for acquiring and using them . . . and for designing new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While intended for Dungeon Fantasy, these power-ups are suitable for any GURPS campaign involving dungeon crawls, and are sure to provide players and GMs alike with new ideas no matter what genre they prefer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
