			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this box likes the key to hours of fast-paced fun and excitement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find one complete game manual usable by both game masters and players, one sheet of full-color cutout heroines, blank character sheets and maps of the Orlando area. In addition to all this cool role-playing stuff you will also receive a full color poster of the Femforce, an issue of the Femforce comic book and a special collector's limited edition mini-comic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are tired of dark, gritty, reality-based R.P.G.'s and are looking for a superheroic R.P.G. that is fast moving and easy to learn, then this is the game for you.  You can play your favorite character from the pages of Femforce or create your own hero or heroine to battle the forces of evil.  Whether you are a novice gamer or an advanced pro, this system offers challenges that anyone can enjoy. With a rule book written in a conversational tone instead of reading like stereo instructions, an easy to use combat system, and a good dose of tongue in cheek humor, this is a game that you will play over and over giving you hours of R.P.G. enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
