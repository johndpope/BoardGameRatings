			<description>The players travel through the federal state of Hesse, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;They receive one town card which becomes their &amp;quot;home card&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;They get 11 more cards which they have to organize for their travel from town to town.&lt;br/&gt;The destination is the capital Wiesbaden.&lt;br/&gt;The die lets the pawns move. A &amp;quot;free time&amp;quot; card is taken when a 6 is rolled. It contains events that either have to be fulfilled immediately or it can be kept to fulfill later. &amp;quot;Free time&amp;quot; cards disrupt the normal trip through Hesse.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach Wiesbaden and get rid of all their cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
