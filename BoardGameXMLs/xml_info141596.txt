							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Martial Action</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barbarians, Fighters, and Rogues, Rejoice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that there are really two ways to go about playing Pathfinder and similar d20 games: you can be a spellcaster, and have all kinds of crazy options to choose from, or you can be a more mundane, martial character, and, well&amp;hellip;not. Sure, barbarians get rage powers and paladins can smite evil, and if you devote a bunch of feats to it you might get a couple of nifty tricks like two-weapon fighting or spring attacking, but at the end of the day most mundane characters spend their combat rounds doing full attack after full attack, and eventually that gets a little stale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been attempts in the past to make fighters and their ilk more interesting to play, but all too often these rely on giving these characters magical (or at least supernatural) powers, and if you just want your character to be able to do cool things with a sword that demonstrate that he&amp;rsquo;s well-trained and knows a lot of useful techniques, that&amp;rsquo;s too bad, because your only options are using your sword to shoot laser beams and fly, or else falling back on the good old-fashioned full attack. Plus, they often require taking a special class, or using complex rules that are difficult to integrate into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book aims to provide a way for martially-inclined characters of any class to be more interesting without falling back on the supernatural. Through over 50 feats and seven very detailed archetypes, A Necromancer&amp;rsquo;s Grimoire: The Book of Martial Action will introduce you to the world of martial action points, a renewable resource that can be spent on a wide variety of martial techniques that allow your character to perform extraordinary&amp;mdash;but decidedly non-magical&amp;mdash;maneuvers, making combat wildly more dynamic and ensuring that you can always do something more interesting than a full attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
