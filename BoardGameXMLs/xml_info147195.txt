			<description>Based on the popular long running 1988-2000 and 2004-2005 Tele 5, RTL II, tm3 and currently RTLplus since 2016 German game show of the same name. (for which in turn was originally adapted from a short-lived 1986 U.S. daytime game show on ABC called Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak) First, the players determine which set of cards to work with. Then it determines the starting player, for which they continue clockwise. The first player pulls on the clock and draws the top card from the deck. Then He/She submits to his/her right players and starts the clock. the player must then now decide on which of the two generic terms the he/she will use and announce them. He/She then list three terms matching the topic while stopping the clock. The hands of the clock displays the score, which is listed in the circular column under the name of the player. Then the timer switches to the next player. In the following four rounds, five and even six terms must be found in the same subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bonus round is also somewhat different that the actual TV series. for which the active player can draw new cards for so long, until the clock expires. For each card completely played, the player gets a point. Cards can continued to be pulled out until the time expires. at the end of the round, the Player will receive one point for each completed card that has been played. The winner is the player whose total is after the bonus round is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
