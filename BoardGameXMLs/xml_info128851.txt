			<description>A card game that feels like a mix of Mille Bornes and Rummy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a hand of 8 cards. Players take turns in order; a turn consists of:&lt;br/&gt;1. draw a card &lt;br/&gt;2. (optional) meld cards (face down), and/or change previous melds&lt;br/&gt;3. discard a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first card melded must always be a &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; card; followed by several number cards (forming one out of 5 legal combinations), and a &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; card as last card.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the game contains cards that mess with other players hands, or allow to claim a discarded card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round ends when one player has completed a combination (for example: start, two triplets, key). Each player gets points for the cards he melded. There are some ways to score bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in several rounds, until the score of one player reaches 35 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
