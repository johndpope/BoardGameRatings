			<description>Roll and move a game where the aim is to decrease the number of pounds of weight decided by mutual agreement at the beginning of each game and achieve a healthy weight. Reaching it is not easy ... you'll have to have a lot of luck and when you get close to winning your opponents will tend countless traps and invite you to dinner and forcing you to eat more meals possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
