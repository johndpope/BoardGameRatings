			<description>The Drowning Soldiers is a game for 2 players. Its mechanics evolve around a player-determined, constantly changing battlefield shape &amp;amp; size. The objective of the game is to trap &amp;amp; drown 3 of your opponent's pieces (soldiers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces (which we call 'soldiers') consist of 12 numbered checkers. Odd numbered pieces are in red and even numbered in blue. The numbers indicate their turn order in placement &amp;amp; movement phase, both of which follows the ascending order of the numbers on the soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st phase: placement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldiers are being placed on the blocks under the said order. With the only restriction that no soldier can be placed adjacent to another one that was already on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd phase: move &amp;amp; drown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A soldier on turn can either move to an adjacent block, move any empty adjacent block to a different empty tile on the board, or perform a card action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 types of cards in game. Each player has 2 of each type to begin with and can recover a used card upon drowning an opponent soldier. The 3 cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bomb card: destroys a block adjacent to the soldier on turn.&lt;br/&gt;Swap card: swaps the soldier on turn with an adjacent friendly soldier.&lt;br/&gt;Barricade card: creates a barricade block on an empty tile of the board adjacent to the soldier on turn. Barricades are neither movable, destroyable, or mountable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drowning: A soldier is drowned when it is his own turn to move but there is no move available other than to use a card. The drowned soldier will then be removed from the board along with the block it is standing on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
