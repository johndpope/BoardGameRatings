							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hunger Games: Catching Fire â€“ Victors Game</name>
									
			<description>The fire has started -- You and the other rebels are here to see that it keeps burning all the way to The Capitol. Using different card combinations to score points, you must gather the most resources to best aid Katniss and the cause... But watch out! One of the other players may be a Capitol spy who will attempt to steal victory from you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Catching Fire Victor's Game is an easy-to-learn game of strategy and deduction as players look to maximize the cards that they play while also anticipating the strategies of the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
