			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The military spends billions for weapons research each year, improving everything from the simple infantry rifle to the most sophisticated missiles deployed on the battlefield. Publicly, only one component remains untouched, the actual soldier himself. Of course, the military does try to create superhuman soldiers, but only in secret, off the books programs. These programs have no consideration for the well being of the research subjects, but the few who survive the tests can develop incredible abilities at the price of their health or sanity. Few of these experimental subjects leave the military on good terms, either going A.W.O.L. or washing out for disciplinary reasons. These survivors wander the globe, haunted by the pain they've suffered in the name of science and power. This 6 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Violence and Haven: Full Metal Zero. Fans of Marvel Comics' Wolverine, X-23, Deadpool or Sabretooth will love to use this character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
