			<description>The game contains 4 double sided boards, with a detailed image of an exotic location from around the world printed on each side. There is also a set of cards displaying objects that can be found on every board. The objects are hidden within the images so that they mingle with the background, making them hard to spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, a single board is selected. On each turn, a card is turned face up and players try to spot the object as fast as possible. The first one to do so wins the card. The winner is the player who accumulated the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
