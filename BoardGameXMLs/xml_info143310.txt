							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Invasion</name>
									
			<description>Aliens are invading Earth!&lt;br/&gt;Six alien races are coming to enslave humanity. Which of them will succeed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Invasion is a control area game with lots of bluffing for 2 to 5 players..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has the control of an alien race in secret, nobody has to know which of them. Every alien has it's own special skills and everybody can use them to their own purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every turn, a player must choice an alien race, a place to invade and an action token. With that, has to change majorities without give clues to other players about his own race. First, place new invasors. Then, move them to an adjacent place if you want. And last, perform it's special skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that there is more different aliens in game than players. So you have to pay attention to other player's movements to guess which is their race. And which race is a non-playing one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, everybody reveals his race and earn points according the majorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This are the aliens:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Proteus: Giant amoebas. Skill -&amp;gt; An invasor comes to the place from an adjacent one, then kill one on main place.&lt;br/&gt;-Enerllaiser: Energy monsters. Skill -&amp;gt; Teleport an alien from the place he is, to the one you want.&lt;br/&gt;-Fetids: they stink. Skill -&amp;gt; Move a invasor to an adjacent place. From that adjacent place, move a different invasor to an adjacent place far away from the original. If at any moment there is no move possible the invasor dies.&lt;br/&gt;-Space Zombies. Like normal zombies, but from outer space. Skill -&amp;gt; Bites an invasor and changes its race to another different.&lt;br/&gt;-Ulfedar: Explote. Skill -&amp;gt; Kills an invasor and another one from an adjacent place.&lt;br/&gt;-Spores. Copycat. Skill -&amp;gt; Copy the skill of another alien on the same place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
