							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Zombies: Day One</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Where Did All These Zombies Come From?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie geeks love to argue about runners vs. shamblers, and whether zombies are defined by mindless behavior or strictly by flesh-eating, infectiousness, and undeath. The topic is nuanced enough that you could tell a new zombie story each day. The catch is that gamers expect a campaign to last a bit longer than that. Which is where GURPS Zombies: Day One comes in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Day One sketches out eight zombie scenarios in broad strokes, looking at genre, backdrop, theme, scope, and power level &amp;ndash; and of course zombie type. In each case, it recommends what parts of GURPS Zombies are worth keeping and what's best discarded for a coherent story. The result is an octet of densely packed campaign seeds:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empire of the Necromancer-King offers a fantasy realm overrun by cursed zombies. It certainly feels like an apocalypse, but the heroes must battle the hordes using swords and spells, not chainsaws and shotguns.&lt;br/&gt;Fields of Fear conceals dark doings in a town in the Antebellum South. You don't need a global onslaught of infectious ghouls to be very afraid. In fact, it isn't the zombies you need to worry about . . .&lt;br/&gt;Savage Streets rips a page from today's news to bring you a city held hostage by drug-crazed, face-eating maniacs. Go ahead &amp;ndash; tell them they're not real zombies!&lt;br/&gt;Zeta Force assumes that almost every kind of zombie exists and then casts the PCs in the role of &amp;quot;Men in Black&amp;quot; tasked with keeping the world safe without revealing the truth.&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Zombie-Fighters jumps right into a video-game-style apocalypse in progress. Wrap your fists, grab your katana, load your shotgun, and get ready to rack up a body count!&lt;br/&gt;Alpha and Omega puts the heroes in the zombies' place . . . sort of. Would you want super-powers if the price were to become a hideous, hunted outcast living in humanity's dying days?&lt;br/&gt;Time of the Zombies starts where most zombie stories end: after society's destruction. Scrounge around in the ruins and rebuild, but be careful &amp;ndash; worse things than zombies lurk out there.&lt;br/&gt;Depravity Well crashes brave space voyagers on a world that unleashed the wrong nanotech. Can a handful of brave women and men hold out against a whole planet of immortal flesh-eaters?&lt;br/&gt;No matter what kinds of zombies you prefer or how mighty you like your heroes to be, there's something here for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
