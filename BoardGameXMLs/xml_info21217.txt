							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oxford: the Great Oxford Game of the English Language</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to move from the center of the spiral on the board to the final square of the outer circuit. Along the way, three small Oxford 'dictionaries' are collected. These are obtained by passing the special dictionary squares on the board or by winning a duel. The first player to cross the line with three dictionaries is the winner. To move forward, questions must be answered correctly. Players may choose questions from three levels easy, difficult or very difficult. Normally you can choose the level you want. Correct answers to more difficult questions make for faster progress. But beware: difficult usually means really difficult! The special squares on the board add extra excitement to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the same as Das grosse Dudenspiel and Het Groot Van Dale Spel der Nederlandse Taal, but in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
