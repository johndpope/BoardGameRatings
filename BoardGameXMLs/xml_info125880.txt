							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Temple Pyramid</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This massive, approximately 80 feet tall, square step pyramid, measuring no less than 130 feet at its base, and others like it dominate the centres of ancient cities, wrought from the surrounding forest, or at the very least their ruins. Countless tons of stone have been moved to erect this intimidating structure. It consists of no less than five steps, narrowing towards the top with a temple built on top of the smallest topmost step. On all four sides the steps of steep staircases ascend towards this temple, ever burning fires blazing in braziers at their bottom. The dark interior of the temple is dominated by a simple but large stone block which serves as an altar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
