			<description>Its 1851, the Gold Rush has been raging for three years and Old Man Biff has kicked the bucket. His widow Betsy has decided to return to civilization and sell her land rights to the best gold digger out there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold Rush: Dead Man's Creek is a fast-paced scramble to be the first player to bank 10 gold and win the rights to the gold claim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll a die and move their pawns from town to the river to pan for gold and return the gold to the bank. Watch out though, other players are looking to steal your gold or stop you any way they can by using their attack cards! Can you survive the rush?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
