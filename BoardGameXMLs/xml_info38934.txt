							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Math Smart Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Math Smart Card Game consists of 90 cards.  There are four different versions one for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.  The sets can be mixed and stacked in any way to allow players to focus on particulars or go for breadth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has an equation on one side and an answer to a different equation on the other.  The rules make for a tile placement game where players attempt to identify which answers match equations in their hand.  First player to lay all their cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a cooperative or solitaire variant in which players work together and attempt to correctly chain all the cards together.  This is an inexpensive card game that lets you and your kids practice math feeling more like you are playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
