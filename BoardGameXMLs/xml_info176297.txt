							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World War 2 Wargaming</name>
									
			<description>Airfix Magazine Guide 15, written in an informal style, as much an exploration of how to create a wargame, and what it simulates, this small book includes all data needed for a detailed, traditional miniatures system, as well as extensive discussion on why the author made the decisions he did in it's creation. Extensive charts &amp;amp; tables cover point-buy options, movement rates with terrain effects, sighting ranges, armour values (with multiple locations per vehicle) and gun penetration, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chosen figure scale is 1/72 (to include 1/76), while the miniature to real life ration of 1:1 makes this skirmish scale gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illustrations through the book are pictures of miniatures and wargames in progress. Original price was &amp;pound;1.40!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
