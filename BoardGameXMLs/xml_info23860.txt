			<description>Take a vacation to Branson, Missouri. While playing the game, players roll dice, move around the floor, and collect as many Vacation Cards as possible. At the end of thirty minutes, the player with the most Vacation Cards is the winner. &lt;br/&gt;Vacation Cards include Show-Time Cards, Meal-Time Cards and Fun-Time Cards. There are also Action Cards which include Think-Fast Cards, Audition Cards and Good News/Bad News Cards. Side loop trips also offered on the game board. &lt;br/&gt;Very colorful board with playing pieces in the shapes of little family sedans. The good news: no money involved.&lt;br/&gt;BONUS: This is a virtual time capsule of Branson in 1992. Many of the attractions and stars featured on the game board are no longer in Branson or have passed away. Includes Boxcar Willie, John Davidson, Wayne Newton, Tony Orlando, Ray Stevens, Jim Stafford and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
