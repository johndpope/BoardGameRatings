			<description>Who's the Daddy is a simple guessing game using the twelve characters from the board game Dollars and Dibble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pick one of the four gang colours (containing three characters each) and shuffle the cards. they are then placed face down from left to right. Players must then guess their way across the line up. The color selected most left goes first, saying the name of said character. the card is then turned up and player moves on to next in line if correct. if unsuccessful next player goes. If player guesses correct on his/her own chosen color, they are able to jump to their next card in line and take a guess at that one. If a player manages to guess their way across the line up without another player having a go, its known as &amp;quot;who's the daddy&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple, quick and great fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May the force be with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
