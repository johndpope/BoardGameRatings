			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silver Screen is a roleplaying game meant to teach kids about storytelling. It is meant as a camp activity for large groups split into small teams of 46. During Silver Screen, these teams will investigate the disappearance of a teen heartthrob during the 1930&amp;rsquo;s golden age of studio cinema. During play, the teams (assisted by a Facilitator and multiple Non-Player Characters) will investigate scenes, learn about roleplay and performance, and will produce a written story detailing the exact circumstances of this disappearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
