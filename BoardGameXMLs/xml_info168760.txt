							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Adventures In Turtleopolis Game</name>
									
			<description>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Adventures In Turtleopolis, is graphically based on the late 80's cartoon that originated from the comic book by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 to 4 players play as one of the four Turtles competing around the board while trying to avoid traps and bad luck spaces. The object of the game is to reach the end of each game board, which supposedly represent a different mission:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1: Race for the Blimp &lt;br/&gt;Game 2: Fight for the Sky &lt;br/&gt;Game 3: Battle for Cereal Castle&lt;br/&gt;Game 4: Dash for Home&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These four boards came on the back of the Ralston Cereal Boxes and as such are in conjunction a very simplistic version of similar games like &amp;quot;Snakes and Ladders&amp;quot;. Just throw the dice and let luck decide in which space you&amp;acute;ll end up. Some spaces have rewards while others punishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was another Ralston&amp;acute;s TMNT cereal box board game called &amp;quot;Adventures Under Turtleopolis&amp;quot; that came out during the same time, that featured amazing art with TMNT thematic enemies and elements such as the Technodrome and sewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
