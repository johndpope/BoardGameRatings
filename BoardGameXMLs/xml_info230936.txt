Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:Never miss a modifier! With Starfinder Condition Cards, GMs and players have all the rules for the game's most common conditions at their fingertips. Simply hand a player the appropriate card for their condition, and there's no need to go digging through a rulebook. Did your technomancer turn invisible? Did that alien paralyze your soldier with its venom? From bleeding and blinded to confused and panicked, these cards have the rules you need, when you need them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
