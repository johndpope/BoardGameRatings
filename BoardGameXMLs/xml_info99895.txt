			<description>Off Road Challenge is a video game developed and published by Midway Games. This game originally released in 1997 for the Arcade using the Midway V Unit hardware. This game eventually released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 developed by Avalanche Software and published by Midway Games. The Nintendo 64 conversion included several unlockable tracks and an added circuit mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The levels are mostly offroad tracks, sometimes containing urban areas. It features a very primitive vehicle tuning system that allowes the player to &amp;quot;Beef Up Your Truck!!&amp;quot; by purchasing upgrades to suspension, tires, &amp;quot;acceleration&amp;quot;, and various other performance items. It also features power-ups which you drive over with your vehicle, such as nitro, crash helmets (to prevent you from losing speed when colliding with others) and money to spend upgrading your vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Off Road Challenge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
