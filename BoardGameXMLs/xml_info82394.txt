			<description>From Wiki: &amp;quot;Saucer Attack is a computer game for the Commodore 64, created by James D. Sachs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a shoot 'em up where the player's job is to protect Washington, D.C. from invading flying saucers. The game screen presents a beautifully drawn backdrop of Washington, with various landmarks such as the Washington Monument visible. After a while, flying saucers start to descend from the top of the screen. The player has to move a crosshair at the saucers and fire bullets to destroy them. If allowed to proceed unharmed, saucers will hover near a famous landmark and shoot a beam of electricity at it, eventually destroying it. If all landmarks are destroyed, the game is lost.&amp;quot;(1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saucer Attack for the Commodore 64 was the first game James D. Sachs wrote. He marketed it by mail-order, and had fairly good success with it. It got some great reviews in the C-64 magazines.(2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Saucer Attack&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
