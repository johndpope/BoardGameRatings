							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mata Hari</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon Games is happy to make your life a bit more horrible&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Margaretha Geertruida Zelle MacLeod is an exotic dancer famous throughout Western Europe. For the past six years, she has gained great acclaim under the stage name, Mata Hari. She performs in &amp;ldquo;authentic&amp;rdquo; Eastern costumes that are both ornately decorated and extremely revealing. Her routines combine exotic eastern dances she learned in the Dutch East Indies with her own individual style. Her popularity stems from both the European fascination with all things oriental and her willingness to shed off clothing on stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Winter of 1911, Mata Hari is performing in La Scala Theatre in Milan, Italy. There she captured the eye of a certain Prince Carlo and was invited to do a private rendition of Salome in his manor. Upon her return, she complained of general malaise and was soon too ill to continue performing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mata Hari's booking agent, Gabriel Astruc, alarmed at the possible breach of contract with La Scala and disturbed by the nature of Mata Hari's illness, contacts the hunters to look into the matter. The party soon learns that Prince Carlo is a vampire who has become obsessed with the famous dancer. He is also intrigued by the fact that Mata Hari's social circle includes several highly placed military officers, politicians and industrialists. He has thus decided to convert Mata Hari into a vampire under his control. Though her, he intends to extend his influence throughout Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
