			<description>from the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prostitutes and clowns may not be something you expect to see in one book. That's okay. They were never intended to be complimentary in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Windows and Clown Alley were originally scripted for a Dark Champions organization book known as Shadow Syndicates two years ago. As seems to happen, however, I got Steve Long-it is, and the manuscripts promptly welled beyond the bounds of reason. They sat, distended pustules of kilobytes on my computer, too obese for a published book. There goes more work that will never see the light of day, I thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Hero Plus came along, and viola...here they are on diskette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So now you have these two organization books in your hands: one book with a vice district filled with hookers, and the other book describing a bunch of clown crooks. What do you do with them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever you want, I guess, is the best answer. It's more in line with the grand Hero tradition of customizing your world rather than having it dictated to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take what you want from Widows and Orphans, tailor it to your campaign, and disregard the rest. Hopefully, there's something you can use in these manuscripts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
