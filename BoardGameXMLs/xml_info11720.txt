			<description>The game is for four players. Each player uses a &amp;quot;railway spike&amp;quot; (.4cm diameter x 1.1cm high) of metal with a glass top either in back, blue, white, or orange. During play of the game, these &amp;quot;spikes&amp;quot; (much like map tacks) are placed in the black dots along the railway lines to indicate player progress in the game. Movement in the game is dependent upon chance derived by tossing dice. Dice are placed in a wooden cylindrical dice box. An included bi-lingual instruction booklet explains how the game is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
