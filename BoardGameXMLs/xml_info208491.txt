			<description>Hellboy: Dogs of the Night is a 2000 American video game for the PC, developed by Cryo Studios. It was ported to the PlayStation titled Hellboy: Asylum Seeker (also the title for the PC re-release), developed by Hoplite Research and released in 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hellboy game is based on Dark Horse Comics' science fiction comic book series Hellboy, written and drawn by Mike Mignola.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, the game was a flop. Having spent four years in development, the graphics and game play were quite dated, and at the time of its release, Hellboy was still a mostly unknown independent comic book series, especially outside the United States. Other factors contributed to the game's commercial failure, as well: the PC version had numerous bugs, the PlayStation version was graphically inferior to most others at the time, and the control of both games was considered abysmal at best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both Cryo Studios and Cryo Interactive went out of business shortly after Hellboy's PC release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC version has a score of 11.50% at GameRankings.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy&lt;/a&gt;:_Dogs_of_the_Night,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
