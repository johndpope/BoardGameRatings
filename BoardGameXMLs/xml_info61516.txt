							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Power Team-Ups!</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally created and released as the two separated sourcebooks, Power Assaulting and Power United, but now revised, updated and released for a general OGL &amp;amp; D20 Superhero system, Super Power Team Up is the super team combat sourcebook you need. A team should work together. The statement might seem absurdly obvious, but it is the single most important lesson a group of superheroes (or super villains, for that matter) can learn. Many so-called &amp;ldquo;teams&amp;rdquo; spend years trying to get a grasp on this elusive principle. Others don&amp;rsquo;t last that long and are broken by internal strife, humiliation, defeat, or some combination of the three. Those who do achieve a measure of appreciation for the idea, however, have another difficult task before them: that of actually putting it into practice. Once the members of a team understand that they have to be more than just a group of individuals on the same side, they must learn teamwork. They must maximize their individual strengths, and use them to compensate for the weaknesses of the entire team. They must become a whole more potent than the sum of its parts. In doing so, they can become unstoppable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking to build a super hero or villain team that can work together, then this is the PDF for you. Best of all it is OGL and D20, so you can use it with the world most popular RPG rule set and should be easily compatible with any OGL and D20 Superhero genre based systems on the market today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Team Roles for Player Characters: Airborne, Armor, Artillery, Infantry, Psi-Ops, Special Forces, Specialist, Support and Transport&lt;br/&gt;     Team Composition&lt;br/&gt;     Breakdown of Popular Teams: The Authority, Avengers, Fantastic Four, Justice League of America, Justice Society of America, Teen Titans, X-Factor and X-Men.&lt;br/&gt;     Nearly 30 Combat Maneuvers for Teams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
