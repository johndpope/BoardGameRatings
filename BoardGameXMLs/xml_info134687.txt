			<description>Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX is a video game released in 2000 featuring Dave Mirra and other professional BMX riders. It was developed by Z-Axis Ltd. and published by Acclaim, and was released on the PlayStation, Dreamcast, Game Boy Color and the Windows PC. The player's main objective in the game is to choose one of the riders and work their way through a total of 12 different levels, completing objectives to unlock new equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in the footsteps of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, the player holds the assigned Jump button in preparation of performing a trick, and releases it to jump. When in the air, 'Big Air' tricks can be performed that can also be 'modified' with the aid of the modifier button, or the Big Air button again (modifiers themselves can also be modified). For example, the player jumps from a ramp, and performs a Superman (Big Air trick). The game also features ragdoll physics that are primarily for use in the 'Wipeout' multiplayer game mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a total of four game modes. The first six levels are all 'challenge-based'. The player must complete specific goals in order to advance to the next. The six, and final levels are 'competition-based' levels, where the player is judged on their performance in a number of timed runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
