			<description>Exhaust Heat (エキゾースト・ヒート, &amp;quot;Exhaust Heat&amp;quot;) is a 1992 Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game that simulates the season and career of a Formula One superstar. There are more than a dozen open wheel racing tracks in the world; all of them corresponding to the 1992 Formula One season. Realistic looking advertisements are present where the audience sits complete with near-perfect spelling of sponsors; this mild level of censorship applies because some of the sponsors are tobacco or alcohol-related. The game uses the Super Famicom's Mode 7 to give the track and background perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a limited amount of money to modify their race car before having to qualify and eventually try to win the race. Modifications must be purchased out of the player's pocket like if he were a driver/owner. As with F1 rules at the time, no refueling was possible; pit stops are only used to fix damage on the automobile. Post-race damage penalties will occur if the player finished the race with a damaged vehicle. Even a minor dent can be expensive to a rookie because of the high level of marksmanship by the mechanics. Total damage can and will force the player to retire from the race. In addition to Japan, this game was also released in Europe and North America (in the latter region it was renamed F1 ROC: Race Of Champions). The player can choose to hide his stats (in order to look at the backgrounds) or view his stats in order to find out whether he is winning or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Exhaust Heat,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
