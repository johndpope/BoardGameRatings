			<description>Players try to earn money by selling one the products in the game: ice cream, toys, lemonade or candies. Each player has his/her own product. Products are sold by moving the player's truck to a right kind of spot on the board. Truck is moved by throwing two dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has enough money he/she can buy another truck to improve his/her possibilities in selling products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can decide the length of the game at the beginning by deciding the sum of money player has to collect to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
