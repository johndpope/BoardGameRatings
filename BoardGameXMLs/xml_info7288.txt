							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Numismania</name>
									
			<description>Players move around the board buying coins at auctions, coin shops and flea markets, trading and selling them.  The player with the most money wins the game..  The game can also be played solitaire to see how much money one can make.  An interesting twist in the game is that players use actual, current coin prices for their transactions.  Thus the players need a current coin price book to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
