			<description>Eternium is a mythical card game where you can trade and battle. The aim is to 'dominate' - create the ultimate collection of cards that will let you win every time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You create the dominating card collection by trading and battling. In a battle, both players may 'risk' a 4 or 5 star card and whoever wins keeps both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of Cards: Monster, Combat and Special. You must always play a Monster Card - both Special and Combat cards can be used in addition to the Monster on each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is popular with younger children because there is a vivid story and the monsters are found to be very imaginative and in some cases comparable to people they know in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
