			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mythic Mining, the player selects their miner's race from a host of typical fantasy races: dwarf, wizard (human), orc, or goblin.  Each race has a special power and unique mining statistics.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of a round, four miners (1 player with 3 AI opponents) being their descent into the mines, digging competitively to snatch up gold, jewels, and powerups before the other miners can reach them.&lt;br/&gt;If a miner's pack becomes full, he must return to the surface to sell his loot, whereupon he may use the cash to purchase upgrades that give him an edge or save up to reach the level's winning cash amount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
