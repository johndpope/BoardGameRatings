							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grimtooth&#039;s Museum of Death</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three decades of preparation, the evil troll Grimtooth has finally thrown wide the gates of his abode to all comers. The troll has sent ravens far and wide inviting delvers to share in the vast wealth of his treasure room. Of course, there is a catch. The adventurers must wend their way through a maze of traps in Grimtooth&amp;rsquo;s Museum of Death, a curated collection of the deadliest and most devious traps ever assembled in one place. Along the way, they might even cross paths with a few of Grimtooth&amp;rsquo;s allies: Grimtina, Spike the Grimdog, and Sludgeworth. Tread lightly, delver. There are no refunds for this tour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three decades, the wait is nearly over. In Grimtooth&amp;rsquo;s Museum of Death, you and your players finally get the chance to delve into the evil troll&amp;rsquo;s base of operations first detailed in the pages of Grimtooth&amp;rsquo;s Trap Comics. Deadly traps old and new are waiting to be sprung, from Castle Grimtooth down to the lower treasure levels. You just might see a few familiar faces on your journey, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
