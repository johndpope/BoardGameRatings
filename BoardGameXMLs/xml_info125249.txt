							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UFO</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a truly unknown flying object this flying saucer would raise a number of questions among those that were able to behold it. First and foremost would be the question of &amp;ldquo;How does it fly?&amp;rdquo; as there is no discernible drive. The next question might be &amp;ldquo;Who does it belong to?&amp;rdquo;. A question possibly followed by many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UFO has landed in an out of the way area compromised mostly of hard rocky ground covered only in sparse vegetation. Although it is nighttime spotlights mounted atop the vessels hull and below it are flooding the landing site and its immediate environs with almost unbearable bright light. A platform glowing and pulsating with an orange light has been lowered to the ground surrounded by a ring of landing gears. No more conventional entrance is visible anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one were to enter the UFO using this mysterious teleportation device they would find themselves in a small circular room at the center of the flying saucer. A single door leads to a circular corridor connecting this entrance to the other chambers of the spacecraft. One of them possibly the bridge if the pair of acceleration couches and the screens set into the ceiling are any indication. The two rooms next to it might be crew quarters. And the last rooms might be enigine rooms, containing a total of four generators actually humming and glowing with power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some experimentation might lead an explorer to discover that the teleporter at the center leads not only back down and out of the ship. As a matter of fact it can be set to teleport to the transparent observation bubble atop the hull as well. This observation deck might seem like a weakness at first, but as a matter of fact its material is designed to withstand the perils of stellar travel and orbital reentry as much as the rest of the spacecraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
