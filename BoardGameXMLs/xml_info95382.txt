			<description>Tunnel Runner is a 3D maze game released by CBS Electronics in 1983 for the Atari 2600. It was programmed by Richard K. Balaska Jr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player has a first person view of a maze that the player has to navigate. Several creatures (called Zots) are looking for the player, and the player must avoid them, find the key, and exit to the next level. The player may press the FIRE button to view a map of the current level in overhead form, which shows the location of the player, the zots, the key, and the exits. As the levels progress, the difficulty is increased by placing handicaps on the player, such as making the map invisible, making the zots invisible, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tunnel Runner&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
