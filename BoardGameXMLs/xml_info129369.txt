							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oubliette</name>
									
			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word Oubliette (from the French) means a dungeon with but one escape. The Oubliette is located within Ligne Castle, a city-state in the world of Tokal. The time is neither past nor present. The players are citizens of Ligne who decide to quest for gold and glory in the Oubliette beneath the castle. You control a party of 1 to 6 players in that quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each member of your party is from one of the eight known races--dwarf, elf, gnoll, hobbit, human, kobold, ogre or orc. Your party of adventurers may also choose from a variety of schools and guilds. The possibilities are almost endless. But choose wisely, for once you enter the Oubliette they may be all that stands between death and glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be open ended, providing a challenge for both the novice and the advanced dungeoneer. Gradually you will become proficient enough to laugh at your early encounters, but do not grow too confident for there will always be another level of play to challenge you and your party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oubliette is an open ended fantasy role playing game using both text and graphics to create an epic worthy of the finest dungeoneer. Oubliette offers the following choices:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 1 to six adventurers in your party.&lt;br/&gt;2 8 races to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;3 10 player classes.&lt;br/&gt;4 10 dungeon levels.&lt;br/&gt;5 Over 150 monsters.&lt;br/&gt;6 Over 100 treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
