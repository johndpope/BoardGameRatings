							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cro-Mag Rally</name>
									
			<description>In Cro-Mag Rally you are a speed-hungry caveman named Brog who races through the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages in primitive vehicles such as the Geode Cruiser, Bone Buggy, Logmobile, Trojan Horse, and many others . Brog has at his disposal an arsenal of primitive weaponry ranging from Bone Bombs to Chinese Bottle Rockets and Heat Seeking Homing Pigeons. There are 9 different tracks to race on, and 11 different vehicles to drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cro-Mag Rally is an incredibly diverse and entertaining racing game, and there is nothing else like it for the iPhone / iPod Touch! The game is visually stunning, has incredibly fun driving physics (you steer with the iPhone itself!), and is suitable for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
