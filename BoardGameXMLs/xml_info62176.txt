							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Primal Magic Items</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These items first appeared in 2001 as part of the Primal Codex. They have now been revised and updated for the 3.5 version of the core rules and have been clarified and re-edited for better integration into your game. Primal Magic Items features 20 unique magic items inspired by the legends and folklore of Native Americans, Africans, Australians and Polynesians. These items add a distinctively primitive flavor to your campaign and are perfect for those less civilized people of your world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this supplement, you can sniff the sulfurous hot rock powder that fills men with rage. You can listen to the irresistible beat of the drums of dancing while you don a mask of the ancestors and cavort around a mystical totem pole! You can frolic freely in the firelight with your mummy dolls, certain that the warning statue will keep watch over you. You can cover your body in ritual war paint and slay your enemies with arrows of the sun. You can even wrap yourself in an animal skin and become one with nature! And don?t forget your boomerang of the planes; you might need it to escape this world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These and 10 other primitive magic items fill the pages of this supplement. Add them to your game today for some authentic Stone Age flavor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
