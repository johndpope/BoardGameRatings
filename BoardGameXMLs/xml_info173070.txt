			<description>Linknotize is the first ever board game to integrate the use of online information and tools into more traditional off-line game play. Linknotize asks players to roll two color-coded dice and then pick two, corresponding color-coded topic cards.  The topic cards are chosen from six subject areas: History, The Arts, Sports, Geography, Entertainment, and Science. By using a device like a smartphone, tablet, SmartTV or computer, the player or team must &amp;ldquo;link&amp;rdquo; the two topics by traveling through the embedded links within an online encyclopedia like Wikipedia. The player or team has three minutes and/or a maximum of ten clicks to &amp;ldquo;link&amp;rdquo; the starting card topic to the destination card topic with the object to accomplish it both the fastest and/or with the fewest number of clicks. The first to combine online search and discovery with offline traditional board game features, Linknotize allows players to capitalize on their general knowledge of a wide variety of cultural and historical topics along with their web browsing skills to connect two topics online while racing the clock.&lt;br/&gt; Linknotize forges a path for a completely innovative category of gaming that juxtaposes technology with more conventional play. The result is the perfect party game that is designed to entertain all audiences. Testing knowledge of categories ranging from pop culture to geography to history to sports, the game is as much about quick thinking as it is about strategically analyzing relationships to link seemingly unrelated topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing on the &amp;ldquo;six degrees&amp;rdquo; phenomenon, Linknotize, proves the idea that everyone and everything can be connected. While it may not seem obvious on the surface, our lives are truly a &amp;ldquo;World Wide Web&amp;rdquo; of related concepts, interactions and ideas that lead to common destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
