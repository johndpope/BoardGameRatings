							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mayhem Beneath Demon Mountain</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Are Invited to a Little Mayhem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Master of Demon Mountain is notorious for his strange customs--and his vast wealth and power, concentrated in a fabled keep perched on a mountain overlooking the Rothenian plain. The problem? The wine merchant Korsav&amp;rsquo;s finest bottle of wine was stolen by his bitter rival--the son of the Master of the Demon Mountain. Korsav convinces the PCs to help him embarrass his rival, by spoiling wine that will be served at a dance the Master is throwing for his daughter. He will pay handsomely for their trouble, and tiny bit of discretion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs will have their first brush with danger in the caravan as they approach.... And then the mayhem begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mayhem Beneath Demon Mountain is a fantasy adventure by Chris Lozaga suitable for four 3rd level PCs near any mountain (and especially a lonely mountain on the plains). It includes  a little stealth, roleplaying, and horrific dungeon elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
