			<description>From back of book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TechCommander is a fast paced sci-fi action tactical game that puts you in the command chair of a hi tech operations center leading an elite squad on dangerous missions!  TechCommander combines miniature gaming with the sci-fi action seen in first person shooters and sci-fi real time strategy video games. The game has powerful Mechanized Strike Vehicle units (called MSV&amp;rsquo;s for short) that can destroy targets in seconds, but also has the ultimate in elite power armor infantry units.  These units are based on a possible progression of future soldier programs in development in the modern day, and are  equipped with technology to keep them agile, powerful and somewhat safe from the monster MSV&amp;rsquo;s roaming the landscape. The infantry are jump jet equipped, and in many cases, running a visibility and sensor masking stealth suit. Many also have capacitance based shield meaning if you do not fully eliminate them, they will recharge!  The MSV may be powerful, but left unguarded, it is no match for a crack squad of  USSC Force Recon Marines!  TechCommander MSVs are fairly large miniatures, standing anywhere from four inches to a foot high. They use a peg-together system so that swapping out weapons and gear for a battle that requires a custom load out is easy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
