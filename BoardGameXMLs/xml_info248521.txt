							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast</name>
									
			<description>The town of Sandpoint has been through a lot, between goblin raids and dragon attacks and crazed killers stalking the night. In Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Sandpoint, Light of the Lost Coast, the fan-favorite town is presented in great detail, with full stat blocks for the region's important NPCs, dozens of quests, and expanded information on every major location in the town and the hinterlands beyond, as well as a double-sided pull-out poster map of Sandpoint and the surrounding region, which has featured prominently in Pathfinder Adventure Paths like the Rise of the Runelords and the Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box since the birth of Pathfinder in 2007. This oversized 96-page campaign setting book is a guide to creating your very own campaign in Pathfinder's most popular town!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
