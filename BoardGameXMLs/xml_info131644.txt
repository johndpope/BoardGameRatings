							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ka-pow! The Superhero Team-up Game</name>
									
			<description>Welcome True Believers! Ka-pow is an action-packed card game of super-heroic mayhem. Create a heroic identity, form a superhero team and then battle the worlds super-villains and save the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes on the role of a superhero, fighting for truth and justice as part of a superhero team made up of the other player&amp;rsquo;s superheroes. Your team must foil the diabolical plots of a series of nefarious super-villains and in doing so the superheroes will receive victory points based on their contribution towards defeating each super-villain. At the end of the game the superhero with the most victory points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you will see, the superheroes must work together to defeat each super-villain, otherwise the villain will win and all of the players will lose! However, once all of the super-villains are defeated, only one of the superheroes can win the game.  Collecting victory points calls for playing the right card at the right time, so you will need to think very carefully about which cards to use each round and how to use your superpowers in order to score as many points as possible. On the other hand, being too selfish in the use of your cards and superpowers may result in a super-villain being able to carry out their diabolical plot, and if that happens everyone will lose the game. It&amp;rsquo;s a dreadful dilemma make no mistake &amp;ndash; but then nobody said being a superhero was going to be easy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete over 3-5 story arcs to be the most heroic Superhero and earn the adulation of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
