			<description>Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Folding Game Board, Playing pieces, Playing cards, Dice, Full Instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You're inside the iron curtain. The Cold War is on. You must eliminate your own 'super villain', acquire by various means secret documents on microfilm and get out alive. As a secret agent, licensed to kill, you are prepared to do anything to win. Watch out for the double agents secretly working against you. Copious amounts of drinking and eating to be had!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brief Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beverage of choice can be adjusted to the crowd playing (and doesn't necessarily have to be vodka), so this makes for a decent party game among any crowd of reasonable adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
