							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Holidays, Volume 4</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The real world that we live in is full of holidays, special dates, and occasions for celebration. While it may seem rather easy to incorporate such holidays into the fantasy campaign world, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it make more sense to allow such a unique realm a few holidays of its own? This edition of Fantasy Holidays continues with Top Fashion Games&amp;rsquo; tradition of providing new, unique holidays for use in most high fantasy campaign worlds. While many of the holidays provided are for the interest of human settlements, there are quite few presented that are usable for demi-human or monstrous societies. Well over a dozen holidays are provided, giving the adventurer, villager, and monstrous encounter alike a reason to celebrate from time to time. Also included is an explanation to the holiday formats, which helps for easy conversion to the paper and dice fantasy role playing game of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
