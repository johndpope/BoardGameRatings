The Stake Your Destiny series returns Buffy Summers and the Scoobies to the glory days of high school. But this time you control the action and accept the full responsibility of being the Slayer. Interactive story lines advance by the choices you make, leading toward more than a dozen possible endings. Do you have what it takes to be the Slayer, or will you fail and summon a successor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banished to the realm of dreams, the Night Terror stalks its victims as they sleep. By replacing another's soul with its own, the demon can assume anyone's physical body and wreak havoc in the real world. But the effect is short-lived. Human bodies soon break down under the tremendous stress of the transfer, and the Night Terror is forced to find a new body to inhabit. That is, until it discovers Buffy's secret and imagines the Slayer would make an ideal -- and permanent -- host....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
