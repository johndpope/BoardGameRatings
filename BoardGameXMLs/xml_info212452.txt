							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Blackguard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dark reflection of the paladin isn't hindered by meaningless virtues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cruel and terrifying, you are more than capable of slaughtering those foolish enough to stand before you (such as virtuous souls, not that they could hide from your gaze anyway).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sinister power of a blackguard comes easily; not only can it can be wielded in a variety of ways, but unlike those of your self-righteous counterparts can be used without restriction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains three files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is a letter-sized character sheet that uses our new character sheet layout (so we could fit the thirty advanced moves on the back).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two are digest-sized PDFs, one in color, the other in black and white to make it easier to print at home. They both contain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The blackguard class (which includes 30 advanced moves).&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons, armor (including armor for animals), and dungeon gear.&lt;br/&gt;    The dread knight compendium class.&lt;br/&gt;    14 additional moves that we couldn't fit on the sheet/people didn't find as interesting as the rest (but you can use them if you want).&lt;br/&gt;    A Director's Cut with questions to ask yourself when rolling up a blackguard, and explanations/clarifications for some of the moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
