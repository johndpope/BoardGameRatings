							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Max f√§hrt Bus, Bahn und Schiff</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lighthouse lamp is broken, and Benny the lighthouse keeper is sick. Max to the rescue! The player helps Max to travel by bus, train and boat to the small town &amp;quot;Hintermberg&amp;quot;, the train station,  and the harbour to buy a new light bulb for the lighthouse, as well as fruit, flowers and a newspaper for Benny, while also collecting 6 figurines for a new board game that Max's uncle has developed. Once the player has collected all things on Max's list, Max needs to travel to the lighthouse to deliver everything to Benny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has lots of small animations and a few songs and games to keep the player busy on his/her travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
