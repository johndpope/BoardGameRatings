			<description>A DLC expansion to F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin was announced by Monolith on July 29, 2009. The story involves four new levels and follows a Replica by the name of Foxtrot 813 to find Paxton Fettel and free his spirit from the psychic amplifier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In it, the player assumes the role of a Replica soldier who is guided by Paxton Fettel, the antagonist of the first game, to turn on his fellow Replica and try to reach the epicentre of the nuclear blast triggered by the Point Man's failed attempt to contain Alma. It is evident that Alma does not want the rogue Replica soldier to reach his and Paxton's goal, and she proceeds to try to defeat the player with Replica still under her control, and the strange ghost-like beings she has implemented in previous instalments of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the player reaches the original blast site, and proceeds deep under the rubble, Paxton makes reference to other soldiers that will be his, and the player's army. They can be seen as ghosts, but unlike those used by Alma or encountered in any of the other F.E.A.R. games. If the player uses the slo-mo ability, they become visible as Replica soldiers not unlike the player's character. They are marching ceaselessly towards a large, red, beam that appears to be the player's destination. After fighting a few more of Alma's ghosts, the player opens a door to find Paxton Fettel, kneeling in the middle of the room. This is clearly a juxtaposition to the opening cinematic of F.E.A.R. where Alma enters Fettel's room through a similar door. Fettel welcomes the player as &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot; and reaches out in a similar fashion. As he touches the player, Fettel melts away. After he disappears completely, the Replica soldier removes his helmet to reveal Paxton Fettel's face, as Fettel's voice narrates that he has been reborn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, FEAR 2#F.E.A.R. 2: Reborn , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
