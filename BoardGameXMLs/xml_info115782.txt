							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Admiral Graf Spee</name>
									
			<description>Box back&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game based on historically accurate records of the Graf Spee's killer expedition in the North and South Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An intermittent flashing pixel on your chart denotes the presence of an enemy ship in the Atlantic. The year is 1939. As Captain of the Admiral Graf Spee your task is to sink all enemy shipping in these waters using your six 11&amp;quot;guns and torpedoes. Search the area, locate the ship and using your instrumental display, which includes variable speed, compass headings, fuel, target distance, compass bearings, ammunition and torpedo state, manoeuvre into visual range ready for the kill. But the enemy can take evasive action - refuelling makes your position vulnerable and British cruisers and battleships are seeking to destroy you. To make your search and pursuit a constant challenge the enemy ships are relocated whilst you take on fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 levels of difficulty from EASY to PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially the display shows a map of the South Atlantic for you to locate targets. Once a target is located then by pressing &amp;quot;S=Search&amp;quot; the display will show the local area and the target vessel when in visual range. When you are within firing range the display will show the target being destroyed if successfully hit, and conversely your own damage state when the target returns fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attacked targets can only be destroyed by approximately the same number of salvos or torpedoes as were necessary for the tonnage during the original action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
