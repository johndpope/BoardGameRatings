							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel</name>
									
			<description>The Player, as Sherlock Holmes, is engaged by Scotland Yard to help with the murder investigation of a young actress. While the manner of her death suggests this is another strike by Jack the Ripper, Holmes believes someone else had committed the crime. The investigation takes Holmes and Watson to many parts of late 19th Century London, including a perfume shop, the zoological gardens, the morgue, a pub, several dwellings, an abandoned dock and of course 221B Baker Street.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graphics are VGA, with MIDI music and a few scenes with digitalized speech (in the other scenes there are sound effects, but no speech). The player interacts with the characters through a command menu that is intuitive for anyone who had played other adventure games of the period. A manual exists but is not necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
