			<description>A trivia game in which the indicated youngest age for play is &amp;quot;5th year of medical school&amp;quot;. The goal of the game is to answer 5 questions in 4 topic areas, mirroring the exams one takes to become a licensed medical doctor. The game is considered good enough to prepare students for their first official exam. Others may not enjoy the game all that much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May be played in partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include large gameboard, sand timer, 6 large pawns, 1 large die, rules, 580 multiple choice question cards, color double-sized cards with posters of the exams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
