			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Testament is a description of the last days of Earth. The game begins with the world ending. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t end in a day but rather over a period of time. Devils and angels walk the Earth picking out the last of the virtuous and the damned and helping or hindering where they can. People will not see winged beings plucking people from the street but they will notice people going missing and the world being seemingly populated by strangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Players commonly take the roles of normal people who are still on Earth during this tumultuous period. The actions of the player characters will decide whether or not they are to be saved or damned and they may also perform a role in the judgement of those they meet. Common themes within the game are isolation, alienation, self-gratification, exploitation, retribution, redemption and damnation. These can be explored within the confines of the game using fictional characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from &amp;quot;Signs &amp;amp; Portents&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;The world of Testament is different to our own. It is darker. The shadows seem deeper and the stars only dully gleam in the firmament. The sun still hangs high in the sky but even at noon it glares like a great yellow eye and few could ever say that it has been &amp;ldquo;too bright&amp;rdquo;. Pollution has taken a great toll on the environment. The air has a coppery taste and a biting chill accompanies the wind. Clouds roll overhead and often bring a dirt-laden acrid rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
