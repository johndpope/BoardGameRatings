			<description>Build an army, Raise a tower, cast spells, equip yourself and manage your resources. What could be a 400+ game but it is compressed in a 80 card game since every card in the game may act for 5 types, its up to the player to make the choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to acheive victory with 15 victory points or be the one with most points when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays with players having a certain amount a &amp;quot;plays&amp;quot; each turn. a player may either play a card from his hand as a resource,an equipement,a spell,a unit in a formation,or has a stone to build a tower on a captured land. once a player has a formation of 3 cards he may capture a land card and gain its bonus. Once a player has a land he may place stones to increase the lands bonus and gain Victory Points. A player may capture a land by having a better formation (poker style a little).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
