Lovecraft, &amp;ldquo;The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sinking City is a game of investigation genre taking place in a fictional open world inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft.&lt;br/&gt;The player incarnates a private investigator in 1920s, who finds himself in a city of New England, Oakmont Massachusetts. It&amp;rsquo;s currently suffering from extensive waterflood, and its cause is clearly supernatural. The city trembles on the brink of madness.&lt;br/&gt;Can you investigate this beleaguered town and untangle the tragic extent of its failings or will you be driven beyond madness yourself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
