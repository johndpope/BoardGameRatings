			<description>A game of plots and schemes, as simple as checkers, as strategic as chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advance, retreat, feint, engage and capture in an effort to be the sole survivor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot area on the board is a safety zone and a vantage point, adds an extra element of suspense and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to capture all enemy pieces, and still have one or more of your own pieces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces move based on the roll of the dice. As long as a player has one or more pieces remaining in the Starting Area, each piece is limited to either a horizontal or vertical move in one direction. Once all pieces are out of the Starting Area, a player is also allowed diagonal moves, and can now capture opponents playing pieces. Jumping is not allowed and only 1 pieces may occupy any space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces are captured by landing on its square at the end of an opponents move. Two pieces may be captured, if a move is split between two pieces. Once down to one piece, you may capture two opponents pieces, by exact count of each of the two dice, either in a straight line, or by changing directions with the second die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game includes two special 6 sided dice. Sides have printed numbers 1-5 and a side with a &amp;quot;P.&amp;quot; If one &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; is rolled, you may move one of your own (or an opponents) piece the number rolled. You can even move the opponent back to his Starting Area. If you roll two &amp;quot;P's&amp;quot;, you can move one of your pieces directly to the Plot Area, even if coming from the Starting Area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Plot Area is a safety zone in the center of the grid. Each player has a square of his color. Besides rolling two &amp;quot;P's&amp;quot;, you may enter this area through your assigned color, and can only come to rest on your own assigned color. A player rolling one &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; may move your piece out of the Plot Area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
