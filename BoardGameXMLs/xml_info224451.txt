			<description>This fun money game combines the popular game mechanics of crazy 8&amp;rsquo;s (a classic card game children know and LOVE) with financial issues we all must face in life such as debt, asset accumulation, and managing the risks of financial peril. Playing the game creates an opportunity for you to teach, discuss, and reinforce positive financial concepts with younger players which will help them become financially successful in their adult life. (After all, there is more to life than longing for your next payday to take care of never ending bills and expenses.) Winning the game requires players to: think strategically, learn to minimize debt, accumulate assets (money), and protect themselves against financial hardships. The player with the highest net worth at the end of the game wins! Net Worth, the FUN money game is a fantastic financial education game for kids because they will have so much FUN playing they won&amp;rsquo;t even realize they are learning! EASY to learn and FUN to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
