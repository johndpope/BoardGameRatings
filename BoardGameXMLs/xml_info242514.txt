			<description>Starseer is a short, quiet, co-operative card game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conduct the ritual, listen to the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play requires 2 players but can accommodate more.  The game does not specify age ranges or play times, but the process is fairly abstract (not for very young children).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place over three turns.  During each turn, one player assumes the role of &amp;quot;Eye&amp;quot; and all other players assume the role of &amp;quot;Hand(s)&amp;quot;.  The &amp;quot;Eye&amp;quot; draws a &amp;quot;Constellation&amp;quot; card which becomes the object of the cooperative game; the &amp;quot;Constellation&amp;quot; is not shown to the &amp;quot;Hand(s)&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using various hand gestures and playing various &amp;quot;Star&amp;quot; cards, the &amp;quot;Eye&amp;quot; attempts to guide the &amp;quot;Hand(s)&amp;quot; into correctly guessing which &amp;quot;Constellation&amp;quot; card is in play.  The game does not allow verbal or written communication.  Play is entirely cooperative, if abstract, and proceeds until the &amp;quot;Hand(s)&amp;quot; correctly guess the &amp;quot;Constellation&amp;quot;, whereupon play passes to the next player who assumes the role of &amp;quot;Eye&amp;quot;.  All players win the game after three &amp;quot;Constellations&amp;quot; have been successfully resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
