							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brit Quiz II</name>
									
			<description>The second in a series of quiz games that require, as the name suggests, knowledge of British trivia...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is as for the first edition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to roll a die and move that number of spaces round the board. The player then tries to answer a question determined by both the colour of the space he or she lands on, and the actual number rolled on the die. If the question is answered correctly the player moves forwards an additional three spaces as a reward. There is no penalty for getting the answer wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Up The Creek' is a special category that asks the player to perform an activity rather than answer a question. If the player fails to carry out the activity to the satisfaction of the other players, or refuses to even try, he or she has to move backwards three spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to complete a circuit of the track around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question categories are slightly changed from the first edition, and the questions are new:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orange - History &amp;amp; This And That&lt;br/&gt;Yellow - People&lt;br/&gt;White - Places&lt;br/&gt;Green - Showbiz&lt;br/&gt;Blue - Animals &amp;amp; Plants&lt;br/&gt;Red - Sport&lt;br/&gt;Brown - Up The Creek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
