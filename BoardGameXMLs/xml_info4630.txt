			<description>Fire on the Suns: Tactical Command 2nd (TCOM2) is a tactical starship combat and war game construction kit.  The product is a CD-ROM and the game can either be printed out for head-to-head play or it can be played via hot-seat/play-by-email with software such as V_MAP (Windows version included for free.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TCOM2 has been retired.  The author, Todd Zircher, is currently developing a third edition of the Tactical Command series that will focus on a harder sci-fi setting with additions to the game mechanics such as vector movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
