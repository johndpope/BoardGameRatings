			<description>A exciting encircle game for 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to encircle the opponent in 21 turns so that he is unable to move. The five blue pawns are set up at the simple rimmed fields of the plan, the green pawn on the opposite double-edged field. This field markings apply only to the starting positions. The player  with the green pawn starts and counts his turns. He may move forward, backward, go sideways and diagonally, while his opposite player, the driver, with his five pawns may move forward, backward and sideways, but can not move diagonally. Turns are take alternately, moving always only one pawn. Skipping over another pawn is not allowed. The driver must now try to encircle his opponent so that he can not move anymore. If he can do that in at last 21 turns, he's the winner. Otherwise, the other player has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trivia:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Zingeln&amp;quot; is a non-existent short form of &amp;quot;umzingeln&amp;quot;, meaning encircling in german.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
