			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game essentially is a virtual &amp;quot;word search&amp;quot; game just like you would find in a newspaper or magazine. You find words by selecting the first and last letter of the word once they are located on the board. This game updates the formula by having the boards in traditional 2D, but also 3D boards that are on all sides of a cube that can be rotated. The game also adopts an ancient civilization theme for the backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three single-player modes: Arcade Mode (find the listed words among the letters quickly to build up a combo score), Survival Mode (travel through 8 ancient worlds and find the listed words, but also defuse bombs before they explode and release detrimental effects), and Free Play (allows the player to select the level and settings as they prefer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-player can be played with 2 players locally, or up to 4 on-line. The object of multi-player is to find words while also sending &amp;quot;prop cards&amp;quot; to your opponents screen to interfere with their searches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
