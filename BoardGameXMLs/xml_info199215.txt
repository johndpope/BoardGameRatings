			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now Amsoft brings the thrills and spills of the race course into your home on the Amstrad CPC464.&lt;br/&gt;Classic Racing is a game for 0-6 players of strategy and planning. Each player is the owner of a stable of 16 horses (the computer managing the remainder of the stables when there are less than 6 players), the aim of the game being to accumulate the most money at the end of the season. As the season progresses, you must try to discover the strengths and weaknesses of your horses, trying to find the right ones to run in the eight 'Classics' at the end of the season. A season is made up of 4-16 meetings, each of which consists of 6 races. Each owner must enter a horse in each race, receiving prize money if you end in the first 3 to the line as well as any money you make on the betting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Paul Neal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
