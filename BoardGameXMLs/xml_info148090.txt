							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Street Level</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Street Level is a 48 x 30 inch, full color floorplan of a SciFi Road Junction, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card version contains eighteen, double-sided card tiles. Each over-sized tile is 8&amp;rdquo;x10&amp;rdquo; and printed on sturdy 12 point card stock. The UV coating on the tiles keeps them spill resistant, lets you peel transparent tape on and off them without damaging the tile, and allows you to mark the tiles with dry wipe markers then wipe them clean. As you can see in the images below, the card version has the square grid overlay on one side and the hex grid overlay on the other side. We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out. The full layout map is not included with the printed card pages to reduce their cost to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The street level module includes a futuristic science fiction street on a city block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module can be used in various ways. The first thing to decide is whether the streets still use cars on the ground or perhaps are using flying cars. For ground cars, the traffic from the north flows one way south able to only make right turns to merge with westbound traffic on the main road and traffic from the south flows only north and able to only make right turns and merge with eastbound traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With flying cars, traffic changes considerably by adding height to the equation. This makes chase scenes rather interesting, since now traffic signs are likely not red, yellow, green, but instead could have up arrows, green, down arrows to signal a change in height of a story, continue forward at normal elevation, or go down a height of a story. The Player Characters could be involved in a bizarre chase with flying cars as traffic patterns change and cars may be flying at them in their current lane if they don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to the elevation shift signals whether they are chasing someone or being chased. The chase could even involve the subway station with the flying car entering the subway trying to escape the Player Characters or the Player Characters diving into the subway to avoid pursuit, adding the additional dangers of a massive station, subway tunnels, supersonic subway cars, and people to an already hectic chase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chase can also be centered on the tram line, with the Player Characters trying to intercept the tram or prevent others from intercepting the tram, adding another element to the chase scene. This works well for either ground cars or flying cars as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
