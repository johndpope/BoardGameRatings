							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battles with Brusilov</name>
									
			<description>Battles with Brusilov is a miniatures rules set designed to allow grand tactical simulation of the mobile phases of World War I.  As such, it is sell-suited for all phases and all fronts except the trench warfare phases of the Western and Italian fronts.  The fundamental maneuver unit is the battalion, individual stands represent companies, and the game is designed to support division and corps level gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include mechanics appropriate for that level of simulation including intelligence, engineering, logistics, night attacks, and morale and cohesion.  They also include elements that would be appropriate for running campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics appear to be loosely similar to the Fire and Fury gaming system.  The game comes with detailed order of battle information for all the major armies and also includes information on combatants such as Bulgaria, Serbia and the Arab Revolt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles with Brusilov is published as a binder-bound set of loose leaf sheets.  It is available from Miniature Figurines, USA as well as from several miniature wargame supply distributors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
