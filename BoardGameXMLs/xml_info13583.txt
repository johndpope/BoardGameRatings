							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirty Words the card game</name>
									
			<description>Object: to be the first person to run out of cards while making the funniest, grammatically correct sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturally, the words on the cards are sexually suggestive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 3 decks are shuffled together. The highest card drawn acts as dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven cards are dealt to each player. The remainder make up the draw pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with the dealer, each player lays down a card. Each player must add a word to the sentence. All tenses must be assumed i.e. kiss can be kissed, kisses or kiss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot use any words from their hand they must draw until they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sentence is deemed ended when it stands as a complete sentence and the next player cannot add another word to it. The player ending the sentence starts the next sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who uses their last &amp;quot;dirty word&amp;quot; and runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play several rounds as the game goes quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
