							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Smash Hits Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Could you become the richest, swankiest, most successful pop star in the world? Release records! Have hits! make pots of cash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First you have to get a music record out and battle your way to the top of the hit parade against the other players. But keep your wits about you, because you'll have to use your skill and judgement to determine when to cash in on your chart success before you tumble down pop's dastardly dumper!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board collecting pieces to create their records. There are four pieces to every record A,B,C and D. A and B make the song name and C and D make up the first line of the single. You have to then make up, oh and also, sing the next line for your single to make it into the charts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst moving around the board you can steal, pass and lose un-used pieces of the record. But once it's created and in the charts you start to move up the charts and cash in on the popularity. Game play moves clockwise around the board and spaces and action/question cards indicate what the players must do to move play along. create the most successful records and collect money at the right time (preferably before the records slumps) to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
