			<description>Absolutism is a party card game that presents players with unfathomable scenarios of daily life in a totalitarian society to which they have to offer solutions. But as no sane solutions can save you in a real dictatorship, in Absolutism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers a funny satirical take on dictatorship from a team of three who spent their childhood and adolescence in&amp;hellip; communism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We strongly believe that humor is healing. Some people who lived in Dictatorships still have a good amount of healing left to do. And some other people who just now make contact with some sort of pre-dictatorship reality will definitely need this humorous approach to survive and overcome it. We hope to provide some of that humor to them with the ABSOLUTISM game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a unique blend of descriptive language and political themes, Absolutism gives a deep understanding of a totalitarian way-of-life while having crazy fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
