							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thomas &amp; Friends Tipsy Topsy Turvy Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a dexterity game based on the classic Thomas Tank Engine cartoon. The board is a 3-D railroad track display with a Thomas engine and a freight car. Players take turns drawing freight tiles. Each child must place the matching item (barrel, logs, etc.) or place an item of the matching color. The stack grows more unstable as the game continues. Other cards require a child to rotate the track, and this can cause the pile to tumble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items that fall off of the pile are returned to play. When the last tile in the deck has been flipped over the game ends. The player who successfully placed the most items is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
