			<description>Colovero is an easy trick-takting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;rules from the publishers homepage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to the left of the dealer is the first to play a card. In clockwise order, all the other players also play a card. Once all players have played their card, the orange and green cards are scored separately. The color with the higher score wins the trick. If the colors tie, the color with the highest individual card wins. If that is also a tie, the color with the highest card played last wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a joker is part of the trick, it wins the trick for its color, no matter what the score is. If both jokers are played, the joker played last wins. The trick goes to the player who played the winning card. The player who won the trick places the trick in front of himself with the winning card face up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, when all players have played their nine cards, the color that won the most tricks in that round is the winning color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players receive one point for each trick of the winning color and lose one point for each trick of the losing color.  This total score is the result of this round. The results of the rounds are added up as you keep playing. It is up to the players to decide how many rounds they would like to play. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
