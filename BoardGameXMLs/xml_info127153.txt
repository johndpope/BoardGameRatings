							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Project 83113</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project 83113 is a side-scrolling run-and-gun platformer. The player controls Belle (or &amp;quot;83113&amp;quot;), a cute, four-armed pink lizard creature who can target multiple enemies at once as she dashes, double-jumps, skids, and dives through each level. Belle is the last hope for organic life, which has been enslaved by machines. She has evolved (or perhaps was created?) specifically for fast and furious combat. The game features 30 levels and five weapons, each of which can be upgraded three times. For each level, players earn a star rating from one to three based on their score, and can also earn medals for destroying all enemies or finding hidden items. These items include energy tanks, upgrade capsules, and story fragments that can be viewed from the menu. Project 83113 is controlled entirely by touch (swipes), rather than more common virtual buttons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
