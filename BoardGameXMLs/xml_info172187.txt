							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goldmarsh Village</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a complete village (Goldmarsh) for the party to explore and interact with. The village is completely system-free and can provide many adventures just from the descriptions therein. The village has 23 locations and 50 individuals. There are 13 adventure ideas along with rumors. This village can serve as a central location for a campaign or as an interesting place for your player characters to pass through. It also is excellent if you need a quick village on the fly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note, if you have already bought our other product, Adventure at Goldmarsh, you already have this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
