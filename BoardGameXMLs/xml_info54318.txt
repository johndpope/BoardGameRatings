							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Cinema</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knew when it started, or why. Perhaps the lonely death of a spinster was one too much for angels to bear, or a chemical leak in the ground-water had unexpected consequences. Only one thing is certain: now the dead walk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This story game is about the zombie apocalypse and the desperate choices of the survivors. Not only do these characters scramble over each other trying to find safety, but they may also cooperate and even sacrifice themselves so at least a few might survive the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Cinema is quick to set up, easy to learn and it&amp;rsquo;s designed to play from start to finish in one evening, making for an excellent party game or a first step into a new hobby. The game box includes everything required to create stories of survival horror with your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
