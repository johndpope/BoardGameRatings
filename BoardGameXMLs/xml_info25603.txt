			<description>This special C3i Magazine (RBM) publication contains Simple GBoH versions of every GBoH battle that has been included in the back issues of C3i Magazine from issue No. 1 through 14, and also the &amp;quot;C3i - SPQR Player's Guide&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifty five GBoH battles are featured in this new publication. These scenarios run the gamut from the early hoplite battles from the Persian Wars (Marathon, Plataea) through the Roman disaster at Teutoburg Forest during the reign of Augustus Caesar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The C3i &amp;quot;SimpleGBoH Battle Manual&amp;quot; consists of a playbook in the same style as the original SBGoH packet, plus a sheet of 259 counters to include the additional leaders needed to play the C3i scenarios, along with the few markers that are unique to the Simple GBoH system. Also included is a completely updated rule book/charts folio incorporating the latest errata and clarifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the rules are self-contained, one must have copies of the appropriate Great Battles of History game and/or module as well as the C3i article (the articles for the out of print back issues of C3i Magazine are available free, as PDF files, at the GMT Games website). And note that the original SGBoH packet is still available, providing conversions for the previously published GBoH games and modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Simple Great Battles of History Rules&lt;br/&gt;- Simple Great Battles of History Charts&lt;br/&gt;- Simple Great Battles of History Battle Manual containing SGBOH scenarios for C3i GBOH scenarios&lt;br/&gt;- Counter Sheet with additional units associated with C3i SGBOH scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: this item does not include the SGBOH scenarios for Alexander, SPQR, Julius Caesar, Conquest of Gaul and Cataphract. The Simple Great Battles of History Playbook contains those.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
