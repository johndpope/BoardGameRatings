							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Germania</name>
									
			<description>Germania broadly represents the situation in western Europe following the fall of the Roman Empire.  Each of two to five players represents one of the Germanic invaders who, pushed by the Asiatic Huns, settled in and eventually destroyed Rome.  As they attempt to consolidate and expand their holdings, a variety of invading nations threaten to overwhelm them, as they overwhelmed Rome. The game combines &amp;ldquo;Euro&amp;rdquo; elements with a light historical wargame.  The game uses no dice; players use cards to influence combat, and also use event cards to control non-Germanic invaders and influence other players.  Scoring occurs each century, with the last century counting much more than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some ways this is a game of survival, of maintaining a civilization.  It is possible to win without directly attacking other players, though successful players usually directly attack another player at some point in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns executing a variety of Actions up to a limit of six Action Points.  Some of the Actions are creating new settlers, moving pieces, and playing Event Cards.  Three or (in Standard and Advanced games) four rounds of turns are a century.  Invasions occur at the end of each Century, or they may occur because of an Event Card played by a player.  One player or another temporarily controls Invaders as they invade.  Players attempt to increase the number of settled areas, improve those areas, and, in Standard and Advanced games, build cities.  They will probably fight Invaders, and may fight one another, using Battle Cards to help resolve these fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
