			<description>Police themed game with a cool looking game board and metal cars.  A spinner and some cards create different movement options. The game has 6 cars. The bank robbers have 3 getaway cars the police have 3 Squad Cars plus the police have 3 roadblocks that can be used to block 3 street exits or avenues leading off of the board. The movement of cars is regulated by a spinner and also by radio flashcards sent from Police Headwuarters to the Squad Cars. The spinner regulates movement. Spin the dila and if the arrow is yellow then spin again until the spinner points either red or green where the cop either stops or moves the indicated number of squares. If all getaway cars are captured by the Squad Cars the police have won. If just one getaway car escapes then the bank robbers have won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
