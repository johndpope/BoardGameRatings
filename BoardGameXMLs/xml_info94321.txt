			<description>From the title page:&lt;br/&gt;A competitive, in your face, testosterone fueled role playing experience in a brutal, over the top, desolate world of savagery and dark sorcery. Are you metal enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in a world called Abalahn, a dark fantasy setting dominated by the evil Witch Kings, where mankind slaughtered the gods and all sorcery draws upon the power of the soul (typically someone else's). Although some &amp;ldquo;canonical&amp;rdquo; elements of the setting are described in the appendix to the rules or are specified in the random generation of an Ordeal, it is the players' free choice to write Components they want to use in the setting and to describe them. The limits of this are given by the other players, who can Rise Up and Challenge the description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice are used as both currency and random number generator. The Chronicler (temporary game master) can inflict Pain (devasting traits, requiring oaths and such) on other players' components, and offer them dice as compensation. If the other player is unwilling to accept the Pain, he must either offer dice against it, or the conflict is resolved by a Clash, in which all applicable dice are rolled against each other and then pushed forward against each other according to the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Different Aspects of the dice corresponding to special rules and the limited possibilities to reroll dice during Clash make tactical play possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 3.1 is published as a beta, prose text version on Ramshead Publishing's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
