							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darker Days Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character's have six Attributes, rated 1-5:  Strength, Dexterity, Perception, Intelligence, Technical, and Operation.  Attributes are purchased from an initial pool.  Each Attribute supports a set of specific Skills.  Skill Levels start at the base Attribute rating and increase from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skill use is resolved by rolling 2d6 and adding the appropriate Skill level.  A basic success target of 12 is used, though this may be modified by the difficulty of the action.  Combat uses the same Skill resolution system, with the success target raised by the opponent's dodge skill.  Damage varies by weapon but in any case is reduced by the opponent's body resistance Skill and any armor.  Sustained damage may be either stun damage or hit damage (mental and physical, respectively).  Taking full stun value causes a character to fall unconscious; taking full hit value causes a character to collapse and start bleeding to death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for computers, vehicles, experience, and psionics (omnipresent) also are offered.  The rules in a slightly shortened version also are offered in DOC (MS Word '97) format, comprising four files--&amp;quot;Shortened Rules&amp;quot; (10 pages), &amp;quot;Skills&amp;quot; (3 pages), &amp;quot;Contacts&amp;quot; (1 page), and &amp;quot;Character Sheet&amp;quot; (2 pages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
