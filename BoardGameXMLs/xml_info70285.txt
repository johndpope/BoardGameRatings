							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Zagyg: The Free Town of Yggsburgh â€“ Moat Gate</name>
									
			<description>[From back cover]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moat Gate District of the Free Town of Yggsburgh is the. Daily there is a flow of traffic into and out of the Moatgate, that gate that connects the Outs with Yggsburgh proper. Through this gate flow workers, businessmen, ladies, and city leaders, all going about their daily tasks. With them come foreigners, thieves, uncounted underclass, spies, and adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas around the Moatgate reflect this varied traffic. Near the gate are businesses that cater to foreigners and denizens of The Outs, while cheap housing abounds to hold the workers that keep the city and The Outs productive. The Fane and Convent of the Three Norns lies in the Southeast corner of the city, and the neighborhood around it is upper class with businesses around the Moatgate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here your brave adventurers will meet the underclass and find outfitting for basic adventuring. They can dine with a retired Knight of the Citadel or take their repast in a bawdy bar. Whatever type of adventure your characters wish to undertake, whatever type of citizen they hope to encounter, they will find it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
