			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her Name is Lillith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lillith X-01, to be more precise. She's an experiment in sex and horror - a psychological weapon of mass destruction, designed to turn a city inside-out with a fear that they dare not speak about aloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When people start turning up dead, their every drop of blood drained out, and having apparently died in the act of having the most pleasure they have ever experienced, no one wants to say what everyone is thinking. &amp;quot;Vampire.&amp;quot; People start stocking up on garlic and crosses, though, and making sure to not invite anyone they don't know in to their homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lillith finds it all amusing, and plays the part of the mysterious Vampire perfectly; just waiting for the moment someone discovers that you can't kill a super-tough combat-hardened robot by driving a stake through it's heart...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Adventure is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game. It contains details about the creation and operation of Lillith X-01, and what she is doing to the poor city that she has elected to inhabit.  Also included is an extensive gallery of images for use as game reference, and because we really like making picture of Lillith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your Hot Chicks campaign to a dark place in beauty and style!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
