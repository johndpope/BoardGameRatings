			<description>Fish and Chips.  Cookies and Cream.  Beer and Pretzels.  Some things were meant to go together.  Among these natural pairs, we find...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Chicks and Guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are one hundred and thirty guns.  Some are familiar from the core book of &amp;quot;Hot Chicks: The RPG&amp;quot;, more than half are brand new.  These guns, and the rules in this book, supplement the existing firearms rules in Hot Chicks, adding more calibers, more modifications, more ammunition types, and more guns, guns, guns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use these guns as you find them, or modify each and every aspect of every gun with the existing modification rules in Hot Chicks to make every gun you could possibly want or need, and a few that you probably wish never existed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And because good guns lead to great times, we&amp;rsquo;ve also included a bucket of Adventure Seeds to get your guns into the Hot Chicks games at high speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a game with enough guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
