			<description>Ransom Trump is Decktet trick-taking game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before start of each hand, the players try to buy the trump suit by choosing one card and putting it face down on the table. Next the cards are revealed and the suit of the highest valued card is a trump for that hand. If several cards tie, then the suit of the second highest card is chosen as a trump. If the tie cannot be broken, the hand is played without a trump suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who won the trump leads and each player plays a card, matching the suit with the card, that was led. The highest trump wins the trick and if there are no trumps, the highest card that follows the suit wins it. The winner of the trick leads the next trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to collect as many tricks as possible. The single hand takes no more than several minutes and the length of the whole game depends on the game end condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete rules can be found here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
