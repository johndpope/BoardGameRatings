			<description>Game idea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drinking Viking - brand new party game born on parties and made for parties. The game consists of various short, simple and funny mini-games, where each is more fun than the last. The game encourages players to interact in many different ways. You will master the rules very quickly and the game will never feel the same, because it gives you endless possibilities to experience something new. You will see your friends in comic situations and laught at things you are able to do trying to escape punishment. While playing Drinking Viking you will learn that the art is not to win but to manage not to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in the box?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drinking Viking party game contains 19 types of cards with unique illustrations shuffled in set of 42 cards, rulebook, 3 wooden dice and original cotton pouch.  To play, all you need are your friends, a viking heart and gaming spirit. It is that simple. The game can be played virtually anywhere. No board, no figures, no long setup. YOU are the figures and YOU are the board!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card represents one mini game with unique rules. Players draw cards one by one to know what kind of game they are going to play and what challenge lies ahead. Some minigames are based on words, memory or creativity, others on luck, courage and quick reactions&lt;br/&gt;You will play minigames like  Egg,-chicken-dragon-Viking, Loki, 2-5-7, Mad king, Thor&amp;rsquo;s hammer, Odin, Hunt , Drinking Viking and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game goal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of this game is the game itself. Players try not to loose in various minigames to escape punishment. Each mini game is competitive and has unique winning goal. The goal of mini-games could be for example:  beating others in rock-paper-scissors to become a Viking,  hitting the table with your hand to &amp;lsquo;stun&amp;rsquo; other players, following the rules made by crazy king or not being the last to row a viking ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules of each mini-game determine losers. As Drinking Viking is a party game and vikings celebrate the BIG VICTORY, losers normally consume a beverage. But you can play Stripping Viking as well as you can play it just by collecting black points which is another funny way to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all cards are played. Then the winner or winners are determined depending on a game type. Winner is a player who has lowest score or the player who has the most pieces of clothing or the player who drank less than others. It is very simple to recognize winners and losers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
