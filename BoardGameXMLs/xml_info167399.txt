			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Offset was going to be a high fantasy FPS built from the team's proprietary Offset engine. Intel bought the studio in early 2008 with the intention of using Project Offset to showcase its new Larrabee graphics tech. The company decided to abandon the project and disband the team two years later. Now Intel owns the Project Offset name as well as the Offset engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat would have had a fusion of close-quarters combat and long range shooting to create a high action experience. The game would also have featured rideable creatures such as Siege Trolls, Dragons and Battle Boars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
