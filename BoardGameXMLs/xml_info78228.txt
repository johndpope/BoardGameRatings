							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buzz Aldrin&#039;s Race Into Space</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Simulation management and strategy game recreating the Space Race between USA and the Soviet Union to land a man on the moon in the '60s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player manages either the US or USSR space program from first orbital satellite through Manned Orbital, space walks, docking, lunar probes to the landing itself and must balance tight budgets in the areas of research, launches, astronaut training, and the all important milestone missions to get the practice and safety up and the government with the big bucks onside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical accuracy has been attempted while allowing for alternative possible approaches. Instead of the historical Lunar orbital approach, earth orbital or direct flight are possible. It is even possible to develop a minishuttle and take that to the moon. There are some simplifications in the technology and changes to match the US and Soviet sides but overall recreates the atmosphere and environment of the era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was based on the boardgame Liftoff! by Fritz Bonner who was also one of the partners in the designers Strategic Visions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
