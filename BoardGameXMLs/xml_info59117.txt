			<description>Players are dealt five cards with the number down to each player. Then place at the center of the gaming table a card with the number up, which is called the target number. On a signal, players turn over their cards, put them in front of them on the table and start (MENTALLY) to use the fundamental operations with numbers in each of his numerals, so the final solution is equal in number to the target number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
