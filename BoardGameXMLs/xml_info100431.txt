			<description>This football strategy game revolves around a pair of selector cups, one for each player. The cups are built into the thick gridiron board and function as dials that determine the play selected by each coach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of each offensive play is determined by die rolls in the selector cups. The offensive team rolls for yardage gained. The defensive player rolls two dice that can generate random events like a fumble or a penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play follows the rules of football with punts, field goals, and every other element of the sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board includes a sliding football marker and a matching first down marker that also slides up and down the field. There is a huge scoreboard plus the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in 1978 by Wildcard, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
