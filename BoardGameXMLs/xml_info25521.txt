			<description>Age of Iron is a set of rules for using miniature vessels to fight naval battles in the early years of the ironclad and steam powered ships. The rules are intended for fast play, so that large naval forces may be used with the conflict resolved to a conclusion in a reasonable time frame. Each turn represents 5 minutes. Scale is 1:1200 (60 inches = 1 mile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten-sided dice are needed, as well as a random direction die or spinner. A ruler or tape measure is also required. Turn rate templates are provided, as well as status sheets that can be photocopied and used to record ship abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules cover initiative, movement, fire, ramming, boarding parties, morale, fires, and naval versus land combat. Comes with reference charts, ship rosters with their game capabilities, and many ship templates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
