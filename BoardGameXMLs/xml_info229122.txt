			<description>Skirmish Warfare in the Far Future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for AFTRERGLOW (a 3 page pdf) were designed to allow people with a range of figures to vaporise each other into a satisfying afterglow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troop listings are provided for commonly available science fiction miniatures but are modifiable at the discretion of players.  Troop types have skill factors for close and ranged combat, armour, speed, courage, leadership, hit points. Troops also have a cost value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game sequence is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Roll Command Points&lt;br/&gt;         Each squad rolls 1D6 and modifies according to leadership.  Command points may be used to move a figure, snapfire at a new target during movement phase or reload a heavy weapon.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Move Troops&lt;br/&gt;         Figures are moved a fixed distance modified by a speed factor.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Ranged Combat&lt;br/&gt;         Roll combat dice for weapon type, add any ranged combat skill and situational modifiers.  Each score of six or more is a hit.  All natural rolls of 1 are misses.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Close Combat&lt;br/&gt;         Roll combat dice for weapon type and add close combat skill factor.  Each score of six or more is a hit.  All natural rolls of 1 are misses.  &lt;br/&gt;         Targets roll a saving throw on 1D6 for each hit, adding their armour value.  Each score of six or more is a save.  All natural rolls of 1 are fails.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory conditions are at the discretion of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
