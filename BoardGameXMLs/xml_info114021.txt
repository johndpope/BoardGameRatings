			<description>The Concept&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hollywood Hookups is the first trivia game that links celebrities through biographical facts. The connections are real. And so are the celebrities. The concept of the game is very simple - you are given the names of two individuals that both dated or were married to the same person. You will have to come up with the name of the middle person. Hollywood Hookups links all kinds of celebrities - actors and actresses, musicians, athletes, and royalty. The trivia questions are in 3 different categories, and span the contemporary era to early 20th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual board game consists of a board, more than 500 question cards, 50 tokens, 1 die and 6 colored game pieces (red, yellow, blue, green, pink and orange). This is a family-friendly game for 2 to 6 players, ages 13 and up. The object of the game is to collect tokens by answering trivia questions correctly. The first player to get 8 tokens wins the game. This game can either be a single-player game, or it can be played in teams of 2 or 3. We really like the design of the board - the maroon color of the board contrasts nicely with the gold accents. The outside of the box has a white background, with more than 30 different celebrity names on the box - Marilyn Monroe, Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Question Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions come in 3 different categories - Modern, Classic and Connect 3. The Modern cards have questions about contemporary celebrities; the Classic cards have questions about classic (old Hollywood) celebrities. Both of those types of cards only have one celebrity as the answer. The Connect 3 cards have contemporary celebrities, but the connection involves 3 different celebrities. These questions are much harder, but we're sure you're up to the challenge! Please see the designs below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
