							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exile Sun: Tech Interrupt Cards</name>
									
			<description>This is a set of supplemental technology cards that were only available to those who pledged to support the &amp;quot;Exile Sun&amp;quot; project on Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards will add a little variety to the base game. The standard technology cards that come with Exile Sun are one time use abilities that players can buy and then use on their turn to gain different advantages in many categories. The details of this standard set of tech cards are outlined on the back of the Exile Sun rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kickstarter exclusive reward Tech Interrupt Cards are different in that they are termed 'interrupt' other tech cards. They allow players to effect the game outside their own turns. Using these cards will be an optional variant to the base game. Shuffled in among the regular Tech cards, these Kickstarter only cards will be rare, but when used at the right time, they provide some additional interaction and strategic planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
