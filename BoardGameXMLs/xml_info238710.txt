			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, I do like to be beside the sea side&lt;br/&gt;Oh, I do like to be beside the sea...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, sorry about that but this publication has put me in a holiday mood!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you have here is a veritable cornucopia of magic items all with a sea, seaside or beach theme. Perfect for any adventure along any coast whether in the Nentir Vale, along the Adventurer&amp;rsquo;s Sword Coast or some homebrew stretch of coastal land!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find items to enhance communication, solve luggage problems, change time, reveal secret entrances, summon a God (yes really!). If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough there are also methods to travel underwater, items to distract enemies and some to even protect the whole team in times of crisis! And more traditionally there are items to armour your players and provide the means to evade capture and kidnapping!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are full descriptions, short narrative histories and stats for the following &amp;ndash; (rarity is indicated after the item name):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shell of Messaging, uncommon       &lt;br/&gt;Shell of Announcing, uncommon       &lt;br/&gt;Octobag, rare                   &lt;br/&gt;Anchor of Time, rare               &lt;br/&gt;Anchor Weight, uncommon           &lt;br/&gt;Kiss of the Sea, uncommon           &lt;br/&gt;Sand of Revealing, uncommon       &lt;br/&gt;Shield of Brachyura, uncommon       &lt;br/&gt;The God Stone, artefact           &lt;br/&gt;Breast Plate of Many Shells, uncommon   &lt;br/&gt;Coral Diadem, rare               &lt;br/&gt;Lobster claw gloves, unusual           &lt;br/&gt;Pseudomorph ink cloud, unusual       &lt;br/&gt;Aquam Amor Staff, rare           &lt;br/&gt;Aquatic Rod, very rare           &lt;br/&gt;Electric Eel Coat, unusual           &lt;br/&gt;Cry of the Gull, uncommon           &lt;br/&gt;Saltwater Tonic, uncommon           &lt;br/&gt;Turtle Talisman, unusual           &lt;br/&gt;Giant Deep-Sea Turtle Talisman, very rare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
