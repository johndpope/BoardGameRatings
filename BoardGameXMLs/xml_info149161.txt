							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Ahlmeran</name>
									
			<description>Heroes of Ahlmeran (HoA) is a cooperative card game where 2 - 5 players come together and build an adventuring party from unique Hero Cards and Feat Cards and then complete Quests to help the land of Ahlmeran. The game requires both team strategy and problem solving abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players, you will build your party from a selection of 12 Heroes spanning across 6 Races. The Humans, lost among the land now, with no real home. The Dwarves, at home among the rock with their advanced technology. Elves, Cast out by their past mistake, they are no longer rulers of the land but rather 2nd class citizens. The Canin, a proud race resembling a blue wolf. The Puar, the cat people of Guuman. And then the Gnomes. No one knows magic more intimately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From those races you will select of the 6 Classes that best suits your play style. Artificer, master of artifacts and arcane knowledge. Barbarian, nomad tribes bestowing their nature knowledge and sheer might to the people. Elemental Mage, master of the 4 elements. Priest, Master of the holy arts, both offensive and defensive. Ranger, commander of nature and all that resides within her. And Templar, defender of the people, master of arcane. Each of the classes come with bonuses and a unique 40 card deck that your character will use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, you select a Location Deck to play with, a deck of 15 cards to represent where your quest takes place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, you pick a Quest Deck, the enemy or circumstance your heroes are struggling against. It could be anything from breaking a curse, thwarting a thief to facing a brutal goblin ambush!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game, you will play cards from your Class Deck, working together with your friends to complete whatever the Quest Deck requires for your victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each Quest Deck completed and Location Deck explored, you gain the chance to accumulate more rare items, allowing you to play the game countless times with more combinations than we can count&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
