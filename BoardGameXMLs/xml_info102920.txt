			<description>Aim of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mobuzz, players must make a word as quickly as possible according to the chosen theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you start the game, enter the number of players. You can also play in teams. In a second step, determine the minimum number of letters to form a valid word. Now you need to choose and vote for a free theme according to which the words must be found. If you don&amp;rsquo;t manage to agree, don&amp;rsquo;t panic, the draw is also possible! Now, each player or team takes place around the game board and the party can begin. Press the center button &amp;quot;GO&amp;quot; and play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 8 letters. All the players get the same letters during the game. They can use a ninth letter which changes every 10 seconds, displayed on the board. When a player decides to use it, he can take control by pressing the buzzer and get the ninth letter. He has 30 seconds to make a word including the minimum number of letters defined before and fitting the chosen theme. Once the player takes control, he must validate a word. During the composition of his word, the player must click on each letter and then validate it by pressing the OK button. In case of error, he simply clicks on &amp;quot;COLLECT&amp;quot; to get back his letters. After validation, the player scores as many points as the number of letters used and a new round can begin with a new draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each letter used, the player wins 1 point. If he succeeds in using all his letters, he wins 15 points. If a player fails to make a word during the allotted time when he takes control, he loses 6 points. The first player to reach 50 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of Topics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forenames / Sportsmen / Actors / Food / Words of 5 letters / Football Players...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are free to choose a theme ... or not! Mobuzz doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a spelling checker in order to leave your imagination free when choosing the theme. In case no player finds a word, you may decide unanimously to change all the letters by clicking on &amp;quot;CHANGE LETTERS&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Solo Mode, the player has 45 seconds to make a word. Once the word is found, he continues playing the game by trying to find a new one, according to a new draw of letters. Once time expires, the game is over. With each word found, the player scores 1 point. He can break records in each category or find 50 words in a row!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
