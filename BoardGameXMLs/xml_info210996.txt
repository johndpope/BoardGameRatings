							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Living Memories in the Forgetting Place</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are dreamers who, ravaged by nightmares, were drawn to an oasis of warmth and peace in the form of a cozy, roadside tavern called the Oubliette. The peace of the tavern quieted your nightmares, but the peace you found came with a cost. What you did not know when you entered was that the tavern was a trap set to lure in weary dreamers, so their memories could be harvested. The longer a dreamer remains, the more of themselves they lose. When the last of their memories are gone, those trapped in this place of forgetting will cease to be, forgotten by existence itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
