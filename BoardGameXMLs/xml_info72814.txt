			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Third World War is a war strategy game set in an alternate reality where the Cold War of the 20th century spilled over into violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take control of one of several nations (including the US, the Soviet Union, China, and several European countries) and then are tasked with taking over the world using both military and financial means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As nations are defeated, they grant both financial and manpower bonuses, which make recruiting larger and more effective forces easier. Combat is from an overhead 3/4 perspective and takes part in real time, with players guiding the various units into combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
