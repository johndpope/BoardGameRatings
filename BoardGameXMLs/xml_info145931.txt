			<description>Subtitle: The Story of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and The People Who Play It&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HERE, THERE BE DRAGONS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient red dragons with 527 hit points, +44 to attack, and a 20d10 breath weapon, to be specific. In the world of fantasy role-playing, those numbers describe a winged serpent with immense strength and the ability to spit fire. There are few beasts more powerful - just like there are few games more important than Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve never played Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, you probably know someone who has: the game has had a profound influence on our culture. Released in 1974 - decades before the Internet and social media - Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons inspired one of the original nerd subcultures, and is still revered by millions of fans around the world. Now the authoritative history and magic of the game are revealed by an award-winning journalist and lifelong D&amp;amp;D player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
