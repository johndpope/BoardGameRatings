			<description>Traplines is based on a prior design that was the predecessor to Linebreakers, and never released.  The design is what was originally intended but deviated from with the introduction of chess pieces in Linebreakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traplines, like Linebreakers, utilizes custodial trapping and delayed capture.  In this, two pieces of a player will &amp;quot;bookend&amp;quot; a line of enemy pieces and freeze them so they can't move, but can be captured in a future turn.  The origins of the idea came from pondering what would happen if you took Othello/Reversi and moved pieces on the board.  From this the custodial trap, with delayed capture, move came about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, there are a number of starting configurations and multiple variants that involve capturing opponent's pieces or exiting one's own pieces off the board, in order to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
