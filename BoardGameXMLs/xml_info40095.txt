			<description>E, the Game of Martian Chinese Checkers (E = mc&amp;sup2; - get it?) requires one Icehouse stash per player and a specifically laid out hex board.  The board is a large hexagon, with its six sections colored to match the pyramids that will go on it - consistent with Chinese Checkers.  The line of hexes that forms the border between &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; territories is multi-colored, matching the adjacent home territories.  What makes E special is that it uses the natural size stackability of the Icehouse pieces to enhance Chinese Checkers significantly.  For one thing, pieces must move precisely as many steps and/or jumps as they have pips (i.e. Smalls go 1; mediums, 2; larges, 3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major effect on play comes from the stackability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A piece may never - not even for a step of a move - stack directly on its own color.  (except as the result of a guard exchange)&lt;br/&gt;     If you can physically touch your piece (without shifting things about), you may move it, even if that means pieces atop it will take a free ride.&lt;br/&gt;     If you can't physically touch your piece, it is trapped.&lt;br/&gt;     You may never trap a piece in its home territory.  The multicolor hexes come into play here, creating a somewhat safe zone for pieces.  The center space is safe for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;     You may liberate a trapped piece of yours, teleport a guard (a trapping piece of yours), and violate the &amp;quot;never stack directly on yourself&amp;quot; rule by performing a guard exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is otherwise exactly like Chinese Checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Icehouse Pieces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
