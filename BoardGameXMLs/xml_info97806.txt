							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wing Commander Arena</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the classic Wing Commander series. WC: Arena is designed like an arcade game without the flight simulator aspects. It contains 18 different ships (9 Terran / 9 Kilrathi) that can be unlocked during single player. There are also several different map stages that can be chosen for multiplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different single-player game modes: Melee (you against a series of bots), Meteor Storm (similar to Asteroids where you need to break apart large chunks of rock), Gauntlet (waves of ships come at you), and Proving Ground (training skills.) The multiplayer has many game types including: Capital Ship Battle (the sides must try to destroy the other cap ship), Satellite (capture the flag), Deathmatch, Bearpit (onlookers can shoot at the main players), and Dogfight (one-on-one battles.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
