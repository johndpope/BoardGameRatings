							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">California Speed</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Golden State! But if you want to see it all, don't blink 'cuz you'll be traveling at a cool 145 mph! Blast by landmarks at eye-popping velocity, while maintaining smooth control over your vehicle. Get in, grab the wheel and drive like the speed demon you are! We'll get your motor running!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Burn rubber through California sites like L.A., San Diego, Monterey, San Francisco, the Mojave Desert (hot, hot, hot) and many more.&lt;br/&gt;- Scoot down 11 original tracks (all with plenty of shortcuts) plus 5 hidden tracks. Race at night, in overcast conditions or on one of those typically sunny California days. Got your shades? &lt;br/&gt;- Custom-build your speed machine with all the essentials! Cool rims, brilliant colors, automatic and manual transmissions! Whether you decide on a muscle car, your dream car, a golf cart or a speed machine, you'll have 21 cars to choose from including some surprises!&lt;br/&gt;- Compete in the &amp;quot;California Series&amp;quot;, a 3 week event divided into 3 divisions: Light, Sport and Heavy. If that doesn't grease your pistons, try speeding in the &amp;quot;California Cup&amp;quot;. But make sure you place at least 3rd in order to keep racing!&lt;br/&gt;- Three gorgeous California Babes await the winner at every finish line!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
