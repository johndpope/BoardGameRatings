			<description>Goalsystem Delves provides rules and adventures for playing character-driven skirmish games in fantasy worlds of mysteries, magic, and monsters. These rules harken back to the days of classic dungeon crawls and the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular fantasy RPG. Players take the roles of a group of hardened adventurers seeking treasure, glory, and the defeat of the festering evils that remain hidden in the darkest corners of forgotten dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goalsystem Delves seamlessly blends RPG and tabletop miniature elements into a fast paced tabletop experience that provides the depth of an RPG with the fast paced action of a tactical miniatures game. Delves plays fast, allowing players to run a multi-encounter Adventure in a single session and epic campaigns over multiple sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the proven and popular Goalsystem, Delves delivers character driven action that&amp;rsquo;s deep enough for RPG gamers and fast enough for miniature gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delves works with any 28mm or 15mm miniatures in your collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delves features 6 character classes and 12 sub-classes that cover all of the major tropes of the dungeon fantasy genre. In addition to a dozen player character races, we also include more than 30 monsters, 30 spells, and lots of weapons and equipment that you can use to bring your adventures to life. But Delves is your game, and we provide the tools you need to run dungeon skirmishes your way. To this end the game also includes rules for creating your own races, classes, and creatures, making Delves the ultimate fantasy toolkit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
