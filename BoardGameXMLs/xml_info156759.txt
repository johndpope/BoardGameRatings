			<description>Your favorite word game, minus the words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of letters, the tiles are numbers, and instead of forming words, each sequence of tiles has to add up to five or a multiple of five, and no sequences may be more than five tiles long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Each player draws five tiles for their rack.&lt;br/&gt;    The first player places a sequence of one or more of their tiles on the board which sum to five or a multiple of five, with one of the tiles on the center square.&lt;br/&gt;    The next player, and then each player in turn, adds a sequence of one or more of their own tiles to the board, intersecting with tiles already in play.&lt;br/&gt;    All sequences of two or more tiles that are completed, both horizontally and vertically, must add up to multiples of five.&lt;br/&gt;    Sequences may never be more than five tiles in length.&lt;br/&gt;    At the end of each turn, players draw new tiles to replace the ones played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The score for each play is the sum of the number tiles in sequences completed on that turn, plus any bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;    Bonuses are earned on the turn in which a player places a tile on a bonus square.&lt;br/&gt;    Bonus squares with a plus sign add to the score for the sequence.&lt;br/&gt;    Bonus squares with a multiplication sign multiply the score of the entire sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The game ends when a player plays all of their remaining tiles and there are no more tiles left to draw.&lt;br/&gt;    The other players lose five points for each tile they have left when the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;    The player with the highest total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Easy to learn rules&lt;br/&gt;    Simple controls, just drag the tiles to the board&lt;br/&gt;    Online multiplayer &amp;ndash; get a notification when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to play&lt;br/&gt;    Pass and Play multiplayer supporting up to four players on one device&lt;br/&gt;    Three challenging computer opponents for single player fun&lt;br/&gt;    Fast startup, no waiting around for loading screens or advertisements&lt;br/&gt;    Realistic wooden tiles and a scorepad make it feel just like family game night&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
