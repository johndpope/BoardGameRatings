			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the mid 18th century, two fearless pirate brothers ruled the seas of the world as it was then known. They were Captain Blackbeard and the Red Corsair. &lt;br/&gt;They salvaged treasures, attacked merchant ships and embarked on many an adventure. Over the years, the par assembled loyal crews and had magic pirate spells which they used to spread terror and fear throughout the civilised world. They were as thick as thieves. As for who was the strongest of the two, no one knew. To decide those once and for all, each pirate kidnapped the beloved lady of the other.&lt;br/&gt;In this exciting duel between two legendary figures, the players take on the roles of Captain Blackbeard and the Red Corsair and each attempt to free their ladies from the clutches of their brother.&lt;br/&gt;The table where the cards are laid represents the sea and its islands. The hand of each player represents their pirate ship, while the cards symbolise the crew or the pirate spells. Which pirate brother will be the first to free his lady from the grasp of his brother?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to free your pirate lady from the clutches of your opponent pirate.&lt;br/&gt;The first player whose lady (Lady in Red for the Red Corsair, Lady in Black for Captain Blackbeard) appears on the opponent's discard pile is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Cards land on the discard pile either by defeating them while fighting on an isle or due to a penalty when the opponent pirates controle one or more of the 4 islands. Care has to be taken on which island your followers should be send as even the strongest pirate has its weaknesses. Furthermore, every island has its own penalties (e.g. discard cards from your hand / discard pile or pirates already on islands) which should be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
