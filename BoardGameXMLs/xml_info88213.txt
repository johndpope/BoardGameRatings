			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A naval simulation set in World War II. As captain of the British O-class destroyer HMS Onslaught, patrol the Mediterranean sea, the English Channel or the North sea, escort convoys, hunt German submarines, conduct search-and-destroy operations or blockade enemy ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a 3d engine with filled polygons and is played in real time. The player chooses between the different views of the ship to give orders (the helm to give navigation orders, map room to plot a course...). There are three scenarios (Mediterranean Sea, English Channel, North sea), each with five different missions to choose from. Each scenario also includes a &amp;quot;Delta&amp;quot; option, where the player has no set objective but can patrol the map and is free to engage the enemy at her leisure. Enemies include destroyers, cruisers, cargo ships, submarines and stukas when the player cruises too close to a German base. The ship is armed with three gun turrets, AA guns and torpedoes (no depth charges, so the only way to destroy a U-boat is to track it with the sonar and wait until it surfaces). If the destroyer needs repair or ammunitions, the player can enter a friendly port, but care must be taken as some of the missions have a time limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version notes: the Amstrad CPC version lacks the third scenario (North sea), the binocular view, some ship types, and the mission briefings are included in the manual and not in-game. The developer, Futura, was an in-house Loriciels development team. The display engine is an adaptation of the Sherman M-4 (a WWII tank simulation) engine by the same team of developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
