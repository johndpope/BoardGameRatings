			<description>Janksy &amp;ndash; Space Based Physics Adventure is a physics adventure based in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Launch Janksy, a little green alien, from platform to platform, trying to safely get him to his spaceship. The real challenge comes in from avoiding dangerous moving asteroids and not getting launched off in to deep space. Each level contains various different mechanics and challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avoid dangerous floating asteroids that would do damage to our poor hero, and time your launches to landed as perfectly as you can on moving platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collide with ringed planets that launch you in the direction they&amp;rsquo;re facing, and use portals that lead you all around the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curve your way round black holes, carefully using their gravitational pull to adjust your trajectory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, of course, try to collect all 3 nebula on each level, to really add to the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
