			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Master's Vault&amp;quot; is a fantasy adventure utilizing the SRD5 Open Gaming License for the world's most popular tabletop roleplaying game, complete with six level one characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more than a century Elaria Feywing, known to many as The Master, mentored young adventurers in combat, exploration, and magic. Little is known about the elf woman&amp;rsquo;s past and her days as a wandering wizard, but her status as a teacher is legendary. Many young fortune-seekers made the trek out to the small village of Parabor on the frontier of the Merriam Vale to seek Elaria&amp;rsquo;s expertise. She took only a handful of these pupils every year. Her favorite group of disciples was also her last and most recent... YOU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Master's Vault&amp;quot; serves as a detailed introduction to both Roll20 and tabletop roleplaying-- perfect for new Game Masters trying to establish their first adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
