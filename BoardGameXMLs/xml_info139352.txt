			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DungeonLord's LogBook What is a DungeonLord? A Game Master's Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DungeonLords are the most prepared and best organized game masters at any table. They use a quality logbook that allows them to quickly pull up details about their world and all characters/monsters that dwell upon it. Their NPCs have personalities, and their cities/towns have economies, shops, laws and realistic random events. DungeonLords award good players with role-playing Award certificates. They provide closure to unfortunate heroes by offering Death certificates. They themselves have a color certificate they might hang on wall as a doctor/lawyer might do. (So all will know and respect them as an authority in their field.)  The DungeonLord's LogBook is more than a simple notebook, it is one of the most powerful collection of tools ever created to Aid Game Masters in running the ultimate fantasy role-playing game. (It is designed for use with ALL Fantasy role-playing systems.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This LogBook features: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Adventure Log Sheets.&amp;quot; Design to quickly track characters by name, class and level. Monitoring their Attributes, Saves, Alignments, Health, Armor Level, Weapons Types, Spells Available and Major Magic items/Equipment. As well as tracking marching order in various formations. (Sheet A &amp;amp; B combined allow the GM to track up to six characters in a single glance.)  &amp;quot;Character Profile Sheets.&amp;quot; Tracks specific information regarding each character including quests, allies, enemies, awards, arrests, and specific spells known by each character.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;NPC character sheets.&amp;quot; Needful information as found on in the adventure logs for characters, but also tracks loyalty, courage, honesty, likes, hates, fears, sayings and mannerisms.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Character Sheets.&amp;quot; Designed for players to use. But also serve as a great aid to Game Master. (It is much easier to check what a player has written down if they are all using the same style of sheet.) Sheets are designed to work well with a variety of role-playing game systems that utilize attributes, race, class, skills, weapons, armor, saves, health, etc. Sheets make use of symbols for easy identification and are all intuitively organized to be user friendly.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Encounter Sheets&amp;quot; Designed to be used for numbered encounters, (Use with or without maps - Also included.) they organize basic monster, trap and treasure info. And offer a small hex map to predefine area dimension and monster location within area if desired.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Map Grids&amp;quot; Both square and hexagon shaped grid paper so GMs can create their own maps quick and easily. (Maybe saved and opened with MS Paint and grids filled as required to quickly make a neat and useful map.)&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Option Monetary System&amp;quot; A enhanced and somewhat different list of metals to be used as coinage. (Include descriptions of weight, color and magical properties.)&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Options Store/Shop/Guilds (A-Z List)&amp;quot; Includes Armorer, Bakery, Blacksmith, Castles (Simplified) Clothing, Engraver, Flowers, Furniture, Fletcher, General Store, Jewelry, Livestock, Mason Guild, Needful things, Tavern, Tents, Thrones and a Weapon Smith.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Random and Specific Event Tables.&amp;quot; Anything can happen and probably will.&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;NPC personality Table&amp;quot; 100 instant unique personalities complete with courage, loyalty and honest rating.
