(In case of 5-player play, one card is left.)&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Take the card you received at the same time in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;     The game is played in real time.&lt;br/&gt;         Check the last obstacle!&lt;br/&gt;         Check the card in your hand!&lt;br/&gt;         If you can fix it, shout out the next obstacle!&lt;br/&gt;             Only the first card you put on the old card is accepted.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
