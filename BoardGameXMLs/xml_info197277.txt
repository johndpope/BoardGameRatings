			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witness the Dark Reflections of&amp;hellip; Obsidious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level X Rogue, Obsidious is an undying evil being who delights in confronting people with their own dark sides. Obsidious is an iconic character in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obsidious&amp;rsquo;s file is designated &amp;quot;Black&amp;quot; to reflect his strange, occult origins. Is he a god? A cosmic entity from another world? Or is he a servant of powers even more terrifying that lurk beyond the worlds we know? No-one knows for certain, but his evil nature is unquestionable. On his own, he is a Power Level 16 threat, but the powers within his mystic Black Mirror grant him abilities that defy quantification. Chief among these powers is his ability to confront heroes with dark reflections of themselves, manifestations of their own dark sides given physical form! Can your heroes defeat themselves and foil the plots of Obsidious?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
