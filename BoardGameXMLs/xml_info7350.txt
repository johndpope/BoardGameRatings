							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Look at the Schmuck on that Camel</name>
									
			<description>Yiddish Trivia Game. Look at the Schmuck on that Camel is a game of over 100 Yiddishisms with 400+ definitions, give or take a little. Participants are asked to logically determine whether a Yiddish word is defined correctly. The game evidently contained a taped performance, music, and comedy cards all based on old Yiddish jokes. The game was the concept of and was written by Wilbur Pierce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
