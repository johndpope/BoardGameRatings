			<description>All the time tiny bugs were seen whenever we played outdoors in childhood. Sometimes by homework, and sometimes by curiosity, we used to catch bugs with friends. But these days, especially in downtown, we can barely see the bugs. Furthermore, some kinds of bug are very rare. Now let&amp;rsquo;s meet the bugs evanescent and out of sight from us.&lt;br/&gt;The players need to find various kinds of bug as the bug-hunters. We are not trying to collect bugs stuffed and exhibited. Rather, we study and preserve them for the better ecosystem. The conference will be held that everyone pay attention soon. Collect various bugs and be the best bug-hunter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Object]&lt;br/&gt;You have to collect various bugs as a bug-hunter. You can collect the bug when you gather all same kind of it in your hand. But it would be a little hard because other bug-hunters also compete for the collection. If you collect the most bugs until the conference(end of game), you will be called the bug expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game Play]&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you do 1 action among the 3 actions - Pick, Call and Collect.&lt;br/&gt;Each player holds the cards of bugs and shows their backs to others during play. The backs notices the color of the bug, so players can deduce the cards needed.&lt;br/&gt;By Pick action, you pick only 1 card from specific player.&lt;br/&gt;By Call cation, you call a kind and a color of the bug to specific player. If you success, you get the card and do Call action again.(Until you fail.)&lt;br/&gt;When all cards of same kind of bug are gathered on your hand, you may collect it and get scores.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of your turn, you have to swap a card in your hand with a card in Forest - the array of 3 cards in hidden on the middle of table.(The illustrations of backs are trees.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Scoring]&lt;br/&gt;When 7 kinds of bug are collected during play, the game ends immediately. (There are 10 kinds of bug in the game.)&lt;br/&gt;The period of bug hunting has been over, and the anticipated conference is held now. Score 1 point per a card of the collected bugs. (e.g. The bug with 5 colors(cards) scores 5 points.) Sum whole points including the bug collected by items. And the player who has no item card at the end of the game gets -2 points. (It is basic attitude of the bug-hunter to take care of items!)&lt;br/&gt;The player who scores the most points wins a victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For details, check the rulebook please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
