			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Fox is a 3D Shooter developed for the SNES by Nintendo. It was released in 1993 and is the first instalment in the Star fox Series. In Europe and Australia the game was titled Starwing. Star Fox was the first game to be equipped with the Super FX chip, which is used to create the 3D graphical style with use of polygons, which couldn't be done with the basic SNES Hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game the player is Fox McCloud, captain of the four-headed Star Fox team. The team has to defeat the evil Andross, by fighting their way through the Lylat system to Andross' home planet Venom. While the player only controls Fox McCloud and his Arwing, the other team members take part in the battle as well, and request for help from the player sometimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose between three different routes from the home planet Corneria to the enemy planet Venom. These routes differ in difficulty. Some levels take place over a planet, others take place in space. All the members of the Star Fox team fly in an Arwing. An Arwing's main weapon is a laser beam-like weapon. This weapon can be improved by finding upgrades hidden in the levels. A secondary weapon are nova bombs. They are limited in supply, but can be found throughout the levels as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is in many ways a Rail Shooter, the player has some freedom of movement. The main progress of the Arwing through the level is automatic, but the Arwing can be moved vertically and horizontally, which is needed to aim. Apart from that the player has the possibility to brake or accelerate. This can be used to dodge enemy attacks and flying objects, or to get certain upgrades. Bonusses can be received by flying through a series of gates or rings present in some levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has inspired sequels on Nintendo 64, Gamecube and Nintendo DS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
