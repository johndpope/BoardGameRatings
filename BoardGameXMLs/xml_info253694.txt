			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salt of the stars and salt of the earth -- the critically acclaimed series is back! The armies of Seven Walls and the armies of Leaf have set their weapons aside -- mid-battle -- and cast off their armor and clothes. They walk hand-in-hand, naked, laughing, as friends, into the UnDungeon. Hannah has been captured. Now Baron Lennox beckons for you to return from your dark decent, rewarding you with The Perseverance [a tavern]. Beneath book 2 begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will venture back to CragLee to claim the rewards they earned from book 1, including The Perseverance (a large tavern). Your party will even manage a &amp;quot;character sheet&amp;quot; specifically made for The Perseverance:  name a bar manager, track profits, store items, and customize the property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will also meet Emily, a &amp;ldquo;Game Witch&amp;rdquo; who will share Hannah&amp;rsquo;s secret and also provide valuable support throughout the second half of the campaign. She can take an apprentice and teach them to imbue animal and human organs with powerful magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horrors compound as the party returns to the UnDungeon and &amp;quot;The Vert&amp;quot; to face the more inverted abominations. Player&amp;rsquo;s decisions affect the outcomes of Hannah and many of the townspeople who have been seduced by the Inverted Cupid. Players will discover what The Invert actually is--a living, breathing cultural catalyst (a &amp;quot;Vert&amp;quot;) summoned with only the best intentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
