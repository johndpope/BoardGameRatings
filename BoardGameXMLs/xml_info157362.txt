							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Character Record Examples</name>
									
			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;Each main character class is given an example printed front and back at high resolution for printing at any size. Also included is an extended example of a magic user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Lore Lords LLA series contains nearly 50 sheets for compiling character records. Both as examples and as an aid to our own gaming we present these examples of ready made character records. All the main classes are represented, and an expanded Magic User book is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Using the Sheets:&lt;br/&gt;Each character record comes as a PDF file. Odd pages have the ref to the right, even pages to the left and are indexed with the LLA drawing number. I use my PDF reader to print them as a booklet at A5 size, but my players prefer A4 double sided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF has been left unlocked so copying of the sheets into your favorite editor should be easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
