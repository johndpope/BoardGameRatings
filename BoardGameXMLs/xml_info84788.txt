			<description>Party game based on a German TV show. The game consists of cards with sentence starts and four possible endings. Each player also has a set of four guessing cards (A-D, one for each answer) and some heart chips. The sentences deal mostly with men/women stereotypes.&lt;br/&gt;In each round, a player reads the sentence and the four endings, then each player chooses an answer option. Then pairs are assigned and the two players try to guess what answer the other player chose. The first successful pair exchanges heart chips. If only one player guessed correctly, he/she gets a single point. After 12 rounds, heart chips are counted, with multiple chips in the same color counting less than a diversity of colors. Bonus points are added and the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
