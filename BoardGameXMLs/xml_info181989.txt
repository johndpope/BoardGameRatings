							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Peterborough</name>
									
			<description>A family game of skill, excitement and fun played in familiar surroundings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You build your companies in the centre of the city where space is at a premium and most valuable!  Can you beat the competition to become the most successful entrepreneur in town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete with a beautiful playing board (which is a map of the city), 80 company cards (4 per company, 5 companies per player), 8 marker tokens, 3 dice and full easy to understand instructions.  Includes fascinating information on the companies taking part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you roll dice (once or twice) and choose how to use them to adjust your horizontal and vertical markers.  These determine the position where you may (a) Add a tile, (b) Remove a tile, (c) rotate a tile or (d) challenge the owner of the tile in that space. The four tile for a company when placed in a square and correctly-oriented form the company logo, which cannot be removed/challenged.  Locations nearer the middle of the city score more points than those on the edge (score is the sum of the distances from the nearest edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
