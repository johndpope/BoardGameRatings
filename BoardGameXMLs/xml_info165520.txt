			<description>Each player have a screen to hide away his side of the board; behind this screen he places his combination with the numbers 1-5 (Black numbers on White background).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose is to guess the other players combintaion by placing number counters on an open row (Black numbers on Red/Yellow background).&lt;br/&gt;If the player have any numbers correctly placed he will be informed of how many numbers are right.&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;Jack uses the combination 2-3-1-5-4&lt;br/&gt;Joe guesses on 2-4-1-3-5&lt;br/&gt;In this example Joe is correct about the location of 2 and 1 - so he have two numbers correct and will be informed by a marker that two numbers are correctly placed, but not which ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who first guesses the opponents combination. Depending on the round the player guesses the combination he will be awarded different amount of points using the scale 40-35-30-25-20-15-10-5.&lt;br/&gt;If succeded in the 5th round he will get 20 points&lt;br/&gt;After the 8th round it is called at tie and the game is restarted&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
