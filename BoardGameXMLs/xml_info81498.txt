							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Daytona USA</name>
									
			<description>Daytona USA is a racing arcade game by Sega and the highest grossing arcade machine of all time[citation needed] . Daytona USA was Sega's first title to debut on the Sega Model 2 arcade board, and at the time of its 1993 introduction, was considered the most visually detailed 3D arcade racing game. Despite a lower polygon-count than its predecessor, Virtua Racing, Daytona's 3D-world was fully texture-mapped, giving it a more realistic appearance than the former. In single-player mode, Daytona maintained a consistent 60fps refresh rate, even with multiple opponents on screen, surpassing the motion smoothness of the only other racing game in a comparable graphical arena, Namco's Ridge Racer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daytona USA was re-released in arcades in 2010 as Sega Racing Classic. A slight update with High Definition graphics and 16:9 monitor screens. The name was changed due to Sega no longer holding the Daytona name copyright.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Daytona USA (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
