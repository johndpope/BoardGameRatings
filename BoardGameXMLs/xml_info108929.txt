							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Call of the Crow (Savage Worlds)</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the harbor city of Steelport, many secrets lurk down darkened alleys and behind shadowy storefronts. It is a city known for its seedy inhabitants and shady dealings, but rarely do the affairs of the underworld spill out onto the streets. Recently, however, an upstart gang of thieves calling themselves the Blades of the Crow have begun making a name for themselves, killing off their competition, and peddling dangerous drugs to the poorest of the poor. A bedraggled innkeeper, his wife recently kidnapped, needs a group of stalwart heroes to stem this deadly new tide of corruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call of the Crow is the next installment in Reality Blurs' Old School Fantasy line of adventure modules. Hearken back to the days of legend and lore, when your spells, swords, and smarts alone kept the forces of evil at bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for adventure? Remember, Reality Blurs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
