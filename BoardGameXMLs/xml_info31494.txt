			<description>This is an abstract strategy game where players are rolling place dice onto a 4x4 chess-board like area.  One player has light dice and the other dark -- and similarly there are light and dark squares on the board.  The player with the highest score in their dice on the opposite toned squares wins.  The trick comes in that the dice are placed with a particular horizontal or vertical orientation, and that when a dice is placed, adjacent dice may be converted if the facing side of the new die is higher in value than the facing side of the original die.  Also, to give a bit more strategic depth, players may store up to 3 dice that they don't like the rolls on -- and may use one of these instead of rolling on any turn.  But, they must use all the stored dice by game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
