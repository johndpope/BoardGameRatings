			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After visiting a friend in a nearby town you head to the tavern to get some food. A recent storm has wreaked havoc and the residents are busy making repairs. Despite your offer to help the citizens politely refuse. After sitting down for your meal you quickly learned that some children found a ship that has run aground. The father tells you that the children are prone to exaggerate but you obtain directions to the supposed site anyway. Sure you&amp;rsquo;re alone, but you&amp;rsquo;ve got tons of experience already&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign, but is easily adaptable to most any game and system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
