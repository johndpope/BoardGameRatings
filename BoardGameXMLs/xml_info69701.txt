							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pearls of Pohjola</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pearls of Pohjola is designed for a Sorcerer level 10-12, but with some minor scaling, The Pearls of Pohjola is suitable for use with a traditional four-player party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago when titans walked the earth and great beasts ruled the wild places, there was Pohjola, a land ruled by a great chief of the same name. To him was born 3 daughters, and to each of his daughters he entrusted something sacred, so that they may protect Pohjola in their own fashion according to their own temperament. But a twist of fate and the great avarice and trickery of the bog hag, follower of Louhi, trapped the sisters three in a pendant of pearls. There they wait, frozen in ever-summer with the blush of youth destined to repeat the tale of the old songs until a champion navigates the pearls and frees them. Do you have what it takes to finish the old song once and for all?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
