			<description>This games was published in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #113. Napoleon and the Archduke Charles: The Battle of Abensberg is a game for two players, simulating the battle of Abensberg which took place on April 20th, 1809. One player commands the French forces, the other the Austrians. Rules on movement, combat, leadership and morale reflect the problems and possibilities which faced the historical commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale = 600 yards (=548 m)/ hex&lt;br/&gt;Strength = 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 guns/ Strength point&lt;br/&gt;Time = 35 min./ GT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is determined by controlling objectives and by inflicting losses to the enemy forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note:&lt;br/&gt;Abensberg is a complete game in itself. It can also be played as a &amp;ldquo;campaign game&amp;rdquo; linked with another of 3W&amp;rsquo;s Bonaparte series, The Battle of Eckmuhl (in S&amp;amp;T #114). Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios are provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. An additional dozen scenarios can be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&amp;amp;T #115 (Kanev). These later scenarios link the two games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #116 includes two more scenarios along with a Q&amp;amp;A by the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nominee for the 1987 Charles S. Roberts awards for Best Pre-World War II Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
