							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El Paso</name>
									
			<description>Each player begins with 5 cards from a standard 52 card deck plus 2 jokers.  Draw a card, keep it or pass it to the player on your left.  If you pass it, you must draw and keep the next card.  You may then discard pairs of cards, with some discards having special powers (e.g. force other players to draw cards).  The round ends if any player discards all their cards or the deck runs out.  Score penalty points for cards remaining in hand.  The player with the fewest points at the end of five rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El Paso was designed as a version of Give Me The Brain to be played with a standard card deck, and was first published by Dalmuti's Restaurant in 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
