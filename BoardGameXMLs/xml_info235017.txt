							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Santa&#039;s Workshop</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the busiest time of the year at the North Pole, with only days to go until Santa leaves to make his yearly trip around the world! After his long night, and all the work that led up to it, Santa always takes a vacation somewhere sunny and warm. As a reward for helping bring joy to children around the world, Santa takes his hardest working team of elves with him!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you lead your team of elves to claim their well-deserved reward? Not only are there toys to be built, but reindeer to be tended and coal to be mined (sadly, not all the children are on the &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; list). Candy canes and gingerbread houses are nice, but by working hard-and smartly-you and your team of elves may find yourselves on a beach drinking something with an umbrella in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A worker-placement game, taking place over 9 rounds, players use their elves to collect materials in order to build gifts, and tend to the reindeer.  Players may customize their workforce by sending elves to be trained in certain aspects of the game, which provide a benefit for the rest of the game.  For some gifts, plastic may be substituted for the standard materials of fabric, wood or metal. This will cause those gifts to score fewer &amp;quot;Christmas Cookies&amp;quot;, but may allow a player to build more gifts in a shorter amount of time.  This can be helpful when Santa comes  around 3 times during the game for an inspection, to see which team has made the most gifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have to decide when to visit the mail room in order to pick which gifts to build, and when to tend to the reindeer.  The reindeer accumulate points the longer they go untended - and each of the eight reindeer provides a unique bonus to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
