			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chomp! Chomp! Chomp! Sounds and sights of giant gnashing teeth, marching critters and musical notes of delight greet you from the screen as you are tracked by an army of hungry little critters.  To escape and score you must entice these critters into the crunching jaws of Hot Lips.  This megamouth eats anything (including you!), and you must b quick to avoid its teeth.  Various pitfalls and bonus scoring opportunities visually surprise and excite you as you become immersed in the strategy of this action-packed game.  The &amp;quot;critters&amp;quot; are outstanding graphically and provide a challenge for every game player.  Full hi-res graphics and exceptionally smooth continuous action make this a truly fun game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
