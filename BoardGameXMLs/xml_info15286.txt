			<description>Not related to the other Milton Bradley game of the same name, Tank Battle is one of the &amp;quot;Flipsiders&amp;quot; games that resembles an audio cassette until you &amp;quot;flip&amp;quot; the game open. The object is to destroy the other players tank. On a turn you spin the 2 spinners. Spinner A tells you how far you must move. Spinner B indicates how far you can fire. All firing must be done in a straight line (i.e. you can't shoot diagonally). If spinner B points to a number that is greater than the number of spaces between you and your opponent, you score a hit. Each tank has 7 hit points. Blow up your opponents tank to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
