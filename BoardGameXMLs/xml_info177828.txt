			<description>Cute old Dutch game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components in my edition:&lt;br/&gt;2 Spoons&lt;br/&gt;4 Balls&lt;br/&gt;Insert that acts as the board&lt;br/&gt;Rules inside lid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended for children and was designed to help children with their mathematical skills. Game 1 is for the youngest children. Game 2 is for slightly older children. Game 3 is intended for much older children, say, 8 to 10 year olds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is punctuated with holes and each hole has a value next to it. The cute spoons have a long handle and a 'bowl' into which you balance a ball. Hold the spoon over the board and blow the ball off. If the ball is in a hole, do the same with the 2nd ball. If, at any time, a ball does not roll into a hole, the player may blow it again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 1. Add the two numbers together after both balls are in holes. The highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 2: Start with a base total of 5. Add the value of the hole where the first ball lands. Subtract the value of the hole where the 2nd ball landed. Highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3: Use all 4 balls. Again, start with a base total of 5. The first ball's value multiplies the base score. The second ball is added to the running total. The third ball is subtracted from the running total and the 4th ball is divided into the running total after the third ball has been computed. Highest total achieved, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
