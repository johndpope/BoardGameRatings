			<description>Visions is a competitive game where the players collect cards that show clocks. They play the clocks to connect other cards via the hands of the clocks with their mental center. Those other cards represent different topics which belong to family Yates: ancestors, places where they lived, rooms where they used to be and their collection of jewels. While the players are visionary talented people, they try to help family Yates finding out what curse lies on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By connecting the family cards at the right time (represented by the clock cards) with their mental center the players gain victory points, visionary power and vision parts in different colors. Each player has got a vision card with a 3x3 pattern where they place the vision parts according to the rules. The players get victory points for full rows and columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players may use the visionary power to change it into benefits, for example reducing the cost to connect family cards with the mental center or getting additional vision parts.&lt;br/&gt;At a given time the player with the fewest victory points chooses a sort of visionary power and all benefits which are connected to this power will be more expensive for the rest of the game and all players have to deal with this limitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One family card lies at a special position and can't be connected directly with the mental center but it is possible to connect the card through the other family cards with the center to get the benefits and the chance to force other players to swap vision parts and/or visionary power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players also have to try to solve a master vision with the vision parts to get extra points and offer the best help for family Yates. Only the one with the most victory points is able to give them the chance to break the curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
