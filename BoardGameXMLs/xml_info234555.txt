It is a game that allows you to deepen the scale closer to the will of your group! It's very modular, it's very trimmed around your group needs, it's really a game that's around you. Do not you believe it? Look at our APs, we chose to play an hour a week and without any problems the adventures last exactly one hour without running over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 Deus Opera manages to host other players and absences! The feature of this game is that it works well even if there is no player, its lack of course will feel on the human side, but it's not a problem the story goes on and you can go back any time in the game! It also allows new players to enter the opera without worsening the experience that it actually earns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you purchase Deus Opera, you will also get an extraordinary game for lovers of this kind: &amp;quot;Forest Keeper Space Adventures&amp;quot; is a variation of the Experience Engine dedicated to &amp;quot;Star Spades&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Nature Forwarding Path&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
