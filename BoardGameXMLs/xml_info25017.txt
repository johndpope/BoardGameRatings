			<description>MOJO ... 3 in-a-row with a twist of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns and one at a time, players put their 3 pieces and pawn on the 3x3 grid board - then, continue by moving any piece or their own pawn to the adjacent empty space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may not move the opponent's pawn - which is used as a blocker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces and pawns may not jump over each other and the last piece moved may not be returned to its previous position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first with their 3 color pieces in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOJO TOO ... similar in principle, played with 3 pieces each and a single neutral pawn that is common to and may be moved by both players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with the pawn in the center of the board and during play, there is a choice of 2 empty spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOJO 2 ... played, as Mojo and Mojo Too, for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing pieces are original, with individual opposite ends numbered similar to regular dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It takes all 3 pieces of a color to make up a single die ... but dice they're not!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are placed on the board either end up and always inverted when moved - thereby constantly changing the score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be played for a certain number of rounds or to an agreed points total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pips on the tops of the pieces in a winning row are added up - the winner is the first to reach the set score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this way, the best of 5 rounds may be 2 - on points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
