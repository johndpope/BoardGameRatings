			<description>In Eloping, each player has three prospective grooms, a prospective bride, a prospective mother-in-law, a plane and a train piece. Players attempt to move a groom to another player's home space to gain a bride and form a couple. The couple must then visit the Town Hall to obtain a marriage license, than obtain a corsage and a ring before proceeding to the Justice of the Peace (JP) space. Two other people (prospective grooms or the mother-in-law piece) must also join the couple at the JP to act as witnesses. The first player to bring the required four player pieces as well as the corsage, and ring to the JP is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A plane and a train are available to each player. These pieces move a greater distance than a player piece may normally travel, but are subject to other restrictions (e.g., only moves on a roll of 5, must move to another unoccupied airport/train station space, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An optional rule lets a player use the mother-in-law piece to block a couple containing that player's bride piece. The couple may only move past the mother-in-law on a restricted set of die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are at least two printings of this game. The more deluxe printing uses a mock-velvet box lining and elastic bands to hold the player pieces, plus contains a setup sheet (printed with an interesting 3-D effect) that described various moves in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
