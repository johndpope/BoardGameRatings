			<description>A dominoes game for 1 to 4 players, on the theme of road traffic, by the author of the 1000 bornes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is placed flat and serves as a model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;contiguous&amp;quot; fragment is a fragment extending properly, either in the longitudinal direction or in the width direction, the image portion represented by the fragments or neighbors. Two neighboring fragments only by the edges should not be considered contiguous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; fragment is one that involves a road user committing a careless or a contravention of the rules of the road. These fragments are shaded and numbered on the image model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mix all the fragments of the game, then share them with partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player chooses a piece and places. If he has a fragment neighbor, he also raises, etc. Each fragment must be placed with the previous close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player selected a fragment close to the last set by the previous player, and the pose. He can continue, if another fragment placed next to last, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is in the game, a hole (empty space on all sides by fragments), or a slot (slot in the periphery of the image), it is possible to plug this hole or that niche instead of asking a neighbor of the last fragment. Every time a player mouth hole or a slot, he can play again and where he wants to continue to ask neighboring fragments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can pass. If all players pass, the one whose turn to play may be a fragment anywhere near a fragment already made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first who got rid of all its fragments. The other players count how many they have left fragments. The &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; fragments are worth 4 points unless the player may explain the mistake, In this case, it counts two points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
