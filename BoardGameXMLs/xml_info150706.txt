			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spellbook Games is proud to announce the release of &amp;lsquo;Portal to Adventure,&amp;rsquo; a classic fantasy role-playing game system.  &amp;lsquo;Portal to Adventure&amp;rsquo; provides the essential rules and background material needed to run a fantasy campaign, and emphasizes playability, without overburdening either Player or Games Master.  The rules system hearkens back to the early days of role playing, when the game was about exploring, quests, mysteries, treasures, and heroic deeds, not about facilitating character concepts. &amp;lsquo;Portal to Adventure&amp;rsquo; is a minimal-rule system that provides the Games Master a framework and tool kit with which to build their campaign.  &amp;lsquo;Portal&amp;rsquo; is intentionally constructed with limited details, much like the classic games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule set includes four Races and seven Character Classes, including several warrior-classes, spellcasting Mages, and Priests.  Character classes can come from any race, and the choice of race has both benefits and drawbacks.  Specialization among spellcasters is based on the elements, and both monotheistic and polytheistic deities are described for Priests.  &amp;lsquo;Portal&amp;rsquo; features a unique approach to magic that allows for innate power differences among spellcasters without overpowering the other adventuring Classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides everything a Games Master needs to run a campaign in a single reference book: rules for Players, rules for Games Masters, spell and prayer lists, information on enchanted items, and a bestiary of fantastic creatures.  114 Pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
