							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grand Bazaar</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost every larger city has one...a Grand Bazaar! This supplement spells out a large group of booths available at a standard open market. Three different sizes of marketplaces have also been included for various metropolitian areas. While this product isn't an adventure it doesn't mean that information FOR adventures can't be located here...This supplement was designed with role players in mind that enjoy the banter!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting was designed for the Filbar 5th edition but can be used in any campaign with any ruleset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
