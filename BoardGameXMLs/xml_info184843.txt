							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cultists &amp; Cthulhu</name>
									
			<description>It's hard being a cult leader. Your underlings are incompetent, madness is eminent and a good sacrifice is hard to find. If you can avoid your competitors tricks and stave off insanity maybe the stars will align and you will summon an old one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cultists &amp;amp; Cthulhu is an fast, humorous, &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; style card game in which you want to complete the Ritual card in front of you. The card has both a Success value and a Ritual value; using Cultists cards, you roll dice to try to meet or exceed the Success value. When you do, you collect the Ritual (and the points). The first player to complete 21 points worth of Rituals is the winner.  Sacrifices, Books and other  cards can add to your roll, while Tentacle, Insanity, and other cards can take away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
