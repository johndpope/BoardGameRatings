							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Azenomei</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Azenomei is situated on the banks of the wide and meandering River Scaum at its juncture with the Xzan River, which arrives at a gentle angle from the northeast. Together these lively watercourses now form the Scaum Major as it is locally known, and this greater flow continues westwards towards Kaiin and the ocean. The buildings of Azenomei are situated on gentle terraces on the north side of the Scaum, and along the south bank on land that slopes more sedately upwards away from the river. These exquisitely gabled structures are, by and large, rambling fabrications of  historical origins and notable style. In short, they have survived from a time when artistry was prized in great building works, and when longevity was considered intrinsic in reputable construction practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
