			<description>Can you be the Archmage&amp;rsquo;s favourite by conjuring the most powerful mythical creatures? Use their unique abilities to bolster your magical powers or hinder your enemies in this game of luck, strategy, magic, and creatures of legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trick or Treat sees 30 brand new cards that focus on &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; mechanics and the addition of Gloom creatures. It also contains all the reworked and play tested Halloween expansion cards, which were requested the fans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gloom cards are a deck of cards which are shuffled and three are dealt to the table. Anyone can Conjure these cards and use them to their advantage. Each one has powerful endgame changing effects - some modify the VP of Burned creatures while others have wholly more malevolent powers designed to allow you to put those Archmage cards to good use! But be warned, the power of Gloom is powerful and unpredictable and it can easily be a double-edged sword. Gloom magic is recommended for advanced Ember players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creatures you collect will allow you to mitigate the &amp;ldquo;luck of the draw&amp;rdquo; and to further your chances of conjuring more powerful creatures (by drawing more cards that you need or stripping your enemies of their creatures' powers). Trick or Treat capitalizes on that giving you even more chances to attack your enemies, to weaken their creatures and to strengthen your hold over the game. It's all out war in the Halloween expansion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     It's got a slew of new art by a fabulous all-female art team.&lt;br/&gt;     It's all about the endgame. Now you can really shake things up with a single Archmage card.&lt;br/&gt;     It makes the final score that bit more uncertain. Now you can manipulate the final VPs of Burned creatures. If that wasn't enough, some of the new creatures are reactionary: when a player does something - you get to do something. It means you can wield absolute power in each game, BUT you might pay a high price for such blatant use of magic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
