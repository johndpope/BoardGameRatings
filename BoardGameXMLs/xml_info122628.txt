			<description>All Zombies Must Die!, the spiritual successor to Burn Zombie Burn!, is an Arcade- RPG where killing as many zombies as possible is top of the to-do list. The fate of humanity &amp;ndash; or at least the small town of Deadhill &amp;ndash; rests in the hands of four unlikely heroes: Jack, the gamer; Rachel, the girl; Brian, the geek; and Luxo, the alien. Go it alone, or enlist the services of up to three like-minded chums to survive the zombie apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTENSE ZOMBIE-SLAYING ACTION!&lt;br/&gt;Reload your shotgun, sharpen your sword and rev that chainsaw; the town is teeming with zombies, and it&amp;rsquo;s your job to put &amp;lsquo;em down! All Zombies Must Die! fuses many gameplay elements to create a frenetic RPG shooter with hilarious characters and a playful, self-referential narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TWIN-STICK SHOOTING MEETS RPG!&lt;br/&gt;Level up characters, complete side quests and collect items to craft new weapons. With a host of role-playing features, there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of options in how you choose to dispose of the undead. Zombies come in varying shapes and sizes, and are affected by four environmental modifiers; fire, radiation, sonic and shock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOUR PLAYER CO-OP!&lt;br/&gt;Surviving against a seemingly endless horde of zombies is always easier with a friend or two &amp;ndash; or better yet: three. With four player local co-op, All Zombies Must Die! offers a frantic multiplayer experience that incites excitement on and off the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
