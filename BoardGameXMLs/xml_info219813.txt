			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How can you add more action and conflict to your story of discovery?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Design Volume 17 - In a revelation plot something is discovered that has serious implications for the protagonist. It may mean also have a serious impact on a supporting character, or the world. The actual discover could be something good or something bad, but it is startling and disruptive to the status quo. The focus of a revelation plot isn&amp;rsquo;t about the discovery itself, but how the protagonist handles what it implies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of the revelation plot include Anathem, Contact, The Dispossessed, Jurassic Park, and The Sparrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story Design: The Revelation covers all of the elements you need to prepare in order to tell a story of discovery. It's based on concepts explored in Story Structure for Writers and Roleplayers, also published by Dancing Light Press. It's a big book that goes into greater detail on how to get the most out of the three-act structure, as well as developing a three-phase series (campaign, if you prefer) with a clear beginning, middle, and end. If you want to use your favorite roleplaying game system to tell stories with more depth than kill monster, get treasure, repeat (not that there's anything wrong with that), it is worth looking into.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
