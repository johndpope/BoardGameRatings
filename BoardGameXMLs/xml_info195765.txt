			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your party has finally made it to Queen&amp;rsquo;s Point only to discover that the military was already aware of the approaching humanoid army and dealt with them. After a rest and training period in the large city you now have to decide what to do next. The large seaport has plenty of options but a curious problem has been brought to your attention. A large giant north and west of the city is harassing the shipping lanes with random boulder tossing. Word has it that a nice reward is available to anyone able to solve this problem. Did I mention a Medusa also has a proposition for the party?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Provincia Campaign for a group of 4-6 adventurers that are level 4-6.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
