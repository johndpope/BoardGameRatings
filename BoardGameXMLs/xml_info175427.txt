The players take turns, selects one of the three cards on the board, and then tries to collect this by playing one character card. The strongest character gets the card. It is good to have strong characters, but some of the gives minus points if in hand then a round is completed, eg. Satan (-20 victory points)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards collected can be put together to complete a story.
