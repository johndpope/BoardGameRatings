							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tower</name>
									
			<description>Each player grabs eight cubes with variously colored faces and sets them on the table before them, &amp;rdquo;silly-face&amp;rdquo; sides facing up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player grabs the tower, flips it upside down, gives it a shake, and then places it back on the table. Eight colored balls immediately fall down into the tube in a random order. As soon as the eighth ball lands on the top, the game begins and the race is on. Players start flipping and stacking their cubes to perfectly match the order of colors in the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must be careful, however, as each cube holds a different combination of colors. The color needed once a player gets to the top might be lost in the cubes down below&amp;mdash;the player will then have to take it all down, rearrange their cubes, and stack it all over again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to stack his or her cubes and perfectly match the tower wins the round. The first player to win three rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
