							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Two Knights from Carcassonne</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is a relatively straightforward one suitable for any number of characters, whether starting their first career or completing advanced ones. Although skill and numbers will certainly help, success is dependent on investigation to discover what happened in the past to bring about the current problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the scenario begins, the characters are travelling through Bretonnia. Perhaps they are delivering a message for a noble patron or wealthy merchant, with a bonus offered for swift delivery. The reason doesn't really matter and can be tailored to suit the group and their previous exploits; all that matters is they have enough reason to hurry to decide to take a shortcut down the Forest Road. If the player characters are just starting out, or have no reason to make this journey quickly they should take the job detailed in the section A Simple Delivery to the right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
