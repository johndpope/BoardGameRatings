			<description>From rules summary:  Plan.It is a planetary puzzle game where players take turns rotating and placing planet tiles to match as many like planets as possible.  The main components of the game are 45 unique planet tiles that contain 1/2 of a planet on each of the 6 sides.  The tile distribution ranges from having all sides represent the same planet to having up to 6 different planets represented.   Players are randomly assigned exclusive planets that they need to score points for.  On their turn, they will first perform a preliminary action in which they place or rotate a tile.  Next, they perform a primary action by placing a tile and calculating the resulting score.  The scores increase exponentially as more planets are matched at one time.  Players discard one card at the end of their turn and then draw back up to the hand limit (3 for 2-4 players, 4 for solitaire).  The game ends when the planet tile draw deck is exhausted.  Players calculate their score by multiplying the score of their lowest scoring planet by 3 and then adding that to the score of their highest scoring planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
