			<description>In Realm, four tribes inhabit a land of chaos and turmoil. It is a land of war, shifting alliances, capture, and rescue as each tribe struggles for supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, played on a Checkers board, pieces never leave the board. Pieces should be double sided with a pawn on one side and king on the other. Pieces move as in Checkers; kings one space diagonally in any direction and pawns one space forward.&lt;br/&gt;If you can, you must jump. A jumped piece is tucked under the jumping piece. When a pile is jumped, the top piece is tucked under the jumping piece, leaving the rest of the jumped pile intact.&lt;br/&gt;If a player has no moves on their turn (ie none of their pieces are on top of any piles), their turn is skipped until one of their pieces is uncovered (through other players jumping).&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to have only your own pieces on top of every pile. Once each pile is topped by pieces of a single color, the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realms draws influence from Laska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
