							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirate Dice: Rough Waters Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This expansion adds 2 double-sided maps to expand your sailing horizons, as well as rules for a fifth player (included on the reverse side of the Rough Waters rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great Horn: A long hook that bottlenecks navigation -- especially around map layouts with corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cape of Lost Hope: A more difficult version of Great Horn that removes a center island, but adds some wind and waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maelstrom: Arrr!  What a tempest!  This highly directional map will add some serious challenge to pilots who wish to navigate its waters -- especially if you're trying to tack against the wind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King of the Sea -- Place a treasure-marker in the bottom-right corner, and have a whole new challenge to navigate!  Players must use ingenuity and opportunity in order to race to the corner of the map, and whoever is able to stay afloat will be crowned King of the Sea!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
