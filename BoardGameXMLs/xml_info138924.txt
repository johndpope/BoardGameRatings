							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mutable Deceptions, Vol. 1: Jazz Age Newspapers</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's product summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutable Deceptions, Volume 1 is a commercial prop resource that we have released to help gamers with the perennial problem of making their own realistic-looking 1920s or 1930s newspaper props. Many games &amp;mdash; Lovecraftian roleplaying games in particular &amp;mdash; place a heavy emphasis on newspaper clippings as clues, but making ones that look authentic is actually pretty hard. The templates that come with Mutable Deceptions make the job much easier: all you need to do is pick one of the 14 differently sized/shaped/formatted templates, open it up in Adobe Reader and type your own text in for the headlines, bylines and article body. You can even do some substantial formatting of the article body to squeeze text together or space it apart so that your text fits into the template field just right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
