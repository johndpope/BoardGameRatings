							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wyrd: Land of Lore</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lands of Nevermore: The Wyrd is a domain where illusion and reality meld together in a surreal existence, where the fantastic and impossible are not only possible but prevalent. The spirits of the Unseelie fey that drowned at the beginning of the Forgotten Age still haunt the landscape seeking revenge upon all who are unfortunate enough to cross their path. In addition to these vengeful spirits, the domain of the Wyrd has the more subtle peril of seduction. This land tempts mortals to spend their lives fulfilling their every wish and many have lost themselves within the Wyrd for years, decades, and even centuries before returning to the Mortal World, while some are never seen again. Wonder and enchantment populate this surreal domain and fill it with unpredictable opportunities and dangers of fantastic adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevermore is an ever-changing world where reason fades into myth and imagination. Featured in Green Ronin&amp;rsquo;s True 20 Worlds of Adventure, it offers a plethora of possible and even improbable adventures for those who traverse its strange domains. Nevermore amplifies and accentuates, twists and skews, it is a place where nothing remains the same for long and all who walk its lands, fey or mortal alike, are changed forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
