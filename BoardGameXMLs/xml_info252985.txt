			<description>Welcome to Legendary, the Marvel Deck-Building Game! Evil Masterminds like Loki and Red Skull lead a horde of powerful Super Villains, planning dark Schemes to destroy the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Only you can stop them, leading awesome Marvel Super Heroes like Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game for 1-5 players, each player starts with their own deck of basic Hero cards. At the start of your turn, you play the top card of the Villain Deck, showing how Villains invade the city, capture Bystanders, and create special events. Then you play Hero cards from your hand to generate Attack, Recruit Points, and special abilities. You attack with your Heroes to defeat Villains. You use Recruit Points to recruit better Heroes to add to your deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile to make a new deck, including all the new Heroes you recruited. This way your deck gets stronger and stronger over time. Build up enough Power and you can defeat the evil Mastermind! But be careful: if the players don&amp;rsquo;t defeat the Mastermind quickly enough, then the Mastermind will complete their dark Scheme and win the game for evil!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Avengers are back in a new setting with images straight from the Phase 1 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Black Widow, Iron Man, Captain America and more face off against the Villains of the first six movies. Three Masterminds including the all new Iron Monger and his Iron Foes try to complete their evil schemes. This nearly 400 card sets comes with a full color rulebook and an updated playmat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
