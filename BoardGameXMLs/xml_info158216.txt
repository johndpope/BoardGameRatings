							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tomb of the Winter Queen</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her name is forgotten, and her tomb was too, until robbers, seeking ancient treasures, broke into the grave of the long-dead Barbarian Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The snow-covered ruins once concealed the entrance to the tomb, but now grave robbers have broken the seal and entered the subterranean mausoleum. They had success in some rooms, breaking doors into the root-cracked chambers. However, the iron doors to the Queen's chamber remain unviolated. What happened to the robbers? What prevented them obtaining the most valuable treasures? Find out!&lt;br/&gt; Tomb of the Winter Queen is a printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. It can be used as a standalone gameboard, or combined with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomb of the Winter Queen is a multiple level map, comprising 2 10x20 square battlemaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a set of 300dpi full size jpgs, for poster printing or VTT, in both gridded and non-gridded versions.
