As you attempt to make contact with the rest of the team, the WATCHTOWER is attacked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seconds before communications went dark, a partial message was intercepted from the plant APOKALIPS. The sourct of the message can mean only one thing - DARKSEID.&lt;br/&gt;The details are vague, but the message was clear; DARKSEID calls for the destruction of the JLA. Cut off from the rest of the team, you rush out in search of the JLA's most nefarious villains in order to stop DARKSEID's evil plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel through the game board collecting information on DARKSEID's master plan.

Return the villains to your BASE CAMP for information to help you foil DARKSEID's sinister plot. The first person to complete their SCORE CARD by Acquiring 4 unique VILLAIN TOKENS and return them to their BASE CAMP is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
