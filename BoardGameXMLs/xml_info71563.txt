			<description>Translated from the game's official web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noir is an award-winning dystopic role-playing game written by two veterans in Swedish RPG development: Marco Behrmann and Petter Nallo. They have 30 years of role playing games and have been in the teams developing Eon, NeoTech and Viking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a time of worldly deterioration, mysteries, violence and dark erotics. The scenes is the multi-million city of Dandukar, the heart of the huge Empire. It's a place for hard-boiled men, dangerous women and fallen heroes&amp;mdash;individuals who create their own rules and who show what is right and wrong through their actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a journey into a living where strong and destructive emotions like desire, aggression and vengefulness rule the dark streets. Egoism, greed and vanity fight against forgotten values like love, justice and generosity. In the ministries of the State, the faceless bureaucrats rule with contradictional forms and regulations. In the party suites, the rich plan new conspiracies and intrigues to increase their power and wealth. On the streets, the simple citizen fight against brutal gangsters, corrupt police and sadistic employers, in a constant battle to see tomorrow's sun rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a time for involuntary heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
