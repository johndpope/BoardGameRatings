			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kaigaku brings dramatic samurai action back to your tabletop! It's based on the innovative Black Hack rules set originally created by David Black. This game is easy to learn and you can get a party of characters created and a game started in just minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a mighty bushi, a devious courtier, a stealthy ninja or a powerful ascetic martial artist and defend the realm of Kaigaku from threats of monsters, foreign invasion and internal strife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents you with a fully fleshed-out game setting that's detailed enough to jumpstart your imagintation but light enough so you can make the stories that you want to tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customize your characters with their own  skills and samurai school abilities to help them stand apart from the rest and to  have the power they need to defeat their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can check out the free version of Kaigaku before you purchase the premium version. The differences are that the free version has only 8 ryu (samurai schools) compared to the 26 in the premium book, plus less setting material. The premium version is professionally edited, has a better layout and gorgeous artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
