			<description>This game exists out of 2 books (an expansion of 2 other books came as well). You place the book in the electronic device &amp;quot;computer&amp;quot; and put in the code of the page you want to play. Now you get trivia questions about the subject on the page of the book. This game can be played with two as well as alone. The electronic device is there, just to see whether you gave the right answer and to remember your scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
