			<description>Superfight: The Hero Machine Deck &amp;mdash; an expansion for the Superfight party game in which players pit unusual characters with superpowers and superweaknesses against one another &amp;mdash; adds one hundred new cards to your Superfight game that take your available characters in a whole new direction. The cards are split into three decks. Each deck contains words that combine to create a character. When a player plays a &amp;quot;TO THE HERO MACHINE&amp;quot; card, he or she chooses one card from each Hero Machine deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Deck 1 contains words like: Super, Giant, Flying, Retired, Flaming, Mutant&lt;br/&gt;    Deck 2 contains words like: Monkey, Zombie, Girlfriend, Dino, Bat, Hero, Sumo&lt;br/&gt;    Deck 3 contains words like: Assassin, Swarm, Babies, Cyborg, Army, Duo, Love Triangle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose one card from each deck, and place them in order to generate combinations such as &amp;quot;Flying Girlfriend Army&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Giant Zombie Babies&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Retired Dino Love Triangle&amp;quot;. This is a powerful and very funny deck, and will add thousands of possible characters to your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
