			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place after the Dungeon of Leche: Search for the Golden Cow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the war of the First Kingdom the normally timorous mice elected to side with humanity against the demons (the human mastery of cheese was instrumental in winning over the mice). While the rats remained neutral in the war, when they learned of the rewards offered to the heroes of the war by the gods, they demanded their cut. In response, the cats mocked the rats, offering them the spilled milk left from their magical milk feast (courtesy of their golden cows). Enraged by this, the rats rushed to attack only to be driven away by the roars of the great cats. These rats fled into the dark and hidden places and plotted their vengeance over the centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seemed their hunger for vengeance would be satisfied: learning of the location of the last golden cow, the rats endeavored to destroy it. However, they were left hungry by brave heroes who recovered the last golden cow from the Dungeon of Leche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thwarted, but refusing to give up, the rats intend to attempt one last gambit: according to the decree of the gods, the golden cow must be returned to the temple where it was originally housed and only then will it give birth to golden calves. To prevent this from happening, the rats long ago took over the abandoned temple and stole the altar from it. It is up to the finders of the golden cow to reclaim the Temple of the Cats from the wretched rats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Temple of Rats is a Pathfinder Role Playing Game compatible adventure. It is a humorous adventure intended for a party of 10th-12th level and follows the Dungeon of Leche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some of the features of the adventure:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A rodent themed dungeon crawl with lots of rats.&lt;br/&gt;     Ben AND Willard.&lt;br/&gt;     A humorous adventure that still provides serious play.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed maps for the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;     New monsters (Rat, Ridiculously Sized and Rat OMFGR).&lt;br/&gt;     Developed NPCs with backstories that can be role-played or ignored by roll players.&lt;br/&gt;     Full statistics are included for all encounters&amp;mdash;no need to look up monsters.&lt;br/&gt;     Robust opportunities for puns, jokes and combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Disease. Lots of disease. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
