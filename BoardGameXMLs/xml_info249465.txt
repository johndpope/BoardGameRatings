			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descended from a long line of superhumans, their power accumulating with each generation, until it was suddenly lost by the lack of a suitable heir. In time, the noble and benevolent teachings of these beings was lost and the power was nothing more than a fanciful tale told among the poverty stricken and struggling family. When the power was found once more - greater than ever - its recipient was far from the long dead heroic figures. Now LEGACY is out to make up for his lifetime of suffering and will make the world into one more to his liking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
