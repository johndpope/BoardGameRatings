			<description>A children's card game about colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 52-card deck has 11 cards each for the primary colors red, yellow, and blue; 6 each for the secondary colors orange, green and purple; and 1 joker which can stand for any secondary color.  Each card has a picture and phrase for the color, e.g. &amp;quot;The Blue Bike&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Santa Wears a Red Suit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Taste a Juicy Purple Plum&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal all the cards out.  Starting at the dealer's left, a player leads a primary color and calls (for example) &amp;quot;Blue Snip&amp;quot;; the next player follows with a different primary and calls &amp;quot;Yellow Snap&amp;quot;; the next player plays the secondary color that combines them and calls &amp;quot;Blue and Yellow makes Green Mixem&amp;quot;.  The one who completes the set lays it aside and leads to the next one.  (It's unstated, but presumably a player who cannot play correctly passes.)  The first player out of cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
