			<description>Diamond Mining -&lt;br/&gt;Adamas (Greek)&lt;br/&gt;Adamant, inflexible; used by Greek and Latin writers for a stone (as a diamond) of&lt;br/&gt;impenetrable hardness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game.&lt;br/&gt;To produce a thriving Mining Company and collect cash and assets in the amount of $500,000 starting with just $30,000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls an area where their claims are placed in hopes of hitting an actual mine.  From there they turn Raw diamonds into Cut Diamonds (via a processing plant), and sell the cut diamonds to the general public at a premium price (via a distributor),  All the while trying to control and manipulate the world and national markets for both Raw and Cut Diamonds.  Simple mechanic, a little luck and a lot of strategy, could make you the next Diamond tycoon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks goes to The Game Crafters for having an awesome Idea and business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            NOTE on 11-12-2009***&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have taken this off of The Game Crafter site as I feel the production quality for this game is just not where I want it to be.  I am currently looking into another source for publishing.  Wish me luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
