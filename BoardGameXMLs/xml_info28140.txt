			<description>(Translated from the box, in Norwegian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: the Kristiand Zoo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tapi? Wilderbeast? Komodo dragon? Learn about animals from all over the world in this fun game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gamers are to visit animals around the world on a mission from the zoo. Participants will have to answer questions, mime and challenge the other players in duels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start with a mission card and have to visit 3 different continents. On each continent you visit you have to bring back a picture as evidence of your visit. Visit the lion in Africa, the tiger python in Asia and the alligator in America. There are also harmless animals around the world like pandas, sleuths and squirrel monkeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will probably get the most headache from the kind, but very stubborn donkey you may meet. You better have brought a carrot as a bribe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first gets back to the zoo with 3 different animals from 3 different continents wins the game! Have you learned anything of the animals you have visited?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
