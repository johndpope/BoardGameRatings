			<description>Bible Wars: the board game, takes the tactical level Bible Wars Card Game to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features the same 6 cultures on a strategic map of the Holy Lands.  In the game each culture is trying to capture and hold onto 18 territories to win but, it's not easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player each turn is randomly determined. Combat is determined, not only by who has the most armies, but by terrain and the playing of cultural army cards.  The cards give each side an advantage to add to their die roll. Combat can continue several rounds until the attacked retreats or the defender is eliminated. There is no retreat for the defender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cultural advantages include Egyptian Chariots, Philistine Giants, Babylonian War Elephants, Israeli Heavenly Interventions, Canaanite Additional Local Forces, and Assyrian Professional Units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
