			<description>The desert plague is spreading from the East: a reminder of a destructive past.  Man has evolved since the wars of old, creating new ways to combat this deadly expanse.  Using Steel and Steam, man fights this terror, as well as the monsters that spawn from its touch.  Now covering half the continent of Terra Corpus, the desert&amp;rsquo;s slow and steady hunger is threatening to consume and corrupt all life in the world.  Some of the desperate seek out legends of the past: elemental guardians said to sleep inside the planet.  Once resurrected, these powerful beings can be controlled, and guided to stop the desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legends speak of a chosen few who have the ability to tame these elemental beings and reshape the world.  Our story begins with one such person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
