			<description>TRUMPsh*t crazy, is a card game in the vein of Cards Against Humanity. Or in this case Cards Against Politics, Civility, Decency, Political Correctness, Feminism, Human Rights, Civil Rights, Peace and whatever else he spouts forth, generally the complete opposite of what is socially acceptable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have taken a wide, varied and often horrifying selection of quotes from the great pumpkin candidate and you get to use them to postulate views in his dulcet and sometimes vitriolic verbal tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw 8 red &amp;quot;quote&amp;quot; cards and a player draws and reads out a blue &amp;quot;ask&amp;quot; card. The other players pick their funniest or inappropriate or topical card and hand it to the reader whoc picks the winner. The person with the most blue &amp;quot;ask&amp;quot; cards wins. Play to a timer or till all the cards are gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;120 &amp;quot;ask&amp;quot; cards and 240 &amp;quot;quote&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
