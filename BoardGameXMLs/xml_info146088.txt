			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disaster Strikes! is a game for 4-6 players about ordinary people caught up in a major disaster, and their struggle to save &lt;br/&gt;themselves, their loved ones and innocent Bystanders from death or worse. It aims to mimic movies like The Towering Inferno, &lt;br/&gt;Volcano! and Aliens. You&amp;rsquo;ll foreshadow the threat, escalate it almost to the point of total catastrophe, and see who can get out alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of the story are the Protagonists, characters of unusual competence, bravery and heroism. Only they stand between the threat and many innocent Bystanders. If they can&amp;rsquo;t save them, nobody else will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes about 4 hours to play and the only preparation is reading this book. You will need playing cards, some tokens or &lt;br/&gt;coins and some paper to make notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
