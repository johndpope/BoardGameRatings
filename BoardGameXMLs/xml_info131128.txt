			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deduction-style party game for 3&amp;ndash;8 players based on characters and situations from Shrine Maiden fame. Based on Shadow Hunters&lt;br/&gt;Players are all dealt characters with different set goals, and try to accomplish these goals during the game. Part of the idea is not to have your identity revealed, but throughout the games, depending on how players move, they may get clues as to who you are. Getting revealed is dangerous, as people will be able to attack you, but even if you're defeated, if your team wins, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On september 1st 2012, Yasutaka Ikeda, designer of Shadow Hunters accused Ayu-ya for simply copying his game. Ayu-ya agreed and the game was withdrawn two days later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
