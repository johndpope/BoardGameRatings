							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">d100 System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The d100 System uses a single core mechanism for all action resolutions.  It originated with a set of house rules for Stormbringer but diverged widely into a generic, universal system capable of supporting any genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have eight Statistics (attributes) including Strength, Constitution, Size, Dexterity, Intelligence, Power, Charisma, and Sanity.  Scores can be generated randomly or purchased from a point pool, and will run from 1-100.  Statistics are then modified for character Race (Elf, Dwarf, Halfing, Half Orc, Half Elf, Orc, Troll, or Human).  Characters have seven Derived Statistics.  Characters have Racial Abilities and select a Career Path which provides access to Skills.  Combat utilizes a variety of random tables to determine effects, including fumbles and criticals.  Combat supports a wide variety of special maneuvers.  The game includes a developed magic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game usually is distributed with two PDF character sheets--a fantasy/generic sheet, and a modern sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
