							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planet X</name>
									
			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;In a future, closer than you may think, you control a lone space traveler, who is lost on a small planet in our solar system, far away from the sun, beyond Pluto. Some people debate whether this is a planet or not...at the moment you don't care, you need to find a way to get home since your spaceship has broken down.&lt;br/&gt;On Planet X, you have found numerous of ancient alien artifact teleport gates that lead to different places on the planet. &lt;br/&gt;The purpose and structure behind them is lost in eternity, but somewhere on Planet X there is supposed to be a big portal leading to the space station TERRA 42, that is orbiting earth. &lt;br/&gt;This is what you were sent here to find, since a strange connection to some portal here have been detected on TERRA 42. &lt;br/&gt;All you have to aid you in your search is your platform generator, your space suit and your feet. &lt;br/&gt;Good luck! &lt;br/&gt;Planet X is a retro style 2D, side scrolling platform game where you get to place your own platforms on the fly as you play. &lt;br/&gt;40 levels, all in 3 play modes, increasingly challenging, awaits you as you explore deeper and deeper into the planet. &lt;br/&gt;Try to beat the levels, to beat them as fast as you can or using as few platforms as possible. &lt;br/&gt;And challenge your friends to beat you on the high score lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
