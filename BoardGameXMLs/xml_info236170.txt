			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numenera Discovery will be a book that covers familiar territory; it is basically a revision of Numenera. Next summer, we will allow the original corebook to go out of print, and Numenera Discovery will take its place. In Numenera Discovery, you&amp;rsquo;ll get some revisions to make things clearer and more fun, and to increase the options available to players. Nanos, Jacks, and Glaives will get an overhaul. Many foci and some of the descriptors might see some reworking. You&amp;rsquo;ll have more options, clearer rules, and perhaps a bit of expansion to the regions of the Steadfast and the Beyond that are covered in the existing corebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
