							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterball: Team Swords of Damocles Arena â€“ Olympus</name>
									
			<description>The Octagon and Hexagon of the Olympus Arena in the Elliniki Historiplex are decorated with motifs and architecture of ancient Greece. The Swords of Damocles are rarely defeated in their home pits, thanks to the extra goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Olympus is an arena board for Slaughterball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Rules:&lt;br/&gt;Each Olympus pit has double the number of goals, making it easier for all teams to score points. But the razors of the Swords of Damocles are best-positioned to exploit this benefit, and games here are often very high-scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the goals start closed as normal, but since you only have four closed goal tokens, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use some other markers (Onslaught tokens perhaps) to indicate that the extra goals are closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
