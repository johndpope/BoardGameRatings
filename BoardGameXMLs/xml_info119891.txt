			<description>Dokapon: Monster Hunter, known in Japan as Dokapon Q: Monster Hunter (ドカポンQ モンスターハンター?) and known in Europe as Dokapon: Monster Hunter! is a 2001 role-playing video game video game developed and published by Asmik Ace Entertainment for the Game Boy Advance in Japan on August 3, 2001. It was later published in North America by AIA on November 30, 2001, and in Europe by Ubisoft on June 21, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dokapon takes place on Dokkano Island, in the town of Poponga. The goal of the game is to become a licensed adventurer - to do this, the player must pass an adventurer's exam by completing a number of assigned missions, which requires the player to defeat many monsters in battle. Once weakened, the player can collect the monster and use it in future battles to defeat opponents, as with other games such as Pokemon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to complete tasks that are given to the player. Dungeons are randomly generated each time the player enters them. Staircases allow the player to move between floors in the dungeons. Within the dungeons are scattered items, weapons, and shields which may be used or sold once the dungeon is completed. Aside from the treasures are monsters. Some will chase you, some will wander freely, some run from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dokapon: Monster Hunter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
