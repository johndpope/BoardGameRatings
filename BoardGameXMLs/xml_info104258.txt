			<description>Million is a tabletop game of futuristic combat between fighters in high-tech combat armor. It was published in 2001 in the French gaming magazine Backstab, issue #35.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a square playing surface of one meter length. The magazine provides counters for the playing pieces and scenery, but players are advised to build their own scenery and use plastic or metal miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player first builds a combat armor using a set number of points, buying systems in each of three categories (Mobility, Offence and Defense). Each of these systems is represented by a counter. These counters also represent the armor's &amp;quot;hit points&amp;quot;: once a player runs out of counters, the armor is considered to be too badly damaged and the player is off the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player then makes three piles of face-down counters (one for each system), put her figure in one corner and play begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, each player secretly chooses two of three systems to activate (Mobility and Offence for example). Players then reveal their choices, draw enough counters from their activated systems to replenish their hand to five counters, and roll a d10 for initiative (players can expend counters to gain a bonus on the initiative roll). Each player then take an action, alternating between players until there are no possible actions left or each player passes, at which point another turn begins. Each player can take a move action and a shoot action each turn, and also play counters as an action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage is resolved by rolling on a damage table with a lot of different results (loss of counters, fighter pushed back and/or stunned...). The last fighter standing wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
