			<description>Dodge, shoot and explode across the Solar System as a crew of intelligent and dangerous chickens. As the pilot of The Golden Eagle, it's your duty to keep Colonel Ram and Professor Bez safe as they squabble about ethics and who last used the toilet. Wage war against humanity as you battle your way towards the Sun to complete your mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll manage this task with burning plasma, smoking bullet cartridges, and daring maneuvers through asteroid belts. Some may discover a profound message, while others will be content with sidling harmfully across this horizontal vision of the future that comes handily embalmed with explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
