			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Ninja Tricks introduces twenty new ninja tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Assassin Assassin - The ninja's training grants her bonuses when dealing with others of the Dexterous-killing-machine profession.&lt;br/&gt;     Aster Master - The ninja can get Weapon Specialization for shuriken.&lt;br/&gt;     Blazing Speed - The ninja can spend a point of Ki for +30 feet of movement rather than +20.&lt;br/&gt;     Calling Card - The ninja leaves a calling card whenever she commits a crime. If her identity is revealed, this grants her a hefty bonus to intimidate.&lt;br/&gt;     Cauterize - Using ki to heat her weapon, the ninja can stabilize dying creatures and stop bleed damage.&lt;br/&gt;     Dimension Bomb - The ninja can throw a smoke bomb at her feet and teleport a short distance.&lt;br/&gt;     Heat of the Moment - By spending ki, the ninja can draw a weapon or rummage for any other item as a swift action, but only during a surprise round and only if she uses it in the surprise round.&lt;br/&gt;     Illusory Wound - A ninja can convince herself that her wounds are not as severe as they actually are, granting her temporary hit points.&lt;br/&gt;     Jagged Lacerations - The ninja's sneak attacks sicken the target.&lt;br/&gt;     Penetrating Throw - The ninja can throw a shuriken with sufficient force to penetrate through a target and into another individual behind it.&lt;br/&gt;     Ricochet - The ninja can invest ki into a single shuriken throw, thus causing it to bounce around and strike multiple targets.&lt;br/&gt;     Silent Puncture - The ninja can attempt to muffle the sound of the victim of one of her sneak attacks, thus facilitating cloak and dagger tactics.&lt;br/&gt;     Sudden Vanish - The ninja can spend ki to immediately vanish upon being critically hit.&lt;br/&gt;     Tangle Bomb - The ninja is capable of mixing tanglefoot bags and smoke bombs, with amusing effects.&lt;br/&gt;     Toxic Saliva - A life of poisoning her blades has left residual toxins in the ninja's body. She can coat several weapons a day in this low-lethality poison.&lt;br/&gt;     Unseen Shadow - The ninja can spend ki to force creatures to reroll their Perception checks to see her.&lt;br/&gt;     Vindictive Mind - Whenever the ninja saves against a compulsion effect, she can immediately attempt to use that mental link to mangle her oppressor's mind with ki.&lt;br/&gt;     Visual Impairment - Throwing dust in an opponent's face, the ninja reduces the combat efficacy of an enemy.&lt;br/&gt;     Whirling Cavalcade - Focusing on one enemy with her shuriken, the ninja gets bonus damage for each shuriken that struck home this round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
