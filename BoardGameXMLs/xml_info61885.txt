							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Verdant World</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Verdant World offers a wide variety of new plant monsters, spells, feats, prestige classes, and a new system to liven your game by injecting it with a touch of green. Oodles of crunch for both DMs and players, with enough flavorific goodness to keep the keenest readers interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to flesh out your druid or ranger with a plant-oriented prestige class? Do you play another class you think should be able to focus on the greener things in life? With six unique prestige classes, The Verdant World offers a wide range of options. Explore the nuances offered by the Nature's Avenger, Forager, Nature's Scourge, Green Man, Sylvan Spellcaster, and Woodland Barbarian, and you will find opportunities you never imagined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty-three new spells give you the flexibility and range you need to bring out the best in your spellcaster. New healing, damage, and specialty spells open up new doors for your divine and arcane classes to tap the power of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new system of herbal creation offers a shift away from the traditional arcane-focused potion brewing system. With ninety-six new plants, each with a detailed description of appearance, use and biome, as well as stats outlining general climate, rarity, market value, and brief explanation of use, this chapter helps any class gain minor access to abilities they would otherwise be without. Twenty-five of the plants outline various healing properties; thirty cover exotic effects; and a full forty-one focus on new and exciting poisons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty new feats complete the player?s toolbox, ensuring you can now build a more well-rounded character, particularly of the nature-oriented classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMs... Feeling like your players are a bit too calm when walking through the woods? Not terrified enough by every rustling branch or solitary cactus? This is definitely the book for you. With twenty-six original plant monsters, ranging from the hyper-intelligent and malevolent soul harvester, to the lovable pet rambling rose, to the mindless gold tips, there are certain to be more than enough choices to fill out your world and ensure your players never look at a shrubbery the same way again. Each plant has a full stat block, description of its appearance and accompanying full-color illustration, combat maneuvers, and incidental trivia. The plants range in difficulty from 1/4 to 14 CR, with plenty filling out the middle range, and scalable options for most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you've been looking for some interesting new material to add to your game ? particularly if you're interested in making the flora of your world more than a passive backdrop ? then this is a strong purchase that we are confident you'll be satisfied with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
