							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talisman: The Magical Quest Game</name>
									
			<description>From Your Spectrum #13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAKES TWO TO TALISMAN &lt;br/&gt;Claiming that it had 'the first ever interactive multi-player arcade adventure', Games Workshop launched the Spectrum version of its fantasy game, Talisman.&lt;br/&gt;The program, which can involve up to four players in any one game, is said to be the true successor to Valhalla. Talisman is a race to reach the 'Crown of Command' and control the destiny of the world - of course! A horrific array of deadly creatures are out to stop you in  your task, including those that are controlled by the computer and the other players.&lt;br/&gt;As, at the time of writing, we at YS haven't actually seen the game, we can only ask you to believe what Games Workshop are letting on.&lt;br/&gt;Try looking out for Talisman in the usual outlets at &amp;pound;7.95 - but if you have any problems, give Games Workshop a bell on nn-nnn nnnn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blurb from the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talisman is the first ever interactive multiplayer arcade adventure. For one to four players, Talisman is a race to reach the Crown of Command - of course, a horrific array of deadly creatures are out to stop you (not to mention the other characters, bother real and computer controlled!) The tasks and foes become more difficult as you go further into the quest, and cannot be overcome without the aid of various magical objects - and the chances are high that you will have to kill another player to get the one you need! There are also mystical followers, who will increase your powers if you win their allegiance, and orcs, wizards, trolls, elves, sentinels, landlords... with over 50 beautiful graphic locations, Talisman is the true successor to Valhalla - only it is one players or multiplayer, and it's packed with action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talisman is written by SLUG, the authors of Apocalypse, Rebelstar Raiders and Battlecars, and is based on Games Workshop's bestselling fantasy boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
