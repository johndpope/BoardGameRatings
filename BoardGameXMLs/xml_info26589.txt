			<description>A social game for 2-4 players ages six and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are given like numbers of plastic beetles to hide in illustrated match boxes.  In turn, the players roll a die and either attempt to recall the location of an empty match box in which they may hide some beetles or interacting with two personalities who sometimes hide in the match boxes away from beetles.  The first player to hide all their beetles wins the game.  Remembering wrong about the boxes causes a player to take more beetles -- pushing them further from the win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
