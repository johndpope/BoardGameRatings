							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cthulhu Grey</name>
									
			<description>designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;...according to Mr. Walmsley himself, strongly resembles an earlier draft of Cthulhu Dark. Basically I added:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A Harm stat, for combat&lt;br/&gt;     Skills to differentiate characters' abilities beyond their occupation.&lt;br/&gt;     Target numbers and difficulty&lt;br/&gt;     Simple rules for Magick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I developed these rules to meet the needs of my specific play group. There are two main issues with Cthulhu Dark that I will attempt to address:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A realistic, intuitive mechanic for Harm as well as Insanity. (Rolling with your current Insanity as the target number is neither.)&lt;br/&gt;     Mechanical differentiation between characters, based on their particular skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have reprinted nearly all of the rules from Cthulhu Dark with my own additions, so this document should represent a playable game. I have removed all examples for the sake of brevity. No infringement on Mr. Walmsley&amp;rsquo;s copyright is intended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
