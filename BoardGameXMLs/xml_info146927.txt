							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gen D&#039;Armes: Rules for a Medieval Wargame</name>
									
			<description>Late Medieval/Early Renaissance wargame rules that use a map-based simultaneous movement system to indicate where units will move each turn. A unit's status is tracked on a simple roster that records losses to the unit. Troops also have an assigned relative points value that can be used for play-balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting resolution uses a number of six-sided dice (D6), while melee resolution uses the cumulative melee values of the stands engaged multiplied by the result of a single average die (2-3-3-4-4-5) and the totals compared. There is also shock combat resolution to take account of the impetus of charging troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stand of miniatures is removed after a specific number of roster hits are recorded. The amount required varies by the type of unit; for example, peasants remove a stand for every two hits, while knights remove stands after five hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gen D'Armes is a playable set of rules that has stood the test of time and uses some well thought-out mechanics. There is also a section for siege battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
