			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Dutch game, published around the turn of the millenium.&lt;br/&gt;The players have to answer questions in various categories about the different decennia between 1900 and 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each turn, a player is allowed to answer up to 3 questions about one decennium. The category of the first question is determined by the position of the spinning wheel on the board, the other two are chosen by the player himself. For every right answer the player marks 1 row on the triangle for that decennium. Three right answers make a 'golden triangle' and give the player the right to mark a row in the 2000 triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can try to replace other players' markers by answering questions right in a decennium where the other player has already put markers.&lt;br/&gt;Golden triangles might be overtaken by a 'coup'. The player can now choose the categories of all his 3 questions, but they all have to be right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has a golden triangle on the 2000 triangle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
