							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gangsters et compagnie</name>
									
			<description>Play with gangsters and cops using cards.&lt;br/&gt;On one hand, there are 4 gangs with a godfather leading them. On the other side, 15 cops are trying to avoid the gangsters to rob a bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gangster et Compagnie is played in two teams. The dealer, the player with the bank and the player with the bomb are one team. All the others are the second team.&lt;br/&gt;These teams play tricks. In a trick where the first card is a Gang or Police, other players can follow or play whatever (if they can't follow). In a trick where the first card is a Bank or Bomb, nobody can play a card. The round ends a soon a player played his last card.&lt;br/&gt;The team with most points in the tricks, win the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
