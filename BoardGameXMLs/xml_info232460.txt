							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Nuclear Men</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of a research and development team designing revolutionary new reactors for the Navy found themselves working with what they believed was alien technology. The strange radiation affected all of them, one of them beyond the brink of madness. Following a disastrous &amp;quot;accident,&amp;quot; there were only three survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the following months, they discovered the disaster had infused them with incredible superhuman abilities. The three friends decided they would learn to use these new powers and continue their work - but now they could also ensure their efforts could be a benefit to people as THE NUCLEAR MEN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
