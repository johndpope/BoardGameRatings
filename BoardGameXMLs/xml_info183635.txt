							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure Island</name>
									
			<description>Treasure Island is a roll-and-move game where players hunt for pirate treasure.  It is included in The Great Pirate Activity Book, published by Kingfisher. There are four starting points, each marked by a ship and leading to a different track.  Each player chooses a ship and places his or her starting marker on it.  More than one player may choose the same ship.  Players take turns rolling the die and moving their marker along the track, following the directions on spaces where they land.  Spaces may move players forward or back on the track or cause gain of loss of turns.  When a player reaches the pirate treasure on an exact roll, he or she then heads back the starting ship.  The first player back to his or her starting ship wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
