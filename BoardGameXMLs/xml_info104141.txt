			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;The Big Apple Has a Rotten Core&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midnight in the city of New York. It's raining. Three miles away from each other, two men make exactly the same decision at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One is Daredevil, the red-costumed fighter for justice, who uses his uncanny senses to fight evil where he finds it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other is Kingpin, the pinstripe-clad warrior, who has followed his own code of ethics while fighting and clawing his way to the top of a criminal empire more powerful than many small nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each has decided to eliminate the other in a duel to the death on the streets of New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside are two books for two players. One of you becomes Daredevil, the other Kingpin. Everything you need to play is provided: two books, Combat Table, and Character Sheets. No dice are required. All you need is a healthy supply of luck and two pencils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAY ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, MANY TIMES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is different every time you play, and your well-being is always at stake in THE KING TAKES A DARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
