							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hey, Bartender!</name>
									
			<description>In Hey, Bartender! everyone is trying to take change from a friendly bartender.  Each player is dealt a hand of seven cards.  The 'bartender' also gets seven cards, played face up on the table.  The object of the game is to trade cards with the bartender, making change such that the bartender gives the player more points than the player gives the bartender.  Play continues until all players have exhausted their hands, at which time the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hey, Bartender! was designed as another version of Pennywise played with cards, and was published in Game Trade Monthly in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
