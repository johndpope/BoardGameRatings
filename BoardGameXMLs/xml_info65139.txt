			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fantasy Supplement for the Generic &lt;br/&gt;Universal Role-Playing System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steve Jackson Games makes the assertion that with a copy of GURPS Lite and access to the Internet, one could conceivably play GURPS forever without spending a single penny. Unfortunately, this has not proven to be entirely true, especially in the field of Fantasy Role-Playing. GURPS Lite offers only one non-human race - Elves - and only a few spells. And the web resources for Fantasy are scant. A few monsters, a host of new spells that all require Magic or Grimoire to be useful, a nice equipment list or two...but not enough to truly carry a full Fantasy game. And while GURPS does interface nicely with any other company's supplements, the resulting boggle is often confusing, and certain to dissuade a newcomer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having noted this, and realizing that it makes it difficult for newcomers to the game to get started, I created this document. With a copy of Caverns and Creatures, plus a copy of GURPS Lite make it truly possible to play Fantasy forever, for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
