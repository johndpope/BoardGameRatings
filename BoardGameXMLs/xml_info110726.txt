			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob strode through the double doors of The Provincial Hotel and into the opulent lobby. The marble floors gleamed as the afternoon sun streamed through the windows surrounding the lobby. He quickly spotted the small wood paneled reception station and walked over. No one was present, so he used the small bell on the counter to announce his presence. Still, no one responded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob was anxious to begin his vacation. It was the first one he had taken in nearly 3 years and Miami seemed like a great place to escape. As he leaned over the counter to look into the open door adjacent to the reception area, Jacob felt something cold and metallic press against the back of his head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Well, my friend,&amp;quot; a rich Hispanic baritone voice stated behind him. &amp;quot;Seems like you picked the wrong place and the wrong time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the 24x36 full map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave. Grab a copy of Modern Floorplans: Hotel today, and keep an eye out for future releases!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Provincial&amp;quot;, an &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; modern boutique hotel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hotel is reminiscent of some of the great boutique hotels in New York City. Each of the floors of this hotel boast nearly 12,500 square feet of space and offer large sun rooms, spacious guest rooms and suits, and a cozy dining space located on the first floor. The beauty of this map is the third floor, which is also designed as a repeating floor plan. This allows the flexibility to build three story or three hundred story hotels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
