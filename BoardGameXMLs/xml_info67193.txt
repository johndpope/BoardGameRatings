							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Für die Königin, für Rondra!</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book (translated):&lt;br/&gt;Kurkum, a name with a promising sound. There are only few places in aventurien, which are shrouded in legend as the amazon castle in the beilunker mountains. It is said that one feels closer to the divine Rondra there, because on Kurkum she has gathered half a hundred of her best and most magnificent warriors. Kurkum is also the dwelling of the queen Yppolita, which is still considered as one of the greatest living heroines of our days. Her fame radiates more brightly than ever, and many see in her the savior of aventurien in coming dark times. So some male and even more female aventurien cavaliers would give a fortune to be allowed to walk before the throne and listen to the words of the queen. But it is only granted to a few to step through the Gates of the amazon castle. Perhaps you are one of these few. If you do not dare the journey to the castle you will never know...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
