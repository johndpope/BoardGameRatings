			<description>Wise Guys is a Dutch game published by Identity Games for &amp;quot;Spits&amp;quot;, a newspaper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with:&lt;br/&gt;- a rather small game board (14x14 cm/5.5x5.5 inch)&lt;br/&gt;- four pawns (blue, green, red, yellow)&lt;br/&gt;- four &amp;quot;eens/oneens kaarten&amp;quot; (yes/no-cards)&lt;br/&gt;- fifty-one question cards&lt;br/&gt;- a four-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to be the first player to reach the finish line. All players start at the same starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game round, one of the players takes a card and reads out loud one of the questions (yes-no type) on it. Each player then answers the question with yes or no, by putting his yes/no card in front of him/her (hidden for the other players). &lt;br/&gt;The card reader then reads out loud the correct answer, which is printed on the back of the question card. One by one, each player announces whether he/she answered correctly or not. If the answer was correct, the player may move his pawn one step towards the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may lie about his answer. The card reader however has the right to check whether a player is sincere by asking to show his/her answer. If a player lied, his pawn has to move back two spaces. If the player was sincere, the card reader has to move his pawn one space backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the finish line wins the game. If two or more players reach the finish line at the same time, it's a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
