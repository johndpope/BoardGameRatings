							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D24 Wrestling Starter Set</name>
									
			<description>D24 Wrestling can be played with one to four players. It combines the elements of dice rolling (with a D24 die!) action, strategy, role play and simulation into one awesome package, with matches taking place in real-time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D24 Wrestling features faces (good guys), heels (bad guys), combining for a total of 20 unique playing cards. Each card has a full color illustration on the front, and game play stats on the back. We have main event stars (like Superbandit, Goliath, all the way down to low carders like Tadpole). The unpredictability of the D24 die adds to the &amp;quot;anything can happen&amp;quot; feel of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two versions of the game: basic and advanced. A &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; match begins when two players roll the d24 to see which wrestler will start on offense. The player that gained control will then roll on his wrestler's offensive set (each wrestler has 24 moves, including their finisher(s)! For the offensive wrestler to stay in control, he must roll successfully vs. the skill rating (power, speed, technical, brawling, aerial and striking). The offensive wrestler loses control when he does not roll successfully vs. his skill rating; then the opponent takes over on offense (just like a real match!). When a wrestler hits their finisher, the opponent must roll their 3-Count or Submission Rating, plus the opponent's finisher rating, to see if he is defeated. If the opponent rolls their 3-Count Rating or below, the match is over and the opponent wins (there are also other random ways to win, such as pin scenarios on the &amp;quot;Into the Ropes Action Chart&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced game turns up the heat with more strategy options and player input. The advanced game allows a wrestler to attempt pins up to three times during the course of a match. Strength of moves is taken into account (some moves are more damaging than others). Maximum Damage Points from close pins/submission attempts, and finishers indicate how hurt a wrestler is, including blood! The advanced game also allows for wrestlers to use steel chairs and other foreign objects...but be careful, a disqualification may result! Other options found in the advanced version: exiting the ring, suicida moves, finisher counters, submission wrestling--you have four turns to get out of a basic submission move, and three for a submission finisher--or you tap out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes complete with a storyline that also allows you to take on the role of owner/booker/promoter and run your own version of WOX! Crown champions, develop feuds, determine rankings, create TV and house shows that culminate in pay per views! Schedule tournament and play nights or focus on the storyline element of the game...you're in charge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
