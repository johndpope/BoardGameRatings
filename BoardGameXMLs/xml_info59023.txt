			<description>The game is similar to Black Jack. There are cards with coins, valued 1-10. Each player can draw those cards and try to get as close to 20 points as possible, but not above. Whoever is closest to 20 or reaches 20 receives a chip.&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player also holds two parrot cards. During the game, a parrot can be taken into the hand and another card dropped. The parrot is discarded after the scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever gets 7 chips first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
