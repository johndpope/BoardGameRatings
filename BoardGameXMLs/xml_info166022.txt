			<description>Comes with 5 blocks (dice) which are rolled to get the result of the play call. The player playing offense chooses whether to call a running, passing or punt play. The result of that roll determines what happens on the play. The result of the die roll can be either NO COMBINATION, SINGLE PAIR, DOUBLE PAIR, THREE OF A KIND, SEQUENCE , PAIR AND 3 OF A KIND , FOUR OF A KIND, or FIVE OF A KIND and then depending on what play you choose to run a chart shows the result in yards of that play. The results chart also shows results with either a black or white dot which accounts for fumbles or interceptions and break away touchdown runs or passes. Some black dot results increase the length of the play, or give the unusual results that a game might have including penalties. 30 plays make up a quarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
