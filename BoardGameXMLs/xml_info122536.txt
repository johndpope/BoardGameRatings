			<description>UFC: Throwdown, known in Japan as UFC: Tapout 2 on the PlayStation 2 and UFC 2 Tapout Final Spec. on the GameCube, is  based on the Ultimate Fighting Championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five different game modes; &amp;quot;Career&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;UFC Mode&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tournament&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Exhibition&amp;quot;. Career mode involves creating a fighter, giving him a fighting style, completing a number of &amp;quot;skill challenges&amp;quot; to build up his attributes, then winning five sparring matches before you can enter an eight-man tournament. After the tournament is over, the player picks a new fighting style to learn, and completes the same process until it has been done five times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In UFC Mode, the player picks a heavyweight or light-heavyweight fighter and must win four fights before having a title match. On winning, the player receives a silver belt, which can later become a gold belt if UFC Mode is completed again with the same fighter. There is also an open-weight division, where the player can face fighters from outside their weight class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In arcade mode the player selects a fighter and must win ten consecutive fights. Up to eight people can compete in the Tournament mode. Exhibition mode consists of single 1 vs. 1 fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game cover features UFC fighter, Tito Ortiz and the late Charles Lewis Jr., better known as Mask, the founder of the TapouT brand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;UFC: Throwdown&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
