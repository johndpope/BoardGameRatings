							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So What&#039;s The Human Called, Anyway? II</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So your PCs have wandered into a nearby town. Perhaps they are relaxing in the tavern talking with the locals, haggling with a merchant or trying to gather information about a nearby ruin from a sage. Then they ask &amp;ldquo;so what&amp;rsquo;s this bloke called, anyway?&amp;rdquo; At this point, the GM normally uses the first name that pops into his head (probably &amp;ldquo;Bob,&amp;rdquo; or the one he used minutes ago for another NPC) crushing the players&amp;rsquo; suspension of disbelief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s The Human Called, Anyway? II banishes this problems by providing 500 first names and 250 surnames and place names of Carolingian, Egyptian, Germanic, Gothic and Sumerian origin. Divided by culture, these handy tables enables the busy GM to generate literally thousands of unique names for use in his campaign. Players can also use the tables herein to create cool names for their PCs that suit the background and flavour of their GM&amp;rsquo;s campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featured Cultures:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Carolingian&lt;br/&gt;    Egyptian&lt;br/&gt;    Germanic&lt;br/&gt;    Gothic&lt;br/&gt;    Sumerian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
