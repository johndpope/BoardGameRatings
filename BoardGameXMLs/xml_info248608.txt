							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tales of Entropy: Dangerous Mind</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agents, conspiracies and the paranormal clash with family life in the suburbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From his birth, Alex Munro has been an extraordinary kid. Being mildly autistic, he has had his fair share of difficulties in adapting to life around other people. It is no surprise that he has spent most of his time reading books and wandering in imaginary worlds of his own creation. Going to school didn&amp;rsquo;t ease things, but despite the bullying and other hardships, he has gone through three successful semesters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
