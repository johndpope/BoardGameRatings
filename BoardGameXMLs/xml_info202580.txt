			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in london all that life can afford.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;Samuel Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In London one can stroll past grand buildings, marvel at the cultural wonders of the many museums and art galleries, and sample exquisite food at exclusive restaurants. Take a wrong turn, though, and one enters a world of poverty and thievery; a world where human life is cheap and citizens are packed into slums like rats who cannot leave the sinking ship. This Ubiquity-powered guidebook to Victorian London in the 1890s includes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An overview of how London works, including topics such as accommodation, climate, communications, death, entertainment, lighting, policing, and transportation.&lt;br/&gt;A tour taking in over 120 locations.&lt;br/&gt;Statistics for 39 major historical and literary personages and 20 stock characters.&lt;br/&gt;The names of important ambassadors, government official, military leaders, museum and gallery curators, newspaper editors, and religious leaders.&lt;br/&gt;Advice on how to run city-based adventures and 19 adventure seeds.&lt;br/&gt;Four Leagues of Adventure, six sample player characters, and eight henchmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
