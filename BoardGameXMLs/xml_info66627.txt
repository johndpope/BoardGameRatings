			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your own haunted house.  Whose attraction will be the best?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A portion of the proceeds from the sale of this game will be donated to &amp;quot;Scare for a cure&amp;quot;.  Scare for a cure is an Austin, TX based nonprofit organization that raises money for local breast cancer charities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build a haunted house attraction by purchasing &amp;quot;Scares&amp;quot; or areas of a Haunt.  These areas are intended to give customers thrills and chills and hopefully given the right theme, be successful enough to produce points during your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once your attraction is open for business, each player attempts to see if area of their attraction is successful.  Various type of patrons may be played on any player's attractions to increase (or decrease) the chances of successful attraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
