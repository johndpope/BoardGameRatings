			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to play, you&amp;rsquo;ll need two to six players (one to serve as the GM and the rest to be players), these rules, and a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20) or an app to simulate dice, and two distinct kinds of tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many role-playing games where the GM calls almost all of the shots, the players and the GM will work together to craft the story of the game. Think of this as a collaborative effort where you all work together to tell an awesome 80s story where strange things happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Ashcan Edition of the game was released for free public download during the kickstarter for the commercial version of the core rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
