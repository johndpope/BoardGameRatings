			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The walls of the City still smolder after the battle with the invading Savages.  The battle raged into the night, and there were heavy casualties on both sides, the City at this point remains secure.  It was as if the savages sent in their heaviest hitters for this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following morning, the City Guard is sent scrambling to maintain their ranks and take a head count of the survivors.  About half remain, and the few that made it out alive are now on double duty not only guarding the City, but rebuilding as well.  Every City inhabitant at this point is beckoned to help out with the construction.  The City Council warns of another attack, although they have no way of predicting this.  Fear and paranoia run rampant on every street and in every home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC&amp;rsquo;s are left with the internal question of where to sit in this situation.  Do they move on?  Or do they help rebuild?  News of some gruesome activity reaches the PC&amp;rsquo;s ears the following afternoon at the Dusty Boot.  It seems that when the City Guard was taking record of dead savages, several came up short.  Where there was once a slain body on the ground and the remnants of their gear, it was as if the corpse just got up and walked away without a trace.  This creates a rumor mill of great magnitude throughout every watering hole, adding to the already established chaos&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
