							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shroud of Olindor</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shroud of Olindor is designed for 1 GM and 1 player, rogue level 7-9. Written by Matthew Hanson, this module includes 20 adventure-packed pages, forming a ready-made adventure for the smallest gaming group. Although it is designed for a Rogue level 7-9, with some minor scaling, The Shroud of Olindor is suitable for use with a traditional four-player party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Dragle was set to auction off his most recent discovery, the Shroud of Olindor. The elven relic was certain to make Dragle a wealthy man. Such a pity he had to die. But the plot surrounding Dragle&amp;rsquo;s death is far more layered than it appears. It is up to the player character to discover the hidden motives and ultimately recover the Shroud of Olindor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is a sequel to 1 on 1 Adventures #2: Star of Olindor, although it is easily played as a stand-alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
