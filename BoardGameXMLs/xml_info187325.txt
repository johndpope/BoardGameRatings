			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rats in the Walls casts the players as &amp;quot;Rats in the Walls of Time,&amp;quot; able to go back into the past and make changes to affect their present. Their reasons vary, but they are all driven by their hatreds, and it is their Hate which gives them the power to do so. They come from many disparate walks of life, but there are things within this world that they hate with such a passion that they are able to do the impossible. The only thing that connects them, aside from the ability itself, is the fact that they are conscious of the changes that others like them make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
