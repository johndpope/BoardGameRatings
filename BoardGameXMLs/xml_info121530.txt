							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The British Empire</name>
									
			<description>Patriotic card game, made when Britain actually had an Empire but one that was fading fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to gain certain cards to complete sets. The different feature as that the sets have a differing number of cards within them. For example, to collect Ireland cards, you will need 4 cards to complete the set. But to collect England &amp;amp; Wales cards, you would need 6 cards to complete the set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all the possible sets have been collected, the one with the most sets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
