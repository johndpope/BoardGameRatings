The church contains art and other priceless objects that are of extremely important value to the cultural history of your town. The art is by a famous artist from history that once called this place &amp;lsquo;home.&amp;rsquo; The art is irreplaceable &amp;ndash; one of a kind. The objects are also irreplaceable. They are made of materials that are rare and unusual. They have important connections to townspeople of many years ago; their descendants still live here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And today, there is a serious problem that you must solve...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
