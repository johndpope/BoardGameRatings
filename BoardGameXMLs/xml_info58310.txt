							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech Classic: Jihad Secrets â€“ The Blake Documents</name>
									
			<description>Centuries-old Secrets Revealed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chandrasekhar Kurita has spent his life hunting for ancient secrets. Almost as soon as the Word of Blake formed in 3052, &amp;quot;Uncle Chandy&amp;quot; put his vast network of spies and his massive wealth toward digging behind their fa&amp;ccedil;ade and now, two decades later, Uncle Chandy has discovered more than he ever thought possible. Now he&amp;rsquo;s using that knowledge to send a coalition of forces against one of the Blakists&amp;rsquo; hidden five worlds: the Ruins of Gabriel. More importantly, he&amp;rsquo;s found a connection to the single greatest mystery in the last half-millennia. Aware he&amp;rsquo;s almost guaranteed his death at the hands of a Blakist fanatic, Uncle Chandy knows the time has come to stand in the light and reveal the secrets that will change the tide of the Jihad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jihad Secrets: The Blake Documents contains a wealth of information on the current universe-shaking Jihad storyline, providing more &amp;quot;hard facts&amp;quot; than any book to date. Detailed information on the opening years of the Jihad, including maps of the most significant conflicts; a current 3075 &amp;quot;Around the Sphere&amp;quot; in the same vein as the Jihad Hot Spots series provides up-to-date information on the latest happenings; biographies of more than twenty individuals important to the Jihad; a complete description of all Word of Blake forces, including unit logos; and the hidden history of Clan Wolverine and the Minnesota Tribe revealed! A complete rules section rounds the book out, with game play rules for taking any Word of Blake division into the field, construction rules for &amp;quot;primitive units,&amp;quot; and new &amp;rsquo;Mechs, including Clan Wolverine&amp;rsquo;s Mercury II, Pulverizer, and Stag, the &amp;quot;primitive&amp;quot; Dervish and the mysterious Raptor II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
