			<description>The Told You There Was No Coming Back&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vincent screamed when he saw us - me - again. After killing me, he'd expected me to stay dead. A reasonable assumption, don't you think? But my Shadow and I, well, we're not reasonable people. - Ryan Shearin, Risen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They Lied&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what tou've been waiting for: the way back to the Skinlands. Here's what you'll need to get there. Here's the terrible price that, no matter what, you'll have to pay. The Risen is a guide to the Walking Dead, those who dare to take their bodies back from the embrace of the coffin. Included are the powers, limitations and history of the Risen, as well as the terrible secret that each revenant carries with her. Gaze out from the sepulchre, and remember: Passion will always be stronger than the grave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Risen includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Everything you need to create a Risen character - or to bring an existing wraith character across the Shroud&lt;br/&gt;     New Arcanoi, Merits and Flaws that only the Risen possess&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for travel back and forth between the Shadowlands and the Skinlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
