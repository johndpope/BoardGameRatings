							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Depth of Banack DÃ»m</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in the depth of the Mountain of Fate, lies the ancient dwarfhold of Banack Dum. Rumours claim it holds an artifact of ancient evil, others speak of treasures beyond imagination. Will the players face the perils of this sinkhole of evil, or will they flee in terror from the undead abominations that once were dwarves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grugan the Beholder Mage has heard about the nexus related treasure to be found in Banack D&amp;ucirc;m and has sent one of his lieutenants to Necropolis to recover it. Grash is eager to proof his worth to his master and has hired some extra help in the form of the two loveable scoundrels Jean and Jaques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
