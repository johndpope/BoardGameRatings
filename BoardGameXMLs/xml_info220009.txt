			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other prominent collectible card games in the genre, which are played in turns, Titanfall: Frontline is played in real-time. The player collects and places Pilot, Titan, and burn cards to damage and defeat their opponent. Pilot and Titan cards can combine to perform extra damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Titanfall: Frontline was cancelled on January 13, 2017 as &amp;quot;the experience wasn't ready to deliver the intense action-packed gameplay synonymous with Titanfall. While it's never easy to cancel a game, we're excited to take some of the concepts we saw resonate with players and build off of them in future Titanfall mobile games,&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanfall%3A_Frontline Titanfall: Frontline]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
