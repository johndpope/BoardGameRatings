							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kursk: Taming the Tigers</name>
									
			<description>A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using micro-scale tank miniatures or paper figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The German invasion of the USSR in 1941 was, at first, a smashing success. However by 1943 the German army was on the brink of disaster . . . Hitler decided to gamble on a massive armored assault designed to force the Soviets out of the war before the Allies could open a new front in Western or Southern Europe . . . The battle of Prokhorovka, near the end of the Kursk campaign, was the largest tank battle in history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's order of battle is simplified, eliminating infantry and anti-tank guns. The Germans have Tiger, Panzer IV, and Panzer III tanks. The Russians have KV-1, T-34, and T-70 tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concepts covered in the rules include artillery, air attacks, terrain, line of sight, and rear/side armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
