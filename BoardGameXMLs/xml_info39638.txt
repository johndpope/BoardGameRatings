			<description>This game uses a gyroscope/spinning top and plastic 'balls' containing ball bearings. In the center of the bottom of the box is a little metal dish. You spin the gyroscope, put your 'balls' into the box with it and hope that they are hit by the gyroscope and sent through one of the four holes into the corners (the bottom of the box has a diamond shaped framework with these holes in it). Balls that reach the 4 corner holes score points dependent on where the wind up along the diamond.   The game is &amp;quot;MADE IN ENGLAND&amp;quot; by an unknown maker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
