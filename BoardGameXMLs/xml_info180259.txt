			<description>Gouda Ganoven is a game about collecting cheese, which was crowdfunded via startnext.de.&lt;br/&gt;The five cheese tokens will be placed randomly in four different rooms. Now all players choose hidden from the other players in which room they want to sneak and try to pickup a cheese token.&lt;br/&gt;You can modify the power of your rat with actioncards such as weapons.&lt;br/&gt;The player who conquers five cheese first, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
