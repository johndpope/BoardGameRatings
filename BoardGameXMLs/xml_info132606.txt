							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Spirit Engine</name>
									
			<description>The Spirit Engine is a 2D, sidescrolling adventure/RPG game with a simple story and a straightforward, innovative real-time combat system. Written as an experimental reaction to old 16bit console RPGs, it took a little under two years to complete and was released in November 2003 as freeware under Natomic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although TSE-1 suffers from amateurish scripting and graphics, poor coding, a cumbersome menu system and a slow and unrefined combat engine, I am still proud of what the game achieved. Most importantly I enjoyed playing it and, although it split opinions, I am happy to say that many others did too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game concept lays the foundations for The Spirit Engine 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spirit Engine is FREEWARE. It is free to download but may not be redistributed without consent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
