							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">JD2: Darkland Moors</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A huge, monstrous presence rampages through the farms and villages of Darkland Moors, throwing the locals&amp;rsquo; formerly peaceful lives into turmoil. What manner of giant is responsible, where is it taking its captives, and what is their fate? To restore peace, our heroes must scour the misty Moors and track the beast to its lair! This is the sequel to JD1 Cess-Pit of the Bog-Mother!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module was originally created as a stretch goal for Jeff Dee&amp;rsquo;s Kickstarter project to re-create his lost paintings from the covers of the classic RPG adventures A1 Slave Pits of the Undercity, A3 Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords, and C2 The Ghost Tower of Inverness. The author wishes to thank all of his backers, whose support made this work possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are three alternate introductions to this outdoor adventure, stat blocks for the standard creatures which appear herein, complete stats for unique creatures especially designed for the adventure, plus GM and player maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
