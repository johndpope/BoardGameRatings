							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Modest Inclination toward Speed</name>
									
			<description>The road ahead beckons, and you want to run the course from start to finish as quickly as possible before you run out of gas. But looking ahead, some of those curves are a little steep. Perhaps it is best not to drive too fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you play one card from your hand, adjust your speed accordingly, and move over the appropriate number of road sections. Taking a curve too fast or a jump too slow results in damage which is paid by discarding player cards. If you cross the finish line card, you win. If you run out of cards or are unable to take enough damage, you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created for the 2012 Solitaire Print and Play Contest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
