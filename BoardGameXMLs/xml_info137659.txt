			<description>SURFACE WARSHIP 1939-1943 is rules and equipment for tactical World War II naval simulation games.  Each player is the captain of a ship.  In a 30-second time limit turn, he moves his ship and fires his guns.  The gunnery effectiveness is determined by the captain himself, since he ranges his guns by eye and guess.  A system of points is used to evaluate damage to ships - how much speed and armament they lose.  Torpedoes are fired by pointing a marker in a certain direction and moving it as the torpedo moves.  An umpire is necessary in the game because many arguments will arrise about hits and misses, and many additional factors can be included in the game with an umpire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
