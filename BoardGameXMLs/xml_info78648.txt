			<description>Paperboy 2 is a sequel to the video game Paperboy. It was released in 1991 for multiple platforms. The game was much like the original: the player controls a paperboy  (or papergirl) who must navigate a bizarre series of obstacles while trying to deliver the morning paper to various customers on a street (though unlike its predecessor, papers had to be delivered to houses on both sides of the street). Like the original, the game is renowned for its difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Paperboy 2 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
