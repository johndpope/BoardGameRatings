			<description>A card game based on the manga cartoon series of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a custom set of sixty cards reflecting heroines, allies, and villains from the series. Heroines include Fuu Hououji, Hikaru Shidou, and Umi Ryuuzaki. For each heroine there are Heroine cards and Team Up cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The allies are Clef and Ferio. Villains include Alcione, Ascot, Caldina, Innova, Lafarga, Mokona, Presea, Princess Emeraude, Zagato. There are Plot and Villain cards for each villain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing area is divided into two sides, one for each player, each consisting of a 3x3 card playing grid. Defending cards are played face down on this grid. The object of the game is to have a card reach one of your opponent's third rows at the same time that you have a card in any position on one of the opponent's other columns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
