			<description>On November 1943, the Japanese 11th Army began its attack with the goal to capture the Chinese city of Changde.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese rapidly achieved its goal and defeated the Chiense forces around Changde however one KMT Chinese division, the 57th &amp;quot;Tiger&amp;quot; division entrenched itself at Changde and fiercely resisted Japanese attempts at capturing Changde until Chinese reinforcements forced a Japanese retreat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a two player strategy game on the battle of Changde and shows the differences between the Japanese and KMT Chinese armies. Each army is different in ability and sequence and the game shows these differnces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
