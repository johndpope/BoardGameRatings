							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Between the Boards Indoor Soccer</name>
									
			<description>Between The Boards Indoor Soccer brings you the action and excitement of the old Major Indoor Soccer League (1978-1992).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fast Action Card (FAC) deck and team charts are all you need to play this fast-paced game.  The FACs control all aspects of game play.  Teams are rated for their offensive and defensive ability, their ability to draw penalties, and their power play and penalty killing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are rated on their scoring, passing, and penalty abilities.  Goalkeepers are rated as to saves and breaking up 2-on-1 chances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has everything ... penalties, penalty kicks, bank shots off the dasher boards, goalkeeper assists and penalties.  The FAC deck keeps play moving right along ... a complete game, plus stats, can be done in as little as 15 minutes once a familiarity with the game exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
