							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nguyen Hue: The Communist 1972 Spring Offensive in South Vietnam</name>
									
			<description>Nguyen Hue is a play-by-mail wargame for two players. A map is provided on which players indicate their positions by either writing on a plastic overlay or sticking in pins. On each of the twelve game turns, the Communist player sends in orders which are executed, with the results then sent to the Allied player, who then sends in his or her orders. Each game turn represents one week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is of moderate complexity, with rules for attritional vs. direct combat, multiple ways of moving Allied troops around, etc. It is possible to win via a political, morale, or territorial victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is designed to be played by mail, this is just to facilitate limited knowledge of opposing unit positions, so it could be played face-to-face with suitable double-blind movement rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
