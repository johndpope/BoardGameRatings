							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spontaneous Subterranean Spore Groves</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAT or BE EATEN&amp;hellip; in the DARK DEPTHS OF THE WORLD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shriekers, yellow mold, violet fungi&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did you ever wonder how such teeming hordes survive in the dark tunnels of the underworld, in the caverns and caves that honeycomb the world? Magic, surface raids and consuming other races help a lot, but even the subterranean depths has an ecosystem. Wafting through the depths of tunnels and chasms are spores of fungal growths called &amp;ldquo;subterranean spore groves&amp;rdquo; where there is dampness, carrion, or radiation from ores in the ground. They can sprout up overnight, for such groves are essential to underground survival, and adventuring parties have been saved by harvesting the edible masses in these subterranean oases of life&amp;hellip; Or they have perished from the often lethal components of such a colony, and the beings that are attracted by them&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subterranean Spore Groves is the latest entry from the Purple Duck Storeroom, including several useful tables for generating these eerie oases of crepuscular life in the dark depths of caves, caverns, and dark places adventuring parties love to travel.  Remember the old D1 Descent into the Depths?  You can quickly build a spore grove with this entry, which also includes a new fungal hazard, cyan fungus!  Get Purple Duck Storeroom: Subterranean Spore Groves today, from Purple Duck Games- where our games are what you want!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
