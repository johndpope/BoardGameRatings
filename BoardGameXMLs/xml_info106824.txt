			<description>Take on the role of a village in an ancient River Boggle civilization, a people who grew food in their mouth while standing in water for months on end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete with other villages as you harvest and store crops for winter, but avoid being seen by your gods as too greedy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center of your world is a five-card, poker-like river. There are simple tools at your disposal, but as Boggles had no need to develop complicated industrial agriculture, those tools are limited to what can be done with the people of your village--like redirecting the River by linking together to form a Boggle blockade, or changing the contents of the River by having a bunch of Boggles slurp it up while another group spit in new elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water crops. Yum!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
