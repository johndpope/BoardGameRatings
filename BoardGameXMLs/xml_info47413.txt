			<description>Leave Nothing Behind is a piratey card game for 2-4 players, created for the Traditional Card Game contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race their ships (aces) around a track, collecting plunder (number cards) and map pieces (court cards) as they go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their ships by melding sets of cards; sets determine both movement and combat strength.  (The winner of a fight can steal map pieces from the loser.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player crosses the finish line; the player with the most points wins (plunder scores face value, maps pieces are worth more in sets than in fragments).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
