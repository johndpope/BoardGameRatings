							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brainwashed (d20 Version)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;East Texas is an unlikely spot for a commune, but Harmony Farm has a long-standing reputation in the community as a place for kooks and weirdos. Still, everyone knew the old hippies and their friends were essentially harmless. Now something is different. The residents of Harmony Farm have been recruiting on the campus of East Texas University, and everyone who visits the farm comes back different--if they come back at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brainwashed takes the heroes inside a cult's rural compound to find a new recruit whom his father believes has been brainwashed. Can the heroes infiltrate the cult undetected? Will the so-called victim come quietly? Buy it today and find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brainwashed is a modern horror adventure for four Novice heroes. It combines the classic style of H.P. Lovecraft with a little Hellboy thrown in for good measure. As a bonus, Brainwashed is the first adventure to integrate our Fear Effects rules right into module. Each encounter eliminates the guesswork by clearly identifying the appropriate Horror level (minor spook, medium shock, great fright). Don't worry though, while Fear Effects isn't required to run the adventure, it does add to the fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 new creatures&lt;br/&gt;     Fear Effects-friendly&lt;br/&gt;     Printer-friendly version included&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
