			<description>Back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lords &amp;amp; Priests&amp;quot; re-presents two classic Fading Suns sourcebooks, each revised and with new material...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of the Known Worlds&lt;br/&gt;Nobles are the unquestioned rulers of the universe. Few are privy to their lifestyles and secrets, and the great unwashed understand little of the perks (and problems) associated with rulership. There are taxes to collect, wars to wage, and rivals to crush. Indeed, as any noble would tell you, the sacrifices they endure more than justify their opulent lifestyles. Not just anybody can be such a martyr; it takes blood privilege. A privilege the nobility protects at all costs, even if it requires deadly duels or declarations of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herein are detailed the histories and sociologies of the five Royal Houses, 10 minor houses and alien nobility: Ur-Obun councilmembers, Ur-Ukar chieftains and Vorox lords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Priests of the Celestial Sun&lt;br/&gt;The nobles may rule the secular lives of the Known Worlders, but the Church guards their souls - and in so doing, dictates to the nobility. Few lords dare to defy the will of the Patriarch and his bishops. But the Church's rock is not as stable as it once was - new sects and orders have appeared in the wake of the Emperor Wars, shifting the populace's loyalties and reawakening ancient heresies. While the Church stands united against the powers of the Emperor, the Royal Houses and the Merchant League, they feud within their cathedrals, vying for dominion over the faithful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herein are detailed the lives of the saints, the histories and beliefs of the major sects of the Church, the heretical Incarnates and the religion of the Children of Zuran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
