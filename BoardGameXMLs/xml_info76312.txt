			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;hris Sawyer's Locomotion is a computer game by independent game developer Chris Sawyer. In his words, it is &amp;quot;the spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows the player to use railroads, trams, trucking lines, buses, airplanes and ships to earn money in a transport company between the years 1900 to 2100. It contains over 40 pre-designed scenarios and a scenario editor, and can also be played in multiplayer mode with another human-controlled competitor. The game is played in an 2D isometric view like the other games by Chris Sawyer, particularly RollerCoaster Tycoon, which uses the engine that was originally developed for Transport Tycoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
