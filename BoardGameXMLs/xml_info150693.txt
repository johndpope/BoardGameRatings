			<description>PDF Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scream in the dark and a commotion outside your inn window awakens your group. While getting your gear on, a knock comes to the door. It is a boy scared out of his wits. While you get all your belongings in order, he tells you a tale of his master. She is a great and well known actress. She has been kidnapped by an ogre and a man. The boy is her assistant, and was able to hide from view and observe her kidnapper. It was none other than Capra, a well known artist with a workshop in the city. The innkeeper had tipped off the boy about the adventurers. He shows you the way to the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
