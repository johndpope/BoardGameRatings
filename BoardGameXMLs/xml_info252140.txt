			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The road meanders along the edge of the forest, curving gently around the outlying trees. As you walk onward, the calm is suddenly broken by the sound of cackling laughter further down the path. A moment later you hear the sound of wood smashing, followed by more laughter.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;In the middle of a session and need an adventure fast? Try Gnolls Galore, a Combat Miniquest for a party of 1st-5th level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a Miniquest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miniquests are short, two-page adventures that can be dropped into the middle of any 5e gaming session. They include everything you need to run them, such as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggested settings. Miniquests can be easily tailored to fit any scenario, but this provides you with the most simple setup so you can jump right in.&lt;br/&gt;Detailed descriptions. All locations within each Miniquest come with a description that can be read aloud to set the scene.&lt;br/&gt;Encounter tables. Every encounter comes with different options based on party level. Stronger parties will face tougher foes!&lt;br/&gt;Tactical maps. Fully-gridded hand-drawn maps aid in both gameplay and immersion!&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Complete the Quest&amp;quot;. Each Miniquest ends with this section, detailing XP earned as well as options for continuing the quest beyond what is written.&lt;br/&gt;Appendices for unique NPCs and items. Each Miniquest offers something new, be it treasure or people!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What kinds of Miniquests are there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miniquests come in 3 different styles: Combat, Social, and Exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat: Combat Miniquests are focused on, well, combat! Each one contains two linked encounters, with different options for parties of varying levels.&lt;br/&gt;Social: Sometimes the party just needs to talk things out! Social Miniquests present the party with unique NPCs and situations that are best solved with words, not weapons.&lt;br/&gt;Exploration: Exploration Miniquests take the party off the beaten path and introduce them to the wilder parts of the world. Hidden secrets, sudden encounters, and amazing treasures wait within!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
