			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes just increasing a creature&amp;rsquo;s Hit Dice to create a more powerful variant is not quite enough to make the creature a suitable challenge for a higher level party. Many special  abilities do not scale very well, if at all, leaving the advanced creature somewhat weaker than it should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ebook offers a selection of new special abilities that can be added to creatures as templates, as feats, as replacement abilities for powers that just don&amp;rsquo;t cut it at higher levels, or as bonus abilities to round the creature out after advancement. Many improve existing abilities, such as swallow whole or grab, and many of them scale over multiple challenge ratings as well, making them usable against adventuring parties of a wide level range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grab a copy of this ebook today and use the 63 abilities inside to make your creatures unique and more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancement powers is a Creature Powers Sourcebook for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, suitable for GMs and Players of any level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This material can easily be adapted to fit into any campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
