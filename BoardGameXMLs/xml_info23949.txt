			<description>The game package includes four scripted murder mystery scenarios, all set in England between 1900 and 1920.  Scenario titles are &amp;quot;A Death in Devon&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Death of a Train Spotter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Return of the Flower Hunter&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;The American Cousin&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three of the cases have speaking parts for 7 or 8 characters, and allow an additional person to act as the narrator.  The design is typical of this type of game, with plenty of opportunities for discussion, speculation and dramatic accusations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second case (Death of a Train Spotter) has no speaking parts, and is therefore playable by any number of guests. It is written as a meeting of the &amp;quot;Greater London Detective Club&amp;quot;, during which the natural progress of a murder investigation is reconstructed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
