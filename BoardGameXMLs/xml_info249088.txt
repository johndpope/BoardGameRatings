			<description>Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mihama Academy.&amp;rdquo; At a glance, it might seem a normal school; but this isolated learning environment is home to a mere five students, all female.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This changes with the arrival of Kazami Yuuji, a transfer student with an uncertain past and a highly idiosyncratic personality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Yuuji interacts with his five classmates, all borderline-eccentrics in their own right, they begin to influence each other in unexpected, meaningful ways&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the deep-seated, painful wounds that have brought these five young women to Mihama are still a fact of their existence. And eventually, our protagonist can no longer remain a spectator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Yuuji&amp;rsquo;s peculiar set of skills and experiences enable him to open his classmates&amp;rsquo; stubbornly-sealed hearts&amp;hellip;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fruit of Grisaia (グリザイアの果実 Gurizaia no Kajitsu) is a Japanese adult visual novel, the first in a series of visual novels by Front Wing, with character designs by Akio Watanabe and Fumio. It was released in February 2011 for Windows, and it was later ported to the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. Two sequel visual novels were also produced for Windows: The Labyrinth of Grisaia in February 2012 and The Eden of Grisaia in May 2013. The three games have been licensed in English and published worldwide by Sekai Project in 2015. There have been two manga adaptations published by Akita Shoten and Mag Garden. A 13-episode anime television series animated by 8-Bit and produced by NBCUniversal aired in Japan between October and December 2014. Sequentially, anime adaptations of the two sequel games aired between April and June 2015.Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Fruit of Grisaia&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
