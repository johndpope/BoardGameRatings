			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chequered Flag was published by Psion for Sinclair as part of the ZX Spectrum package to demonstrate the machine's capabilities. However, unlike the other games produced for this purpose, Chequered Flag is actually a good game. You can choose between three types of racing car, with different handling and characteristics, and there are 10 circuits, including real ones such as Monaco, Brands Hatch and Monza, and fantasy circuits like Saturn Sands and Micro Drive. You must manage your fuel stops, overheating, hazards such oil, glass, off-road and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only part missing is other cars. You're racing against the circuit and improving your own lap times. But that didn't detract from the thrill. To have your own racing car in your own home was fantastic. Chequered Flag did set a high standard for the commercial publishers starting out on the ZX Spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
