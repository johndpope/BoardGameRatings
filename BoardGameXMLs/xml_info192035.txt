			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The folks here at Flying Ape Studios have always been fans of the world&amp;rsquo;s most famous roleplaying game, especially its older iterations.Fifth edition was a great surprise, since it had elements from past editions and became once again a game that can be played without worrying too much about rules and etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much to our surprise the rules for this edition were released under the Open Game License, and Dungeon Masters Guild was opened. We knew we had to come up with some content for it... and here it is! Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love kobolds?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be a regular series in which a new monster is presented each time. In this first volume we proudly present the Kobold Triggerer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
