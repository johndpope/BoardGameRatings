			<description>The game is situated in the southern polar ice cap, on an ice float which the heat of the sun is melting. Baby penguins traveling on the ice are trying to reach their mother before their way is cut off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board depicts an ice float constructed of many ice tiles laid face down. The players move their penguins one at a time, trying to bring their baby penguins A) next to their own mother or B) next to an opponents mother. Every turn starts with the active player flipping and removing an ice tile from the board, possibly revealing a special action for that turn, and consequently making the ice float smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tile special actions are:&lt;br/&gt;Scorching Sun: Flip and remove an extra tile&lt;br/&gt;Belly Slide: Extra move&lt;br/&gt;Empty: Nothing happens&lt;br/&gt;Ice float moves: You can move an ice tile with a penguin on it.&lt;br/&gt;Whale: Move an opponents penguin anywhere you like on the board (it gets scared).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last free ice tile is flipped, and the scores are calculated. You get positive points for every penguin of your own colour next to your mother penguin, but also negative points for every penguin of an opponents colour next to your mother penguin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
