			<description>&amp;quot;For a long time you, as Cornelius, have been working at the local comic books stand shop. For about as long, you've been daydreaming about how somehow, someday, you'd be a Hero.  After all, wasn't what the fortune cookie was saying, right? ... Right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Aliens invaded, on a sunny afternoon, you knew right away that something unusual was going on.  This impression got stronger when you saw an odd looking big headed alien running away with a lady.  Perhaps...perhaps this is your grand moment announced by the cookie, otherwise all those flying saucers will surely destroy the world or worst, mess up the ozone layer. You have to step up and do something!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
