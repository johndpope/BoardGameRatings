			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4th Level adventure for 4-6 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strange thief wandered into Waterdeep and stole from the wrong person. Now, he has died of &amp;ldquo;natural causes&amp;rdquo; on his visit to the City of Splendors. Having no known friends or relatives, he was hastily buried, along with his possessions, at Waterdeep&amp;rsquo;s Cemetery (The City of the Dead) in The Road&amp;rsquo;s End Tomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the PCs are dining in the taproom at The Dripping Dagger Inn, they are approached by a stranger who claims that the unknown man had stolen a necklace from his employer, and he needs the adventures to reclaim it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the thief&amp;rsquo;s fresh corpse has been pilfered by a dire evil with unknown motives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
