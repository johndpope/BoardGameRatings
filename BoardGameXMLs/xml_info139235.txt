			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;From the author of the &amp;rsquo;100&amp;prime; series of Adventure Seeds books, a new, shorter form source of inspiration for Games Masters. They might be adventures, non-player-characters, monsters, places&amp;hellip; all ready to be dropped into your fantasy campaign, regardless of system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this booklet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gladiators of the Stone Heart: An underground arena, a fabulous prize, a hidden motive. Enter the dark and battle for your life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take it With You: Tradition has it that great leaders are buried with their most loyal soldiers and servants. Some take this a little too seriously and if they are thwarted can become extremely dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Breath: A strange mask, an assassin&amp;rsquo;s legacy with a power &amp;ndash; and a desire to kill &amp;ndash; all of its own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Broken Band: Wandering bands of heroic tomb robbers can&amp;rsquo;t be the only kind of adventurers out there. What do things look like from the other perspective?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Candlelight: In a war against the undead the bones of holy men take on a special value. They&amp;rsquo;re also heavily protected from the various unscrupulous forces that might seek to take advantage of the situation. Can you recover them and who will you give them to?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
