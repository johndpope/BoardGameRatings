			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a dark and stormy...future. The collapse of society came and lingered like an unattended cigarette burning itself out in an over-heaped ashtray. Technology fell into disuse and then into rubble. Cities crumbled. Resources ran out. Darkness reigned.  Sometime between then and now, communities started to rebuild and even have a glimmer of hope against the bleak background of reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That brings us to two towns separated by a river and by attitude. East Bank and West Bank were the same city in the times before. Now, there's no way but boat across the river, at least that's what everyone thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Councilman talking about rebuilding the long-failed bridge between the two towns is found dead in the river, the rallying cry of separatists is carved into his chest. &amp;quot;Two towns, two futures.&amp;quot; Populations are small between the two towns and this was a sucker punch to everyone; Councilman Macer was a good man, no matter what side of the river you are on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now it's up to you to figure out what's going on. By choice, by chance, or by conscription, you and these people around you are supposed to figure out what's going on, how the Councilman was killed, and maybe...just maybe...you can bring two towns together in the process...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
