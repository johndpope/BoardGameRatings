			<description>It's the early 1900's and you are the owner of one of the fastest growing rail companies in the eastern USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Spike, you expand your rail network as you connect cities in order to pick up and deliver more goods; complete contracts and routes to bring in money to modernize your train; upgrade your engines, tenders and railcars to transport the most freight; and build farther, transport more, and amass wealth on your way to become &amp;quot;King of the Rails&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Summary &lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;- Randomly distribute the 12 goods tokens into the chart on the board.&lt;br/&gt;- Shuffle track deck, place 4 in display.&lt;br/&gt;- Place the 3 game timer cards on the track on the board, the first one face up.&lt;br/&gt;- Each player:&lt;br/&gt;... gets a random contract showing a starting city, an end city, and several cities along the way. At end of game, earn $ based on city furthest along path to which you connected, +$1 per city along the way.&lt;br/&gt;... gets 3, 4, or 6 (4, 3, or 2 players) contracts, all of which correspond to a different type of good. Contracts have several possible destinations, paying more $ for more distant deliveries.&lt;br/&gt;... gets 5 random track cards; 1st player gives one to last player&lt;br/&gt;... sets up their train: level 1 engine (moves 1 space), level 2 card drawing, one cargo space&lt;br/&gt;... in turn order, players place their loco in any starting city&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your Turn&lt;br/&gt;- If you have a train on the tracks, advance it up to a number of spaces equal to engine level (1 at first; max 3).&lt;br/&gt;... Move only along your own tracks. &lt;br/&gt;... May not change direction while on track.&lt;br/&gt;... As you move, may jump over cities you don't want to enter.&lt;br/&gt;... If you enter a city, may deliver a good on your train; earn $ according to value showing on contract. &lt;br/&gt;... You may only deliver to any particular city ONCE; may only deliver each type of good ONCE.&lt;br/&gt;- Take one action:&lt;br/&gt;... start train moving (up to your engine level)&lt;br/&gt;... draw cards (up to your card drawing power); may draw from display and/or deck; only replenish display at end of your turn&lt;br/&gt;... build track: play track cards corresponding to tracks on the board; must build a complete link to a city. May play n+1 cards of one type, to count as n cards of another type. The first time you connect to a city, move the corresponding track marker to the bottom row of the chart; earn $1-3 depending on which row the marker started on. Shift the other markers up to fill in the empty space.&lt;br/&gt;... move train one additional space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End&lt;br/&gt;- When the draw deck runs out, flip the next round marker card face up. Shuffle the Display and the discard pile and create a new Display and draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;- When the 3rd timer is face up, shuffle all 3 into the bottom half of the new draw deck. When the 3rd card is drawn, the game ends immediately.&lt;br/&gt;- The player with the most money (tracked on score track) wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
