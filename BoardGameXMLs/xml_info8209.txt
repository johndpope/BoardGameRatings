			<description>Serata in Giallo (Evening of Mystery) is the premier collection of murder mystery games to appear in Italy.  The players are invited to an Evening of Mystery, during the course of which each player enacts the role of one of the protagonists of the event.  The games unfold in &amp;ldquo;acts&amp;rdquo; with a theatrical flavor, and the game may or may not include an &amp;quot;investigation team.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sangue Blu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir Reginald MacFergh has been murdered with a blow from a fireplace poker. In one corner of the dining room is his wife, in tears and suffering from shock. What happened here?&lt;br/&gt;A characteristically Sherlockian episode, &amp;ldquo;Blue Blood&amp;rdquo; takes place against the backdrop of a society divided in two: On one side, the nobility&amp;mdash;proud of their peerage and contemptuous with their inferiors; on the other side, the humble servants searching for a way to defend their dignity.&lt;br/&gt;The rigid British society of the late 1800's sets the tone for rendering the performance of these entertaining and original characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place&amp;mdash;Scotland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time&amp;mdash;October 1895&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters&amp;mdash;Six (3 men and 3 women):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sir Alex Carrington:  45-year-old bachelor of the most noble origins.  He is extremely proud, well-mannered, and refined. He has a condescending attitude towards those whom he considers inferior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Bruce Bonanno: 32 years old, of Italian origin. He has an exuberant, extroverted, and fiery nature.  He uses heavy irony to mock all nobility who visit Sir Reginald&amp;rsquo;s estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Cary Lynn: A handsome young 30-year-old man, with a substantial tan.  He is employed as a gardener for Sir Reginald&amp;rsquo;s estate. He has a reserved but passionate nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Della MacFergh:  Sir Reginald&amp;rsquo;s sister.  She is 35 years old and is extremely arrogant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miss Evelyn: The MacFergh&amp;rsquo;s 22-year-old maid.  She is very energetic and decisive.  She is not afraid to speak her mind&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Fiona Fraser: A very fascinating 28-year-old woman.  Originally from Adelaide (Australia), she is the daughter of Simon Fraser, a rich politician. Having grown up in a free and nonconformist environment, she is irritated with British traditionalism and with those who believe in absurd social rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
