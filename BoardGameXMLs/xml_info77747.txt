							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sacrifice</name>
									
			<description>Sacrifice is a video game published by Interplay Entertainment in 2000 for the Windows 98 platform. Developed by Shiny Entertainment, it is a real-time strategy game, featuring elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. Sacrifice was the first commercial video game to take advantage of video graphics cards that can process transform, clipping, and lighting instructions. The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many contemporary real-time strategy games, Sacrifice does not heavily focus on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana&amp;mdash;energy for casting spells&amp;mdash;constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Sacrifice (video game) , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
