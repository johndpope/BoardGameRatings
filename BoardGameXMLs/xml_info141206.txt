			<description>ROLLEM is a strategy marble arcade game where the objective is to push your marbles to the bottom of the maze. You play against the computer or a friend in your quest to gain the most points by getting your marbles further into the maze game board. Strategy is a must as you try to block your opponent by rotating the arrow blocks within the maze. Rollem is based on our popular DOS game 'BOLOBALL'. It is packed with features and has several difficulty levels so the whole family can enjoy this fun strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
