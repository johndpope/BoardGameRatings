			<description>&amp;quot;Tee Off in the Comfort of Your Living Room&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appeared in the July/August 1980 issue of Games Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Golf Course (gameboard) is printed in the magazine along with a sample scorecard. There are only 4 'holes' on the golf course; however, you can play 9 holes by using different combinations of tee-off locations and holes. The sample scorecard has the 'par' for each hole. Other equipment needed: a golf ball (marker) of a distinct color for each player, 2 D6 and paper and pencil to keep score (you can make or copy a scorecard for each player instead of using a plain piece of paper for scoring).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a new hole is started, each player tees-off in turn. Until everyone finishes the hole, order of play is determined by whoever is farthest from the current hole. Whoever is farthest takes the next swing. On your turn, while you are on the fairway or rough, roll both dice. You must move your ball in a straight line (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) as follows: (1) the total of both dice (2) the number on either die (3) the difference between the two dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing from a sand trap has a potential penalty. Play the stroke as usual, but then roll one die again. If it is a 1, there's no penalty. A 2, 3 or 4 adds one penalty stroke. A 5 or 6 adds two strokes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing in a water trap incurs a two-stroke penalty, and you take your next swing from the last space you passed before landing in the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you make it onto the proper green, you must decide whether you will (1) continue to use the movement method using 2 dice or (2) use a 'putter' (move the ball one square in any direction for each putt). You must continue to use this method for the rest of the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few more obstacles: (1) You may not hit onto or directly over an opponent's ball (2) You may not hit onto or directly over trees (3) You may not hit your ball onto a green other than the one around the hole you are playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep track of the number of strokes it takes you to complete a hole and write it onto your scorecard. Lowest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
