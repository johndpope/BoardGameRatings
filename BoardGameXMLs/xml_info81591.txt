The massive radiation released in the holocaust of world war mingled with the genetic fallout from biological weapons, creating horrific mutations that came to be called &amp;quot;Yoju&amp;quot;. These beasts bred in the bodies of humans and multiplied, covering the blighted landscape and pushing humanity to the brink of extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now the year 2048. As mankind's final gamble in the struggle against the Yoju, a squad of genetically engineered cyborgs was created - the A.S.S.P. Its members posess combat ability far beyond that of normal humans, and have been programmed with the complete database of anti-Yoju strategies and tactics researched over years of war. These female biosoldiers have become humanity's last line of defense against total annihilation, and you have been chosen to command them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pretty Soldier Wars A.D. 2048 is a battle simulation adventure game for adults that puts you in the command seat of humankind's last effort to preserve its existence on postapocalyptic Earth. Combining intense turn-based tactical unit combat with interludes of mission planning and social interaction (dating) with your squad members, Pretty Soldier Wars presents a unique gaming experience for adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
