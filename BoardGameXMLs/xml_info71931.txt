			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An arcade game that was released in 1984 by Tehkan (known today as Tecmo). It was followed by two official sequels, Mighty Bomb Jack for NES and home computers, and the arcade game Bomb Jack Twin. There was also Bomb Jack II, a licensed follow-up developed for 8-bit home computers by the European games publisher Elite Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set on a still screen with different platforms, enemies and bombs floating still in the air. The player controls Bomb Jack who has an extraordinary jumping skill, trying to collect all bombs. Collecting all bombs completes the screen, but collecting them in the order their fuses are lit gains the player extra points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games used borrowed songs, the arcade had three songs, of which one was original, one was &amp;quot;Kittens in the apple forest&amp;quot;, the ending theme for Mrs Pepper pot, and &amp;quot;Lady Madonna&amp;quot; by the Beatles. Most ports had their own music, and the latter ports have removed the background music. The Commodore 64 played a cover of &amp;quot;The Last Rumba&amp;quot; by Jean-Michel Jarre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arcade was ported to several systems, including the SG-1000, the predecessor to the Sega Master System. Wikipedia tells of a Game Boy release, however, this seems to never have been released in Japan and the information is unsure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bomb_Jack,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
