							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hero Master: An Epic Game of Epic Fails</name>
									
			<description>You&amp;rsquo;ve never really managed it as a hero. In fact, you&amp;rsquo;ve been the undoing of many a quest. Half of the parties you&amp;rsquo;ve adventured with ended up trapped in a cave-in you triggered, skewered by a trap you detonated or cooked by a monster you thought you could converse with. Somehow you have always ended up leaving unscathed, eager to join another party and change this streak of &amp;lsquo;bad luck&amp;rsquo;. It seems now though, just as a dragon has come to Snoozehaven and heroes look to band together, that your reputation has begun to proceed you. As the numbers dwindle in the tavern and heroes sing their way to battle, you realise your hopes rest with the no hopers sat around you. You&amp;rsquo;re just pleased that you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to be the party leader&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero Master: An Epic Game of Epic Fails is a parody dungeon crawler card game.. Each player begins the game with a different special abilities, deck of cards, weapons and armour based on the mixture of the character they randomly generate, by drawing from race and class cards. Each combination allows for a different synergy of humorous attacks and bungles that reflect a character&amp;rsquo;s personality as they desperately strive to become respected as an adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to become respected amongst heroes? Loot of course! Hero Master: An Epic Game of Epic Fails uses gold as its primary method of scoring victory, but the coins can be lost, stolen or even used to buy helpful services along the way. It&amp;rsquo;s not only coins that will be awarded to the heroes. If by some fluke, these hapless heroes managed to defeat a monster, they will be able to choose from a pile of treasure that will be added to their arsenal of options in future encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes will drag their loot from location to location in search of the dragon&amp;rsquo;s den. With the party leader choosing the path that best suits them from the ones presented, even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite lead in straight line to the dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more than one hero with designs on glory, as the whole party is just as desperate. While they squabble to be the party leader, to get the first swing at a monster (variable turn order) the heroes&amp;rsquo; quirky traits will become apparent in the form of bungle cards, which grate on the nerves of any of their companions. The elf, obsessed with being the first race to exist must be the first in any decision making, the human is so painfully vanilla she bores the rest of the heroes stupid, and the barbarian, he just has very little spacial awareness for a big fella.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With so much disruption and chaos, mistakes will be made, often at the risk of those nearby. Rolling a D20 to attack, any bungles played at the attack will have an impact on the chance of a critically fail. While other more competent parties the heroes have experienced may have borne the wrath of their stupidity, now surrounded by equals, who knows who is going to get hit by the mis-swing or nudged over the precipice?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a game of fast flying dice, jockeying for first position and strategic card play, anything can happen. The heroes just need to stick together until they defeat the dragon, then they can go their separate ways.... Which hopefully won&amp;rsquo;t be into the dragon&amp;rsquo;s stomach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
