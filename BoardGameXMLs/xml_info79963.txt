			<description>From the back of game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the mood to punch, kick and knock the daylights out of a bunch of wicked thugs? If the answer's &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;, be prepared to receive your own fair share of hard knocks, because these goons are tough. And you'll need brains as well as brawn since an intricate maze of passages leads you closer and closer to victory. Passages which you'll have to find. You're Aarzak, a renegade with a dream to free your people from a life of oppression. A master of Jet-Kwon-Do, the most elite practice of the martial arts; you're about to experience hand-to-hand combat that never lets up. You're swift, you're lethal, you're good. But are you good enough to outsmart layers of labyrinths; battalions of beasts; and scores of setbacks? Are you good enough to survive the Last Battle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
