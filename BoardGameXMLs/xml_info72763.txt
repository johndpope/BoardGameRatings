			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ArenaWorks is a simple, flexible and fun way to model a gladiatorial fighting arena. The front and rear of the terraced stand units are fully interchangeable; there are three fronts and five backs. There are over 80 unique items in this jam-packed set! Make your own customized dream arena with 90-degree corners, and 45-degree corners. If you wish a more rounded arena shape, try putting a straight section in the middle of the two 45-degree corners. A reverse 90-degree corner is also included if you wish to make an &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; or &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo; shaped arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To access the stands, seven different stairs are provided, stick them on any way you want! As well there is a grand gate, a royal box and an altar, whether it's the peaceful shrine of the benevolent rulers or the bloody altar of the sorcerer priests is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arenaworks is designed to play your way, from a pickup afternoon session of dice-rolling to the centrepiece of your fully developed campaign. The modular stands will portray many scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Small town fighting pit&lt;br/&gt;    * Big city coliseum&lt;br/&gt;    * Jousting, Tournaments&lt;br/&gt;    * Horse, beast or chariot racing in a Hippodrome&lt;br/&gt;    * Stage for spectacles, parades, training, executions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use Arenaworks as the backdrop to your urban campaign or for a handy and danger-filled side adventure. Fight your PCs in them to prove their skills and earn experience, money and fame. Hire henchmen or bodyguards from the brutal fighters. Arenas with masses of people are also a good place to cut a few purses, too...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ArenaWorks includes all of the following, over 80 items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Three Different Terraced Stand Fronts&lt;br/&gt;    * Five different Terrace Backs&lt;br/&gt;    * 45 degree corner, left and right hand&lt;br/&gt;    * Two different 45 degree corner backs&lt;br/&gt;    * 90 degree corner with buttress&lt;br/&gt;    * 90 degree reverse corner&lt;br/&gt;    * Royal Box&lt;br/&gt;    * Altar&lt;br/&gt;    * Flat-top building&lt;br/&gt;    * Grand Gate&lt;br/&gt;    * Tower&lt;br/&gt;    * 10 different ground tiles including clicks, blank and water tiles&lt;br/&gt;    * Short, Medium and Tall fencing in both 4 and 8 inch lengths&lt;br/&gt;    * Tall 3D stone Wall&lt;br/&gt;    * Ramp-style Stairs &amp;ndash; 3 kinds&lt;br/&gt;    * 2nd story Ramp-style Stairs&lt;br/&gt;    * Step-style Stairs&lt;br/&gt;    * 2nd story Step-style Stairs&lt;br/&gt;    * Ramp&lt;br/&gt;    * Odds Boards&lt;br/&gt;    * Archery Targets&lt;br/&gt;    * Weapons Racks&lt;br/&gt;    * Banners &amp;ndash; 7 kinds&lt;br/&gt;    * Two different Flags&lt;br/&gt;    * Pushcart Vendor&lt;br/&gt;    * Cages &amp;ndash; 2 kinds&lt;br/&gt;    * 3 signs for the Terrace Backs&lt;br/&gt;    * 3 different arena Pits&lt;br/&gt;    * Magic Circle Risers &amp;ndash; 2 colours&lt;br/&gt;    * Wooden Bridge&lt;br/&gt;    * Arena Riser&lt;br/&gt;    * Riser Ruins&lt;br/&gt;    * Kiosk that doubles as Guardhouse and Outhouse&lt;br/&gt;    * Dead Cart&lt;br/&gt;    * 2 different coloured Chariots&lt;br/&gt;    * Execution Column&lt;br/&gt;    * Ladder&lt;br/&gt;    * Spare doors and walls&lt;br/&gt;    * Full color photographed instructions for all models&lt;br/&gt;    * &amp;ldquo;Bringing it all together&amp;rdquo; illustrated starter guide&lt;br/&gt;    * Incredibly useful updated &amp;quot;Beginners Guide&amp;quot; full of tips and tricks on Cardstock -modeling&lt;br/&gt;    * Online user support and community at the WorldWorks games message boards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
