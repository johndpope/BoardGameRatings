			<description>This is old and pretty simple roll and move boardgame, where you are a customer in a department store. In Finnish Tavaratalo means department store. There is three departments in the store, Paper department, food department and household department. Players start from the lobby and throw the die to decide in which department they are going. After that you just roll and move throught chosen department. All the spaces in the departments sell one special thing and you just buy it. If you roll five or six, you take a random card and you either get money, or things or loose money. When you come back to Lobby you sell all the things you bought with random prize (from zero to two and half times the buying prize) decided by the dice. Game ends after certain amount of rounds and the player with most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
