							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flag To Flag Racing</name>
									
			<description>A very straight-forward racing game.  Players roll dice to move their cars around a track separated into spaces.  Some spaces are cautions, at which a caution card is drawn.  Players gain and lose money throughout the race and receive bonus money based on finishing positions.  Multiple races can be played.  The player with the most money at the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include board, custom money, caution cards, dice and playing piece cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game looks to be self-published, with the box stating &amp;quot;Limited 1st Edition,&amp;quot; and the rules stating that &amp;quot;You have purchased one of the original 2500 games produced.&amp;quot;  I doubt that there was a second run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules also state: &amp;quot;Copyright No. VA249-950 Flag To Flag Racing Game. September 21, 1992&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Made in North Carolina U.S.A.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
