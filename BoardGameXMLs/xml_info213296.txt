			<description>Meu Jardim (My Garden, in Portuguese) is a tile placement game, similar to dominoes, that focus on color perception and attention.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 45 hexagonal tiles, each one showing an unique combination of 3 from 5 types of flowers. Each player must place its tiles touching at least 2 other pieces whose sides match in their colors. Different from dominoes, the hexagons make a closed grid, that forms the garden. That way, each play creates a new garden.&lt;br/&gt;The game can be competitive -win who puts down all their pieces- or can be cooperative. In this mode, players help each other to build gardens based on one of the 27 templates that comes in the manual. This mode can also be played solo, as a puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by Rafael Arrivabene with art from Luiza Sequeira&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
