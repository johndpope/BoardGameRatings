			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of Gothos, there are hidden sects and secret schools where the most powerful arts of war are learned. Great masters have studied the most ancient ways of fighting, passed down through the ages and tied to the powerful spirit of the races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presented in the Mystic Warriors sourcebook, is the rich history and techniques of these schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great Pantheon calls them cults and fears them, chooses not to understand them, and in some secret way embraces them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike paladins, mystic warriors find power deep within themselves. It is their raw spirit that they draw upon to work the wonderfully complex combat moves that these fighters are legendary for. These warriors know how to reach deep inside themselves and call on their vitus, their spirit, their very ego, to do what they do. The schools have rigid ways and are as disciplined as any monk might be, in some cases more so. The warrior schools follow different creeds- many are good, some are&lt;br/&gt;evil, and some focus purely on the art, not caring about the outside world at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you have here in these pages is a single Mystic Warrior class. This special class, called The Forgotten will not be found in the Mystic Warriors sourcebook and is a preview to introduce you to our world and our new d20 supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
