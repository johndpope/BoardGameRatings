							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Figure Me Out: a game to help children learn about others</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;This game helps kids get to know each other. The game develops social skills by helping children learn to gather information about others and share information about themselves. Children take turns assuming the role of a reporter, getting to the bottom of a story by using Who, What, When, Where, and How questions to figure out what another player is thinking. These conversational skills are used to teach children how to begin and maintain an interesting conversation. A variety of topics (a hobby that interests me, a movie I saw recently, my favorite season, etc.) are used to generate ideas, or stories, for the players to figure out. The object of the game is to complete a full circuit of the game board and file your story by the deadline. Designed for children with Asperger Syndrome in mind. Said to help kids develop the social skills needed to begin and hold a conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
