							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tilt</name>
									
			<description>Tilt is played on a hexagonal board divided into six horizontal and six vertical channels by raised squares. Each player has a set of square pieces numbered 1-5, with more of the lower numbers (plus a &amp;quot;flag&amp;quot; piece) which move along the channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces can be moved individually or as columns of adjacent friendly pieces. A piece or a column can push an opposing piece or column if it stronger (i.e., if the sum of the pieces' numbers is greater). Flags cannot move on their own, but must instead be included in a column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces which are blocked from moving (even temporarily) can be removed by the owner if it is to their advantage. It is also legal to push your own pieces if you like (even off the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to touch or immobilize the opposing flag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
