			<description>The objective of the game is to stack plastic books on your own hat and hope to be the one with the best balance. When everyone else have dropped their books only the winner is left. &lt;br/&gt;Each player places a &amp;quot;student hat&amp;quot; on her or his head. The top of the hat is flat and slightly rubbery. You roll a die and get to do one of six things: &lt;br/&gt;Remove 1 book from your own head&lt;br/&gt;Add 2 books to your own head &lt;br/&gt;Everyone adds 1 book to their own heads &lt;br/&gt;Everyone adds 2 books to their own heads &lt;br/&gt;You pick a player who gets to remove 2 books from their own head &lt;br/&gt;You pick a player who gets to add 2 books to their own head&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different sizes of books, big and small, you pick yourself which ones you want. And, you are only allowed to use 1 hand when you add and remove books from your head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
