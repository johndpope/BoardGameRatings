							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Miss Management</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ready to manage a team of zany animated coworkers as you step into the shoes of Denise, a young and beleaguered first-time office manager. You'll have to juggle incoming work tasks, keep everyone from getting stressed out, and help the coworkers achieve their goals, from flirting at the watercooler to getting more work done than anyone else! Office politics was never as hilarious as this! From the designers of Diner Dash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
