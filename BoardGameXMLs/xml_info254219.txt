							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Geriatric Medication Game</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geriatric Medication Game attempts &amp;quot;to increase student awareness of the difficulties confronting geriatric patients in the ambulatory care setting and their medication use.&amp;quot;  The game involves up to thirty students participating in assigned roles (geriatric patient with physical limitations and prescribed medications; aide to patient with incomplete knowledge; or caregiver with assigned tasking), and moving through six stations (physical areas) of play.  The game is intended for collegiate level participation and requires multiple facilitators with advanced pharmacy knowledge.  A game is intended to last about an hour, and setup is simple enough to allow start-to-finish play in a seminar or graduate level course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geriatric Medication Game is described and analyzed in &amp;quot;Instructional Design and Assessment: The Geriatric Medication Game in Pharmacy Education&amp;quot; published in &amp;quot;American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education&amp;quot; 2005; 69 (3) Article 46, pp. 304 - 310.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
