			<description>&amp;ldquo;The Great Northern War (1700 - 1721) was a military struggle between Sweden on one side, and Russia, Denmark, and Saxony-Poland on the other. The Swedish army under Charles XII was among the best in the Europe, and would win many victories. However the end result of the war was a defeat for Sweden that ended her run as a world power and cost her much of her empire. In 1708 Charles XII launched an invasion of Russia.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In June of 1709 the decisive battle of the campaign was fought at Poltava. The Swedes attempted a surprise attack on the Russian's fortified camp. They lost 1/3 of their army fighting past a line of redoubts. Hemmed in and outnumbered they had only one option left - attack! Which they did. The Russians held their ground and used their greater numbers to halt the Swedish advance and envelop their flanks. The Swedish retreat turned into a rout. The army was later forced to surrender, and Charles XII, who had been wounded on the eve of the battle, escaped to Turkey.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order of battle for each army (Swedish and Russian) is broken down according to the position of the units on the battlefield: the left wing, right wing, or center. In addition to a commander for each section, each army has an overall commander.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
