			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digiworld is a rules-light role-playing game that adapts the Digimom: Digital Monsters media franchise to the table-top.  Players in the game assume the roles of characters that are able to interact with &amp;quot;digital monsters&amp;quot; that come from an alternate, digital, dimension (often by traveling to that dimension from our own).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Attributes (Strength, Athletics, Toughness, Charm, Genius, Smarts, and Heart).  Each Attribute has an associated dice pool of D6 that are rolled whenever that Attribute is used in a contested action.  Within the &amp;quot;digital world&amp;quot; everything is built of seven Elements:  Fire, Water, Thunder, Earth, Wind, Light, and Dark.  Each character specializes in one of these Elements.  Elements are considered &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; against one other elements, &amp;quot;weak&amp;quot; against one other, and &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; against the remainder.  Damage taken from &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;weak&amp;quot; elements is increased or decreased, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
