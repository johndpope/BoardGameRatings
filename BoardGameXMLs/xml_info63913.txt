			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Thrash is a book-and-dice RPG about fighting games and anime martial arts created by Blackbird (A.K.A Ewen Cluney).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Magical World is a game setting for Thrash about Magical Girls in a Sailor Moon meets Aberrant meets Kingdom Come world with a dark, sinister flavor. In this world, magical girls fight to keep supernatural evil from this world while fighting at the same time to regain the love of a world that now fears and despises them, bring love back to a grey world, and all this while trying hard to keep their sanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A world-wide magical girl demographic explosion caused an inminent conflict between all the young do-gooders, causing the world to view them almost as much of a threat as help. This short guide explores the Film Noir-esque point of view of those men and women devoted to keep the magical threat in check. These so-called magical girl hunters have as many motivations as there are hunters and as little help as their ingenuity and all the firepower they can get.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
