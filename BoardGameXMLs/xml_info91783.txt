							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: The Star League</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Star League  was the greatest achievement of mankind, a golden age of prosperity and advancement the likes of which had never been seen. Led by the noble Cameron family, the League united all of humanity under one banner for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the League also had its dark side. Not everyone wanted to be a part of such an undertaking. The rulers of the League were forced to use their military might to bring the nations of the Periphery into the fold. Many resented the League for this action and it would eventually lead to the League's downfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For wicked men plot the League's demise. Stefan Amaris, cursed forever after as one of the greatest villains in history, wants the destroy the League from within and has corrupted the young First Lord. He is opposed by Aleksandr Kerensky, General of the Star League's armies, who is willing to do whatever it takes to defeat the Usurper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this sourcebook, ComStar presents the history and the tragedy of the Star League.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook contains more detail on the Star League than any other BattleTech publication, and hasn't been reprinted. Although rules for Star League equipment and 'Mechs were detailed in the Technical Readout: 2750, this book provides a wealth of background detail on the Star League, and is one of a very small number of publications to include an atlas and map of the Star League and the Terran Hegemony. Some of the detail from this book relating to the Star League Defence Force was later reprinted in the German edition of the Technical Readout: 2750.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
