			<description>Twisted Texting is a party game where players try to get the other players to say a word on a card by spelling the word with transparent letter tiles. The 'Texter' has a limited pool of letter tiles and many times must improvise with misspelling, similar sounding and resemblance to get the players to say the word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Texters have a limited time to get players to say words and race against a sand timer to get as many words correctly guessed as they can. Each player takes turns as Texter. The game plays over 3 rounds with each round providing a new pool of letters. Each successive round provides a smaller pool of letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
