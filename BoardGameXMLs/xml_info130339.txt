			<description>A game that defies explanation, the ultimate goal being whatever you make it to be. Teams of 2-players take part in this party-style game by moving across a board and performing one of four actions from a specified deck of cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mime Medium: help your partner guess the clues on the card by miming it to them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Korean Trivia: guess the correct answer to a collection of erroneous and admittedly falsified questions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Illustrative Efforts: using drawing only, get your partner to guess the clues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thespian Affronts: using any means necessary, except for saying the exact clues themselves, help your partner guess the clues on the card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team also has a collection of dominoes, which can be played after each card action is performed. The game being played with these dominoes should be agreed upon before the game starts (the rules recommend playing &amp;quot;double sixes&amp;quot;), and the scores should be kept track of on a piece of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether the result of each card was successful or not, a word from the bottom of the card is written down, and at the end of the game the group tries to come up with a poem using these words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the game should be agreed upon by all players before starting, or by setting up a house rule to that effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
