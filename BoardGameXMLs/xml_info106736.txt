			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beret is the story of a Scientist working for the Evil Corporation.  He realizes that the company is just a little too evil for him to handle, so he decides to take it down from the inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using his telekinesis, Beret must travel through several levels, defeating enemies and collecting medallions to unlock deeper areas in the company offices.  The medallions are hidden in many ways that require your puzzle solving skills as well as some quick reflexes to reach them, and bosses will tax you as you seek to take down the Evil Corporation once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, you can unlock a level editor that lets you create your own levels to share with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
