							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">How to Spice Up Combat</name>
									
			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is an integral part of most role-playing games, and in many of them the most IMPORTANT part.  Lots of RPGs have game systems almost entirely devoted to rules used for adjudicating fights; whether between individuals, vehicles, or massed armies.  Many of these conflict resolution mechanics are complicated, and can take a long time to resolve at the table.  This can lead to lots of downtime, as well as boredom and frustration, for players who aren't immediately involved in the action.&lt;br/&gt; But even in games where combat is a relatively short and/or simple affair, it might still be a terribly dry one.  A bunch of players sitting around a table calling out numbers, die roll results, and damage values-RPG as Bingo game-with no context, flair, or narrative excitement to frame the action; can kill a game faster than a bullet to the head.  &lt;br/&gt; While there are certainly players who are fine with this style of game (&amp;quot;Roll your attack.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;I rolled a 16.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;You hit, roll for damage.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;An 8.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;He's wounded, but still standing.  He attacks you.  Roll your defense.&amp;rdquo;); many more would rather have combat be more interesting and dynamic.  After all, fights (whether in the real world, or a fictional one) should function to get the heart pumping and the adrenaline going, and should be ABOUT SOMETHING other than killing the next roomful of nameless orcs.  &lt;br/&gt; With all of that in mind, this Avalon Games How To Book is intended to give gamers a variety of tools, suggestions and examples (many of them illustrated by popular fiction) in order to make their combats more enjoyable and more meaningful; hopefully leading to a better playing experience and more fun for everyone at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
