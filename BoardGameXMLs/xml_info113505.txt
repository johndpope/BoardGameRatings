			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reverse Tower Defense game. You control the creep in this case, and must make it through enemies defenses. You can choose the path your ships take. You have a hero ship that if destroyed you will lose. Damage is cumulative and will stay from one level to the next. Earn money by destroying opposing ships and forts or pick it up in the sea. Money can be spent to upgrade your fleet and to repair damage done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;+  As of 11/22/11 the game is buggy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
