			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Doubletaire(tm) is the fast action card game for two players.  Based on the classic game of Solitaire, players must race to play as many cards as possible before the game is stopped.  Extra &amp;quot;freeze&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;undo&amp;quot; cards have been added to keep the game exciting and unpredictable.  The game is perfect for Ages 7 and up.  Winning at Doubletaire (tm) requires a combination of speed and strategy... and maybe a little luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
