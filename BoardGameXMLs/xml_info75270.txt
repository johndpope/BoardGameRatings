			<description>From Wikipedia supplemented by User Submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were video game versions of Disney's Aladdin released around 1992, when the movie was released. Each version had its own developers and publishers - this VGG entry concerns the SNES/GBA version that was developed and published by Capcom. Interestingly, Capcom waited a full decade before developing and publishing this game on the Game Boy Advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the Sega Mega Drive version of the game, the player does not equip a scimitar. Instead, the gameplay revolves around jumping on enemies, as well as vaulting off stumps to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, though like the Genesis version, the player can also throw apples to stun opponents. The storyline more or less closely follows the plot of its namesake, the Disney full-length animated motion picture, with Aladdin going from a street rat to a prince, who first woos, and then has to rescue, the Princess Jasmine. Most levels and stages of the game will be readily recognized by people who have seen the motion picture, but there are a few levels that have nothing to do with the movie including an Egyptian pyramid and a surreal world where Genie dressed in a tuxedo serves as Aladdin's guide (this level represents Genie's song sequence You Ain't Never Had A Friend Like Me, and has an instrumental version of that song playing in the background). The game features renditions of the soundtrack from the Disney motion picture, as well as several mini-games dependent on the player catching a golden scarab or collecting all diamonds within a stage. An extra challenge involved finding 70 red diamonds throughout the game. While they weren't necessary for ending the game, the credits screen changes slightly according to how many diamonds were collected. That version sold over 1.75 million units worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason that the Super Nintendo version of developed by Capcom and not Virgin Interactive was that the film came out at a time when Capcom held the licensing rights to games on Nintendo consoles based on Disney intellectual property. This deal resulted in some classic titles as Ducktales, Darkwing Duck, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (Game Boy version), and Goof Troop. The license expired some time between the cinematic releases of Aladdin and The Lion King, as the videogame adaptation of The Lion King was developed by Virgin Interactive on all platforms including the Super Nintendo, and the Mega Drive version of Aladdin was ported to the NES for a European release on New Year's Eve 1994. The Capcom version was also ported unofficially to the NES by an unknown company in 1995. It was also ported unofficially to the Mega Drive/Genesis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A version of the game would also later receive a port for the Game Boy Advance with an extra stage, though all the songs based directly on the original movie were replaced with new music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
