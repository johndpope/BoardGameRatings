			<description>From the outside of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Master's Keep is the perfect bastion of secrecy from which DMs can run their adventures and campaigns! The Dungeon Master's Keep is cast from durable resin and comes pre-painted and ready to use right out of the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gatehouse is secured by two stout doors with a pair of familiar-looking door knockers, and above the door hangs the D&amp;amp;D 4th Edition Dragon Icon. Behind the screen are numerous shelves to store miniatures, game cards and other record keeping notes. Two handy trays are built into the walls to hold your GF9 Dungeon Master's Tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, the towers of the gatehouse also serve as dice towers, with one tower facing out to your players (the rolled die exiting from a door in the tower) and one securely behind the screen for private rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
