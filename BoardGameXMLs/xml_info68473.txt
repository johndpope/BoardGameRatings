							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Matador: Et spørgsmålsspil om Korsbæk</name>
									
			<description>The game is based on the highly popular television series &amp;quot;Matador&amp;quot;, which was shown on Danish television in the eighties. It is not necessary to have followed the series, but the pleasure is greater if you have a little knowledge of the history and characters you will meet on the gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;The game is about to correctly answering questions, collect the right number of cards and reach the goal, before the other players steals your cards. In addition to knowledge about the persons in Matador, their intrigue and relationships, you also need to play tactical, and to be part of the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; alliances to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 1200 questions about the series and its personalities, and all question-cards are in addition to the 4 questions for adults, marked with a question, especially developed for children, (8 years), thus without a greater understanding of 'Matador' can participate on equal terms with grownups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
