			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Ronin: Oriental Adventures in Tokugawa Japan, a world of honor and steel at the edge of the modern age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ronin brings you to Japan during the Edo Period, characterized by the rule of the Tokugawa Shogunate (1600-1868).

Will you be a samurai beholden to a master or a free-ranging ronin? Will you follow the way of the sword or call upon the arcane spirits?

A world on the edge of turmoil awaits you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ronin gives players and Game Masters will find invaluable information to bring the rich historical era of the Edo Period to their games, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* An introduction to Tokugawa Japan, covering topics such as geography, culture, daily life, nobility, commoners, outsiders and outcasts, magic and mysticism.&lt;br/&gt;    * A primer on samurai culture.&lt;br/&gt;    * New Rules systems, such as the all-important Honor, as well as Flaws.&lt;br/&gt;    * New Basic Classes, such as the courtier, shudoshi (Zen seekers), and vagabond.&lt;br/&gt;    * New Prestige Classes, such as the blade saint, blind swordman, hedge witch, medium, merchant, and shinobi.&lt;br/&gt;    * New Feats, 16 in total.&lt;br/&gt;    * New Magic, including 12 new spells.&lt;br/&gt;    * A Bestiary of menaces from the natural, magical and ghostly realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ronin: Oriental Adventures in Tokugawa Japan is a sourcebook in the 3rd Fantasy line, compatible with the 3.5 edition of the world's most popular fantasy roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
