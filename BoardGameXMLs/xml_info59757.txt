			<description>Combination of Memory and trivia game. Picture tiles are laid out and flipped open Memory-style. When a player find a matching pair, he or she has to answer a trivia question from a separate card to be able to keep it. The questions are all dealing with environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tiles don't just show one picture each, but each side shows a half of one picture, so there are four matching partners for each tile. In some cases, a player has two pairs that can be assembled, too; for this, another question has to be answered. The player with most combinations is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
