			<description>&amp;quot;Bridge comes easy with the partner racks. Two can play. The help you need to take yourself up to competition standard.&amp;quot; (From box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginners to Winners Bridge begins with modified rules to teach the concepts of Bridge, but also includes rules for Contract Bridge with four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the included two-player rules, all 52 cards are dealt out. While both sets of partner cards are face down, both players make their first bid. Once this has been done, each player will set up his partner cards in his partner rack, according to suit. The card racks hold the cards at 45-degree angles, allowing a person to see the cards opposite them, but not their opponent's cards. Each player will play the cards in their partner rack as well as his own cards. The bidding continues as each player studies their partner hand as well as their own. Players can raise the bid until 7 NT is bid or until one player passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a simplified scoring system for the beginners' game. One point is given for each trick won. Both the Declarer and the Defender can win these points. If the Declarer wins at least the number of tricks called for, they win a bonus of 10 points. If he doesn't, the Defender wins a bonus of 5 points and the Declarer deducts 1 point for each Undertrick. The first player to score 30 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
