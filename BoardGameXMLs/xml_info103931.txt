			<description>While waiting (for the Matrix Games version) and to whet your appetite we have available Australian Design Group's original version of this international award winning game. The original Chris Marinacci version has been our greatest project ever, started in 1995 and only finished in 2002. This version forms the basis of the Matrix version of World in Flames (although admittedly the Matrix version has some mighty souped up graphics and enhancements)and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of World War II on a grand strategic scale &lt;br/&gt;1-8 players playing 1 or more of the 8 major powers of WWII (China, the Commonwealth, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union and the USA)and their ever obedient minor countries &lt;br/&gt;playable hotseat or solitaire (requires player to play both sides, unfortunately there is no artificial intelligence in the Marinacci edition) &lt;br/&gt;Now you can have the destiny of the world in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operating Systems supported&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program runs under Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows NT 4.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardware requirements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 MB disk space &lt;br/&gt;64 MB RAM &lt;br/&gt;Pentium CPU or better &lt;br/&gt;Video card capable of at least 800x600 resolution &lt;br/&gt;Scenarios Implemented&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barbarossa &lt;br/&gt;Guadalcanal &lt;br/&gt;World in Flames&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
