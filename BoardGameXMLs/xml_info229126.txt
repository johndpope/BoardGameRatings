							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Butlerian Jihad</name>
									
			<description>A two player card game themed on The Butlerian Jihad in the Dune Universe as described by the Prequel Trilogy. After a thousand-year standoff, the War between the Free Human League of Nobles Worlds and the Intelligent Machine controlled Synchronized Worlds escalates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is the Humans. The other player is the Machines. Each player has their own unique deck. Each deck has 6 suits. Each card has a force value and a special ability. Some special abilities require their ability to be activated, other abilities automatically take effect when the card is recruited or as a Free action discarded from the hand or in-play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with 3 Empire Tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round has 6 Phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Initiative Phase &lt;br/&gt;-   Players roll high on 1D6. High roll is the attacker. Low roll is the defender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Fate Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Each player draws 5 cards from the top of his deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Strategy Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Each player may discard up to 2 cards and draw replacements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Battle Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Players take turns starting with the attacker. On his turn a player can either Recruit (put a card into play face up in front them), Activate (use the activation ability of a card in play if it has one) or Pass. &lt;br/&gt;-   If both players Pass, one after the other, the Phase ends. &lt;br/&gt;-   Once a player passes, he must continue to pass, unless his opponent causes one of his in-play cards to be discarded or eliminated. &lt;br/&gt;-   Normally, during the round, a player can only recruit a max of one card from each of the six suits. Some cards as their special ability allow you to recruit more than 1 card of a particular suit. &lt;br/&gt;-   A card can only be activated once per round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.  Resolution Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Add up the modified force values of all the cards in-play. The player with the highest score wins. If tied, players roll high on 1D6 to determine winner. &lt;br/&gt;-   The winner takes an Empire Token from the loser. &lt;br/&gt;-   The winner causes one target in-play card of his opponent to be discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.  End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Each player can allow up to 9 of their in-play cards to remain in play. Excess cards must be discarded. &lt;br/&gt;-   Max hand size is 3 cards. Discard excess cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to control all 6 Empire Tokens wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
