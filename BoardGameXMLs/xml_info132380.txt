			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player starts the game then play moves to the left. On your turn take the top category card and turn it over so that all players can see it. Then the player whose turn it is rolls all 7 letter cubes. Immediately all players shout out words that relate to the category that begin with one of the letters face up on the cubes. As a player shouts out a word, that player snags the cube with that letter on it. Opponents must object immediately if they think the word just shouted does not relate to the category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all of the letter cubes have been snagged, or players have gone 10 seconds or more without coming up with a word, the round is over. Players score one point for each letter cube they snagged during the round. The first player to snag 20 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include some variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 7 dice, dice cup, 30 category cards, score pad, rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
