			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game of Checkers (called Draughts in England) is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest intellectual pastimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game similar to Checkers was played by the Pharaohs in ancient Egypt. Similar games were mentioned in the works of the Greek writers Homer and Plato. In the 12th century the game was adapted to the 64-square chessboard. In the 16th century the game was changed enough that it was essentially the same as modern Checkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now Checkers has entered the computer age, adding an exciting new dimension to this ancient game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
