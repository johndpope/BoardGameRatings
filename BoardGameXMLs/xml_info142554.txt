							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gemstone Island</name>
									
			<description>The King of Gemstone Island does not have an heir to the throne. Thus, he has set up a competition to determine who is worthy of being next in line as King or Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win this competition and thus become next in line to rule the island, you must be the first player to successfully bury a complete collection of gemstones. As you attempt to complete your mission, any of the following may happen: a hole in your sack, an earthquake, someone switching sacks with you (without your permission, of course), someone bumping into you and then picking up the gems you drop, or even another player digging up all that treasure you worked so hard to bury!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
