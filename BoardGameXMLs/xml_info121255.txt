			<description>The object of the game is to give same answer as partners to questions in order to score the most points. The couple with the lowest score after the final wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in three phases:&lt;br/&gt;1. Phase &amp;quot;Men&amp;quot;: men and women will answer questions about six men. Each woman draws 1 card issue where the answer is man.&lt;br/&gt;Each correct answer will score 5 or 10 points&lt;br/&gt;2. Phase &amp;quot;Women&amp;quot;: Women and men will respond to six questions concerning women. Same principle as for the questions men with the addition of the bonus issue which is worth 15 points.&lt;br/&gt;3. The final phase: to win, the pair will give the maximum correct answers to 10 questions in the final.&lt;br/&gt;The system is somewhat different since a member of the couple will meet secretly to 10 questions. Then, a facilitator will ask the questions and the member of the couple will say Yes or No:&lt;br/&gt;1. if he says yes, his companion can attempt an answer.&lt;br/&gt;2. if he says no, proceed to the next question.&lt;br/&gt;The couple must try to get at least 5 hearts (correct) and 2 points for each correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of three phases, the couple with the highest number of points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
