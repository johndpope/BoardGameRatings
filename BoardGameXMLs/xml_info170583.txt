							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Capture: A Medieval Wargame</name>
									
			<description>Capture: A Medieval Wargame is a game in which players use armies made up of Knights and Soldiers in an attempt to locate and capture one of the enemy crowns in enemy territory and safely return the crown to their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally designed by first-timer Andrew Hunzicker way back in the 1980s, Capture was pitched to several big name companies but never saw the shelves. Only now is it seeing the light of day, having been given a beautiful makeover to help it grab the attention of gamers in 2015. Gameplay is in the style of &amp;quot;Capture The Flag&amp;quot; as you roll your dice to send your soldiers into the enemy's territory while also claiming cards from a deck that will hopefully give you the edge. Should you manage to steal an enemy crown, you'll race to return it to your own side of the board while also protecting your own, but watch out for the opposition forces that will swarm around you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capture also comes with a unique element, adding a need for dexterity as well as strategy. Each game comes with a pair of catapults that allow you to fling boulders at the opposition forces, should you have the card that allows you to do so. Knocking out a soldier will send them home, but it's not just the enemy that's under threat - should your own forces get hit, you'll have to send them back as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capture is a game that works with a wide range of gamer types, from children who delight in hurling boulders across the board to take out their parents' pieces, to experienced gamers who want to take the strategy element to the next level, only occasionally throwing in the chaos of the catapult!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
