			<description>Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) is a cooperative board game for 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These days, terrorism has grown rampant causing great loss of lives and destruction of property. Terrorist organization &amp;ldquo;HIJACK&amp;rdquo; led by its mastermind &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot; directs its target at Hong Kong, with a plan to deploy bomb attacks at densely populated areas (eg. schools, markets, hospitals and cultural centers) and strike fear among citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several years ago,  the EOD Unit was infiltrated by a mole from &amp;ldquo;HIJACK&amp;rdquo; to steal intelligence and disrupt the order of the police force. EOD unit must fight against this threat by finding out the mole and defusing all bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is the mole hidden in EOD? Where are the bombs? How to defuse the bombs safely? This game will bombard you with a series of questions while surrounding you in an air of suspense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
