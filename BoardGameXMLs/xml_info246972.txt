			<description>Each player on his turn plays a puzzle piece out of his hand of three. A piece can be played if it can be &amp;quot;associated&amp;quot; with at least one of the other pieces already on the table, along one of the two &amp;quot;variables&amp;quot; of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two &amp;quot;variables&amp;quot; are the color of each animal (white, black, brown, pink, green, white/black) and how it moves (two-legged, four-legged, flying, swimming).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two pegs of each puzzle piece only allows the interlocking with another piece belonging to the right category. For example, the panther can be associated with the gorilla (because they're both black) or with the polar bear (because they have four legs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But how do you win? Making the winning combinations before opponents, which are in all five different types and give different scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winning combinations and the corresponding prize tokens that you earn to keep track of the points are explained in detail in the rules of the game, but an example of a winning combination can be to complete a row playing the fourth and last animal of pink color, or completing a column by attaching the sixth and last animal that flies ... Easy, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
