							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartomancer RPG System Basic Rules</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cartomancer RPG System is perfect for encouraging actual&amp;nbsp;roleplaying&amp;nbsp;and storytelling as opposed to merely providing a setting for acquiring treasure or power.  In other words, this system is for those who value the craft of weaving together a great Story.  As a veteran tabletop RPG gamer and gamemaster, I put all of my passion and love of games into creating a system that is not only fun to play, but rewards Characters and Players who use their wits, not just their sword.  With the Cartomancer RPG System, the Fate of your character is literally in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
