							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cutlass of Cheese</name>
									
			<description>This is a dungeon crawl created by the same designer as &amp;quot;Cutlass of Fire&amp;quot; and made to poke fun at it. The rules are filled with funny references to the game itself and the previous game.  &lt;br/&gt;Squares are laid face down on the table and turned up as player put their pawns on them.  The player will encounter walls, monsters, skulls, fountains, and treasure chests.  By using cards for all actions except moving, the players battle monsters, find gems, and find spells, weapons and armor.  The players' ability to use the items depends on their skills. Spell skills are based on the known elements of the universe, namely: Cheese, Nougat, Lint, and Uranium 236. Weapon skills could be: Stabby, Pummely, Huckey, and Minty Fresh.  The number of hits a player or monster can take is called, &amp;quot;Chutzpah.&amp;quot;  The game ends when 7 gems are returned to 7 skulls (just like Cutlass of Fire) and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
