			<description>Dark Knights is a &amp;quot;press your luck&amp;quot; style dice game that is played with six dice. 3 dice are dark and 3 dice are light. The dark dice represent the lower scoring dice, and the light represent the higher scoring dice. A pen and paper are also needed for keeping score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are scored by matching numbers (or face values) on dice. The point value is determined by the numbers rolled as well as the shade of dice within the combination(s) set aside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
