			<description>A sequel game to SiegeStones is available from the publisher as a free download from the Siegestones website.  It uses the same components as that game, but focuses on capturing pieces rather than controlling area.  Towers (which can be built during play) are used to &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot; stones, which are moved to attack other pieces.  Stones support allied stones, adding defensive strategies.  Winner is the one who destroys the opponents' towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wasn't sure which &amp;quot;mechanics&amp;quot; boxes to check.  Players take turns deploying and moving pieces, which are used both to attack and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
