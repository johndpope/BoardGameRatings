			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Slugs&amp;quot; start falling from the sky, and you must defend yourself, lest the touch you and turn you into a slug, too!  Fortunately, you are an odd little creature that can fire pellets from the top of your head.  Tilt your device to cause your character to slide left or right.  The angle of the device also affects the angle at which you fire your pellets.  The pellets are limited, but you can pick them back up, if you can dodge the falling, jumping slugs to get to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time you finish off a slug, its eye pops out, which you can scoop up, in order to heal yourself.  Sometimes, the eye is a different color, which indicates either a temporary power-up, a temporary debility, a permanent upgrade, or one other nasty effect:  A purple eye that rolls along like any other, but any pellets it touches go away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is in stages, and the game increases in difficulty as you progress through the stages.  The slugs get [much] bigger, such that hitting one splits it into two smaller ones.  The ground itself becomes dangerous, fog rolls in, and every once in a while, you must protect your defenseless girlfriend.  Where you have 10 points of health and can take a minor beating, she is frail, and becomes a slug the instant they touch her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
