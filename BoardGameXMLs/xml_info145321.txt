			<description>The roletaking game Conjunction Point uses deck seeding and on-the-fly continuity to induce internally consistent interactions within the framework of its conspiratorial futuristic, dystopian game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By seeding location decks, players can attempt to induce characters, locations, missions, and other story threads of their choice to enter the game state, and by filtering through location decks, they can act within the game state to ultimately identify and counteract its narrative core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Conjunction Point, players, who start as defecting U.N. cyberagents or nanoagents, work against in-game timing pressures to trace the threads of the global conspiracy to their point of intersection, cooperating with sympathetic individuals and nationalist and subglobal groups to follow the deception to its ultimate goal. By adding to and enhancing their bionic capabilities as the game progresses, gaining advantages suitable to their styles of play, spheres of operation, and in-game personas, players can seed and sometimes filter through location decks, reinforcing aspects of the global conspiracy in other players&amp;rsquo; spheres of knowledge in order to sift truth from lies in their own spheres and, eventually, to lay bare the global deception in time to bring to bear forces sufficient to achieve its downfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
