			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mars Attacks!&lt;br/&gt;The War of the Worlds was only the beginning. In the wake of the alien invasion of 1898, the Martian metal, Aetherium, has greatly advanced the boundaries of science. Little did we know what the long term effects of exposure to it would be...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise of the Ravaged&lt;br/&gt;The year is now 1936. The Red War happened nearly 40 years ago and everything has changed. The cinematic world of the screen has bled into the streets and lines have been drawn as crisply as black and white. Secret societies struggle for control of the world. Masked avengers oppose them with eldritch words and Tommy guns. Fantastic treasures have been discovered in vine-laden ruins and tales cross the globe hinting at more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have felt Destiny&amp;rsquo;s Call. Ready to get Ravaged?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Edges and Hindrances help you craft a unique pulp hero.&lt;br/&gt;Defining Interests help you easily get a handle on your character. Simple setting rules clearly define exactly what it means to be Ravaged. An in-depth overview gets you quickly familiar with the world. Pulpspeak helps you learn the latest street lingo in no time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example archetypes let you leap into the action right away!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the GM&amp;rsquo;s section, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn details of Ravaged Earth including info on some of the more powerful villains, secret societies, and exotic locations. Guidelines help you design villains and tales that feel immediately part of the world, while the Randomatic Adventure Generator is standing by to help get those creative juices flowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rattle and Hum, an introductory adventure, is included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ravaged Earth is an open-ended game setting. All you need, besides this, are a few friends, some dice, some cards, and a copy of Savage Worlds to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
