							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fisherman&#039;s Knot Tying Game</name>
									
			<description>A game which efforts to educate and improve knot tying skills which are specific to fishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opponents attempt to tie the knot on the card drawn quicker than one another, without errors, using the materials provided in the game.  Whoever does so claims the points on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A vast array of multiple use knots for leader tying, snelling hooks, tying smaller leader line onto fly fishing line, along with standard knots for tying baits or hooks onto monofilament or braided line are included on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's educational, and handy to keep in one's tackle box for that matter, in case of a specific knot for a specific situation is needed.  Or, simply in case the fishing stinks...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
