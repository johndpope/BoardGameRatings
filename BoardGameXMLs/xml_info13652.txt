			<description>GSCII allows players to design their own ships, from the tiniest star fighter to the largest dreadnought. You can play games as small as a couple of gunboats to as large as massive fleets of capital ships. You get to use all of the cool special systems and attacks from the TV and movies - like ion beams, singularity missiles, transporters for boarding actions, tractor beams, cloaks, tunneling drives, scanners, assault pods, and mines - that the other games leave out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much is still to be added, and some further revisions and rules tweaking will continue to made for as long as people keep suggesting ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visit &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thanesgames.com/gsc2/gsc2main.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thanesgames.com/gsc2/gsc2main.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
