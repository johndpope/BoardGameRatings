			<description>A racing game with a theme of environmental protection. The first player to collect an eco medal on all six continents and to reach his/her starting location with 1.000 eco dollars wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players travel around the world to take part in environmental protection activities and by doing so, win eco medals. Open cards present the actions that have to be taken. There is one card fewer than there are players, so there is competition for actions.&lt;br/&gt;Movement on the board is determined by dice. One can choose to use only one dice and earn 200 dollars, or use two dice and earn no money, or one can pay 500 dollars to use the plane. When a player reaches the target destination, they earn an eco medal of this continent and the card is removed from the game and replaced with a new one. If a player lands on the same space as another, he/she can take away money or a medal from that player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player has earned a medal of each continent and reaches his/her home town with at least 1.000 eco dollars in his/her pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
