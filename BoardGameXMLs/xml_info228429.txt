							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Neil deGrasse Tyson Presents: Space Odyssey</name>
									
			<description>Players in Space Odyssey are tasks to create solar systems and larger stellar bodies in a virtual galaxy. This not only includes defining the planetary bodies within the system, but managing a space-farring species as it uses the resources from those stellar bodies to expand its civilization through research, production, and trade and make it successful. The game provides various challenges to players that, if completed successfully, rewards them with items to further help with their species. Players will be able to share their creations with others and visit the systems that others have made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson_Presents%3A_Space_Odyssey Neil deGrasse Tyson Presents: Space Odyssey]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
