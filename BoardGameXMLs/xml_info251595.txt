							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Homesteaders: New Beginnings</name>
									
			<description>The world is changing. Settlers spread westward across the American continent, and railroad companies follow. Back east, sweeping laws are passed, and tensions between the North and South escalate into a civil war. How will these events affect the humble inhabitants of a burgeoning frontier town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homesteaders: New Beginnings includes all the components needed to add a fifth player to the game. In addition, the expansion adds more auction and building tiles to give more variance to each play session. It has 25 &amp;quot;jumbo size&amp;quot; resource components, and each of these counts as five resources of normal size. Lastly, the expansion includes an event deck, with every round of the game altered slightly by an event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
