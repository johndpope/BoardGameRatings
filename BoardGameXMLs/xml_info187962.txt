							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Continental Realm of Ethaerios: Section 5</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills are usually taught through professional assistance, such as a savant, master, trainer, experienced individual, or even Sagelord as in the case of the Immortalist.  However, with the proper techniques and resources, anyone can be self-taught at an exponentially slow rate.  The student can never exceed the teacher's Skill Level because of the obvious fact that the teacher cannot provide training beyond his or her capabilities. Therefore, many students often seek out specialized and rare individuals to achieve Skill Levels beyond the 10th Skill Level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete setting was published as a series of three documents:  Section 1-4, Section 5, and Section 6.  This document includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Section 5 - Skills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
