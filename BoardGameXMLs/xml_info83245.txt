			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul desperately roamed the alleys looking for a vendor with what he needed. Booth after booth blurred by, each one having something similar but not the same. He twisted a handkerchief over and over again in his hands, his fingers working it and tying it into knots as his eyes darted over each stall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As he wandered down one alleyway a shrill scream filled the air, sending a sharp ring through Paul&amp;rsquo;s ears. He turned to see an old woman with the sweatshirt lying on the ground, her eyes glazed over and her skin ashen. A man rose from crouching near her body and surreptitiously closed a small vial as he walked away. The crowd parted around him for a moment before descending upon the body, hoping to find something of worth on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Struck by sudden greed, Paul fought his way through the scavengers. A quick glance gave him what he was after: the dirty sweatshirt the woman had tried to force on him yesterday. He snatched it and turned to disappear into the crowd. Finally he had his prize; the tattered piece of clothing was worthless yesterday, but it was suddenly worth a great deal more&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Collection of Horrors is an anthology of Storyteller tools inspired by the Horror Recognition Guide that you can either use in conjunction with the Guide or as part of your existing Hunter: The Vigil chronicle. You can get a free introduction here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each story kit in the Collection of Horrors (which you can buy individually, as a bundle or as a subscription) contains variety of appropriate tools; usually an SAS scene, a character with a character sheet, and props ranging from maps and reports to print out and hand to your players, to short imbedded audio files that you can play at your gaming table. These kits represent a collection of evocative story tools that you can write a story around, drop into an existing SAS or even string together. They aren&amp;rsquo;t stories in their own right, but rather pieces that you can snap together into whatever shape you want. Using the Guide can add even more props and ideas to this anthology, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required to use the various story kits in the Collection of Horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
