			<description>From Rules&lt;br/&gt;Goal: Be the first player to reach Executive Level, have $1 million in cash and securities (stocks, bonds and real estate), and be on a Security Trading Square (STS).  You achieve success by buying and selling securities at strategic times as the economy changes and being watchful of other players' positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard has some fixed spaces and some spaces that are holes that allow the middle level to be seen.  As the center wheel is turned, the text and actions allowed in the holes change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is particularly large at 22&amp;quot;x22&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
