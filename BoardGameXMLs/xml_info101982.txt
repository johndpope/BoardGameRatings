			<description>From the Developer Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JADE is the successor to ADOM. ADOMs implementation started in 1994 in C, JADE development begun in 2000 in Java. JADE is suffering from lack of time on my side but I&amp;rsquo;m committed to finally release an initial version in 2008. Keep your fingers crossed! JADE will try to improve ADOM in almost all respects by providing a much larger world (randomly generated) with an ecology, infrastructure, weather patterns, social behavioral patterns, cities, states and more. The basic idea is to provide a living and breathing world that takes the scope of the game far beyond treasure gathering and monster slaying (although you can do just that and nothing else if that is what you want - nonetheless there is an endless variety of other options available, too). JADE might be compared in some respects to Fable (although JADE has a much longer history), will have none of the stunning Fable graphics but even more depth and details if everything works out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
