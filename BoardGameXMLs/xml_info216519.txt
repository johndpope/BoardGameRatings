			<description>From the book cover:&lt;br/&gt;Features: Play with or without dice! &lt;br/&gt;A complete new, skill, ability, and spell system. Combat can be story driven with bonuses and play by play rolls, or quick and dirty with higher level skill rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore Virtual Reality as you attempt to hack through firewalls and other network security. &lt;br/&gt;Build your own space ship to haul cargo, transport people, or harry Conglomerate forces. &lt;br/&gt;Build your character from an extensive list of cybernetic upgrades, genetic modifications, or special abilities; or try to take on the world as a good old basic human being. Then switch to Kalijor and access an impressive list of spells and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as employees of any of the 'Big Five' corporations that make up the Conglomerate, trying to maintain order and harmony, or as the outcast Dissidents, trying to make ends meet on the fringes of society, or strike out against the Conglomerate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a science fiction campaign, a fantasy campaign, or move back and forth between worlds as your story requires. You decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
