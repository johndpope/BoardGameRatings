			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;30 seconds to drop zone,&amp;quot; the pilot said over the intercom, piercing the background hum of the Hercules' four engines. The soldiers stood up from their benches, beginning the final preparations for drop; checking parachutes, loading and re-loading guns and checking ammunition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;15 seconds to drop zone.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Captain walked down the length of the cabin, making eye contact with each of his men. As he reached the far end, he turned, back to the open ramp. He drew a combat knife from his hip and, in a motion that he had done a dozen times before, drew it across the palm of his hand, letting it drip to the floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;10 seconds.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeing the start of the ritual, the soldiers lining the cabin began to do the same, mouthing unspoken words of power as they did so. A palpable energy could be felt in the air as blood began to pool on the floor, and hitherto unseen runes and sigils began to glow on equipment and uniform as the blood ritual was completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;5 seconds.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ready?&amp;quot; Asked the Captain, stowing his knife and grabbing his gun before turning to the opening, not waiting for an answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Aye Captain.&amp;quot; Came the reply from his men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Drop.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerer-Captain Franklin smiled as he hurled himself from the back of the aircraft, feeling the air rush by as he plummeted towards the ground. Far below, in the jungles of Indonesia, he could see the faint outline of tracer fire. And there, visible for only a moment, a burst of eldritch fire. This was the place alright, he could feel it in his blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project M.A.G.I. is a campaign frame for Mortal Coil written by Andrew Kenrick, author of the indie RPG Dead of Night. Set in modern times, players take the role of elite magical special forces, sent in to deal with occult and supernatural threats that normal soldiers can't handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project M.A.G.I. is a fully sketched out setting in the form of a detailed theme document, with all of the world set-up choices written out in detail. The frame is customizable by your game group. You choose a tone, and pick the magic level that is appropriate for your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
