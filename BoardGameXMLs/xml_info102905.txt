			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;September 1944. Your squad has been scouting ahead of the division in an attempt to locate German Reinforcements reported to be gathering for a counterattack. Your squad has reached a small village at a vital crossroads. Headquarters has ordered you to stay put and report any enemy movement in the area.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in Victory Games Insider #7 (1985). This scenario provides an additional mission (Mission VI1: Traffic Control) for the original Ambush! game. The designer of this scenario, Paul Fasoldt, would go on to design the Ambush! Silver Star module in 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario includes rules for a new weapon type (the Flamethrower), along with 4 summaries for new vehicles (Armored Car with Light Machine Gun, Halftrack, Motorcycle with Sidecar, &amp;amp; Truck).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally the scenario comes with 3 pages of Paragraphs, 2 double-sided Mission Cartridges showing 4 conditions (printed on normal weight paper), and a sheet with 11 Character/Vehicle Cards (also printed on normal weight paper).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
