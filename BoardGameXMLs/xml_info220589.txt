			<description>Teddy Hedz, or THZ for short, is a card game in which you attempt to hit your opponent repeatedly with a range of soft plush toy animal heads. The victor is rewarded with the right to hit their opponent with a real plush toy animal head, adding humiliation to failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round has a build phase, a battle phase and a draw phase. In the build phase players set up defenses, boost their abilities or initiate a battle. If a battle is declared, all players participate in the battle phase; pitting the skills of their THZ, as well as a variety of Buffs, Environments, Interrupts and Bearicades, in a duel. Winner scores virtual SCONs against their opponent. At the end of the battle, all players draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach 10 SCONs &amp;mdash; or the player with the most SCONs when the cards run out &amp;mdash; wins and may claim the THZ to hurl at their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No actual teddy bears were harmed in the making of Teddy Hedz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
