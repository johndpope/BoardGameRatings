			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Contest Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Each player writes down 2-3 wishes on seperate index cards. The wishes can be anything he wishes had been, would be, or could be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All wishes go into a bowl, and each player draws one at random, which then becomes the Dream which drives his character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character exists in his own story. Characters do not need to exist in the same place, time frame, or even the same universe. Each player decides who his character is and when and where that character lives. He may reword his character's wish as seems appropriate for the character and setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The connection between the characters is in a theme that runs through all of their stories. Think of this theme as the the Title of a collection of short stories, each story featuring one of the characters in play. Players may choose a Title from the list, or agree on a new Title more appropriate to the Dreams forming their stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
