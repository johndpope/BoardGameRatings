							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pit</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color floorplan of a Sacrificial Pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Hex, Square and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Justice? Might is the only justice this world recognizes. Smite your foe and show me your righteousness if you wish to expunge the guilt for your crimes!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pit is a single map of a gladiatorial arena. One misstep on the center platform and the gladiator finds himself falling into a pit. The product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pit is intended for use in fantasy games. The various spiked towers give the product an alien feel that may make it appropriate for science fiction games as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure hook for use with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trial: A draconian emperor has captured one of the members of the group for a crime. Whether this crime was committed by the party member or not, the emperor demands a trial. Not in the court of law, but in the gladiatorial pit. The winner of the match who survives will be cleared of all charges, but the loser is judged guilty of his crimes. The rest of the group can buy tickets and watch, gamble on the match, or actively try and free their friend, possibly even allying with the opponent to fight the emperor and his guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
