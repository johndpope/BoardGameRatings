			<description>SimCopter is a 1996 computer game from Maxis. This game is a 3D offshoot from Maxis's normal fare, putting the player into a 3D city. Like Streets of SimCity, SimCopter lets the user import SimCity 2000 maps into the game. As the name suggests, SimCopter puts the player in the role of a helicopter pilot. There are two modes of play: free mode and career mode. The free mode lets the player import and fly through cities of their own or any of the 30 cities supplied with the game. However, user cities sometimes need to be designed with SimCopter in mind, and most of the time the player must increase the number of police stations, fire stations, and hospitals to allow for speedier dispatches. The career mode puts the player in the shoes of a pilot doing various jobs around a city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;SimCopter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Box Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly missions in the Metroplois&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attention SimCopter pilot. You're cleared for rooftop landing in SimCity 2000, where the local temperature is a balmy 678 degrees. That's because there's a five-alarm fire in progress, not to mention rampant riots and SimCitizens running for their SimLives. So soar through 30 built-in cities in hyper-realistic 3-D and perform your heroics and receive your rewards: a snazzier copter, a tougher mission and more near-death experiences. Or import your own SimCity 2000 cities and stamp out skyrocketing crime and permanent gridlock. Over and out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Help local police catch criminals and subdue full-scale riots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Do you put out the raging inferno or help the impaired Sims? Call on firefighters and ambulances for help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-With each successful mission you earn cash to buy better equipment and helicopters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Soar past SimCity 2000 skylines and view cities as never before -- from a stunning 3-D perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Get a 3-D, whirlybird's-eye-view of a SimCity 2000 city. Zoom down to see Sims waiting to be rescued from a shipwreck, or rioting in the streets, in realistic close-ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Tackle various missions in 30 pre-built cities: fight fires, collar criminals, chase down speeders, medevac injured Sims and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The skies get increasingly unfriendly; complete ten levels and soar to the Macropolis level for the ultimate challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Import your own SimCity 2000 cities, and go above and beyond urban planning. Action-packed missions emerge from your cities' own characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Make life-or-death decisions on the fly. Juggle multiple missions by calling ahead for police, fire and ambulance support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-SimCity 2000 not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
