							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Multi10 Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Multi10 is a simple, universal roleplaying system designed with contemporary or science fiction settings in mind; it can do fantasy but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t built to accommodate truly heroic/superhuman settings. Its name is directly derived from the dice mechanic it uses to resolve actions. Multi10 uses d10-based dice pools, rolling a number of dice equal to your attribute and multiplying the highest-scoring die by your skill rating to generate an action score. Most similar systems simply add the attribute and the skill rating together to calculate the size of the dice pool, but the multiplication twist makes skills quite important and prevents players from simply focusing on attributes to get large dice pools. A system of specialties that allows for high character customization further builds on this simple premise. Combat is fast, mostly realistic and deadly. The ability to perform quick or slow-but-precise attacks and spread actions over multiple phases adds a tactical element to battles without resorting to long and cumbersome lists of special actions and manoeuvres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
