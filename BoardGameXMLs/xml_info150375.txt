			<description>Invasion Z is a Zombie Survival Game. The story is about an outbreak of Zombie-like creatures after a Meteor disintegrates in the atmosphere raining a strange color into Buenos Aires City. This rain causes the population to get sick and then die, only to become the dreaded ghouls that crave for the flesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay has 5 basic steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) MAINTENCANCE: Operatives untap all the used items and Profile card, and Mission penalties are applied to the main Counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) OPERATIVES STEP: Heroes move around the board, hunting zombies, rescueing people, finding useful items and trying to avoid the inevitable fate that awaits them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) ZOMBIES MOVE: All zombies move closer to the base in the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) EVENTS STEP: Depending on the levels of the Event Counter one or two events might happen. A special die is rolled and the event takes effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5) ZOMBIE STEP: Depending on the levels of the Zombie Counter one or two extra zombies will be added to the Zombie Roll. Usually 1 die per rescuer is roll (between 3 and 4 die total) plus any extra die added by the Zombie Counter placing zombies in the suburbs of the map. A 6 rolled is a miss and do not adds any zombie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to rescue the 8 survivors that stand hidden on the locations of the outer ring of the board and then return to the center tile to be retrieved by the rescue team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heroes lose if at any time there are 3 zombies on the central location tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Items deck works as a counter that will increase the difficulty as the game progresses with some &amp;quot;bad luck&amp;quot; cards that can be a devastating force against the heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ways of losing the game and only one way to win so usually players will feel very rewarded when they win as it&amp;acute;s usually on the edge of oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
