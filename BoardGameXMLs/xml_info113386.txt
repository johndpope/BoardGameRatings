							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Card Chase</name>
									
			<description>The goal of the game is to utilize the deck of standard playing cards in order to be the first to get your four color-coded pegs all the way around the board, and finally back to your safety zone base before any other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the card you play during your turn, determines the amount of movement one of your pegs may move. Landing on an opposing players peg causes their peg to be returned to their home/starting location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the cards played have special abilities that can be used in a strategic manner, such as plying a 4, which allows one of your pegs to move four spaces backwards instead of forwards. You can also play a jack, which allows your to switch the places of any two pegs on the board, which do not even have to be your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Includes:&lt;br/&gt;- Wooden Gameboard&lt;br/&gt;- 16 Pegs of Four Different Colors&lt;br/&gt;- Deck of Standard Playing Cards&lt;br/&gt;- Rules Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
