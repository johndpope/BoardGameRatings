			<description>Sprout is a cooperative game for 2 to 5 players that can be played with a Shibumi set. It uses a 4&amp;times;4 set of stacking spheres in 3 colors. It can also be played as a solitaire game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The completed Shibumi pyramid symbolizes the branches of a cherry blossom tree that grow and prosper. They can sprout horizontally or diagonally upwards, but must not break or tangle unnaturally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim: All players win by placing the thirtieth ball, thus completing the pyramid, without losing the game in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Place all 48 balls (16 of each color) in the bag. Each player draws a ball at random and holds it so that everyone can see it. The player who first recites a haiku or poem about beauty plays first. Choose difficulty, Easy, Medium or Hard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: When a player's turn comes, he must place the ball he holds on any hole on the Shibumi board or on top of a 2&amp;times;2 platform created by balls. He then draws a new random ball and play continues counter-clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sprout, unlike other Shibumi games, dropping a ball is not allowed. You never remove balls from the pyramid you build as branches of a cherry blossom tree cannot be cut by themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Loss: The players lose the game in two ways&lt;br/&gt;1) If, at any time, two balls of the same color on the same level are diagonally next to each other (break)&lt;br/&gt;2) If, at any time, a ball is placed on an upper level and there are two balls of the same color adjacent to one in the lower-level platform (tangle)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wish: During their turn, any player may use one of the team's wishes to put the ball he holds in the bag and draw a new one of the color of his choice. If you chose the Easy difficulty, the team has 3 wishes. If you chose Medium, the team has 2 wishes, while if you chose Hard you have only 1 wish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Etiquette: The players are generally not allowed to speak about the game, suggest moves and interrupt a player's thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exception to this are the ancestors. After a ball is placed, any player other than the player who placed it is allowed to appeal to an ancestor and explain, in a few words, why this is a bad move and suggest a better one. The player who placed the ball then chooses to take the ball back or leave it be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player may only appeal to his ancestors twice per game. Beyond that he must silence out of respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an entry for the Shibumi Challenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beautiful the trees&lt;br/&gt;When winter leaves, spring arrives&lt;br/&gt;Colors fill the land&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
