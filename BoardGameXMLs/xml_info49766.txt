							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AT-43 Tactics</name>
									
			<description>AT-43 Tactics is the roleplaying supplement for use with the AT-43 miniatures wargame published by Rackham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the tabletop miniatures game, AT-43 Tactics is intended to be played by small units of 3-6 player characters (PCs), while a &amp;quot;Game Leader&amp;quot; (GL) provides the impartial challenge of the missions this unit undertakes. As with many roleplaying systems, PCs gain experience points and levels from mission to mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally speaking, players take on specific roles within the unit: officer/leader, mechanic, medic, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the AT-43 Tactics book are six missions comprising a short campaign. GLs are encouraged, of course, to create their own missions or run those currently available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final two pages of the book are a photocopyable page of terrain cards (doors and nodes) and a punch-out set of simple terrain (ramps/bridges and a variety of items detailed in the rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information on the world of AT-43 as well as the essential mechanics of combat, see the boardgamegeek entry for AT-43 and its many supplements.  Many of these books, expansions, unit boxes, etc are indispensable for an indepth AT-43 Tactics campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
