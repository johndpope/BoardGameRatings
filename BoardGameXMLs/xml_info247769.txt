							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Horror of Merehurst</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Horror of Merehurst is an OSRIC(tm) module designed for 6-10 adventurers of First Level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The island of Merehurst was once a bustling center for trade. But this was not to last, for in one single deadly night sixty years ago all the people and the animals of the town died - collapsing where they stood. The neighboring villagers of Coombe claimed that the miners dug too deeply into Ynyswel and the spirit of the isle was offended. The island gained a fearsome reputation and only the bravest would dare set foot upon its forested grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday strange lights were seen in the sky over the island and Ynyswel started smoking. The villagers can wait no longer. Brave adventurers must be found who are willing to investigate the Isle of Merehurst to either appease or oppose what lies behind the latest mysterious activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
