			<description>Very unusual board game from the late 70's. Each player is a mountaineer and must climb the Mont Blanc to win the game. However, the player has to earn experience points to get the skills to climb mountains, so there are 22 mountains to conquer. Each climb is harder than the previous one. You don'&amp;Auml;t have to climb them all, you can choose which to climb. You might, for example, climb Number One (Aiguille du Belv&amp;eacute;d&amp;egrave;re) successfully, and then try Number Four (Aiguille Purtscheller), and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each climb is illustrated for the player, with various points along the route when equipment (Alea) cards might be asked for, the more equipment you have, the better for you. And the Descent (Rappel) might cause you problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is very attractive, showing the mountain ranges. There is a curious box in the right hand corner, on which you place two tiny green frogs. These frogs move during the game and when they reach certain points on the track, the weather changes (Meteo). This weather change can be catastrophic. You might not to be able to get down a mountain you have climbed and a helicopter might be needed to get you off the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game looks great with all the Climbs being illustrated in some detail. The playing pieces look good but are completely impractible. They are plastic Picks, in 6 colours. And they fall over far too easily. And not to forget, the two green frogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In my game there was a card asking me to buy their next game, which would be about skiing. However, I got no reply and I never did see a second game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
