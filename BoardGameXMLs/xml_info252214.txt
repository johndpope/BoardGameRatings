							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Wizards of Greesly Keep</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High up in the mountains, the wizards of Greesly Keep have trained generations of new magic users in secret. Only the best and the brightest young minds were admitted to their exclusive academy. And then, something went terribly wrong. Some time ago, the residents of the neighbouring town of Mumbleton heard a tremendous explosion emanate from the Keep and since that day, the wizards and their apprentices have remained locked up in their craggy home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The townsfolk have also noticed a black cloud has appeared over Greesly&amp;rsquo;s tallest tower. And the cloud is growing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s never a good sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
