			<description>User Summary: Submission for the Game Chef 2010 Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos Lords and the Desert of Death, from here on referred to as Chaos Lords, is a beer and pretzels, completely over-the-top, science fantasy role playing game that should not be taken too seriously. What exactly does that mean?&lt;br/&gt;● Beer and Pretzels game: Simple mechanics, simple characters, almost no math beyond basic addition and dividing by two, and a setting that fully accepts unexpected characters.&lt;br/&gt;● Completely over-the-top: The goal of the game is to ride out from the Last City with your group of heroes, destroy hordes of Death&amp;rsquo;s minions, and, if you make it far enough, destroy Death itself. Who are these heroes? Just about anything you can dream up. In Appendix A, you will find a few sample characters, including a Viking warchief, the Martian alchemist responsible for destroying most of the dinosaurs on Earth, and a walking war machine being controlled by a brain cloned from Abraham Lincoln.&lt;br/&gt;● Science Fantasy: Alchemists and cloned brains...&lt;br/&gt;● Should not be taken too seriously: ... of former presidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
