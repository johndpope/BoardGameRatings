							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hu√≠da del Imperio Cobra II</name>
									
			<description>&amp;lt;Translated from the back of the box in Spanish&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from Cobra Imperium is a game for &amp;quot;heroes&amp;quot; from Ages 2 and up. It can be played for 2 to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heroes must try to escape from the temple crypt before it closes his doors. If the crypt closes, the heroes are kept shut out of the crypt forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the heroes pull down the &amp;quot;Magic Eye&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;Big Cobra&amp;quot; comes back to life and the computers take over the command switching of the safety system that close the doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a short time the crypt will be closed. The heroes must destroy the Cobra and bring back with them the &amp;quot;Magic Eye&amp;quot; that they first lost when escaping from her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a standard roll and move fare with the added twist that one of the gamers controls the forces of evil and attempts to stop all of the other players from winning. It was originally published in Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
