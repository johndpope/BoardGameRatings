							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mecha: Combiners</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not Strong Enough on My Own&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle field is a lonely place.  As an elite mecha pilot, it&amp;rsquo;s your job to win every battle piloting your twenty foot tall mechanical warrior.  But sometimes, one mecha is not enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Enemy is Too Powerful&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kami spirits infesting feudal Japan, dishonorable generals turned traitor, teams of super villains bound by destiny to work together, horrible magical creations forged by unimaginable energies, alien societies protected by mechanical soldiers, and teams of lawyers hell bent on taking your family restaurant&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the enemies that await you and your mecha and each are too strong for you to face alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We Must Combine!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mecha Combiners is the long anticipated supplement for the Mecha role playing game.  This book gives Mecha players everything they need to create their own combiner, a super robot formed by other mecha joining together.  Combiners also features new super robot Configurations--special equipment the Combiner can use to form fiery swords, energy boomerangs and leap across the field in a single jump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a full Combiners setting, where players take on the role of ronin who are out to defeat a possessed general who turned against his former master and murdered him.  Let your mecha pilots fight amongst these tattered ruins of feudal Japan or create your own setting with guidelines included in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal and Flesh, Live and Die, Combined Together as One&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now&amp;hellip;go fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
