							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jones in the Fast Lane</name>
									
			<description>Jones in the Fast Lane is a life simulation game developed and published by Sierra Entertainment in 1990. The objective of the game is to attain as much money, happiness, status and education as necessary to win. The exact amounts needed are set up by the players before the game began. The game's name and goals are a play on the concept of keeping up with the Joneses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game world is represented by a board game-like ring of buildings in squares, resembling a cross between Monopoly and The Game of Life. The player, represented by a coloured marble on the board, is free to move around, only limited by the time remaining per turn. Time is used up by moving to a new location and performing actions like working, attending class, or resting. Each turn represents a week of the player's life. The player only gets to decide what their character would do during the week. On the weekends, the character experiences an &amp;quot;Oh What a Weekend&amp;quot; event and spend a certain amount of money (usually less than $200). These events are usually based upon a purchase that the player had made during their previous &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;, such as attending a show if the player purchased theater and/or concert tickets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Jones in the Fast Lane , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
