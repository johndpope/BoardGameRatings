			<description>The board contains some hidden electronics which when two adjacent spaces are pressed will either cause the &amp;quot;Core Master&amp;quot; to light up and make noise - or not.  Players move around the board and attack each other whenever they get next to another player by pressing down on both figures.  If the &amp;quot;Core Master&amp;quot; goes off, then the defending player is removed from the board.  Game continues until all but one player is wiped out.  The surface of the board can rotate to a number of different positions so that the pattern of which spaces are active and which are not can be changed between games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
