			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spellbinder's Sourcebook contains 50 arcane spells. Wizards, sorcerers and any other arcane caster can find dozens of useful and innovative spells within these pages. Amazing new spells such as creeping shadows are presented for illusionists. Horrible new necromancies like vampiric youth and death shadow, which plagues the target with a life-draining parasite are also included in this collection. There are also spells designed for transmuters such as Invulnerability and acid reflex attack. There are several spells that manipulate the flow of time in this collection as well. Spells like time leap, time stall, and time sense can give a caster control over the most powerful force of all--Time. There are many new spells for diviners, conjurers and evokers in this collection as well. For example, the deadly 8th level spell entropic blade is a powerful conjuration that inflicts excessive suffering on lawful creatures.&lt;br/&gt;The Spellbinder's Sourcebook also features several original spells that first appeared in the Primal Codex and the Book of Broken Dreams. These spells are revised and updated to the 3.5 version of the core rules and feature several adjustments and clarifications These spells include many of the most useful and original spells from those titles such as encumbering load, instant karma, salty wounds, giant strength, hand of doom and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spellbinder's Sourcebook also features a new template, the war beast. Two new spells are included that relate to the war beast template, one that creates the war beasts and one that summons them. A sample war pig is included as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
