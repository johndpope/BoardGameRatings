			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protect Your Brand (the card game) pits 2-5 brand managers against one another to stay viable in the social media dominated millennial rat race we call life. Utilize your best assets and hand off liabilities to your rivals to stay on top in this competitive card game companion to Mush's musical release, &amp;quot;Protect Your Brand.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tracks their Viability (health) with an included card, starting the game with 3. The double-sided cards function as Assets, granting positive points and abilities, or Liabilities, subtracting points from opponents or triggering detrimental abilities. A round ends when all dealt cards are exhausted, and each player except the one with the most points loses Viability. If a player reaches 0 Viability, they are eliminated from the game. This often leads to players being eliminated in staggered waves, since multiple players are losing Viability at varied rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all but one player has exhausted their brand's Viability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
