			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game tells a story about what happened when a dragon came to an insignificant village and demanded that the residents paid it a tribute or faced its wrath; some saw this an opportunity to make a better life for themselves by ingratiating themselves with the dragon. Some saw it as a chance to avenge the wrongs they felt had been done them and petitioned the dragon to act as&lt;br/&gt;executioner. Some felt that capitulating to this monster made them less than human and vowed to fight it to their very last breath. When you play this game, you will find out which villagers did what, how the dragon reacted and what became of them all in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
