							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Multimatch IV</name>
									
			<description>Multimatch I and II deals with square tiles, while  Multimatch III and IV concerns triangular tiles. &lt;br/&gt;The box of Multimatch IV contains a plastic hexagonal trail, and an acrylic set of Trioker four-colour triangles. Instead of showing dots, the triangles corners are coloured in plain colours.&lt;br/&gt;The 1994 edition Kadon rulebook contains a large section of puzzles, and rules for 3 games, plus variants.  The two first games are the same that those of Multimatch II.&lt;br/&gt;Multimatch. Players take turns placing tiles on the hexagonal trail. Edges must match and the first piece must be placed on a border. Last to play wins.&lt;br/&gt;Outmatched. Players share the tiles at random and then race to assemble their group into a symmetrical shape, with edges matching.&lt;br/&gt;Hexagonal Match. The four solid-colour tiles are set as starter pieces. Players draw tiles and play them at their turn trying to complete a 6 tiles hexagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
