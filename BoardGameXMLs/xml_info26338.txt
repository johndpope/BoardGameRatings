			<description>Each player places his 2 tokens in the middle of the game board (djungle) and tries to be the first, who leaves the board with both tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The djungle is covered with a grid showing 9 x 13 intercept points in  5 colors. The tokens move on the intercept points, but the die does not determine the distance of a move, but the direction! 1-4 are used for the 4 straight directions, 5 and 6 enable diagonal moves towards both sides from the starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White intercept points are neutral, red and black ones reduce or increase the moving speed, yellow and blue ones enable to draw 1 of the 40 yellow or blue cards included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards reduce the luck factor, because they allow to change the result of the die roll in most cases (yellow card instructions must be followed immediately, blue card can be kept for later use).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
