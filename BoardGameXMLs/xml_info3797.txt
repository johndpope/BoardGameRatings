							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grade Up to Elite Cow</name>
									
			<description>A promotional/educational game &amp;quot;of skill and chance for Dairy Farmers&amp;quot; made by Waddingtons of behalf of &amp;quot;The British Friesian Cattle Society of Great Britain and Ireland&amp;quot; as a fundraising exercise in which proceeds from the game went to the Y.M.A (Young Members Association) of the said Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players attempt to gradually &amp;quot;grade up&amp;quot; their mixed non-pedigree and pedigree dairy herd to achieve pedigree status in just three generations. The mechanism for doing so involves following the real life process of getting female offspring from an animal that is considered typical of the breed and showing no obvious signs of cross breeding (and thus qualified to be entered in the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; Section of the Supplementary Register of the Herd Book maintained by the Society as ASR). These female offspring would be qualified to be entered in the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; Section of the Supplementary Register as BSR cows, and their pure bred offspring would in turn qualify as CSR animals. The daughters of CSR animals can then be registered in the Herd Book proper and become full pedigree cows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full pedigree animals that achieve certain standards of milk and butterfat production then can be entered into the Register of Merit (can carry the suffix RM) and an RM cow that has calved at least three times, had two yearly yields entered in the RM and has at least 76 point in Type Classification (out of 100 in a system of grading desired breed characteristics) in turn qualifies as an RMX standard cow (X for Excellent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RMX cows who achieve a lifetime milk yield of at least 50 long tonnes and have scored at least 85 point in Type Classification finally qualify to grade up to Elite Cow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object in simplified game terms is to be the first player to grade up at least 4 cows (out of a starting 6) to that Elite Cow status and thus win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
