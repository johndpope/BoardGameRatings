			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new concept in games. HIJACK is a skilful combination of arcade, strategy and simulation. The game sets you up in charge of a Pentagon department, the Hijack Division, dedicated to stamping out terrorism by peaceful means.&lt;br/&gt;HIJACK is played using live action and complex windowing techniques as you fight a desperate struggle against bureaucracy to end a hijacking before all hell is let loose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hijack places the player in the role of the head of an anti-terrorist Hijack Division of the US Government. Terrorists have set a deadline and your job is to defeat them in one of three ways - 1) Raising enough money to pay them off, 2) Raising enough political power to persuade them to give in or 3) Raising a large enough military force to scare them into submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is achieved through working with other members of government. Some are more senior that you, such as the President, others are at the same level as you and others are subordinate. Working to gain their loyalty and respect, and using their different skills is one of the key aspects of the game. Choosing how much time to spend on different activities is also important. For example, the CIA agent can gather intelligence, but a hastily prepared report will only give details of the terrorist demands, while allowing more time for a longer report will give information of potential bargaining tactics and who they are working for. But of course by the time you receive the detailed report, you may not have time to act upon it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you gain the confidence of the different members of staff, they may grant you three digit codes which allow additional options to be used. These codes may also be found by examining documents, etc. The ultimate three digit code is provided by the President when he has enough confidence that you will be able to resolve the situation. This code activates the door to the helicopter pad, which allows you and certain picked advisers to travel to the scene of the hijack in an attempt to deal with the terrorists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout, keeping the press on-side is also important. Neglect them or having high-profile failures will result in negative headlines. If things get too bad, the President may decide to fire you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program &amp;amp; Graphics: David Shea of Paradise Software&lt;br/&gt;Game Design: Mark Eyles&lt;br/&gt;Animation: Nigel Brownjohn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
