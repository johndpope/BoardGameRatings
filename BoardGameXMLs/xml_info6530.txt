							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Oxfurd Bluff</name>
									
			<description>There are a number of word games, of varying difficulty, on the market, but none Words has encountered has the appeal of Oxfurd Bluff, a creation of Manvers Games Inc. of Toronto.  Ignore the game's trifling title and press on; there is much here to tantalize and fascinate word freaks. (And we'll skip the details on the rules; they're easily grasped. There is a strong element of guesswork and chance involved.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, &amp;quot;must&amp;quot; is defined on one of the game's cards as (1) in law, an exception to a standard code or doctrine; (2) an elephant in heat; (3) the juice of various fruits before fermentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number two is correct (an awesome &amp;quot;must&amp;quot;), as is number 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Taken from a review of the game by Lew Gloin in The Toronto Star - Sunday, July 14, 1985)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
