Players take turns rolling 10 dice to get the best poker hand.  Each roll however forces you to choose to play safe or go for broke by going ROGUE. The goal is to get maximum points either by following suit or playing by your gut feeling. The game ends when all players have finished all 10 rows and points are tallied.  Ages 8 and up. 1 or more Players.&lt;br/&gt;                                  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; Consists of:&lt;br/&gt;Each game consists of 10 dice for a total of 60 sides. 52 of the sides are similar to normal playing cards (K&amp;spades; 9&amp;hearts; 10&amp;clubs; 8&amp;spades; and so on).
