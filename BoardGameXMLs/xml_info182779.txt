			<description>A turn based two player game of naval warfare where the two players try to sink each other&amp;rsquo;s hidden ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A divider is place between the two players so they cannot see each other&amp;rsquo;s fleet which consists of five ships &amp;ndash; one carrier, one battleship, two torpedo boats, and three submarines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player lays out his ships (occupying between 2-5 squares) on a plastic frame that consists of two grid sections (one larger &amp;ndash; the ocean, one smaller &amp;ndash; the target control area) with the ships occupying the larger section. Each grid section has numbers (1-10) across the top and letters (A-J) down the side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After deciding who goes first, the first player calls a shot on his opponent&amp;rsquo;s ocean grid, say E7. His opponent must declare a hit if the grid square is occupied by a ship or a miss if it is not. The player that fired marks the grid number on his target control area with a Red bomb if it is a hit or a White bomb if it is a miss. Then the second player takes his turn, with either a hit or a miss being declared by the first player and the results recorded by the second player. Turns are taken until all the ships in one players fleet have been sunk. The five ships have a total of 21 hits. Each player keeps track of the number of hits he has made and declares himself the winner if his target control area has 21 Red bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is very similar to Battleship, but based on the art and packaging was most likely published before Battleship, between the late 1950's and the mid-1960's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
