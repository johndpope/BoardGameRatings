							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curse of the Iron Sword</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The winds of fear are blowing across the moors outside Vacelonia. This land is home to many, ruled by a wise King. His bloodline has ever shared their realm with Elves, Wizards and many other Mystics, creating a legacy steeped in magic and mystery. Yet all things move in Seasons, and twilight fell, the King&amp;rsquo;s Champion betraying him and bringing war to the land. That was long ago, and Men have used the magic of song and story to change this truth into a mere legend. But time has a way of whispering its secrets to those who can bring them back to the light. Can your band learn the truth about what happened? Can you survive the curse of the Iron Sword?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
