			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hazon was published in early 1988 as a public post in ASCII text format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have six Abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Will Power) with Scores.  Scores are distributed form a point pool of d100 + 360 by player fiat.  All non-human races have an Ability Score cap on two to four Abilities, ranging from 90-120 (70 is average).  Ability Scores are used on a single table that determines an Ability Bonus for every Ability, ranging from -15 to +40 (0 is average).  Hit Points are determined by a formula with an added 3d10 (23 is average).  Characters also select Skills which improve through Training or Experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-trivial actions are resolved by comparing a d100 roll added to Ability Bonus added to Skill Bonus to a Difficulty determined by the GM.  Combat is handled as &amp;quot;a glorified performance roll&amp;quot; with additional modifiers.  If successful, a hit's damage is determined from how much the modified roll exceeded the Difficulty.  Criticals and fumbles are supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
