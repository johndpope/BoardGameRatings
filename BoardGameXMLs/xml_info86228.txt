							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mighty Final Fight</name>
									
			<description>In contrast to the original arcade game, Mighty Final Fight can only be played by a single player. But unlike the SNES ports, all three main characters from the arcade game are present in a single edition. The player can choose between Cody, a street brawler who fights using a self-made martial art combining Karate and Boxing; Guy, an agile master of Ninjutsu; or Haggar, a former professional wrestler. The three main characters retain almost all of their abilities from the arcade game, with some aesthetic differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game introduces a leveling system in which the player gains experience points by defeating enemies. The number of experience points awarded after defeating an enemy is depended on the finishing move used by the player, with stronger moves giving more points. After accumulating a certain amount of experience points, the player will move to the next level, increasing their attack power and maximum vitality. There are six skill levels in total: Cody and Guy both begin the game at the first skill level, while Haggar begins at Level 3. When the player character reaches Level 4, they will receive an additional special attack which can be performed by rapidly pressing the directional pad left or right and the attack button at the same time. The new move the player gets varies between each character: Cody gains the &amp;quot;Tornado Sweep&amp;quot; energy projectile attack, Guy gets the &amp;quot;Tornado Kick&amp;quot;, and Haggar's extra move is the &amp;quot;Running Clothesline&amp;quot; (also known as the &amp;quot;Scramble Haggar Press&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power-up items are also featured, which includes vitality-restoring food items, extra lives, and even additional chances to continue after a game over. Weapons can also be obtained, but unlike the arcade version, the weapon the player can obtain are dependent on the character. Cody will get a knife, Guy can uses a set of shurikens, and Haggar will obtain an over-sized mallet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of five stages, as well as two bonus rounds, where the player will encounter child-like counterparts of the Mad Gear members from the original game, including bosses such as Damnd (renamed Thrasher in the English localization), Sodom (Katana), and Abigail. The final boss is a cyborg version of Belger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mighty Final Fight,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
