			<description>This is a distant relative of Battleship.  Each player deploys four agents over a world map.  Then, using probes you try to deduce the position of the enemy agents before he deduces the positions of yours.  Basically, when you probe a grid location, the opponent announces how many of his agents can be reached in a straight line (including diagonals) from the probed location --excluding any of his agents which may be hidden behind others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some extra complications occur because both are playing on the same map: for example, you may not probe where the opponent has probed, which opens up strategic opportunities...  &amp;quot;Checkpoint: Danger!&amp;quot; is what you call out when you're convinced one of his agents is in the same location as one of yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
