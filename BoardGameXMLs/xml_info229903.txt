			<description>A dice and card game of civilization building for 2-4+ players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of 8 six-sided dice and share 6 common decks of cards:&lt;br/&gt;-    The Leader, Wonder, Culture and Resources decks each have cards with a Victory Points (VP) value between 1 and 25, but may score additional VP in combination with other cards (from the same or different decks) or have other special abilities.  &lt;br/&gt;-     Disaster Deck.  These cards have a VP value between -1 and -25 and have negative effects such as losing leaders or wonders, starvation or being attacked by barbarians.  Players should do their best to avoid acquiring disasters. &lt;br/&gt;-     Conquest Deck.  These cards have a VP value between 1 and 25 but no special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is divided into phases:&lt;br/&gt;1.    All players roll their dice simultaneously. &lt;br/&gt;2.    Players may re-roll some, all, or none of their dice. &lt;br/&gt;3.    Players may a second time re-roll some, all, or none of their dice. &lt;br/&gt;4.    The player who rolled the most ones gets the top Leader card. &lt;br/&gt;5.    The player who rolled the most twos gets the top Wonder card. &lt;br/&gt;6.    The player who rolled the most threes gets the top Conquest card. &lt;br/&gt;7.    The player who rolled the most fours gets the top Resource card. &lt;br/&gt;8.    The player who rolled the most fives gets the top Culture card. &lt;br/&gt;9.    The player who rolled the most sixes gets the top Disaster card. &lt;br/&gt;If there is a tie in any category, the tied players roll one die each. Highest roll wins the tiebreaker.&lt;br/&gt;Players put the cards they have won in front of themselves, visible to all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 20 turns. Each card has a Victory Point (VP) value.  Each player adds up the points of all their cards to get a VP total. The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
