			<description>Touch, Parker Brothers' game of palmistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Maxine Lucille Fiel has studied scientific hand reading and palmistry for 15 years . . . Maxine claims that the hand is like a graph that reflects the emotional and physical changes in the body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Touch is intended as a group game for parties or other gatherings. It can, however, be played solitaire since it is basically a detailed guide to palm reading and analysis.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a set of oversized cards illustrating different categories of markings on the hand and a pad of Profile Sheets for recording which markings appear on a player's hand. The personality characteristic for each type of marking is listed in the game booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The brief rules suggest that players break into groups and work on figuring out the what markings appear on their hands. Once these have been marked down on profile sheets, all of the sheets are gathered and the interpretations are read from the game booklet. The rules suggest that you read the analysis aloud and let your friends try to guess who is being described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
