			<description>Amazing Tater is a puzzle video game for the Game Boy from Atlus. The game features a password system. It is the sequel to Kwirk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must guide a potato to the exit of each level, which consists of several obstacles. By pushing crates, the player fills up holes that can then be crossed. Different shaped crates and holes create puzzle like situations. The player must also manipulate rotation devices to reach the goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different modes in the game. These include a practice mode, a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; puzzle mode, a mode specially designed for beginning players and an &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; mode containing two stories (either Mega Picnic or Puzzle Forest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Amazing Tater&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
