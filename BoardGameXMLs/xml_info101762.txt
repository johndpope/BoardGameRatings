							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">L-Gammon</name>
									
			<description>This is game #19 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a variant on Backgammon adopted to an 8x4 board and in two dimensions.  The name comes from the the L-type shape that the movement of pieces resemble during their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is similar to regular Backgammon, except that spaces on the board can totally block the movement of enemy pieces, unless doubles are rolled.  In addition, pieces start off the board in a reserve, and enter the board through a player's a home space, as game progresses.  Besides this, when pieces are hit, they are sent back to the reserve area, rather than a bar (L-Gammon doesn't utilize a bar).  A player only bears off pieces when they have none in their reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has the feel of regular backgammon, but the 2 dimensions adds increased tactical considerations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
