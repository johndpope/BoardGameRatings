							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Invaders</name>
									
			<description>Game given away in the first edition of the U.K. magazine, The Gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board represents a Space Invaders layout, broken up into squares. One player is the Planet Player (otherwise known as the PP) and the other is the Aliens Player (AP of course). The Aliens are represented by a single card that starts at the top and then will move across the board and down, just like the real thing. The PP gets to fire first and if he hits any aliens, they are marked off the card with a wax crayon. Then the AP gets to drop bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On any one turn, the PP can fire four shots or he may move to any space along the baseline and get two shots only. A die is used to indicate successful hits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PP player wins if he destroys all the Aliens. The AP player wins if he can get just one alien to touch the baseline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants are included for using two dice and for adapting the game for three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
