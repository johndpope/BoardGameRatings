							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters (Probably) Stole My Princess</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters (probably) stole The Duke's princess!  Each level pits you, an irreverent vampire, against a different monster in a tall vertical chamber with several platforms.  To defeat the monster you must jump quickly from platform to platform, up the chamber.  There is a strong emphasis on &amp;quot;combos&amp;quot;, which are accumulated by touching as many platforms as possible exactly once.  The higher your combo, the more points you get and the more extravagant your finishing attack on the monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game has only a small number of levels, the game encourages you to play each level several times to maximize your score.  There is also a challenge mode, outside of the main game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
