							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fast-Action Horse Racing</name>
									
			<description>Fast-Action Games created many &amp;quot;quick-play&amp;quot; sports simulations where the outcome of a contest could be decided with just one or two dice rolls.  These games made it easy to play an entire series of games in a matter of just a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game covers horse racing, something the designer knows quite a bit about, having created supplements to Avalon Hill's Win Place &amp;amp; Show game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
