							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poochie Giant Card Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poochie challenges players to a friendly game of tug-of-war.  The object of play is to build the longest length of rope between Poochie and her boyfriend, Fastball.  Players take turns drawing cards and placing them in a row in front of them.  When a player has a Poochie card at one end and a Fastball card at the other end, she is out of play.  The remaining players continue play until they have also completed their ropes and dropped out of play.  The winner is the player with the most rope cards between the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
