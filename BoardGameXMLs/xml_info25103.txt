			<description>A game made up real-time by Captain James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner,  during the Star Trek episode &amp;quot;A Piece of the Action&amp;quot;. The game was described as a trick-taking card game with an increasingly confused set of rules, intended to allow the Enterprise crew to gain control of the situation. Multiple versions of the full rules have been posted online and the game is played by Trekkers at most Star Trek conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
