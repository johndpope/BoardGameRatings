							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Codename: Spandex</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Codename: Spandex is a retro-clone game that emulates the game mechanics of another out-of-print game without using any of the copyrighted artistic presentation. For legal reasons, the name of the game being emulated is not mentioned anywhere within this site or within Codename: Spandex itself. However, this doesn't matter. If you know the game then you will pretty much instantly recognise it, and if you don't know the game then it doesn't matter - you can play Codename: Spandex on its own merits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Codename: Spandex concentrates on handling one power level of super heroes well, rather than trying to cover all types of hero from the lowest powered street-hero to the most powerful cosmic entity. This power level is approximately that of the classic X-Men (without such powerhouses as Phoenix, Magneto and Professor X)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
