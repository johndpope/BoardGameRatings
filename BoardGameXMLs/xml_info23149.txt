Amidst the screams and gasps from the audience and cast members the curtain comes down and the investigations begin. It seems that Vincent&amp;rsquo;s death is not by natural causes and Scotland Yard believe it is murder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, in true theatrical style, the show must go on. Vincent&amp;rsquo;s understudy plays his role the next night and afterwards all the company are called together by the theater manager, Jay Fitzharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click here to download the introduction&lt;br/&gt;(1.4MB PDF file.
