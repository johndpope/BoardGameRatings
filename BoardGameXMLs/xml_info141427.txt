			<description>Bombinoes is a game of creative connections.  During the game you have tiles and attempt to form them into a line.  However, all the tiles have images on them and placing a tile requires you to come up with what the tile has in common with the tile next to it.  A cloud and an umbrella might be connected by &amp;quot;rain,&amp;quot; for instance, while a criminal and coffee might be connected by &amp;quot;words starting with C.&amp;quot;  You're only able to use any kind of connection once in your line, and your opponent might break up your line with a bomb tile and force you to rethink connections on the fly, so making the 10 connections you need to win the game will take an agile mind and a creative spirit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
