			<description>This simulates two of the &amp;quot;Duke of Marlborough's&amp;quot; Battles during the &amp;quot;War of the Spanish Succession&amp;quot; featuring Blenheim(1703) &amp;amp; Oudenarde(1708) and makes a play on words regarding a more famous cigarette maker. It has two 22-inch by 17-inch mapsheets in four sections that have to be put together, and the game's two countersheets have to be mounted and cut apart prior to commencing gameplay with these. There are plenty of Cavalry involved in these, as well as the Dragoons which seem to be in transition in Historical terms. For the price that you pay, it should be well worth the Value that you'd expect from the acclaimed designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
