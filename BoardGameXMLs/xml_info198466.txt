							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blockbusters Gold Run</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOLD RUN from Macsen Software is based on the well-known television series Blockbusters. The TV game is a Central Production made in association with Mark Goodson and Talbot Television.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blockbusters was a highly popular British TV show (though originally based on an American format) hosted by Bob Holness. Students, one single and one team of two, would compete to answer questions to fill in hexagons on a grid. Each hexagon was filled with a letter, and the answer to the question started with that letter. If a team answered a question correctly it would turn their colour (white or blue) and they could then choose the next location on the grid, leading to the famous catchphrase &amp;quot;Can I have a 'P' please, Bob?&amp;quot; (having a Pee is British slang for urinating).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is for the single student (playing white) to connect from top to bottom, a minimum of four spaces, and for the pair of students to connect from left to right, a minimum of five spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning would allow the team to progress to the Gold Run, where a single student (the pair would alternate if they won multiple times) would attempt to cross a more complicated version of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first game in the series was a two player game that played the main game only. This standalone sequel is a single player game that includes the Gold Run only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
