							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flitting Bad Wolf</name>
									
			<description>Big Bad Wolf is so annoying! No one wants to be his neighbor! People start to move around in the town to stay away from him. Will you be lucky enough to live happily ever after &amp;mdash; or end up being annoyed by the Big Bad Wolf for the rest of your life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flitting Bad Wolf is a microgame of deduction and bluffing. Players try to get the most valuable cards while avoiding a visit from the Big Bad Wolf! On a player's turn, they may choose to (1) offer a hand card to the opponent (who may refuse), or (2) play a card and execute the ability. Players alternate turns until no one has any cards in hand, and the round scoring takes place. The game is played for a number of rounds until one player has scored 11 or more points to become the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
