							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lichten Spell</name>
									
			<description>A dark and mysterious blight has come to the Great Kingdom of the Mystic World. There has been no hint of sun for 500 days. With the people starving, the king turns to his four court magicians to cast an ancient spell known as the &amp;ldquo;Lichten Spell&amp;rdquo; which will again turn their kingdom to light. The first magician to cast the spell correctly will become the Great Court Magician and a hero of the Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to cast the spell a magician must follow the recipe. The balance of Elements needed to cast the spell changes with the wind and from moment to moment. The four magicians now race to determine the precise mixture of elements and be the first to cast the spell correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with an auction for each of the Elements. As play begins, each player makes three moves per turn, spending their Elements to both learn and change the requirements for victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lichten Spell requires many skills to win. It is one part bidding game to obtain precious Elements. It is one part mystery as players race to identify face-down cards. It is one part strategic thinking as players try to figure out three moves which will leave them with the proper amounts of Elements to win the game. Most of all, The Lichten Spell is a thought-provoking battle where no two games are the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
