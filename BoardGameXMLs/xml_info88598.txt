			<description>From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A White Plume Mountain (Revised) Web Enhancement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White Plume Mountain was one of the classic DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS adventures from the early days of first edition, and I remember my times exploring this dangerous mountain. Now that you have access to it in the newest edition of D&amp;amp;D, new generations of players have the chance at those same thrills. As a Dungeon Master, you might wish to use White Plume Mountain as the centerpiece for a campaign, or at least for an &lt;br/&gt;extended setting for your heroes to explore. To do this, you&amp;rsquo;ll look to the Great Swamp that surrounds White Plume Mountain, and perhaps to the mountains farther away, for additional quests and encounters to challenge your heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition adventure Return to White Plume Mountain introduced additional material into the region surrounding the mountain itself, including a new weapon and the Witch of the Fens, Thingizzard. Here below you will find Frostrazor, the fourth legacy weapon, and Thingizzard, converted to D&amp;amp;D 3.5. Additionally, consider using Dragotha the Undead Dragon (a dracolich) as a threat to be introduced now and battled later; he was introduced in the online adventure Dragotha&amp;rsquo;s Lair. With these three, you can provide weeks of fun (or headache) for your players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
