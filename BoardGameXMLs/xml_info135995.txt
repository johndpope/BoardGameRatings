			<description>BeyBlade: Super Tournament Battle, also known as BeyBlade VForce: Super Tournament Battle and Bakuten Shoot Beyblade 2002: Nettou! Magne-tag Battle! (爆転シュートベイブレード2002 熱闘！マグネタッグバトル！) in Japan is a 2002 role-playing video game based on the anime and manga Beyblade and was released originally in 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player selects a Beyblade and a Beyblader to fight in a tournament, buying better Beyblades as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to knock your opponent out of the stadium. When launching a Beyblade, a &amp;quot;Launch Meter&amp;quot; is displayed and quickly fills itself up with a golden meter. The closer the golden meter is to its end when the player hits the launch button, the faster the Beyblade will revolve. Players can also get points if the player makes the Beyblade stop spinning or misses a launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player earns four points or more if they destroy the opponent's Beyblade to pieces using a powerful assault from the Bit-Beast. In order to be capable of releasing a Bit-Beast, the player has to earn &amp;quot;Legend Power&amp;quot; points simply by hitting other Beyblades repeatedly. Bit-Beast assaults usually take a larger amount of energy from the adversary than normal assaults and they also increase the speed of the spins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;BeyBlade VForce: Super Tournament Battle &amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
