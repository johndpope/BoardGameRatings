							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monopoly: Roppongi Hills</name>
									
			<description>Roppongi Hills is a huge residential/business area in Tokyo that was opened in 2003. It includes a television station, galleries and museums, and very tall office towers. Instead of houses there are kiosks, and hotels are bigger retail shops ... and if you build enough shops, you get to build a Mori Tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Mori was the businessman who spent billions buying up the land over a couple of decades - including the Australian Embassy, which was in a historic building which had an even more historic and beautiful garden.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
