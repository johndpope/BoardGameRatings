			<description>From Wikipedia: Comic Bakery is a computer game for the MSX, made by Konami in 1984 and later ported to Commodore 64 by Imagine Software. The game was set in a bakery, where the town baker tries to bake and deliver bread (Croissants in the MSX version) while fighting off raccoons. Pieces of bread would move along a factory line while the raccoons tried to eat your bread and also try to switch off your machines. You had to keep your machinery running and also scare away the raccoons. If you did this your delivery truck will be loaded with bread and drive off, advancing to a level with exactly the same layout on a more challenging difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Comic Bakery,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
