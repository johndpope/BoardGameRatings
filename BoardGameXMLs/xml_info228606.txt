							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Covfefe: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Covfefe is about the nightmare scenario of 21st Century Supervillains that take over countries from the people through a mix of technology, misinformation, and outright deception. Players are sociopathic dictators trying to dismantle the world to profit themselves and their friends, all the while trying to keep one step ahead of government investigations. The winner is the one with the most Hubris when the world is hobbled by Nuclear War, Economic Depression, or Tribalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players are recently-elected populist politicians who only won their elections through corruption related to an evil empire that is hellbent on world domination. Through manipulation of the public, pointless but politically popular actions, and bald-faced lies, the players try to destroy their governments, making money from evil corporations, and stay one step ahead of government regulations and/or unpopular opinion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has worker placement (we call it &amp;lsquo;scapegoating,&amp;rsquo; as your worker may not come back) and worker-developing (like deck-building for workers), multi-purpose cards, and a lot of deception. Welcome to 21st Century politics!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
