							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All About Colorado Springs Colorado</name>
									
			<description>Learn all about Colorado Springs (in 1980) with this &amp;quot;Exciting, fast moving game of travel&amp;quot; published for the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largish 6-piece board shows the major streets of the city with businesses at the appropriate locations. Evidently (the rules were missing), each player must visit locations specified on their Shopping List card. Players move around the board via Travel Cards to businesses or by simply rolling 2d6. Hazards cards are available to impede your progress. Every bit has advertising on it: board, Travel cards, Hazard Cards, play money, and even the player pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A predecessor of &amp;quot;Wherever-opoly&amp;quot;. Charming if you live around here, of little interest to anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
