			<description>From the author's website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 2006, I decided to participate in Bully Pulpit Games' Owlbear Challenge. Take three of the following four items and make them into a role-playing game. You have twenty-four hours. Go. I came up with Winnie-the-Owl-Pooh: Adventures in d100 Acre Wood, a game heavily influenced by A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh. The challenge called for the following ingredients: Owlbears, Apiculture (the raising of honey bees), Mark Twain, and Owlbears (again). You're one of the Owl-Pooh's friends -- one of those goofy first edition D&amp;amp;D monsters that make no sense -- and you go with him on an Adventure, but you are more likely to get into trouble. This is a storytelling game. This was completed in a twenty-two hour period.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
