			<description>From Panzerfaust Publications in 1971 originally published in Panzerfaust Magazine #49 in October 1971,the game Poland 1939 designed by Ted Buyniski.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These early issues of Panzerfaust were mimeographed and all the components were printed in the magazine, more of a game kit - you had to photocopy the components to actually play it because maps and counters were printed on the reverse side of the pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components are:&lt;br/&gt;3-pages of rules. &lt;br/&gt;The color map is on 8 - 8.5&amp;quot; X 11&amp;quot; sheets of ivory paper. The counters are on two of the map sheets in red for the Germans and the all to familiar purple for the Poles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
