			<description>Based on the events described in the first three chapters of &amp;quot;Wild FIRE: Legend of the Ryukage - Book 1, Vol. 1&amp;quot;, this Turn-Based/ Card Battle style game pits the five mysterious Ryukage clans (with powers based on the 5 elements of Fire, Water, Wind, Earth and Sand) against one another for the purpose of defeating the sinister 'Gold Clan' in order to protect the powerful &amp;lsquo;Star Heart&amp;rsquo; orb from falling into the hands of a ruthless evil capable of destroying the delicate balance of space/ time itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes complete with the following: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A4 sized laminated playing board (x1)&lt;br/&gt;     1 deck of playing cards ( 185 card set hand-made)&lt;br/&gt;     Game Play Manual (printed version - download also&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;available)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     2 playing dice (only 1 is needed to play, the other is a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;spare)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     20 colored playing stones (representing each clan)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game mechanics are deigned to be simple, with each player moving through the game board by rolling dice in an attempt to get to the center of the board so that they can battle the Gold Clan. However, getting to the center of the board is not enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to beat the Gold Clan, players must &amp;quot;power up&amp;quot; along the way by defending their own clan`s territory, crossing over into other clans` territories via &amp;quot;cross-over points&amp;quot; and Card Battling against rival clan members to collect their cards in order to increase their energy (life) points and gain much higher level &amp;quot;Combo Attacks&amp;quot; which they will use to defeat the Gold Clan and wipe out any of the menacing Kuragami Demons lurking about along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is obtained only when one player enters the final arena and defeats the Gold Clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played by 1~5 players on a single game board. Players with multiple game boards can network with each other following a special set of &amp;ldquo;Clan Battle&amp;rdquo; in which the primary objective is simply to eradicate the remaining 4 clans. (Recommended for up to 3 game boards and 15 players.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
