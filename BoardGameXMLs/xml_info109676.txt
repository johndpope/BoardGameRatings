			<description>MLBPA Baseball, or Fighting Baseball (ファイティングベースボール Faitingu Besuboru, &amp;quot;Fighting Baseball&amp;quot;) as it is known in Japan, was a sports game for the Super NES, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Game Gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was one of the first console games to feature Major League Baseball player names and statistics. Its American version was published by EA Sports. The game included the 1993 season's major league players and stats thanks to its MLBPA license, but could not use team names for lack of an MLB license. The game got around this by using the city names of each team with matching colors, and using terms &amp;quot;A League&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;N League&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;The Series&amp;quot;. Players are allowed to play a single game (with the default teams being Philadelphia at Toronto, the 1993 league champs), a full season based on the 1994 schedule (with wins and losses recorded by password in the SNES version, battery back-up for Genesis), playoffs, and a World Series. Though the full season mode is based on the 1994 schedule, it does NOT include the new (and current) three divisions/wild card format introduced for the 1994 season; instead it uses the old two division (per league) format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Couched in what the packaging billed as &amp;quot;huge arcade style graphics,&amp;quot; games could be played on either natural or artificial grass (depending on the home team) during day or night. The game also featured scoreboard animations for double and triple plays, home runs, grand slams, pitching changes, pinch hitters, and sometimes strike outs. There were also several cheat codes to alter the game play. These included &amp;quot;RBBR,&amp;quot; which made the ball bounce extraordinarily high, and &amp;quot;BRRR,&amp;quot; which eliminated friction when the ball was in contact with the field. Under ZSNES, the game tends to freeze at random spots in the game (a similar effect occurs in the NHL series and the Madden series). The audience sound is muffled by limitations of the 16-bit sound engine of the Super Famicom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SNES version is the first ever baseball video game to include the Atlanta Braves' distinctive Tomahawk Chop theme song, which is actually advertised on the back of the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;MLBPA Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
