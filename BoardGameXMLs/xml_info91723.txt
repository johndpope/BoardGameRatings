			<description>Cyber-Lip is a horizontally scrolling, side-view platformer shoot 'em up (this combination is sometimes referred to as &amp;quot;run and gun&amp;quot;) arcade game released by SNK in 1990 for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS. The player(s) control(s) Rick and/or Brook, two human veteran soldiers, who are sent by an unspecified &amp;quot;federal government&amp;quot; into combat on a last-ditch attempt to save Earth from a malfunctioning military supercomputer in charge of all military androids. Gameplay consists of battling through large amounts of enemies, collecting power-ups and defeating several end-of-stage bosses. This makes it comparable to the likes of Metal Slug or Contra in terms of gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is noted that a handful of members from Irem developed this title and later went on to create Metal Slug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cyber-lip&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
