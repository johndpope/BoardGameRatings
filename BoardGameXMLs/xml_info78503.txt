			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MechWarrior was the first video game to offer the player a chance to pilot a BattleMech from the view of a pilot (a MechWarrior). With this game the player has a great deal of freedom when compared to many of the follow-up MechWarrior games, which include choosing missions, buying &amp;amp; selling 'Mechs and parts, hiring lance-mates, and traveling throughout the Inner Sphere. Underneath the major game mechanics, the player had the option of following a role playing style story arc that would unfold over a five-year (game time) period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was ported to the Japanese Sharp X68000 home computer in 1992 under the name Battletech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
