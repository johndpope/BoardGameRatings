			<description>(Translated from box in Norwegian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join in on an exiting adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This games is about the teddybear Trygg (safe) og his friends: Trym and Lise. The world famous Sirkus Filiokus has finally come to town, and the three friends have sneaked out late on a dark autumn evening to have a peek at the cirkus and everything in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something scary happens to Trym and Lise - so Trygg have to save his friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throught the use of many funny characters and some good friends he meets on the way, he is able to reach his friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there are a lot of hindrances on the way! &lt;br/&gt;He meets the old magician Mr Pierre, the frightning clown Klaus and the lion Baltazar. These are the cirkus' &amp;quot;bad guys&amp;quot; so Trygg have to watch out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 36 counters in a grid in front of themselves on a mutual board. In turn the player throw two dice and uses them as coordinates on his grid to identify which counter to turn. All counters start face down. The turned counter has a character on it and that states what the player must do. Typically it is to move his or an opponent's pawn which run along a track in the center of the board. When the player finds a key he may try to reach goal, and if he does he wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
