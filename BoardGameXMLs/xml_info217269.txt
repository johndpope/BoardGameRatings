			<description>Very simple childrens/family cooperative game.&lt;br/&gt;Theme of the game is springtime maple sugaring season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the game owner shuffles well and places all 16 cards (depicting either pails, a sap collector or bad weather) face down in the 16 spaces around the perimeter of the board. In the middle of the board are 9 spaces depicting tapped trees. Off the board, but within reach of all players, are 16 small plastic pails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a players turn, (owner goes first) one of the 16 cards is turned face up. The action that card shows affects all 3 center spaces in the direction the arrow on the board is showing.&lt;br/&gt;SAP PAILS: (depicting 1 to 3 pails) place plastic pails in number &lt;br/&gt;           shown anywhere on those 3 spaces. You can never have&lt;br/&gt;           more than 4 pails on one space.&lt;br/&gt;SAP COLLECTOR: player takes all pails in the direction of the&lt;br/&gt;               arrow, and places them in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;BAD WEATHER: remove all pails in the direction of the arrow, and &lt;br/&gt;             put them back in the general supply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player with the most sap pails after all 16 cards have been turned over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game instructions also include information about maple syrup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
