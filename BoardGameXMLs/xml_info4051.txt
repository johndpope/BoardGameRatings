			<description>Bulls, Bears and Billionaires is a board game that makes winner a Millionaire on a short game or a Billionaire for a long game.  It takes making money and turns it into even more fun because you are buying and selling stocks as the prices go up and down.  And to help you relieve your stress, you get to yell out your stock orders and when you sell your stock you must throw the trading tickets on the floor.  The Bulls, Bears and Billionaires game allows you have fun while learn more about the real stock market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and that causes the stock prices to change, sometimes just one stock price changes; other rolls cause all stocks prices to go up or down.  It&amp;rsquo;s a game that test wit against daring.  Should you sell out now or wait for a higher price.  Or, if your stock price is down, double up the price by using the Rumor Mill but beware&amp;mdash;stock prices can go down just as fast as they go up.  The game uses Good News and Bad News to change stock prices just like the real stock market.  There is even an &amp;ldquo;Insider Trading Violation&amp;rdquo; penalty to keep all things equal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All stock prices go up with a Bull Market and watch out for the Bear Markets when they all go down.  Rolling doubles takes on a whole new meaning in this game.   One double reduces your stock shares while another doubles your holdings.  The game is a fast pace of buying and selling stocks.  It creates an atmosphere of constant participation because every move affects any and all players.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take long to learn strategies to help you win.  Build an alliance with other traders to try and control the market or force the prices down on stocks you do not own.  It is a great game for the family or those more serious players looking for a real challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
