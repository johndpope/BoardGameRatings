			<description>A very cheap version but with the same idea as Jaques&amp;rsquo; Ascot.  The game consists of a box that houses five card horses and riders: Tom, Dick and Harry &amp;ndash; Gert and Daisy as well. The horses are attached to a spindle by cord that winds around the spindle when turned.  The horses are set up on the table, the handle turned, and the horses approach the winning post.  The speed of the horses depends on the way the cord winds, giving the chance of a different winner each time.  The game components are all cardboard or cord&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
