			<description>A simple roll-and-move game to promote tyre manufacturer Pirelli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a race course in a winter landscape. Some spaces are marked with a tyre. These are special event fields that make the players move their pawns forwards or backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a pawn (cardboard token showing the Pirelli mascot). Players take turns rolling a six-sided die. If you roll a six, you get to put your pawn on the start space. Afterwards, you move your pawn according to your die roll. If you roll a six, you get an additional turn. If you land on an event field, you follow the instructions for that field. If your roll would mean you'd land on a space that is already occupied, you stop on the space behind that space. The game ends when a player reaches the finish space. He/she has to roll the exact number (rolling a five when you're three spaces away from finish won't help you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
