			<description>Ushua&amp;iuml;a permits the players to dive in the world of expeditions around the world. The goal is to arrive first at the final destination. The board represents a planisphere, within the squares players can move by kayak, 4x4 car or even with a balloon. Each player draws an expedition card that determines the expedition that he has to complete (the card determines the start and finishing point). During the game players also draw adventure cards that can help or slow their expeditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
