			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, we know where we&amp;rsquo;re going&lt;br/&gt;But we don&amp;rsquo;t know where we&amp;rsquo;ve been.&lt;br/&gt;And we know what we&amp;rsquo;re knowing.&lt;br/&gt;But we can&amp;rsquo;t say what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;br/&gt;And we&amp;rsquo;re not little children.&lt;br/&gt;And we know what we want.&lt;br/&gt;And the future is certain.&lt;br/&gt;Give us time to work it out.&lt;br/&gt;-- &amp;quot;Road to Nowhere,&amp;quot; The Talking Heads&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Illuminati has been working on methods of creating the next generation of humans, in a secret research facility. Some of these experiments have escaped and have wandered into a cabin in the woods near Boulder. The people in the cabin have found a book on the Kabala and cast a spell. They think the escapees are the result of the spell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spell has fractured time. The escapees have flashbacks that explain who they are and what they are. Also, something is coming from n-time, a part of time that is orthogonal to our own. The players must figure out how to defeat the creature from n-time using the Kabala, the secret Illuminati knowledge, and the enhanced humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they succeed, then time is realigned so that it all never happened. If they fail, then time is realigned such that they are stuck in a dystopia where the Illuminati rules all with an iron fist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
