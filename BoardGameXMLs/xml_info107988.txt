			<description>Cataclysm is a large board chess variant (12 X 16)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It uses most of the basic chess pieces from FIDE chess, plus a range of additional, mostly short range pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New pieces include;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grand Rook: The Grand Rook can move as either a standard Rook, or as a Cannon from Chinese Chess (that is, it can capture an enemy piece by leaping over exactly one piece of either color and capturing the first piece beyond, if that piece is an enemy piece.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorceress: The Sorceress is a 2-space area-mover. She may make either a single step in any direction as a King, or may make two consecutive steps in any direction and may change directions in between. The only limitations are that the Sorceress may not return to her original square (thereby making a null-move) and may not capture a piece on the first move and continue on - her move ends with any capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elephant may slide up to four spaces diagonally, or may step a single space horizontally or vertically. This piece has no relation to the Elephant of Shatranj.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tiger may slide up to four spaces horizontally or vertically, or may step a single space diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duke may slide up to three spaces in any direction. He moves like a Queen in Chess, except that he is limited to a range of only three squares&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and others&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 40 pieces (including 16 pawns)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
