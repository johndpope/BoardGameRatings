			<description>Nuit Blanche is a simulation of the French national sport called Boule. Many active French players call it also P&amp;eacute;tanque.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to get your quite heavy metal balls as close to the smaller, wooden and colored 'jack'. The winner is the player whose ball is closest to the jack. The Team achieving first 13 points wins the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this boardgame adaption you roll out the flexible map and soon opposing and own balls group themselves around the goal ball &amp;quot;jack&amp;quot; and the players stand before the decision, depending upon game situation, whether to aim or to shoot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To determine if your action was successful or not you will use a  two-pieced plastic ball with a pointer and two scales. In a dexterity depending action you shake that ball trying to get that pointer pointing at the right position. At first you won't succeed very well but with more experience you will find that this process is not only luck but also controllable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
