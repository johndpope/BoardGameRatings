			<description>HAZARD - The Ultimate Golf Board Game. Play the course and avoid the hazards. 18 holes of exciting golf - whatever the weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAZARD can be played by any number of players in pairs, foursomes, or alone against the course. Players draw five cards representing a 'wood', 'long iron', 'mid iron', 'short iron' and 'pitch, chip or putt'. Each card has a different stroke indicator informing you of distance, hook or slice, and by using the card in any one of four directions allows you unlimited combinations of shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in real golf, mistakes occur. So when the ball strays from the fairway or into a bunker, 'rough' or 'bunker' cards are drawn to continue play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hole ends when the player lands in a hole or on the green which indicates the number of putts to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hazard can be played against the course par of 72, or 'hole for hole' as in matchplay.
