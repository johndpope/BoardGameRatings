							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">London Rules Wargames Section American Civil War 1863c</name>
									
			<description>Based upon an 'article submission' within the pages of &amp;quot;Miniature Warfare&amp;quot; Magazine Vol. 1 #-7, and part of a 'Series' for &amp;quot;Miniatures Wargaming&amp;quot;. This 'Booklet' has a YELLOW 'front &amp;amp; back' plasticized-'looking' outside covers, with BLACK print on the front and plastic 'binding' for the pages. It contains '20'-pages of RULES in a 'half-page'~SIZED format, and covers the 'Basics' of &amp;quot;minis gaming&amp;quot; within this. It details the use of 'BOUNDS'~written 'Orders' and simultaneously revealing them, for its 'mechanism' of PLAY. You will NEED to provide *SPECIAL* 6-sided-'DICE' numbered as follows: &amp;quot; 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 &amp;quot;, as well as some regular 'D-6's, various other 'sundry' items associated with this 'genre' as required, and some 'Markers' of the same SIZE as the 'Units' that they will represent in the 'Game'. These 'Markers' can even be 'used' for DECOY 'Units' where applicable, and you would have to obtain additional DATA on 'specifics' for individual 'Battles, Troops, &amp;amp; Leaders' prior to commencing PLAY for this. Calculations for creating 'Casualties' are based upon a 'percentages' and &amp;quot;DIE rolls&amp;quot; method being employed for resolving 'Conflicts'. These seem to be the 'easiest' and 'quickest' RULES devised at the time, for recreating the many epic &amp;quot;Confrontations&amp;quot; that were to 'define' the &amp;quot;American WAR for Reunification!&amp;quot; in the 'period' covered by this 'Rules SET'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
