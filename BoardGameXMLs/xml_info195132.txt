			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in this rules-light game are defined by a concise narrative statement.  They also have a single Attribute with a value from 1-10, selected by player fiat.  This Attribute describes the character's &amp;quot;evil vs. good&amp;quot; axis, with a 1 being a &amp;quot;very good&amp;quot; character and a 10 being a &amp;quot;very evil&amp;quot; character, but one not so evil as to be reviled by the other characters.  Action resolution uses a single d10 roll with results varying for characters depending on their Attribute and the type of action they are attempting.  The game master determines whether the action is good or evil or somewhere in between.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended to explore the nature of good vs. evil, though it provides no suggestion of what might be meant by these terms.  The game does use a credible mechanism for assembling the adventuring party from disparate individuals who may be antipathetic to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
