			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to PORTAL (Player Oriented Roleplaying: Timing, Action &amp;amp; Lucidity), a universal roleplaying system ready to be adapted to whatever your imagination can come up with. It's a system which strives to strike a balance between roleplaying and gaming. A structured way to create and play dynamic characters in engaging stories driven by an easy system that keeps everyone on the same page. PORTAL is founded on the belief that any good roleplaying game should be based on character and story, not dice rolls, charts or math. PORTAL is a universal, system that can be easily and seamlessly molded to any genre, setting, or story. It's designed to work with peoples' to allow them to focus on story and setting, not the system. PORTAL lets players and storytellers make their own choices about how to act in a situation; a system that refuses to pigeonhole creativity for the sake of ease, balance or structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
