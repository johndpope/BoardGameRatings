							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ys: The Oath in Felghana</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the adventuresome duo of Adol and Dogi make an unannounced visit to Dogi&amp;rsquo;s homeland of Felghana, it quickly becomes apparent that things have changed dramatically since Dogi departed on a journey of self-discovery eight years earlier. Hordes of violent monsters roam the outskirts of town, there's an unsettling rumor of a long-dormant volcano suddenly becoming active again, and the lord of the land has become more and more tyrannical with every passing day, most recently depriving the land's citizens of their right to mine for the precious ore known as &amp;quot;raval&amp;quot; - a staple of the economy for generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Adol and Dogi begin their search for the source of Felghana&amp;rsquo;s recent tribulations, they find each clue leads them more and more towards the disturbing conclusion that these events are all somehow linked. The closer they get to the truth, the higher the stakes, as the consequences of their actions affect not just Felghana, but possibly the entire world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
