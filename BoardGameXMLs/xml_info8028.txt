							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goblin King</name>
									
			<description>Each player in this game controls three goblin leaders who, with their small tribes, come down from the mountains to raid human villages, towns, castles, and mines. Leaders gain status after successful raids, and status is not only victory points but may also allow a leader to become chief or king, which is worth additional points. The king and the chiefs can also force other players to help them raid, which is useful when attacking the stronger human locations. Raid outcomes and casualties are driven by decks of standard playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced in an edition of 100 copies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
