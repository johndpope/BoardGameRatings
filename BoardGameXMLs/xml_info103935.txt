			<description>Isle of Wight is a 2 player print-and-play map for Steam. The map incorporates a sixth goods colour (black) and ferry links that can be built in the same way as track tiles. The availability of goods cubes is very tight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, was popularised as a holiday destination by Queen Victoria, who regularly spent summers at Osborne House, near East Cowes. In order to handle the increasing numbers of visitors, the first railways on the island, between Cowes and Newport, and between Ryde and Shanklin, opened in the 1860s. By the turn of the century there were 55 miles of track on an island that measures little more than 20 miles by 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
