			<description>This game takes place during the 1920's prohibition era. Players are professional bootleggers tasked with moving alcohol regularly shipped to their ports to the different establishments around town through a combination of their runner units, dogface or muscle units, and their special units, the latter of which differs from player to player. Opposing players will also try to supply establishments as well as take over establishments already being supplied so players need to balance expanding their empire with defending it. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 5,000 rubes, the in-game currency. Money is earned from the different establishments around town as well as start up money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
