			<description>This submission to the Game Chef contest (design an RPG within seven days) was later fleshed out and published as Polaris:  Chivalric Tragedy at Utmost North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ben Lehman announced his entry as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Below the eternal Pole Star lies the mistake, festering like a forgotten apology, a tower of smoke to the sky that most of the People prefer to ignore even as the demons it spawns crush their fragile palaces of starlight, frost, and ice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you are not like most of the People.  You are a Star Knight, guided by the charter set down by the long-dead Snow Queen, chosen for the heavy duty of guarding the People against the yearly demon invasions from the frigid mists of the mistake, and try to save what remains of your civilization after the fall of Polaris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knights have a thousand forces arrayed against them, and the radical elements from within the People are as dangerous as the demons that boil forth from the Mistake with every dawn.  And, in the end, it shall be the knights themselves that will destroy what remains of the greatest civilization that ever was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your fight is as futile as a baby crying against the coming of summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you have decided to take up the struggle.  Don your starlight sword, take only a breathsuit as refuge against the cold, and fight against that coming light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
