			<description>D!Git is a number and color based tiling game. There are 50 number/color tiles (0-9 in each of 5 different colors), 5 color specific Wild tiles, and 5 D!Git tiles (can represent any number in any color). Each player draws one random tile. High number goes first. All tiles are then jumbled and distributed evenly and stacked face down in front of each player. First player lays 1,2,3,4 or 5 tiles from his/her hand in a straight line to establish the grid. Tiles laid down must be either different colors of the same number OR a sequence of numbers (up or down) of the same color. Sequences may also roll around e.g. 8,9,0,1,2 etc is OK. If, on your turn, you place a 5th or 10th tile on a line, you get to replenish your hand. Rather than using your turn to add tiles to the grid, you may choose to swap tiles from your hand for already played Wild tiles as long as they work there. The first player to get rid of all of his/her tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
