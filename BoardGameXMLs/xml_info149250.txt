			<description>Colorinto is a deck of abstract paintings that challenges players with different games of visual skill, ranging from solitaire to speed contest or to strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When put together, those paintings form a museum, in which every room has one picture on it. It can be only visited following certain rules that are hidden inside the paintings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to discover and create paths that cross the maze, sometimes discovering the longest route in less time than the opponents, other times by creating the museum itself so it follows certain conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game recommended for people with a liking to challenging games with simple rules, abstract art aesthetics or unconventional mazes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
