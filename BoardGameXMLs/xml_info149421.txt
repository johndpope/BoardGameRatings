			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this much improved sequel of the notorious RTS game you can opt for any of six different campaigns and fight in various terrain such as mountains, forests or wastelands. There are six races depending on the campaign you choose. You can play as the Necronator and control the undead in a quest to exterminate the humans. You may also play as the humans trying to restore your kingdom to its former glory. Alternatively, you may choose one of the other races such as the Dragons, the Elves or the Orcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective in every level is to overtake the enemy castle while protecting your own. Summon your units and heroes, collect coins from slain enemies and win battles to earn shields which can be used towards upgrading your units and unlocking various skills and spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
