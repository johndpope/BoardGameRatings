							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Tomb</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Tomb is an adventure module designed for 4-6 characters of 10-12th level; however, a well-rounded party of characters 8-10th level should be able to handle the encounters successfully. This dungeon marks the first in the Expert Series modules, which are designed for advanced players. A thorough understanding of tactics, magic and smart dungeon delving are strongly recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventuring party should consist of at least one rogue, as the traps and mechanisms in the tomb are challenging. As with most modules, a balanced party is necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended to be an old-fashioned, site-based dungeon crawl. A referee should be careful when inserting this adventure into an existing campaign. In this case, the characters should be given background knowledge about the locale and history. Adventure hooks have been provided in case a referee wishes to weave this adventure into an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last Tomb will not appeal to every gaming group, especially those that are only satisfied with simple combat and happy endings. The adventure has plenty of combat, but a larger proportion of its challenges are much less physical. Mental preparation and patience are key to a successful gaming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
