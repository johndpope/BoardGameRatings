							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadlands Skirmish</name>
									
			<description>A 2 player skirmish game using miniatures and cards, based on the Deadlands RPG game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is conducted on an 8x8 grid using figurines or counters to represent units.  Players select units from a list of over 50 characters/units with differing hit points, equipment and capabilities.  For a typical game each side should have about 20-24 hit points worth of units.  To start units are placed on a player&amp;rsquo;s back 2 rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck containing Attack, Defence, Move, Special and Option cards.  The Option cards are used to activate one of the six options available to each unit.  Options include but are not limited to healing, regeneration, disarming, immobilization and fear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.   Draw Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Draw 5 Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.   Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Play cards from your hand to have your units move and attack.  Move and attack cards have an associated range value that determines the exact distance in spaces that a unit moves or is hit by an attack from its source. &lt;br/&gt;-    Attacks do one hit point worth of damage unless otherwise stated. The attacked player may play defence cards to negate attacks. Units are eliminated when their hit point value reaches zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Max hand size is 5 cards.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory is achieved by completely eliminating all enemy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
