			<description>Flohzirkus (=&amp;quot;flea circus&amp;quot;) is played on a board with 12 x 12 dots in 4 alternating colours. 5 colour dice and 2 large wooden fleas per player complete the game components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each flea is marked with 4 colours: 1 yellow dash at the head, 1 blue dash at the tail, 1 red flea drawing on the right side and 1 green flea drawing on the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player throws the 5 dice, which enable him to make 5 moves. Yellow, blue, red and green lets a flea jump to the 4 directions as marked on the flea, white and black enables a flea to turn in place or to shift to an adjacent dot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to achieve as many points as possible, which is done by jumping over as many other fleas as possible. Winner of the game is the player with the most points after a predefined number of turns, or the one who reaches a predefined number of points first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game reminds at Alex Randolph's game family including &amp;quot;Corona&amp;quot;(1974), &amp;quot;Moonstar&amp;quot;(1981), &amp;quot;Harun&amp;quot;(1984), &amp;quot;Orbit&amp;quot;(1993) and &amp;quot;Ricochet Robots&amp;quot;(1999). Opposite to those games, each player has his own playing pieces in &amp;quot;Flohzirkus&amp;quot;, but the lack of a time limit can be a serious problem here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
