							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cave of the Spiders</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bandits have been preying on the caravan trade of late, and the number of burglaries and kidnappings is on the rise. Such events might not seem all that unusual, except for the bandits' calling card -- webbing! Can the PCs penetrate the bandit lair and slay the leader before any more locals vanish? Drop the latest miniadventure for D&amp;amp;D v3.5 by Skip Williams into any spot in your campaign world that features a cavern complex in a wilderness area. Suitable for four 9th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Preview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cave of Spiders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forest abruptly gives way to a long slope covered with loose rocks and scraggly bushes. A sheer cliff, about as tall as a good bowshot, rises from the top of the slope. About 20 feet above the surrounding forest floor is an opening that faces west. The slope leading up to it is mostly clear of vegetation but covered with scree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could this be the entrance to the lair of the bandits who are behind the recent crime spree in the surrounding towns? And if so, what fell traps and dangerous monsters guard the place?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
