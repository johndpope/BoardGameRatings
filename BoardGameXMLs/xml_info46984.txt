			<description>Logomaus is a word game from Jean du Poel. The game includes a deck of cards, each showing one letter of the alphabet. As with many games of this type, there are multiple cards of the more common letters but only single cards of the ones least used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a set of cards, and on a turn can either take two cards from the draw deck and the optionally may discard one, or they can take only the top card from the discard pile. They then can form words, with a minimum of three letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has two scoring options. One uses pebbles, and at the end of each round pebbles are awarded for longest word, most words, and for use of the letters with only a single card. The other option is to use the included board.Players start at the 10 spot, and earn points for words as above but lose a point for each card not used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
