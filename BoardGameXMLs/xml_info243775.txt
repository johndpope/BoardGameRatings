			<description>Kickstarter game designed by Bernie DeKoven and Tassos Stevens, exploring the nature of legacy and &amp;quot;evoking what it means to pass something on to someone else&amp;quot;, created following de Koven's terminal cancer diagnosis in 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game arrives in a sealed box, with instructions not to open it until the players are ready to play.
