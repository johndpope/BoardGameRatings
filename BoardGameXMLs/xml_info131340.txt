			<description>Magistrat is an expansion to SPEICHERSTADT HAMBURG and consists of 35 action cards, which give the players additional options to take control over their success.&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled with 15 Storehouse cards and from that pile you take 10 cards in each harbour phase, one to each package of 2 ware cards to create a three card set. Likewise the basic game each player buys two of these sets in the harbour phase.&lt;br/&gt;New options of the Magistrat cards are for example:&lt;br/&gt;- exchange cards from the sets in the harbour phase&lt;br/&gt;- take your own cards into account only when evaluating the income&lt;br/&gt;- increase the value of your gift to the senate&lt;br/&gt;- get more victory points for your gift&lt;br/&gt;- count MAGISTRAT-cards to get victory points at the end (the more cards the more efficient are they)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion was distributed at Essen 2012 and is now available everywhere you get the base game.&lt;br/&gt;The expansion comes along with short rules. Complete rules are on the website for download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
