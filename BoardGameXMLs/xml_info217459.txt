							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hollywood Movie-Bingo</name>
									
			<description>This bingo-style game has a spinner with the letters of the alphabet, and 10 player cards, each bearing the names of three '30s Hollywood stars, one with 5 letters, one with 6 and one with 7.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each spin, players put tokens on top of all examples of that letter on their card. The first to cover all letters on two of the names on a card shouts &amp;quot;Hollywood&amp;quot;. The names are checked and if correct, that player wins; otherwise that player is out of the game and spinning continues. The rules say players may agree to play until all three names on a card are covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are a who's who of Depression-era stars: Astaire, Garbo, Chaplin, Gable, Cagney, Hepburn, Karloff, Jolson, Ruggles and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
