			<description>My Hero (Seishun Scandal in Japan) is a Sega arcade/video game released in 1985 and was later ported to the Sega Master System in 1986. The gameplay takes the form of a simple side-scrolling beat 'em up fighting game, which was seen as being frustratingly difficult at several points in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arcade version consists of three different levels, each continuing in an endless loop until the player runs out of lives. It starts out with your character (named Steven according to the arcade flyer, Takeshi in Japan) on a city street watching as a street thug runs off with your girlfriend (named Remy, also according to the arcade flyer, Mari in Japan). As you pursue him you must fight off gangs of other various street thugs. Half way through the level, you have an opportunity to save a captive bystander who (if rescued) will help you fight until he is killed. Soon (after jumping across platforms and dodging fireballs) you will arrive on a beach and fight the thug that has captured your girlfriend (Remy). After you defeat the level boss (the thug) by landing the allotted amount of hits (10), you have completed the level. This same process repeats for the remainder of the game, only with two other bosses and stage designs. The next bosses are a ninja and a space creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;My Hero (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
