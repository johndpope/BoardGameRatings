			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snowy isn't like other bears. While his friends are content to make their home on the ice, Snowy dreams of finding adventure as he travels the world! In Snowy: Treasure Hunter, the adorable white bear grabs his pick axe and shoulder bag, and sets out to rid three beautiful game worlds of the riches they contain. As he makes his way across the globe, he'll have to use his wits along with a selection of special items to outsmart enemies and grab every last jewel.&lt;br/&gt;Snowy: Treasure Hunter is a side-scrolling platform game featuring stunning background art and film-quality character animation. As Snowy digs a hole in a platform to trap an approaching enemy or shimmies along a rope stretched between two platforms, you'll be amazed at the smoothness of the animation. There's no jumping, though, so Treasure Hunter is as easy to play as it is fun to look at.
