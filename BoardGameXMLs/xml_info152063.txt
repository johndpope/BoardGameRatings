							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Halfling: A Dungeon World Playbook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your people say, there is nothing wrong with enjoying the fine things in life. Drink and be merry! Work hard to get food on the table, then eat that food with the joy of one who has earned it. Six times a day, if you can manage it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But just because you prefer a soft life doesn't mean you're soft all the way through. When the time comes to sacrifice comfort for safety, you'll drop the fork and draw the knife. When enemies and thieves encroach, you'll fight them with sling and stealth. And when there's the promise of adventure, treasure and a feast at the end, you'll bring a tighter belt for the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a big world out there, and you're small. Time to get started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Halfling is a new class for use with Dungeon World, perfect for players who like their Dungeon World with an old-school feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
