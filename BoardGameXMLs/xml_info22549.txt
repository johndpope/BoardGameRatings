							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campbell&#039;s Soup Game</name>
									
			<description>Licensed by Campbell&amp;rsquo;s Soup Company, &amp;ldquo;Campbell&amp;rsquo;s Soup Game&amp;rdquo; is a children&amp;rsquo;s game for ages 3 and up, for 2-4 players.  It includes a spinner, alphabet letter tokens (which are round, and the writing on them resembles soup noodles), plus two-sided round discs to serve as Campbell&amp;rsquo;s Soup Bowls, according to the package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The label on the container has text in both English and French, and on the bottom label has information for Mattel USA, Mattel France, Mattel Australia and Mattel Canada.  The container itself is shaped very much like a soup can.  It is unclear if the mechanics or game play of this game differs at all from the 1979 title, &amp;ldquo;Campbell's Alphabet Scoop &amp;amp; Spell&amp;rdquo;, which also came in a soup-shaped container, and was produced by Warren Industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
