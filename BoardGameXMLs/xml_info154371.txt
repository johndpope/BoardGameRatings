			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set during the year 1907 Somewhere in the North Atlantic Ocean. An explosion aboard a Luxury Ocean Liner has taken place and you must follow along with the story and interview passengers to determine who had done it and why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, this was a Japanese only release and is language dependent. The entire game is displayed in Sepia tones to have the look of old film negative keeping in proper feel with the time period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
