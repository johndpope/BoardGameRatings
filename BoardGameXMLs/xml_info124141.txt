			<description>In Mini Mouth, players race to create words with the letters on display, with the fastest mouth claiming the letters used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, place all the letter tiles face down and shuffle them. One player chooses 2-5 tiles and reveals them, then everyone races to name a word that includes all of the letters revealed. (One caveat: If more than one letter with an asterisk is revealed &amp;ndash; those letters being J, Q, X and Z &amp;ndash; then players need to use only one of these letters in their word.) The player who first names a word that includes the letters claims all of the letters used. If no one can think of a word or players simultaneously call out an acceptable word, return the letters to the letter pool. The next player clockwise then draws 2-5 tiles and the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as no tiles remain in the letter pool, the player with the most tiles wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
