			<description>Anyone Can Par is a golf simulation game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general rules of golf are followed.  Players tee-off by rolling up to 5 white dice.  The dice are added up and the total is multiplied by 10 to determine the yardage.  To simulate a hook or slice, the black die is rolled to determine which lane the ball lands in.  Shots from sand traps, putts and chip shots are done with special dice that have non-standard number distributions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Brown &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Sand Trap Shot &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;          1:2:3:3:3:4 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Red &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Chip Shot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;          1:2:2:3:3:4 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;         Green &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Putt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;          1:2:2:2:3:4 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternately, these shots can be done by taking the appropriate card and following the instructions.  As the player's marker (ball) gets closer to the green, they will wish to roll fewer white dice to ensure they do not overshoot the hole.  Markers landing in hazards suffer penalties.  The course includes 9 holes with water hazards, sand traps, out of bounds areas, and trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
