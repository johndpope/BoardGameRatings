							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jekyll &amp; Hyde</name>
									
			<description>A two-player, print and play game designed for 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving a pawn around London using tokens as action points.  The Jekyll player is trying to discover the parts of a cure, to rid themselves of the Hyde personality.  Hyde is trying to take full control of the pawn, by limiting the Jekyll players ability to use the tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the players' actions turn into a tug of war with the other player.  Moving the pawn can place it in an advantageous location for the other player, and playing cards gives the other player a chance to draw them into their hand.  Players must try to accomplish their goals without aiding their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
