			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cutting Edge Tech at Your Fingertips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology is the backbone of civilization, setting the sentient races apart from the rest of the cosmos. From the powerful space ships that bridge the vast distances between worlds, to the computers that keep us connected to the information we need and allow us to control all manner of convenient devices, to top-of-the-line armor and weaponry to protect everything that is important, technology is a vital part of day-to-day life in the modern spacefaring age. And no one stays at the forefront of new and exciting technologies like Horizontech!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horizontech Catalogues contain all the newest and best developments from Horizontech Industries, the galactic leader in innovation and progress. This issue presents a collection of new systems that can be installed on a wide range of star ships, including hyperspace communications arrays, scout labs, attack drones, tachyon projectors, and much, much more. When you think of the future of technology, think Horizontech!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
