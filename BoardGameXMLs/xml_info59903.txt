							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Witch of Loch-Durnan</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return to the hamlet of Loch-Durnan. More terror awaits in this adventure of levels 8th-9th characters in the lands of Gothos and our Hunt: Rise of Evil setting. Will the heroes be able to help the hamlet again with their very souls at risk? Once again, terrifying evil comes to the small mining community. Feeling as if their very homes are cursed, they once again seek the help of stalwart adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lake, the very name sake of the small hamlet, has turned dark and sinister, spewing forth a putrid evil that threatens the entire land. Some think that this is the work of a vengeful foe returned, others are not so sure, but like before, nothing appears as it seems and the mists of the Loch conceal something that none could have imagined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witch of Loch-Durnan is the next terror filled installment that takes place in and around the stricken hamlet. This new d20 adventure from Mystic Eye Games is set for an average of four characters ranging from 6th to 8th level. It can run as a continuation of The Pit of Loch-Durnan or it can be run stand alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
