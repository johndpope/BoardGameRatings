							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chaos Engine 2</name>
									
			<description>Unlike its predecessor, The Chaos Engine 2 is a split-screen deathmatch between two players, one of which may be controlled by the computer: there is no co-operative mode available. Instead, each player must try to obtain the greatest score, either by simply killing the opponent repeatedly or by collecting objects, destroying monsters, fulfilling tasks and solving puzzles. Conversely, points are lost if killed. Inventories are dropped upon death, which means that if a quest requires a key to unlock a door or a safe, it becomes necessary to kill the opponent should they acquire it before the player. If a human opponent has the highest score at the end of a round, they move on to the next; if the computer defeats the player, the round is replayed until the user wins. A game can be played across 4, 8, 12 or 16 rounds, with each consisting of a different environment: Medieval, Aztec and Chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters:&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos Engine 2 allows players to select one of four available characters. Each character has different attributes that define how quickly they move, how much health they begin with and their starting weapon. The four characters are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The Gentleman&lt;br/&gt;    * The Navvie&lt;br/&gt;    * The Brigand&lt;br/&gt;    * The Mercenary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Chaos Engine 2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
