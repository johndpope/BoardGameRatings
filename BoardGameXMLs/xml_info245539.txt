			<description>Quirk! Legends is a follow on game from Quirk! In this stand alone version of the game you play as legendary characters, unicorns, mermaids, angels, demons and many others. It can also be mixed with the original Quirk! game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal: To win the most Quirks by the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Quirk is 3 of the same character card (green). To win character cards from other players on your turn, you must act out the card you want to win from another player, choosing the player you wish to win it from. If they have it, they must give it to you. If not you pick up another card from the deck and the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once Quirks are on the table you can start using Tactic cards (red) to steal Quirks from other players. You can use Defence cards (orange) to defence your Quirks from an attack or use a Skip card (blue)after your turn to skip another player if you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all Quirks have been played. Who ever has the most is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
