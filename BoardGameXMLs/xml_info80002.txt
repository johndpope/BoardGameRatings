			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Paradroid the player takes control of a small robot with the serial number 001. His goal is to clear a starship with several levels from all other robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only problem is that 001 has no weaponry and is pretty weak. But 001 has one unique ability: It can gain control over over robots if he bumps into them. The placer has to solve a small logic minigame to gain control of the other robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 different robots with different advantages and weaponry as well as Repair bays, data and map terminals and maze-like shiplevels make this game a fun challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
