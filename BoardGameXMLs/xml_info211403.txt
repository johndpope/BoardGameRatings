			<description>A One-Round Living Greyhawk Veluna Regional Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fals river rolls lazily westward through the Diocese of Falsridge. Flatbottom barges ply their trade from Mitrik to Thornwood and points west and though political tensions may be rising between the east and west the flow of money and travelers rolls on as always. Just north of where the Fals River crosses over into Bissel sits the little town of Quishern, a salt of the earth town that scratches out a living by lumbering the local forest for wood to send south to Delkellet. Its only notable feature is the huge looming landmark known as Krag Spire. It rises far over the valley that the little town calls home. All is not well in Quishern lately. Dark shadows creep throughout the town and the villagers are paralyzed in fear over what they want. Each night as the sunsets and the shadow of the spire stretches across town the same voice whispers from the darkness. &amp;quot;Give me what I want, give me my due, give me what I want, or the shadows shall consume you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for [character levels] 4 - 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 4 of the Rings of Austor series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is fully compliant with the new revised D&amp;amp;D Core Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
