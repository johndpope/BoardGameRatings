			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And Then...! is designed to be a super light-weight game system that new players can utilize to be up and running within just a few minutes.  The rules are developed into three layers, each building on the last:  Little Rules, Medium Rules, Most Rules.  New players could start with the Little Rules option and then, after some play, move on to the Medium Rules option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have four Attributes (Muscles!, Brains!, Speed!, and Help!) which are rated from 0 to 10, with points distributed from a pool (Help! always starts at 1).  Task resolution uses a D6 (or variable dice type for increased difficulty) with a 1 being a failure and a 6 being the best possible outcome.  The rules contain several random tables and a character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
