							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swords &amp; Banners</name>
									
			<description>Valiant charges, bone crushing melee, and lump-in-your-throat defense has been recreated in Swords &amp;amp; Banners, a gaming system that uses 15mm or 25mm miniatures to recreate epic Medieval historical battles from the year 870 AD to 1424 AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swords &amp;amp; Banners system has been designed to provide miniature players a historical set of parameters without sacrificing playability. Extensive research into actual formations used by medieval armies has been incorporated into these rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Swords &amp;amp; Banners system also uses modifiers that are incorporated into &amp;ldquo;At a Glance&amp;rdquo; tables, allowing players to use the tables without having to constantly refer to the rule booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are reproducible game rulers, markers, and overhead view stand counters (so you don&amp;rsquo;t even need miniatures to play the game), along with scenarios allowing you to get right into game-play!&amp;quot; (From the Introduction)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swords &amp;amp; Banners is a complete print-and-play game which comes on a CD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
