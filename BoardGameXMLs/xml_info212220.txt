			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[A Please From Beyond the Grave] starts in the village of Camfast in Falwur Province. It is located in the Bramblewood Gap and was part of Bissel before the Greyhawk wars. Although Camfast is not on the major trade routes, it is fairly close to them. At one time a fair sized village, it has shrunk to a small hamlet. Many people decided to leave Camfast for good, both before and after it was taken by Ketite forces. As a result, there are a fair number of buildings that have simply been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This concise document provides guidance to Dungeon Masters for the process of utilizing an &amp;quot;Adaptable&amp;quot; scenario for the Ket region: ADP1-08: A Plea From Beyond the Grave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
