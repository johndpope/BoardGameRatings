			<description>Scissors slashes paper, rock crushes scissors and paper smothers rock, but add a little poker in the mix and all bets are off! This quick-draw card game plays just like a traditional game of poker without the betting and adds the charm of your favorite childhood game. Players decide whether they are IN or OUT based on the best hands they can make with their cards. Packaged in a travel size card box, Rock, Paper, Poker is the two-in-one game that&amp;rsquo;s fun for everyone, everywhere!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever the player has three of a kind in their hands but different combinations (one player has scissors and other player has rock) then the typical Rock,Paper,Scissors hierarchy is played and winner collects his opponent's cards and all cards from jackpot pile.&lt;br/&gt;If two or more players have the same winning combination they place their cards in their personal piles. Losers place their cards in jackpot pile. If all players have same combination they place their cards to jackpot pile.&lt;br/&gt;When all card are used or there are too few of them the game ends and players count the cards in their own personal piles.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the players with the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
