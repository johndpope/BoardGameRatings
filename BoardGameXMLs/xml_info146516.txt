							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High Seas: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Many countries are fighting for rule of the Caribbean. Your king has equipped you with a flagship to take control of the High Seas. In a race against the other players to explore and fortify the Caribbean, the one who can assemble the largest armada will secure ultimate control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card game that is easy to learn, quick to play, and each game is different with 85 unique crew and ports, plus a variety of resources and ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game, you will search for and collect resources, maps, ship plans, and crew references. You will use these to visit exotic ports, construct forts for permanent bonuses, expand your fleet with various ships, and recruit a powerful crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first one to survive the battles and build the largest armada wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played exclusively through actions listed on cards in your 'Armada' (cards in play on the table), and a few base actions which are available to every player.  You begin the game with two cards in your Armada (3 in the shorter game), which contain basic actions, such as drawing a new card to your hand. Each player takes as many actions as they would like, and then announces their turn is over, beginning the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are divided into two types based on how often you may use them: one time per turn, and unlimited times per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through these actions, you will be able to acquire cards to your hand and draft cards from your hand to your Armada. Each card added to your Armada (ports, forts, ships, and crew) will give you additional actions you may perform each turn. You may not use the actions of cards in your hand, but the cards themselves may be spent in various ways (or drafted to your Armada).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, certain cards (such as most ships) are worth between 1 to 4 victory points.  The first player to 8 victory points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
