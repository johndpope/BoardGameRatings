			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures of Nightmare and Legend!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic adventurers--not to mention pirates, brigands, and ne'er-do-wells--need monsters to overcome, fiends to thwart, and hostile wildlife to discover. And nothing enhances a setting like a selection of creatures that were specifically created for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures of Freeport is just that--96 pages of monsters great and small, and all of them belong in the Freeport setting like your cutlass belongs in a thieving knave's vitals. But there's more! As well as the game statistics and creature descriptions that anyone can put in a monster book, Creatures of Freeport digs deeper to bring you information you can really use in your game! Within these pages you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Knowledge: What a character knows about a creature from Knowledge skills, Bardic Knowledge, and other sources of information.&lt;br/&gt;     Uses: Some creatures are valuable in their own right, and some have parts that can be used by alchemists, spellcasters and others.&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure Hooks: Most creature descriptions come with a selection of ideas for using them in your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;     Sample NPCs: Some creature descriptions include ready-to-use NPCs, in the same style as Denizens of Freeport.&lt;br/&gt;     Beastes of ye Farre Landes: A scholarly tome where characters can research the unique (not to mention monstrous) flora and fauna of the Serpent's Teeth and their surrounding waters - if they can get hold of a copy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One appendix presents some new animal species, and another covers some of the creatures from this book and the MM that can be used as companion animals in the Freeport setting--including several creatures commonly used by aquatic races as pets, guards, and hunting beasts. All stats in the book are fully 3.5 compliant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the deceptively familiar malkin to the nightmarish deadwood tree, Creatures of Freeport has what you need to keep your campaign fresh and challenging!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
