			<description>Board;&lt;br/&gt;The board is four concentric circle with 16 space each (aka a Byzantine Chessboard).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;The 32 Black and 32 white pieces are alternated like a circular checkerboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: &lt;br/&gt;This game is a two player abstract strategy game in the Mancala family.  As players sow their pieces, the board position &amp;quot;erodes&amp;quot; and leaves the players fewer and fewer options, and more and more spaces to sow pieces into to be removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is for a player to capture more of their opponent's pieces than their opponent captured of theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
