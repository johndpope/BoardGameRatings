			<description>Hog Trivia is a game that was created in 1987 and was part of a lawsuit brought on by Harley Davidson, Inc against the manufacture of the game &amp;quot;The Hog Farm&amp;quot;. The lawsuit brought forth by Harley Davidson in 1997 stopped all sale and production of the game (even though so few had been produced already, as they were only for sale at &amp;quot;The Hog Farm&amp;quot;) an appeal by the owner of the hog farm, Ronald GROTTANELLI, was partially overturned. it was found that The Hog Farm can use the term HOG, but cannot use it in conjunction with items such as this game, effectively ending this board games life span.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to collect nine t-shirt pieces. At the start of each his turn, the player has to answer a question read from a question card. If he answers correctly, he gets to roll a die and move his pawn the indicated number of spaces forward. If he lands on a t-shirt space corresponding to a t-shirt piece that he does not yet have, he gains that piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the t-shirt spaces, there are penalty spaces which will have some drawback. Among the question cards, there are bonus questions. When a player correctly answers a bonus question, he automatically advances to the next t-shirt space corresponding to a piece he does not yet have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has all nine pieces and passes the start/finish space, he wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
