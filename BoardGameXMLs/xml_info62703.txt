							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superiors: Asmodeus</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The world is a game, whose rules must be followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asmodeus and his Servitors are Lucifer's secret police, responsible for hunting down Renegades and other traitors to the infernal armies, and for keeping order in Hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prince of the Game is one of the most powerful of Hell's royalty. He is widely feared and roundly hated by his peers. His agents always have at least one cover identity and often move through infernal society unseen, only unmasking themselves to levy an accusation and make the subsequent arrest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamesters are charged with slaying or seizing any Renegades they encounter. To Asmodeus and his servants, a demon is Renegade and within their jurisdiction if he acts against the expressed or implied wishes of his Prince, if he possesses dissonance or &amp;quot;angelic&amp;quot; Discord, or if his actions call his loyalty to Hell into question - in short, if he breaks the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above all, Lucifer uses Asmodeus to weed out demons who might defect to the angels or threaten Lucifer's own plans. The Game is the counterweight to the unrest Malphas stirs up, a force of totalitarian order imposed on an ever-volatile Hell. While any Prince may call upon the Servitors of Asmodeus, most prefer to deal with problems themselves rather than risk close scrutiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've always been in the game. It's time you knew what it was.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
