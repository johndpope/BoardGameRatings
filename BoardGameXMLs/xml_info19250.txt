			<description>Fun Fair game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, the player will roll the die and move thr amount on the circular track. Rolling a 6 earns the player 3 notes, and an extra roll. Crossing the start space earns the player 2 notes. Landing on the Target allows the player to roll the die, and on a 1-3 the player earns that many notes, and a 4-6 nothing happens. On the Clover the player draws one of the 7 luck cards. Landing on the Labyrinth makes the player lose one turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landing on one of the rides allows the player to take that ride by playing the corresponding amount of notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to take all 12 rides wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Found in a Danish book, originally published in Prague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
