			<description>Find pirate&amp;rsquo;s treasure! We have gathered in a desert island of wrecked pirate ship to find treasure. To take more gold and treasure each other in frantic, pirates still remain on the island. Who could take the treasure most avoiding pirates? Good Luck~!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Goal]&lt;br/&gt;To get the most treasure tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game Play]&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 48 Gold cards, 4 Pirate cards and 1 Treasure Box card.
