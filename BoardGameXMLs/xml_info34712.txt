							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elementalis: Chaotica and Cultists</name>
									
			<description>Something has gone horribly wrong.  The Great Elemental War has been raging on for over 100 years.  The Flux is in tatters, and the Creationists can barely keep it together.  As the 5 Elementals sects continue to wage their war, an unholy power has slowly been breaking down it's cage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harmonists and Elitists combined research of their perverse magic has lead to a terrifying discovery.  Directly tapping the power of Chaos, they have gained tremendous power.  What they didn't realize is that the more they exploited this power, the easier it had becoming for the Gods of Chaotica and their cultists to escape their long forgotten prisons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chaos has been unleashed.  The very existence of mankind is now in danger.  Can these ancient Gods be stopped, or is their power too much to overcome?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaotica and Cultists is a free expansion for Elementalis. This expansion allows the game to handle up to 5 players with two new Mage types to diversify game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chaotica harness the powers of Chaos to choose a new Major Arcana every turn, while their blind followers, the Cultists, can reroll the Sun die once each roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
