			<description>&amp;quot;Join the Earth Heroes on a quest to save the planet!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is time for kids to take charge and rescue Earth, which has been ruined by adults. The players are time travelling heroes who must make their way back to Earth from 2259AD and save it from destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a Team Play option where co-operation is essential, instead of playing as individuals. Game play consists of moving by die roll and following the instructions on the square reached: this could be answering a question from a card, taking a chance card or doing an action card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no waste in the game - the box becomes the board, all the components are made from recycled materials  and there is no plastic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced by a team of high school students as part of Young Enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
