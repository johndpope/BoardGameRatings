			<description>from designer's webpage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here they come!  Black as hell and thick as grass!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;                                      ...Private Frederic  Hitch, V.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zulu! covers the famous defense of Rorke&amp;rsquo;s Drift by 'B' Company, 2nd Battalion, 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has no hexes, no squares, no point-to-point.  It also has counters with no ratings.  In some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s like cardboard miniatures &amp;hellip; with fewer rules. The game system highlights the firepower of the British Martini Henry rifle, the value of a solid defensive position, and the greatly superior numbers of the three Zulu amabutho that gave them something like forty-to-one numerical superiority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even so, each British counter represents one man, and we have identified each with his name and unit. Zulu combat counters represent about 25-30 men, but that usage is not literal, given the unusual system. The map scale is 1&amp;rdquo; = 4 yards. The mechanics cover such facets of the engagement as Zulu fire from the Oskarberg terraces, the Hospital and its patients, the pros and cons of setting fire to that building, even possible heroics by the very men who earned Victoria Crosses for their actions during the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes scenarios on  Isandlwana &amp;amp; Kambula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
