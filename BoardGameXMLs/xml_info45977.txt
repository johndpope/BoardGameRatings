							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kurishan&#039;s Garden</name>
									
			<description>From the front cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kurishan's Garden is a d20 System adventure booster designed for 4-6 characters levels 5-6. It can be played as a stand-alone adventure or dropped into any ongoing campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you take a well-deserved break in a city that seems friendly enough, you quickly notice an unusual amount of activity around the marketplace, as well as the unreasonable cost for meals at every inn. You soon discover that many food items have become scarce in the city, causing prices for those goods to soar and creating a mild panic among the population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having heard of your party of bold adventurers, Marrick, a leader among the local merchants, approaches you on behalf of his fellows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Over the past few years,&amp;quot; Marrick explains, &amp;quot;our fair city has become dependent upon a village named Darbin, about five day's travel to the west. The village's farms yield a great harvest each year, and they have become a major supplier of our city's fruit and vegetables.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The problem is this: No deliveries have been made by the farmers of Darbin in over two months. Twice messengers have been sent to Darbin, but neither has returned....&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We ask that you go to Darbin and speak with Brock Gnath, the head of the village's farmers, and find out what needs to be done to rectify this situation. A few of us have collected what we hope is a reasonable sum in payment for your services.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Please accept our offer. We need your help.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
