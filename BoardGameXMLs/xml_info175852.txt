			<description>Oh Snap! is a game for three or more players in which the players have a hand of cards. The goal is to create the best insults and retorts that include the phrases on the cards in your hand. Two of these players put down the cards they want, and the rest of the players vote on which one they like the best. The first player to reach an arbitrary number of points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
