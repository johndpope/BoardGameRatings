							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Return of the Lizard King</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only a few short years have passed since the Lizard King of Fire Island was slain by a brave adventurer and the good folk of Oyster Bay were released from imprisonment. They thought their troubles were over, but news has reached them that the Lizard King has been brought back from the dead! The Undead Lizard King, assisted by a powerful priest, is now gathering together a new force of Lizard Men and is determined to exact revenge on the people who have escaped him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are spending some time in the nefarious Port Blacksand when the wizard Nicodemus summons you. YOU have been recommended for the task of slaying the Undead Lizard King!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two dice, a pencil and an eraser are all you need to embark on this thrilling adventure of sword and sorcery, complete with its elaborate combat system and a score sheet to record your gains and losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many dangers lie ahead and your success is by no means certain. Powerful adversaries are ranged against you and often your only choice is to kill or be killed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
