			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This document is the first of This document is the irst of a series of Times and Streams for Timestream, the role-playing game of cinematic time travel. Streams are pre-generated situations for a game of Timestream that present a certain twist on the open-ended setting of the basic game. They are intended to give a broad backdrop against which to place a certain kind of character. Times are detailed timeframes within which to place a game of Timestream. They give more information about particular eras, in order to help guide play of characters from those timeframes, or through events set in those eras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time&amp;rsquo;s Champions is a Stream, presenting a world where the Gods themselves imbue mortals with temporal powers in order to play out the battles of the Divine across the bounds of time itself. This PDF contains a description of the backdrop against which a Time&amp;rsquo;s Champions game is played; rules tweaks and changes from the basic Timestream rules that facilitate this play; pre-generated characters to serve as protagonists, Anchors, or foes; and Faith, a new resource which character&amp;rsquo;s draw upon in order to serve their Gods. A copy of Timestream: A Role-Playing Game is required for play.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
