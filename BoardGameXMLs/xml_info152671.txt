			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavy Metal Black Ops&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For as long as military forces and governments have employed them, special forces and other covert operations units have employed the latest, and most advanced technologies available to give them an edge in combat. The fires of the Jihad have been no exception. Employing a mix of the most radical technologies in stealth, electronics, and advanced weaponry, the elite shadow warriors from across the Inner Sphere continue to do battle with some of the most cutting edge BattleMechs, vehicles, and battlesuits that money can buy&amp;mdash;all optimized for the deadliest of &amp;quot;black ops&amp;quot; missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Tech Readout: Phantoms samples a number of high-technology designs developed for use by elite covert operatives and special military forces found throughout the Inner Sphere in the late-Jihad period. Each design featured in this book demonstrates the advanced and experimental technologies found in Tactical Operations. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battlesuits presented in this book, ready for play in advanced BattleTech games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
