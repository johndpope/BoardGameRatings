			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situation...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the summer of 1942. As World War II enters its third year, the North Sea port of Zielhafen is an important base for U-Boat operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Commander of the Luftwaffe Jagdstaffel (fighter squadron) based at Zielhafen, you are responsible for the defense of the city against American bomber attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your FW190s are the Luftwaffe's most effective fighters and are expected to annihilate any unescorted bomber formations. U.S. bombers are fast, sturdy and well-armed, but they do have their weak spots (which you will have to discover to succeed).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also have to learn how to deal with the long-range fighters which have begun to escort the bomber formations. In some cases you can outmaneuver them and get at the bombers without a fight, but some types must be elminated directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will control your Jagdstaffel. The computer controls the attacking enemy bombers and their escorting fighters. Your planning and judgement will determine the outcome in this recreation of one of the critical campaigns of World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
