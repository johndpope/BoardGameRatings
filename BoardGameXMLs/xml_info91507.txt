							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MotoGP 10/11</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MotoGP 10/11 is a motorcycle racing game developed by Monumental Games. The game is based on the licensed content of the Moto Grand Prix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title continues Capcom&amp;rsquo;s series with a number of new features. Firstly, 10/11 is the first MotoGP game to feature driving assists. There are a range of settings that players can activate which will enable a variety of assistive controls, including automating front and rear ABS, auto brake, auto tuck-in during straight parts of track, anti-wheelie measures, and traction control. Players can race with any combination of these aids to customize the simulation level to their play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other new element that has been added to the series is a cooperative season mode. Now players can have a friend drop in during a race and control a teammate. There is also a 20 player online multiplayer feature available for players to race against the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sound and graphics have both been completely reworked since the previous title to better emulate the actual sensations on the track. MotoGP 10/11 includes actual racers, tracks, and bikes from the 2010 season, and will have 2011 content available for download as the season advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
