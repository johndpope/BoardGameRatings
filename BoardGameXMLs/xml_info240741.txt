			<description>The fast paced game of languages and offence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 10 languages each with 8 swear words over four different levels of offence (Extreme, Offensive, Rude, Mild) The object of the game is to get rid of all of your cards by playing cards of the same language or same level of offence. When you play a language card you must say the word or you pick up two!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of special cards added to the mix which allow you to screw over other players and can get you out of difficult situations as they can be played on any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For an added twist there is always a RULE in play. This can be anything from picking up additional cards from saying the words in an accent to ending the game quicker. You can play a RULE card at ANY time to wreak havoc amongst your oppenents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a 'make your own' set for adding those extra special words!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many can you offend?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
