			<description>From the publisher's press release:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid Response is the fast-paced, question and answer game that pits your basic knowledge up against a twisted timer! Families and friends will have a blast trying to multitask as the questions fly, the balls drop and the bell dings. Don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted by the &amp;ldquo;DING!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; as time quickly runs out! Quickly give your partner clues to guess the category on the card: &amp;ldquo;Cake&amp;hellip;Ice Cream, Candles&amp;hellip;Streamers&amp;ldquo; Your partner shouts &amp;ldquo;Birthday Parties!&amp;rdquo; Right! Now grab a marble from the bottom trough and put it back into the funnel at the top of the slide to buy yourself more time.&lt;br/&gt; The object of the game is to quickly (and correctly) guess the phrases being described by your partner before all the marbles run down. Open-ended categories make it easy for all ages to get into the action &amp;ndash; hints can be as complex or simple as you need them to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
