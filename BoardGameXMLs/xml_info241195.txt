							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Norsaga: Kickstarter 2017 Promo Cards</name>
									
			<description>Ten cards that expand Norsaga: Odds and Endings from the associated Kickstarter campaign:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immortal - Watcher: Unsung Donwen&lt;br/&gt;Heirloom - The Empty Mask: Fimble&lt;br/&gt;Fae Legend: Gael the Winterwose&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Legend: Yldivard Ash-Coat&lt;br/&gt;The Saga of Skade - Goddess of the Mists (Might, Faith, and So Much Lore)&lt;br/&gt;The Saga of Skade - Goddess of the Mists (Might, Faith, and So Much Craft)&lt;br/&gt;Immortal - Guardian: Thrice-Woke Omhar, Ulwilda Fading, Agmind the Intrepid, and Soul-catcher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Immortals -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These special double-sided heroes form their own deck, and one is dealt to each player at the start of the game. Before you can call on your immortal, you have to unlock them by proving your lineage. Spare inheritance markers are used to track progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a hero of the appropriate color is added to your family tree, you advance the marker. Reach the top of the track and the immortal flips to their unlocked side!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlocked immortals have varying abilities. Guardians can be moved onto your existing heroes at the start of your turn, altering their traits. Watchers remain on the sidelines but provide free first-generation embellishments every other turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the inheritance marker from your unlocked immortal is swapped into your saga, giving you greater flexibility towards completing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Heirlooms -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like immortals, heirlooms form their own deck, and one is dealt to each player at the start of the game. These family relics start out cursed, preventing you from inheriting your youngest hero's dominant trait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To break your curse, you'll have to sacrifice 3 different heroes in a particular order by dismissing them from your family tree. The color of your next sacrifice is dictated by the topmost icon on your heirloom, which is rotated counterclockwise afterwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the third sacrifice, the curse is broken and your heirloom flips. This restores your youngest hero's ability to inherit and permanently augments them with a second color, giving you access to multiple embellishment trees for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
