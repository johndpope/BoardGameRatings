							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of Lake Erie, September 1813</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;The Battle of Lake Erie, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Put-In-Bay, was fought on September 10, 1813 on Lake Erie off the coast of Ohio during the War of 1812.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Under light and variable winds, nine American vessels under the command of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry challenged the British Commander Robert Barclay&amp;rsquo;s squadron of six vessels for control of the lake.  Whoever controls the lake controls the movement of troops and supplies along the border between British Canada and the United States.  Victory goes to the side disabling or sinking the most enemy vessels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students. The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using miniature ships. Free print-and-play paper miniatures designed to accommodate the unusual combat resolution system are available on the Junior General site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The British Royal Navy order of battle consists of two ships, a brig, two schooners, and a sloop. The United States Navy has three brigs, five schooners, and a sloop. Each class of ship is rated for hull strength, sail points, and salvo size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses an unusual method to resolve fire combat - the players roll pennies from atop the miniature ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
