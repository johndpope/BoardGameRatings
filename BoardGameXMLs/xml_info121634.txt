			<description>Rock, Roadies and Roll is a game for 3 to 5 players where one must guide a band from the humble beginning playing in garages to the heights of fame! Bands are defined by four attributes which can be increased throughout the game: Confidence, Talent and Guitars, and Amps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Phase 1, players hire up to 3 Roadies and add these to their band of 3. They will place these 6 'workers' on action spaces such as: Drop off Demo tapes, Hang up Concert Posters, Record Album, Buy/Sell Gear, etc...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2 is a cash auction for Booking Agents which will lend their precious 'Leverage' to the band to get them gigs for the weekend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 3 is an auction using the Booking Agents' leverage to try to secure the best gigs for the weekend. Players can pick up gigs for Friday and/or Saturday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the bidding is over, or all players have 2 gigs, players will 'play' their gigs. Add the band's confidence to 1D6 and compare to the difficulty of each gig to see if the Band bombed or blew the roof off! Increase your fame accordingly, get paid and cash in on royalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last gig card is drawn, complete that round. Whichever player has the most Fame, is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
