			<description>It's Franklin's birthday and his friends are bringing presents. On his turn, a player spins the spinner. Franklin is moved first, then the player token. When a player ends up in a present square of his player color, or shares a square with Franklin, he can give a present to Franklin. Then the player must go and pick up another present from his starting square. The first player to deliver three presents to Franklin wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
