			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starship Troopers: Terran Ascendancy is a 3D RTS game inspired both by the Starship Troopers movie and the eponymous book. In this mission-based game, players lead up to three squads of Mobile Infantry troopers and various specialist soldiers against an overwhelming army of Bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game missions are real-time tactical battles, where players have to maneuver their squads on the battlefield to find optimal firing position and avoid being overwhelmed by the enemy. Each soldier can be equipped with different weapons (from automatic rifle to nuclear rocket launcher) and gear (targetting equipment, first-aid kit, nerve gas canisters to destroy bug nests). Soldiers gain experience levels, which can allow them to wear combat armor, which makes them stronger and allow them to use better weapons, forcefields and jetpacks. A number of specialist soldiers (combat engineers, medics, PSI soldiers) can also be added to squads to increase tactical flexibility. Missions are varied, including search and destroy, bug capture and rescue operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
