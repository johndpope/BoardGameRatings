			<description>Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't let the other guy have all the fun!  It's your game, too.  Roleplaying is a contact sport, so get in there and make it happen!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There may be a reason why your games aren't as awesome as they could be.  Could be the system, might be the GM, or possibly it's you - the player.  I'm not saying this little self-help guide will turn you into the boss overnight, but it's a start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Game Master like a F****** Boss has done a lot of good for GMs over the last couple years.  This shows the other side of the curtain, and I believe it's just as vital for GMs to know what's going on with players as it is for players to examine life behind the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a quick but important read with tips, tricks, and techniques for getting the most out of your roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
