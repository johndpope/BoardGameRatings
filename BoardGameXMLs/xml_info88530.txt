			<description>This game is part of the Paw Prints Floor Games series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paw tiles are placed on the ground, and several games are played as children need to step on the `paw prints' in animal fashion.  In the game &amp;quot;Let's Switch&amp;quot;, you need to pick an animal print and act like that animal until you draw a card with a different animal. In the game &amp;quot;Time to Go Home&amp;quot;, you need to follow directions to bring the animals home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the the inventor, I have found through dozens of classroom studies that children love to carry this game with them everywhere they go. That is why I designed the tote box to make them easier to carry with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no limits to this game, you can make up any game you like, like :hide and go feet&amp;quot; and countless others.... just let your children come up with their own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
