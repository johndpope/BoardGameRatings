							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Quest Dungeon II</name>
									
			<description>In the original Dragon Quest Dungeon, players places squares shape blocks off walls on the individual squares of the dungeon. In this game, the walls are thin, and get placed between the squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is much more of the simple 'feeling your way along an invisible maze' feel. There's an option to use the monster and treasures from the first game, but by itself its meant to be more of a race to the exit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
