			<description>Dogeza in the Pacific is a strategic level wargame of the Pacific War. In a two-player case, the flavor of this game is a compact edition of Avalon Hill's Victory in the Pacific, but in a four-player case, each player (Japanese Army, Japanese Navy, U.S. Army and U.S. Navy) fights each other in order to save face of each organization. Sometimes army player cannot help using navy units. Sometimes navy player cannot help using army units. If so, they cannot help performing dogeza (prostration, kowtow) to borrow the unit even though it is losing face. Therefore, they fight each other for their organization's face rather than their motherland's future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
