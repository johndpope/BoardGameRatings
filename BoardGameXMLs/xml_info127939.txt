							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BrainBox: Deutschland</name>
									
			<description>This is a Germany-themed BrainBox game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description provided by the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you know which regions the river Rhine flows through Or where the N&amp;uuml;rburgring is? BrainBox All Around Germany contains 69 beautifully-illustrated cards showing the very best Germany has to offer, and then some! The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner. Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun. Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
