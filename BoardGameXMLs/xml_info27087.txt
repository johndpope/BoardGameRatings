			<description>From description: Defining a Nation: India on the Eve of Independence,1945 is set at Simla, in the foothills of the Himalayas, where the British viceroy has invited leaders of various religious and political constituencies to work out the future of Britain&amp;rsquo;s largest colony.  Will the British transfer power to the Indian National Congress, which claims to speak for all Indians?  Or will a separate Muslim state&amp;mdash;Pakistan&amp;mdash;be carved out of India to be ruled by Muslims, as the Muslim League proposes?  And what will happen to the vulnerable minorities&amp;mdash;such as the Sikhs and untouchables&amp;mdash;or the hundreds of princely states?  As British authority wanes, smoldering tensions among Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs increasingly flare into violent riots that threaten to ignite all India.  Towering above it all is the frail but formidable figure of Gandhi, whom some revere as an apostle of non-violence and others regard as a conniving Hindu politician.  Students struggle to reconcile religious identity with nation building&amp;mdash;perhaps the most intractable and important issue of the modern world.  Texts include the literature of Hindu revival (Chatterjee, Tagore and Tilak); the Koran and the literature of Islamic nationalism (Iqbal); and the writings of Ambedkar, Nehru, Jinnah, and Gandhi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in other Reacting to the Past games, participants are given secret role sheets with victory objectives.  Debate and negotiation are the major mechanics used in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
