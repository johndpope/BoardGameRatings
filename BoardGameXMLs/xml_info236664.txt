			<description>A One-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever Eve's secret is, she's awfully touchy about it; not that there aren't a few things about your life that no one knows about.  In any case, everyone has to work together if an adventuring party is going to survive and, hopefully, be prosperous. Times are tough and your party's last job was a disaster.  You've been selling magic items just to eat. Maybe this next town will have a job... a job better than mucking out stalls and baling hay for a meal.  Some danger, some excitement, some treasure...now that would be a good thing. An adventure for characters of levels of about 8th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
