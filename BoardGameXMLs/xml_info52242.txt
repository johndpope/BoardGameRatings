			<description>Shape shifters, those beings of such mercurial nature that their very bodies are not static, appear throughout literary history.  The characters range from the fantastic -- super heroes who can stretch, shrink, grow to enormous size or change their very appearance to the terrifying -- werewolves terrifying the countryside during the full moon, Dr Jekyll's transformation to Mr Hyde or the alien &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; who have assumed the form of your loved ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Metamorph gives you all the tools you need for creating and running these form-changing characters.  Included in the book are new powers, advantages, limitations, power tricks and plot hooks.  Several example characters are also presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--user description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TIME FOR A CHANGE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From genre to genre, one of the most popular and intriguing types of characters you can play are metamorphs - characters who change some aspect of their shape, form, or being.
