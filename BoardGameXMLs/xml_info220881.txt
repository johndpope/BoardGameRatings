							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Races of Everglow</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's easy to be distracted by the colorful ponies that have laid dominion over the world of Everglow, but they are far from the only race that has carved out their own portion of things and demands recognition. From the whimsical flutterponies to the despised impure, these lesser races are given a chance to be known, from social mores to combat abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Book Includes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Two New Races!&lt;br/&gt;        Take control of the gem gnolls, if they&amp;rsquo;ll let you. Seek treasure at all costs, or perhaps look for a better way?&lt;br/&gt;        The donkies of Everglow were not given a fair shake. The impure are prejudiced against harshly, but under your guidance, perhaps they can find justice, or at least peace.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Well As:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dozens of feats&lt;br/&gt;     Many new spells&lt;br/&gt;     Compatible with both Pathfinder and the 5th edition of the most popular roleplaying game&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed looks into the lives of each race, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
