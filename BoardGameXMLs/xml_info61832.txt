			<description>Back Cover Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        A new beginning...&lt;br/&gt;        Tabula rasa, a blank slate. CORPS is the role-playing system that looks at what you want. Rules you can remember. Dice you don't have to use. Guidelines for both new and experienced players. Everything you need in one volume that half the thickness you would normally expect. From swords to psionics, magic to machine guns, past present or future, this game has what you need.&lt;br/&gt;        It's complete. It's omniversal. The only thing it can't supply is what you have to bring to the game...Imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        While retaining the mechanics of 1st edition, 2nd edition is settingless, and fairly complete. It does not include vehicle nor weapon creation rules, but uses CORPS VDS and 3G3 for those.&lt;br/&gt;        1d10 per player. &lt;br/&gt;        multiple pool point-based character generation; &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;        Attribute Points &lt;br/&gt;        Skill points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Color Text Blocks delineating...&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;        Information blocks: design commentary, synopses, and elucidations&lt;br/&gt;        Alert Blocks: Rules cross-references, warnings of potential abuses.&lt;br/&gt;        Don't Do This Warnings: warnings about things that will break the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
