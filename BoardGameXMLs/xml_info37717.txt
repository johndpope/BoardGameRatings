							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheshire Ring</name>
									
			<description>The Canal Age and the Industrial Revolution that birthed it produced several new transportation systems, one of which was a circular canal network known as the Cheshire Ring. Narrow boats were pulled around the ring carrying stone, coal, and iron for use in development of the landscape. The boatmen were paid for delivery and paid the expenses of the trip from this amount. One of the largest expenses was tolls, which were set not only on the amount of goods but also the type of goods carried. Clever but unscrupulous boatmen soon learned that by mixing loads they could fool the toll keepers to help reduce their expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player owns two narrow boats and use actions to move their cargo from one market to another along the canal. As they move through the toll houses (the signature Stratamax colored dice), the house owner must be paid. It is up to the toll house owner to decide whether to take the toll offered or use an action to inspect the load in case the boatman is trying to rip him off. If caught in a deception, the boat owner pays a fine. However, if the boatman was honorable then the toll house owner gets a penalty for the time and delay caused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
