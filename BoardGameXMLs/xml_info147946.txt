							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wagons Roll</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full color set of ten Wagons and Accessories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It comes with Square, and Hex Overlays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wagon&amp;rsquo;s Roll includes a collection of carriages, covered and uncovered wagons, and carts with and without horses and oxen to pull them set on a grass field or cobblestone background allowing the module to be used in either wilderness or urban environments. There is a well-traveled path in a grass field with some surrounding forest and a cobbled city street surrounded by buildings that can be used to set up encounters with the carriages.  There are also obstacles such as overturned carriages, a dead ox, rocks, logs, barricades, etc. that can be used to set up a roadblock or as components of a chase scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wagon&amp;rsquo;s Roll can be used to set up a ton of encounters both in the wilderness and in town. The classic adventure is a caravan guard mission. The Player Characters are hired by a merchant to guard a collection of wagons to its destination where its goods will be sold. Bandits and thieves may be after the goods. In the crowded city streets before leaving town, they could set up a blockade with an overturned wagon. With the caravan stopped, they then climb out from the windows of nearby buildings rappelling and then leaping onto the top of the carriages. They then start a fight on the top of the wagons, trying to knock out the drivers, and perhaps hijack the carriages to another destination.  Once the caravan makes it to the wilderness, bandits on horseback may chase after them, leading to a chase scene using the obstacles. A different wilderness encounter could be like the one in town, they set up a road obstacle, and then ambush the caravan from the cover of the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Player Characters may even have an investigation scene when they find a dead ox and a flipped over carriage and try to figure out what happened to them. Bandits? Or something more sinister? The first thing to investigate would be how did the ox die? The ox could have died from being trampled, poisoned, diseased, or even famine. The second thing to investigate would be the condition of the carriage. The carriage could have been flipped, crashed into a tree, burned, crushed, etc. The Game Master could use this as an adventure hook or even a subtle warning of a possible danger later down the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another encounter would be the Player Characters are wandering through the wilderness and happen upon a friendly traveling merchant in his carriage willing to sell the Player Characters some goods. This gives them a chance to supply on the road and continue an adventure without returning to town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if not using Wagon&amp;rsquo;s Roll to set up an adventure, Game Masters and Player Characters alike will find this module extremely useful. If a Player Character buys a small cart in town, he can get one of the small handcarts or wheelbarrows in this module for carrying extra goods. If a Player Character buys a large cart, he can get one of the larger carts and will likely need to buy some oxen or horses to pull the cart around for carrying larger amounts of extra goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
