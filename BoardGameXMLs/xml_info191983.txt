			<description>THEME&lt;br/&gt;YEAR = 2025&lt;br/&gt;WORLD POPULATION = 8 Billion&lt;br/&gt;GLOBAL TEMPERATURE RISE = 1 degree C&lt;br/&gt;As the first quarter of the century comes to an end, world leaders have yet to achieve any meaningful reduction in global carbon emissions. Food production is being disrupted around the world, and demand is surging for dwindling resources. In the decades to come there will be countless crises, like economic collapse, political revolutions, disastrous weather, failed states, disruptive technologies with unknown consequences, and much more. The only certainty is that when people are faced with famine, they will always migrate and raid their neighbors before starving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the near future, the players take on the roles of the USA, Western Europe, Russia, China, and India. Collectively, these five major global powers dominate the world&amp;rsquo;s economic, military, political, social, and technological powers. By cooperating and strategizing, the players must put their collective powers into actions to lower carbon emissions while resolving the many crises around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;The world is divided into 15 regions, each with its own population, food capacity, carbon emissions, sociopolitical stability, and likely number of people that would suffer when hit by famine. At the start of each turn a number of crises are revealed to all the players. Each crisis is associated with one of the 15 regions. The players must then decide what actions they will take, unilaterally or jointly, to resolve which crises by implementing their economic, military, political, social, technological powers. Alongside dealing with crises around the world, the players must quickly reduce global carbon emissions and prevent their own regions from becoming a failed state. This can be done by implementing green energies and developing advanced technologies. At the end of each turn the global temperature rises, and if it exceeds a new threshold then food capacity is reduced in every region worldwide. If any region loses its ability to feed its population then famine strikes, starting a chain reaction of refugees, conflicts, failed states, and megadeath! Players must devise innovative solutions to tackle Earth&amp;rsquo;s most urgent problems. Act too selfishly, and you accelerate humanity&amp;rsquo;s demise. Act too altruistically, and you could be overrun by climate refugees and chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EVERYONE LOSES WHEN&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;If the global temperature rises by six degrees Celsius, there won&amp;rsquo;t be any way to stop the runaway greenhouse. It will result in Earth&amp;rsquo;s sixth mass extinction, possibly the greatest one in geologic time! Still, a rising global temperature alone is not the only thing that can bring the end of human civilization. Some regions of the world and its people may be forsaken, mired in conflicts, epidemics, and anarchy. If the chaos consumes most of the world then there will be no safe-haven left for anyone, and all nations will inevitable become failed states. If either condition is met before the end of this century then it is a Global Collapse . . . the beginning of the end of all human civilization!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU WIN WHEN&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;If the two conditions for losing are not met by the end of this century, and your region is not a failed state, then humanity is saved and your civilization leads the world into the next century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
