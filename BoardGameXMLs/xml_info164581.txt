			<description>Two Sides of Harbor Prime&lt;br/&gt;The outskirts of the city are plagued by crime, poverty and filth. Out there, every day is a new struggle for survival. The wealthier districts are full of skyscrapers and bustling businesses. Yet beneath the sleek exterior, another war is going on, as powerful corporations are constantly at each other's throats. Woe to those who become entangled in their conspiracies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The streets of Harbor Prime offer countless opportunities. In this open world, you get to influence the fate of everyone you meet, fight against dangerous gangs, expose corporate secrets, dive into the depths of Cyberspace, develop Dex's skills, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate in Your Hands&lt;br/&gt;Dex is the heroine, albeit against her will. Chased by corporate mercs, without a clue as to why, she gets thrown into a web of intrigue, leading her to question the origins of her own existence. A trio of hacktivists help her in her quest &amp;mdash; the mysterious Raycast, the protective Decker and the light-minded Tony. Only you get to decide how the story ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real-Time Combat&lt;br/&gt;Dex's flexible real-time combat system is reminiscent of the classic arcade games from the 90s, and offers many ways to deal with your opponents. Besides melee combat, Dex can also handle a variety of firearms, or alter the physical world via augmented reality. Use mechanical implants to make yourself nearly invincible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyberspace&lt;br/&gt;The future is filled with sophisticated security systems and foes sporting robotic implants. Yet those can easily be incapacitated or even destroyed by venturing through Cyberspace, an artificial realm inhabited by malicious viruses, security towers, walls, gates, black holes and other deadly entities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
