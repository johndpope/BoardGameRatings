			<description>From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Ops offers high octane action adventures in any setting you desire. Players will form a cohesive team of skilled individuals facing challenging missions. From mysterious investigations to heated shoot-outs, from dangerous deceptions to hectic chases, this game focuses on the &amp;quot;tactical&amp;quot; use of fiction, description and ideas rather than number crunching and rules min-maxing. Then again, you also get to roll a bucket load of dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a GM-Less game unlike any other. Most games of this kind work by turning all Players in part-time GMs. Instead Tactical Ops uses every trick at its disposal to emulate the sensation of &amp;quot;just being a Player&amp;quot;: you never act as director of a story, you never know what lays behind the next corner, you never have all the answers. You play your character as you would normally do, while the structure of the game and its rules take care of everything else with the contribution of all Players involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This allows you to explore rich and detailed game settings that no one had to prepare or study, and live engaging stories that no one has decided beforehand but feel like someone had tailored them just for you. The aim is to make you feel like an invisible GM is at the table, maneuvering the opposition and plotting the events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2-5 participants.&lt;br/&gt;Zero Prep (after character generation)&lt;br/&gt;GM-less.&lt;br/&gt;One Shot friendly, geared towards medium/long play (5-15 sessions)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
