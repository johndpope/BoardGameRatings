							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mind War</name>
									
			<description>One of the &amp;quot;Warriors of the Green Planet Trilogy of Games&amp;quot;. The games are set on a future Earth that has suffered an &amp;quot;axial flip of 72 degrees&amp;quot;, resulting in various disasters and changes that result in this hypothetical post-apocalyptic game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mind War each player controls one, or perhaps a few mind warriors. Each player simultaneously plots where they are moving, where they are attacking, where they are defending, and how many mental points are to be allocated to each of these activities. Players then simultaneously move, and resolve their attacks. Iterate till one side is standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of expansion rules allowed Mind War to be played together with the companion games Warriors of the Green Planet and War of the Sky Galleons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
