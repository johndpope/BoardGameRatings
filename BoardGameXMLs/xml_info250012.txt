							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Inhabitants of a Naughty Sea Side Tavern, Third Round</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 Inhabitants of a rather rough and tumble coastal drinking hole. Some of these folks live up to the foul reputation of the public house while others would do well to flee the premises while they still have their coin, dignity, or body parts intact. This file was created for fantasy to colonial pirate role playing in mind, but is suitable for most coastal fantasy settings as well. Document contains the individuals first name and surname along with a brief description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
