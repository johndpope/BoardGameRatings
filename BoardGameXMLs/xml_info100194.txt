			<description>Paper-and-pencil game where from 2 to 4 players must score the most possible points after marking the fifth dot (later cross) on a row or column of an 8x8 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round consists of two phases: in the first phase players mark in turns a square on the board with a dot - the first one to mark the fifth square in a row, column or main diagonal scores as many points as dots drawn by the other players in that row, column or main diagonal. In the second phase players mark free squares in similar fashion but with crosses; the first player to mark the fifth cross in a row, column or main diagonal scores as many points as crosses drawn by the other players in that row, column or main diagonal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
