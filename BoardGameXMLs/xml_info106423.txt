			<description>England, 1073. You are the Reeve of a Feudal Manor.  Compete against other Reeves for farmland while dealing with Blights, The Plague and the occasional Flood. The Objective of Feudal Endeavour: Fields &amp;amp; Fenceposts is to plant as many Fields of Crops as possible in order to have the largest harvest, gaining bonuses from Field size and proximity to water.&lt;br/&gt;On their turn each player may play one to five Crop Cards or an Action Card from their hand following the instructions on the Card. When Crop Cards are played either a tile is placed on the board whose value is equal to the number of Crop Cards played or number of tiles whose total value is equal.&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a 14 in. diameter circle with a smaller circle inside used for 2-3 player games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
