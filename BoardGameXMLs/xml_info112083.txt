							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Creative Kitchen: The Game</name>
									
			<description>Creative Kitchen is board game that brings together your creative and culinary skills while mixing in a few good laughs. Originally designed to help engage students at a local culinary training program in Savannah, Georgia (Starfish Caf&amp;eacute;), the game has earned rave reviews from both home cooks and professional chefs in prototyping sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by dealing each &amp;ldquo;chef contestant&amp;rdquo; a set of ingredient cards. Based off the mystery box ingredient concept popular in shows such as Food Network&amp;rsquo;s Chopped and Iron Chef, players can discard and pick up new ingredients in their quest to make the best recipe out of their hand. Contestants then have to name and illustrate their dish on provided recipe cards and sell it to their panel of judges (their fellow contestants!). Creative Kitchen is a great way to gather recipes from friends and share a few laughs over &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; recipes. Cheers to Creative Kitchen&amp;rsquo;s next master chef!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, the board game design includes 110 ingredient cards (expansion decks to come!), game board, kitchen timing device, pad of blank recipe cards and eye catching Creative Kitchen box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
