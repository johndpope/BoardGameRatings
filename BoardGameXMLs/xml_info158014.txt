							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Threats: Dawn of the Dwimmerlaik</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We need no god because we have stood as gods.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For aeons, the Dwimmerlaik walked the Grand Stair. They ruled countless Gossamer worlds, and those that they did not they destroyed. Their name stirs fear and dread across the Grand Stair even today. They reigned unopposed for millennia until the rise of the Gossamer Lords, and a centuries long war finally ended with their entire race exiled into the void of Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But where did the Dwimmerlaik come from? From where did they get the power to walk upon the Grand Stair? What we know of them comes only from whispers and rumors&amp;hellip;until now. The notes within this volume, found by a young Gossamer Lord as she reveals details of the Dwimmerlaik never before known: their origins, their powers, and their culture. But are these notes to be believed, or yet another trick from a race known for their lies and deceit?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter and discover for yourself, the Dawn of the Dwimmerlaik!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
