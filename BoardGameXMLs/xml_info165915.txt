							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WWI: The Tug of War</name>
									
			<description>In WWI: The Tug of War, two players compete in a very light, fast-playing game of dice-rolling and battle, as all the major countries involved in &amp;ldquo;The Great War&amp;rdquo; are slowly and inexorably tugged into the conflict. Game turns quickly become combat events, with the outcome in doubt and usually dependent on the entrance of the United States into the fray, ending a long and bitter back-and-forth stalemate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player always rolls two red dice. He/she will roll one or more four white dice along with the two red dice after he has cards with at least three dice icons, rounded down, in front of him. At the start of the game each player has a card with a half-die in front of him. He or she will therefore need to get cards into the war with two-and-a-half more dice icons to be able to roll a total of three dice (two red and one white).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the red dice total matches the entry number of one of your nation&amp;rsquo;s cards it enters the war and its dice icon(s) will be available to you on your next turn. To score a hit (i.e., win a battle), you must roll a 5 or 6 on a white die. If you do, move the token one space toward you on the Tug of War track. Move the token to your &amp;quot;Win&amp;quot; space and you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you'll have to choose between the red and white dice result, and when one player can roll all six dice, the end of game sequence will trigger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
