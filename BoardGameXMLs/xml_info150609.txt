							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PX Poker Night</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Platte Air Force Base Nebraska, the last stop on your road to a dishonorable discharge. Platte AFB is where the junk the Air Force doesn't want ends up: obsolete aircraft and personnel who can't be expected to do any better than mothball rusting aircraft. The only break in the deadly dull routine of base maintenance is the one or two times a month a surplus aircraft flies in. Parked in the aircraft &amp;quot;graveyard,&amp;quot; drained of fuel, fluids and sealed against the elements, row after row of these planes mark the slow passage of time at Platte AFB. Miles from anything resembling civilization, there's not much to do but count the days until your assignment ends and you can eithe r get out of the Air Force or get your career back on track.  &lt;br/&gt;But Saturday evening at 8pm, rain or shine, it's PX Poker Night. With nothing but poor reception of broadcast TV in the offering, everyone joins in this weekly ritual. After all, where else are you going to get a chance to win your commanding officer's paycheck? Only this Saturday's PX Poker Night is about to take a turn for the bizarre &amp;hellip; and deadly. Mysterious visitors have arrived at Platte AFB, and what they bring with them will sow madness and gruesome death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended as a introductory scenario for Pagan Publishing's Delta Green source book for the Call of Cthulhu RPG, PX Poker Night is intended to be run in less than four hours. The scenario comes with 11 Pre-Generated Characters suitable for a quick one-off game, or the Keeper can use them to fill out the staff at Platte Air Force Base if the players want to generate their own characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
