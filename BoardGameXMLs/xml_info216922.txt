							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Timely Undeath</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Timely Undeath is a standalone encounter designed for five characters between levels 7 to 9. The swamptown of Brelt is no stranger to death; most of its residents are wanted men and often arrive with problems in tow. Interred in an ancient cemetery that long predates the town, many of these brigands find peace for the first time&amp;mdash;until a mysterious necromancer arrived, that is. Now, the cemetery seems to have become insatiable, and there are rumors of dead bodies being seen walking the marshlands at night. With nowhere to run and death knocking at their doors, the hardened residents of Brelt have begun to panic&amp;mdash;because something tells them the end of their lives is only the beginning of their problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
