			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Man&amp;rsquo;s Hand is a tale of desperate gamblers and corrupt lawmen, of criminal subtlety and supernatural mystery. Characters begin at 1st level, and by the end of the campaign they should by 9th or 10th level. The ideal party size is four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, you can adjust the adventure&amp;rsquo;s difficulty by reducing or increasing the number of enemies present in a given encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Man&amp;rsquo;s Hand is set in the American Frontier circa 1872.

As such, there is no conflict with birthplace or recent places of living for the characters, Everyone arrives in Western Valley just the same, and are no culture is more foreign than any other. A combination of roads, railroads, and even a few rivers connect the various settlements of the valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Episode 2: Welcome to Snake's Bend. Whether in pursuit of Sloan Campbell, headed toward the poker tournament, or simply victim to wanderlust, the party of pioneers heads west. The next major city along the worn dirt road is Snake&amp;rsquo;s Bend, though there are a few small settlements along the way. The trek to Snake&amp;rsquo;s Bend alone is ripe with adventures with several events that can potentially make for an exciting adventure worthy of tall tales.

You can play this adventure with just the DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS basic rules and the Frontier campaign setting, which contains all the enemies and items not described in this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
