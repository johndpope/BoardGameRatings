			<description>Content:&lt;br/&gt;Board, 6 twarfs, 1 cipher die, 1 norrmal die, 15 pawns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The twarfs hear the word &amp;quot;treasure&amp;quot; and start running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a twarf and places it on a start field outside with a character. Let's take &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;. This is also his destination around the board.&lt;br/&gt;The active player throws the dice 13 times to get his characters together and marks them with pawns.All players try to put a word together out of the chosen characters.The twarf on the outside lane is set forward by the numbers of the characters. &lt;br/&gt;If two players do not find any new word the next player's turn starts and he throws the dice.&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the players whose twarf is back on his startinf point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
