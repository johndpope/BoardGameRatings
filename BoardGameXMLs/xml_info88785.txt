			<description>Delusions is a game about virtual reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reality is so...unreal. &lt;br/&gt; The tangle of observations woven about it, humankind's utter lack of consensus, phases it to fit individual desires. Becoming and unbecoming, back and forth eternally, as it paradoxically coexists with and within infinite versions of itself... &lt;br/&gt; At least, that's what always surfaces in your mind whenever your own perception of reality is altered. Which is to say, ten or fifteen times a day. But it's your job, working to someday entertain others with new observations, new experiences, new realities. And after all, you signed up for the Project (as you well remember, even though it was close to five years ago), so you suppose it's entirely your fault if you don't like it. Which, when you think about it, you realise you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by C. E. Forman.&lt;br/&gt;IF Comp 1996: 3rd place of 27 entries.&lt;br/&gt;XYZZY Awards 1996: Finalist for Best Story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
