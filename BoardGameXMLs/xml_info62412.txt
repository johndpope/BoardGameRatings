			<description>Each participate starts with 20 towers which are introduced by casting a die: the number cast will decide how many towers may be placed on the board.  Initial placing may follow any random pattern.  The objective is to encircle opposing towers and to avoid encirclement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all the towers are placed, they may be moved only vertically or horizontally by as many spaces as are indicated on the die, but the permissible move may be split among several towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is finished when one player is left with only three towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
