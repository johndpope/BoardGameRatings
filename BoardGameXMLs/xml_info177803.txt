							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wizard Survival</name>
									
			<description>A dark age approaches the Realm of Atheria &amp;ndash;- the vast ancestral lands of the Amurelden people are under siege by countless hordes of mana-infected beasts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While cold steel and piercing iron may help defend the Kingdoms and Empires that stretch across the sub-continent, their only real chance for surviving rests in the hands of wizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The passing of the Lorelias comet signalled the coming of a new era &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash; one marked by a relentless battle for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The sapphire colossus was last seen more than three centuries ago &amp;ndash; it torched the skies, spilling its mana-filled insides across the entire planet. Many believed that the mystical messenger of doom would never return -- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the more ancient wizards still remembered the chaos of its last passing -- they themselves witnessed the horrors and death that unfolded in its wake -- things they had hoped never to see again.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wizard Survival is a card game for 2-4 players. The games mechanics were specifically designed to assure that every game is a new and unique challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the games two modes is survival - a free-for-all match that is won by being the last surviving Wizard in the game. Players use magic spells to defend against marauding monsters, and are limited by the scarcity of resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other game mode is cooperative, in which players join forces in order to vanquish the 4 powerful bosses. This mode has four difficulty levels, especially designed to push players to their limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
