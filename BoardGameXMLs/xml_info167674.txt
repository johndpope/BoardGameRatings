							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pathogen: Z</name>
									
			<description>Pathogen: Z takes place in 2057 after GenTech, a genetic research company, released a pathogen onto a small town as leverage to use its new antigen on human test subjects. Things quickly turned bad as the virus mutated and became immune to the existing antigen. Rather then accept responsibility, GenTech sat back hoping the virus would stop spreading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five years later, and nearly 75% of the worlds population has been affected. Some have been reanimated from the dead, others gruesomely mutated into something that no longer resembles a human life form. Pick your side. GenTech? Rogue military? Civilian? Street Gang? Private security? Government? Scientist?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your deck and try to survive one more day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must construct decks from predefined Base Decks along with optional expander packs to customize their chosen deck. All packs contain no randomization or rarity. Similar CCG themes are present such as playing cards from your hand, drawing from a draw pile and having cards discarded from play through various mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various card mechanics allow players to draw additional cards, reduce an opponents hand, introduce survivors (your team), use zombies and mutants to harm your opponent and use defensive barriers and equipment to protect your survivors while trying to defeat your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each faction has team members which have skill levels in certain skills. These skill levels give them access to &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; things through playing cards which match their required skill levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, a Geneticist has a Skill Level of 3 and can create more powerful mutants then say a Lab Assistant with a Skill Level of only 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end game is to defeat the opposing faction by using your survivors and equipment along with their abilities to either control zombies, engineer mutants or simply use brute force in this post-apocalyptic card game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
