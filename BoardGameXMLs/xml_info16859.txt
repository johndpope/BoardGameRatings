			<description>From the box. &amp;quot;The object for the game is for players to move forward and towards the center of the board, to enter the Erogenous zone, and ultimately to enter the Hot zone. When two players are in the small confines of the Hot zone at the same time this is considered to be the end of the game, as the excitement and the stimulation gained and given, in order to achieve this position, will make further concentration difficult,- if not impossible for anything other than making love, which is the real object of the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Players movements throughout the game are determined by the way they respond to either of three types of instructions read from cards picked at random. They could be asked to answer a question, do a forfeit, or perform an action, all of which are designed to stimulate all the senses and to prepare and encourage the players to bring the game to a satisfactory conclusion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
