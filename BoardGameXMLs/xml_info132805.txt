			<description>A card game for children in which players try to find shared characteristics between items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 38 word cards are printed on both sides. One sides shows just a picture, the other shows a picture plus the corresponding word. The picture-only side is used when playing with younger players who can't read that well yet. With other players both sides can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are shuffled and divided into three stacks. Players turn over the top card from each of the stacks. Players then simultaneously search for a characteristic that two of the three items shown on the cards share. A player who thinks to have found such a characteristic slaps the stop card and tells the other players his/her idea. If they accept it as correct, he/she wins the pair of cards and two new cards are turned over. If his/her idea isn't accepted, the game continues with the same three cards as before.&lt;br/&gt;The shared characteristic has to be something both items have (not something they both don't have), and it has to something that hasn't been mentioned in a previous round, otherwise the first player to use that characteristic wins this pair too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all cards have been used. The player who has collected the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
