			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings from AHC.  Next we have the biggest - little hero, you may never see unless you were Sherlock Holmes with a magnifying glass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With his internship at Megatropolos University, and being lucky enough to work with the legendary Dr. Abel and Heinrich, they together created the (Regenerating Nanite Technology) suit and customized its look.  From learning some techniques from his mother, who is a professional seamstress; much to Michael's chagrin the suit didn't make him BIGGER, but made him smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
