			<description>New International Track &amp;amp; Field (New International ハイパースポーツDS New International Hyper Sports DS?, &amp;quot;), is a sports video game by Konami for the Nintendo DS. Developed by Sumo Digital, it is the latest game in Konami's Track and Field series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New International Track &amp;amp; Field features single-player career and training modes in addition to Wi-Fi multi-player between 2 to 4 players, a character-based minigame challenge mode and a worldwide player ranking system. The original Track and Field game will also be available to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of New International Track &amp;amp; Field differs from the traditional button mashing and joystick-wiggling gameplay of the original games in that players use the motion of the stylus to set a rhythm for their character. In addition, the game will also feature uses for the DS' dual screens and you can shout encouragement for your character via the microphone to give them an extra boost. The louder you shout, the bigger the boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New International Track &amp;amp; Field features an online community at their website. Players are able to link their games to their website accounts and participate in online global scoreboards, teams, and tournaments. The site also features forums for discussion about the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 events are featured in the game.&lt;br/&gt;100 Metre Sprint&lt;br/&gt;Long Jump&lt;br/&gt;110 Metre Hurdles&lt;br/&gt;Skeet Shooting&lt;br/&gt;Weightlifting&lt;br/&gt;400 Metre Distance&lt;br/&gt;Steeplechase&lt;br/&gt;Archery&lt;br/&gt;Javelin&lt;br/&gt;Cycling&lt;br/&gt;Triple Jump&lt;br/&gt;Hammer&lt;br/&gt;Discus&lt;br/&gt;Shot Put&lt;br/&gt;Breaststroke&lt;br/&gt;100 Metre Backstroke&lt;br/&gt;High Jump&lt;br/&gt;High dive&lt;br/&gt;Double trap&lt;br/&gt;Springboard&lt;br/&gt;Pole vault&lt;br/&gt;Rowing&lt;br/&gt;Horizontal bar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;New International Track &amp;amp; Field&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
