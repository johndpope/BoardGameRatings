			<description>From the game description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;THE BIG BOARD is a game of stock investments, combining chance and skill. Two to six players move colored tokens around the board, and play the market. The object of the game is to make money, as much money as possible, before the game ends. To do this, players SPECULATE, buying low priced stocks that may rise in value, PROFIT-TAKE, selling stocks for more than they cost, and EARN DIVIDENDS on the stock they own. [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Investors must watch the market's movement and make the right choice at the right time to get the most return on their investments. Test your skill against the ups and downs of the stock market on THE BIG BOARD.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
