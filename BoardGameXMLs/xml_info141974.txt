			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Party Tactical Archetypes: Does your party lack cohesion? Ever wanted mechanics to reflect a UNIT rather then a few guys you picked up at a pub who happened to be the next saviors of the planet? We've got it!&lt;br/&gt;    Heraldry &amp;amp; Battle Standards: Tired of having your wizard uselessly hold that dagger? Want your bard to have a support weapon? Well we invented a system for using the great flags of war to boost morale and increase damage! (Included: The Standard Bearer Base Class)&lt;br/&gt;    The Veteran Adventurer: A jack-of-all-trades, master of them all! This prestige class is intended for characters who have multi-classed into too many classes and want something to reflect their varied nature. Gain limited uses of other classes class features!&lt;br/&gt;    Mundane Crafting Rules: Why should the mages have all the fun?! Learn to craft unique custom weapon with this new sub-system! This allows a character to make an original weapon for their own personal use! Want to add parrying flukes to your great sword? Sounds good! How about an Italian grip on that rapier? We can do that! How about a thick tip-heavy retractable extra-long spear with a spiked butt cap? We got ya' covered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
