			<description>In order to play this European centred race game each player must have a marker, four counters and an eight-sided teetotum. There are 133 playing spaces covering the gameboard. The race begins in London and ends in Athens. A separate booklet sets out the rules. As well as providing information on the history and commerce of the places, the game also encouraged reading and conversational skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published May 1st, 1810.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
