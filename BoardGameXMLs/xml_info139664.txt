							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Europa Rundreise</name>
									
			<description>This 1930s German game is a spin-and-move tour around Europe. There is a spinner in each corner of the board, and the four cute cars provided are in nicely painted ceramic: a very unusual feature in an era of typically metal or wooden pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts and finishes in Berlin, and may travel either clockwise or counterclockwise. Players must follow directions in the rules if they land on one of Europe's 12 major cities, some good and some bad. In surely unintentional pre-WWII irony, the trip from Berlin goes no further east than Stalingrad, where the directions say the driver &amp;quot;decides to stay a few days in the city of Tractor Works&amp;quot;, and loses two turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
