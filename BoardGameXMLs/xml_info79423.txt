			<description>The world of Gaea is falling into darkness. Eve, a seamstress who loves leg-of-rat, really doesn't want to take on the daunting task of saving the world. No matter what she wants, she's going to have to do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her one worry about setting off on a quest? Her Aunt Mildred filling her cottage with junk furniture while she's away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important: This is a game I made several years ago. It only works on Windows 95 and 98.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
