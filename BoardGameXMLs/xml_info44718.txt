			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1739, Jonathan Hager, a German immigrant from Pennsylvania and a volunteer Captain of Scouts, purchases 200 acres of land in the Great Appalachian Valley between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains in Maryland and calls it Hager's Fancy. At this time, there are already about 100 settlers in the area. In 1762, Hager officially founded the town of Elizabethtown which he names after his wife, Elizabeth Kershner.
