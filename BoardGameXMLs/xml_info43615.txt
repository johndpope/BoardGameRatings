							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dramune Run</name>
									
			<description>This is an adventure that uses the Knight Hawk expasion as well as the Alpha Dawn ruleset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dramune! A system of conflict at the edge of the frontier. Its two life-bearing planets stand poised on opposite sides of an uneasy peace. Only the thin leash of one planet&amp;rsquo;s democratic idealism prevents interplanetary war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far across the galaxy, a dying captain carries an explosive secret. In his battered but swift freighter he hides a curious cargo. A cargo that will snap the leash preserving Dramune's peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The captain has one last wish: to find a new crew and take his secret home. And he has one great obstacle: a notorious crime czar with a troop of slimy thugs. The odds are against the captain and his new crew, but together they must make this last voyage&amp;mdash;the Dramune Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dramune Run is an adventure designed for the STAR FRONTIERS&amp;reg; game system, including the original role-playing game, Alpha Dawn, and its space-faring sequel, Knight Hawks. Both games are needed to play Dramune Run, which combines boardgame space combat with mystery, intrigue, and fantastic new characters for a thrilling science fiction role-playing adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
