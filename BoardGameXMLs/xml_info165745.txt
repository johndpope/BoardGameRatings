							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Analogies</name>
									
			<description>At the beginning of each round, any player may suggest an analogy. The analogy should be of the form &amp;ldquo;What is the ______ of ______?&amp;rdquo; For example, &amp;ldquo;What is the Texas of Europe?&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;What is the Model-T of the Animal Kingdom?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone secretly comes up with an answer to the analogy. When everyone&amp;rsquo;s ready, each player says his or her answer in turn. (You&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to change your answer after you hear someone else&amp;rsquo;s!) You get a point for each other player who came up with the same answer you did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play until someone reaches a predetermined score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
