			<description>Given a deck of cards with integer values from 1 to 100, with each number displayed on three cards as numbers written as numerals, numbers spelled-out, and groups of base-ten blocks, the players will be able to point out the greater of the numbers shown upon any two of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules of this game are similar to the card game &amp;quot;War&amp;quot;. &lt;br/&gt;Players turn their cards and compare the values shown on the cards. Whichever participant turned the card showing the greatest integer representation, then takes both of the cards and places them faced-up in a &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; pile next to his/her stack of faced-down cars. If the cards placed in the center of the playing surface are the same value, a showdown occurs.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until a specified time period has elapsed, or until one player has run out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;300 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
