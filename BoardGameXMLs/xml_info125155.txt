			<description>From the rules: This is a most interesting and instructive game. As many children can play as there are individual playing cards. Give each player a card and place all the filler pieces in the center of the table face down. The object of the game is to complete cards correctly. Players draw from the face down fillers and try to complete a figure. If he/she does so the player draws another filler card and tries to add it properly. He continues to pick fillers until he draws a filler card that does not belong on his card. When that happens he/she returns the filler card face down into the center. After having mixed it with the rest of the remaining filler cards play continues   in turn until someone completes their card and wins the game,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
