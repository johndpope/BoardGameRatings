			<description>From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sharks are Circling&lt;br/&gt; When the great dragon Hestaby leveled Saeder-Krupp&amp;rsquo;s arcology in Dubai, a lot of people wondered if the success of her act meant that Lofwyr &amp;amp; co. were off their game. And of course, the corps of the Sixth World aren&amp;rsquo;t ones to just sit around and speculate&amp;mdash;instead, they act. All of the sudden, corporations of all sizes are on the move, snatching up any Saeder-Krupp clients they can pry away, telling them that S-K can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted in the current turmoil.&lt;br/&gt; Saeder-Krupp, though, is not about to let anyone believe they are weak. They're going to show that they should never be trifled with, and that clients would be well served to stay with them&amp;mdash;or risk the wrath of Lofwyr. They&amp;rsquo;re bringing runners to Dubai to demonstrate that the largest megacorporation in the world still has strength to spare.&lt;br/&gt; Damage Control is the first in the new Boardroom Backstabs series of adventures for Shadowrun. The series explores one of the classic Shadowrunthemes&amp;mdash;corporate machinations where every handshake is made with crossed fingers, and the hand you can&amp;rsquo;t see is always holding a knife. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of money to be made on this job, but runners better keep their wits about them if they want to keep all those corporate sharks from feeding on them.&lt;br/&gt; Damage Control is for use with Shadowrun, Twentieth Anniversary Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
