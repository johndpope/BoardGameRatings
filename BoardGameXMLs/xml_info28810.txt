			<description>Game comes with 32 cards. Each featuring information and a picture of a different bug, spider, or insect. This information has nothing to do with gameplay, but each card has a number 1 - 8 and a letter A - D in the upper left corner. Players are trying to collect sets of four cards with the same number. Each turn, the current player asks opponents for a card of a given number and letter. Players are required to hand over the requested card if they have it, but as soon as a request cannot be fulfilled, a new player's turn begins. When all cards have been played in quartets, the player with the most completed sets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
