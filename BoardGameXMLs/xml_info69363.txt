			<description>&amp;quot;An environmental sculpture in chrome steel and crystal clear polished playing boards which moves chess into an intriguing new dimension.&amp;quot; (side of box Description)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a relatively straightforward 3-Dimensional extrapolation of the standard chess concept, and as such the goal and theme are much the same, with one player each starting one the top and bottom boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the moves for various pieces have been changed, with all pieces moving as per usual on one plane, but the movements from plane to plane of the Queen, Bishop, and Pawn are not as one would initially expect. Most other 3D moves are restricted to moving one square only directly above or below the initial position of the piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Board and set could also be used for several other Three Dimensional Chess Variants, as there are no original pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
