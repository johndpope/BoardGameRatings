			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaxy Command was heavily influenced by the classic sci-fi comic, Legion of Superheroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook allows you to custom build a similar galaxy: an incredibly bio-diverse universe filled with super-powered humanoid and near human aliens, each with a memorable planetary monoculture.  Each new race in this book has taken a Powered Hero class talent and modified it into a racial trait all the members of that species are known for a single racial super-ability, and this power has formed the cornerstone of their planet&amp;rsquo;s society, defining the races&amp;rsquo; place in the galaxy. Heroes hailing from a super-powered planet are distinguished from their fellow citizens not genetically, but by their courage, fighting spirit and the precision or raw power they display when activating their alien abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
