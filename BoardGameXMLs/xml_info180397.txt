			<description>Abriss is a fast and tactical game that deals not once again with the construction of buildings but with the consequences &amp;ndash; DEMOLISH buildings. Therefore, at the beginning of the game all 25 buildings are laid out on the table, ready to be torn down and blown up. Of course, this work is not done by itself but you need trustworthy workers like Slobodan, Leonid or Hao Wech. During each game round each player buys one of these at an auction, and thus equipped with the required devices they can demolish a building, provided the following conditions are met: the player is able to get rid of the construction waste (legally or illegally &amp;ndash; the main point is: away with it!) and there are sufficient vacant spaces next to the building. Of course the nuclear power plant in the heart of the city is harder to break into pieces than the hot-dog stand just next to the city limits sign. This edition introduces the bureaucrats. They can be useful with their special permits if once and again there is not enough space to demolish a building. A successful demolition results in a demolition award for the player and they keep the tile for scoring at the end of the game. Who would not like to blow the revenue office to pieces and thus earn a little tax refund? That way the buildings vanish one after the other until there are only 2 or less left standing. The player who has demolished the most valuable buildings is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abriss takes about 45 minutes to play, the game mechanism is easy to understand and there is little downtime. The auction of subcontractors and bureaucrats provides interaction and is kept simple - there are only 3 possible bids. With the random set-up, each game offers a new challenge for the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new edition includes bureaucrats and the expansion ABRISS-AUFTR&amp;Auml;GE/DEMOLITION-CONTRACTS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
