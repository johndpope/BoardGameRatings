			<description>HuniePop is a 2015 adult hybrid tile matching puzzle game and dating sim that was developed and published by HuniePot. Funding for the game was raised via a successful Kickstarter campaign and the game was released on January 19, 2015. HuniePop is available in two different versions, an uncensored version available via Humble Bundle and MangaGamer, and a censored version via Steam. The game follows the dating adventures of the main character as they try to woo several different women in their home town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay focuses on the player (who can be male or female) interacting with several different women, each of whom has her own distinct personalities and preferences. The player can interact with women by talking to them and giving them gifts. Doing this rewards the player with &amp;quot;Hunie&amp;quot; an in-game currency that can be used to upgrade the player's stats. These stats allow the player to earn more points during dates, increasing their chance of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to progress through the game, players must take the women on dates, where they will play a tile matching game where they must make matches of 3 or more of the same tokens. The player must earn enough points to complete the date before they run out of moves. Each woman has specific type of token that they like and dislike, and players will gain more points if they match the type of token that woman prefers. The player can also use special items called &amp;quot;date gifts&amp;quot; during their dates which grant positive effects to help the player earn more points. After a successful date, the player is rewarded with a picture of the woman the date was with. Each successful date will also raise the game's difficulty, making subsequent dates require more points to complete. After 3 successful dates with a woman, the play will be able to take them on a date at night, and if that date is successful, the player can bring the woman to their bedroom for one final round of tile matching. Unlike regular dates, the player will have unlimited moves to complete the bedroom game, but the score meter constantly drains over time, so to win, the player must make matches quickly until the meter is full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game the player is guided by Kyu, a love fairy set on turning the player into a successful Lothario. She gives the player tips on how to interact with each woman, and explains how the game's various mechanics work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;HuniePop&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
