							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All Bunnies Eat Carrots</name>
									
			<description>A sarcastic and cheeky game for all ages. Earn the heart of these fuzzy critters to win and maybe snatch your friends' along the way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Bunnies Eat Carrots, nicknamed ABEC, is quick to learn and easy to play. Players gather items, find bunnies, and initiate actions using the cards they&amp;rsquo;ve been dealt. There are 11 bunnies to find and collect and each has its own needs and difficulty level. The higher the point value of the bunny the more difficult it is to collect it! Players only need to collect three bunnies to finish the game and the player with the highest combined value of bunnies wins! Simply put, collect the bunnies&amp;rsquo; needs, the first player to collect three bunnies ends the game, and the player with the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 5 cards. On their turn they may either draw three cards from the deck or look at the top three cards of the discard pile and pick one card. They may play as many cards as the wish during their turn. This includes playing bunnies in front of them to begin collecting. Every bunny has four unique needs that a player must obtain to collect the bunny. Once all the items have been gathered the bunny is finished collecting and is the player&amp;rsquo;s for the rest of the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also has action cards to help players develop strategies to give them the upper hand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
