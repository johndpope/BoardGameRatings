			<description>Back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Apprentice sorceress at Susthania's School of Magic, you know you're in trouble when your unlocking spell opens everything in the school. But instead of sending you home, Suthania gives you a quest and a special ring - and suddenly you find yourself spell-sent to the Valley of Tears, stronghold of the wizard Thoren, your mission to get Susthania's spellbook back from him.&lt;br/&gt;Around you, you can feel magic working, and you sense a hidden menace. Is it too late to turn back? Will you use your ring to summon aid and give up this dangerous quest? Or will you go to the cabin you just spotted and search for the missing spellbook? Danger, riches, and romance await you at every turn. Will you fall victim to the spell of evil, or choose wisely for both your heart and your wand?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
