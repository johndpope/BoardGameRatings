The goal is to capture as much works of art of great value, avoiding works in poor condition or even fake art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, the first player turns over a action card. If it shows an auction, the player takes the hammer of auctioneer and take the object card with the starting price 2000 francs.  The best bid wins the card, then the purchaser discovers the condition of the object he just acquired!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some action cards allows player to look at the condition of the object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to acquire objects forming series - a series of three objects is double the amount of objects that compose it. &lt;br/&gt;When all the object cards are sold, the player with the most valuable collection is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
