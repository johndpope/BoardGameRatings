			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mission introduces the Phoenix Society, a covert criminal organization that accepts contracts to overthrow nations on behalf of either other countries or internal factions. The Phoenix Society started in the 1970s when Elvera Karel , a political professor with few scruples, devoted her skills toward personal profit. Under the codename of &amp;ldquo;Phoenix,&amp;rdquo; she helped destabilize several African governments, including Namibia, but&lt;br/&gt;she was eventually captured and exiled in 1979. Phoenix maintained a few loyal followers after her forced retirement to France and two years ago attempted the overthrow of the government with a mind-control drug. The Agency thwarted her and she died in prison while awaiting trial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
