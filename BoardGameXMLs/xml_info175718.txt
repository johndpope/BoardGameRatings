			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghastly Affair is a Role Playing Game where players assume the roles of characters in a Gothic story, in the style of classic works such as Mary Shelly&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Frankenstein&amp;rdquo; or John Polidori&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Vampyre&amp;rdquo;. Together the players create a plot involving their characters, much like an ongoing television series or soap opera. Unlike reading a novel or watching a show, however, the players can actually change the course of the story. They are not spectators to the action; rather, the plot revolves around the characters they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Ghastly Affair is characterized by monsters and madness, desperate love and implacable hate. Innocent damsels are imperiled by the desires of wicked men, while creatures of nightmare lurk in the dark corners of the world. Lovers are torn apart by twisted customs and pitiless laws. Dark castles hide the horrible secrets of ancient noble families. Obsessed men of science create abominable new forms of life. Brutal brigands lurk in dark forests. Grave robbers despoil churchyards for profit. Worst of all, the dead are said to walk by night, and certain men are cursed to wander the moors as wolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A character might engage in a forbidden romance with a brooding poet, battle an infestation of Vampyres in a lonely graveyard, or play cards with Death in a secluded coffeehouse. Characters could wield dark sorcery atop a bare mountain, sell their soul for wealth, or run from a forced marriage to the freedom of banditry. The game can feature as much thrilling action and dramatic role-playing as the players want. Dark dreams impossible in the real world can be lived in Ghastly Affair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
