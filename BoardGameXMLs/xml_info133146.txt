							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Angels: the Game of Divine Stories</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a God. There are Angels. There is a Devil. There are Demons. There is a war over the souls of humanity. This is our world. The world that most people do not see until they pass on and find out where their souls spend eternity. It is a world of unseen forces, miraculous feats, and the touch of the divine and the infernal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most people are blind to this world, you see it in terribly sharp focus. It is your world, you see. You are an Angel. You are a divine spirit serving God. Your mission is simple, really. Stop the Fallen Angels from harming humanity and help the humans reach Heaven. You are immortal. You have gifts from God that can help you. You can go between Heaven and Earth with a little concentration. These things help you in your mission, but by no means is it easy. In fact, the more time you spend with the humans the more you understand their problems with things like faith, hope, and love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are an Angel. These are your stories. Welcome to Angels - the Game of Divine Stories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
