							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Teletubbies Match &amp; Stamp</name>
									
			<description>With three different ways to play, the Teletubbies Match &amp;amp; Stamp game is both an activity kit and a game. It comes with 4 cans of different-colored Play-Doh; 12 Teletubbies stampers that fit nicely into their own sturdy holder; 6 Teletubbies cards, each with 4 different images; and 4 plastic trays, plus a wooden roller for rolling out the Play-Doh. Players match the pictures on the stampers to the pictures on their Teletubbies card. The corresponding Teletubbies images are then pressed into the Play-Doh with the stampers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just roll the dough, pick a stamper and make a picture.&lt;br/&gt;In the beginners' game, the youngest fans will search for &amp;quot;lookalikes,&amp;quot; matching stamper pictures with pictures on their cards.  In the next two games, the stamper pictures are hidden:  Pick a stamper - who's got matching picture?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     12 Teletubbies Stampers&lt;br/&gt;     4 Cans of Playdoh&lt;br/&gt;     6 Teletubbies Cards&lt;br/&gt;     4 Plastic Trays&lt;br/&gt;     Stamper Holder&lt;br/&gt;     Wooden Roller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
