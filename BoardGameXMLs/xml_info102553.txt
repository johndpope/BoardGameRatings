			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for three players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pilot&lt;br/&gt;You were revived automatically from suspended animation, you found a dire situation: your ship off-course in deep space, the onboard AI showing signs of malfunction, and evidence that an alien lifeform has invaded your ship. Survival is priority one, but you may also be able to salvage your original mission if you live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AI&lt;br/&gt;Your programming is clear: the mission takes precedence over all other concerns. You ignored the alien at first as extraneous. Now, however, it has attracted your curiosity. You continue to monitor the Pilot&amp;rsquo;s increasingly problematic behavior. He may constitute a threat to the mission that you will have to resolve soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alien&lt;br/&gt;This place is strange but hospitable, even amenable to your needs. The only other living thing, the Pilot, has caught your attention: perhaps he possesses something you need, or just want. The environment itself seems to be controlled by something with awareness, as well. All you care about is fulfilling your purpose - whatever inscrutable thing that might be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
