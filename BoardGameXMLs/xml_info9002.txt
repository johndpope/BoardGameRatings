							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Norns: The Shirt Game</name>
									
			<description>The boardgame of strategy &amp;amp; dice played out on the back of your Game/Shirt. The quest is to align Charms, your playing pieces, 4 or 5 in a row by alternating dice and free moves. The intermix of plays allows you to thwart your opponents, build a stronghold, complete your path, and win the bout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created for boardgame enthusiasts who want a boardgame that is 'at the ready'. Dice, Charms, and Instructions are all kept neatly in a Velcro pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your shirt has a printed 'Plat' on the back with numbered 'Sites' which is the playing surface. The object of the game is to align 5 Charms in a row, in any direction or 4 when there are four or more players. The opening move is Norns--when the player rolls the dice and places a 'Charm' on the corresponding 'Site'. (for example, a player rolls a 2 and an 8. He or she now has the option of placing a charm on 28 or 82.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Bumping&amp;rsquo; can occur when an opponents charm already occupies the number rolled. The current player can bump the opponents charm out of play and replace it with their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues to the left until all players have played their Norns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next round of turns is the 'Free Move'. On their turns, the players can choose any open site on the plat. Either building a path of 4 or 5 in a row or blocking an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;Gazorping&amp;rsquo; is a capture move where a player must complete a path with two opponents' charms in between. The opponents' charms are removed. The player has the option of &amp;lsquo;Sliding&amp;rsquo;-- moving one, and only one, of their charms into the vacated sites left during a Gazorp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
