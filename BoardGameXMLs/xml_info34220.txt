							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nosies im Kinoland</name>
									
			<description>The little &amp;quot;nosies&amp;quot; are all over movieland - seemingly hundreds of them in various movie costumes all over various movie sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kids take turns drawing image disks out of a bag and try to locate the image on 3 large &amp;quot;Where-is-Waldo?&amp;quot;-like boards. Once a player finds the image he/she will slam their magnifying glass onto it. If it's correct, the player gets to keep the image disk as a token. Many images are tricky to find because all the little &amp;quot;nosies&amp;quot; slightly differ in body position, nose color, costume color, etc. If the player pointed out the wrong image, he/she will have to pay one of their tokens. At the end of the game, the player with the most tokens wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 4 games boards, 7 plastic magnifying glasses, 1 bag, 138 image disks, 1 rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
