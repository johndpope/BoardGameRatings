							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American XMAS Dinner</name>
									
			<description>A murder mystery dinner-style party game in which each player is assigned a role and players try to find out who the murderer is. Each player has his/her own information booklet, and five game rounds are spent discussing clues and inconsistencies until players vote on who to accuse of the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This case takes place at an almost deserted college campus during the Christmas holidays. All remaining inhabitants of the campus have been invited to a Christmas dinner, but the last guest arrives with horrible news: Stewart White, janitor, has been found murdered in his room, and the killer is among the guests.&lt;br/&gt;Roles include the campus cop, a football player, a cheerleader and an exchange student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
