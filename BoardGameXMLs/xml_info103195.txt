							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Charioteer: Racing at the Famous Circus Maximus</name>
									
			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trumpets blare and your horses are ready. The moment of truth is at hand as the Emperor himself signals the start of the race. You guide your chariot around the racing oval using all the skill, savvy, and if need be, savagery, in the quest to finish first. The quest for fame and fortune is on and none shall stand in your way. Welcome to the world of Charioteer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relive the glory that was Rome with this fast-paced chariot racing game. Charioteer includes two levels of play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Charioteer - As a Charioteer, you spend your entire time chariot racing, trying to gain experience and find work in the best of places, Rome herself.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Patron - As a Patron, the head of a chariot Racing Faction, you buy and sell both horses and charioteers alike, then put up the money to enter the races, all with the hope of winning more fame and a chance to race in Rome herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In either case, you must learn your trade on the fringe of the Empire and work your way to your ultimate goal, racing at the famous Circus Maximus in Rome herself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
