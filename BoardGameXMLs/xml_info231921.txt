							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battletech Technical Readout: Succession Wars</name>
									
			<description>KING OF THE BATTLEFIELD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On February 5, 2439, the Mackie obliterated all opposition during its first combat trial, ushering in a new era of warfare. The BattleMech&amp;mdash;King of the Battlefield&amp;mdash;was born. BattleMechs reached their pinnacle during the golden age of the Star League. The fall of the Star League and the Succession Wars that raged for centuries afterward took their toll and by the Fourth Succession War, the technology employed on the battlefields was a mere shadow of what it once was. However, the discovery of the Helm Memory Core unlocked the technological potential to develop new BattleMechs and experimental technologies for the first time in centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Readout: Succession Wars is the perfect &amp;quot;first Technical Readout&amp;quot; companion to the BattleMech Manual. Combining the &amp;rsquo;Mechs previously found in Technical Readout: 3039, Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade, Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, and Technical Readout: 3075, this volume features some of the most common &amp;rsquo;Mechs from the Age of War to the Succession Wars. Each machine is illustrated in detail, and accompanied by a description of its history, capabilities, game stats, along with their most famous pilots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This is a compilation volume. The entries in this book are reprinted from Technical Readout: 3039, Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade, Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, and Technical Readout: 3075. Players who own those Technical Readouts will find the same units presented in Technical Readout: Succession Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
