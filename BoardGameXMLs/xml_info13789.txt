							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gladiolus: the Game of Gladiatorial Combat in the Roman Arena</name>
									
			<description>A simulation of single combat between gladiators in ancient Rome, based on a system of drawing and playing from a pack of combat cards. Each gladiator (represented by miniatures or counters on a combat map) has a set of cards giving options suitable to his style of fighting. The players maintain a hand of combat cards from which to choose their actions. The game is played in alternate moves, and features a hidden &amp;quot;hole&amp;quot; card, chosen by each player at the end of each turn, and revealed at the start of the next turn. Six types of gladiators are represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
