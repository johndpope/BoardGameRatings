			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War Within&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all has been right in our shadows of late. Especially in the dark of my mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those were among FastJack's parting words to JackPoint when he left, the victim of a condition that divided his mind against itself. And the condition is spreading. Across teh Sixth World, people's minds are in schism, as new personalities emerge and battle the old. The world is in chaos, and there is dramatically increased demand for extractions, to get people out of sensitive positions and to steal the insights of people who might know what's gone wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stolen Souls is a Deep Shadows sourcebook for Shadowrun with plot updates and adventure hooks, as well as information, techniques, and gear to help make runners extraction aces. It also contains setting information about Manhattan, where key extractions are taking place. Players will get the chance to dig deeper into a new mystery that has torn through the Sixth World - and discover just how deep the conspiracies and cover-ups go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stolen Souls is for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From retailers preview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shedding further light on the Sybil virus plotline, this Shadowrun, Fifth Edition sourcebook provides extensive information on New York City in the Sixth World, as well as details on extraction runs, giving shadowrunners tools, gear, and technique that can help get people out of tightly guarded spots.

PSI CAT27200............................$44.99&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publishers homepage:&lt;br/&gt;Stolen Souls (Deep Shadows)&lt;br/&gt;Those were among FastJack&amp;rsquo;s parting words to JackPoint when he left, the victim of a condition that divided his mind against itself. He&amp;rsquo;s not the only one that has been so afflicted. Miles Lanier, formerly of NeoNET, has the same condition. And across the Sixth World, people&amp;rsquo;s minds are in schism, as new personalities emerge at unpredictable times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has thrown the world into chaos, and there is a sudden demand for new extractions. Infected people need to be forcibly removed from their positions. People who might understand something about what&amp;rsquo;s happening need to be removed so they can tell what they know. And people covering secrets need to be removed so that they, and their secrets, can be buried somewhere out of reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stolen Souls is a Deep Shadows sourcebook for Shadowrun that contains plot updates and adventure hooks, as well as information, techniques, and gear to help runners up their game when it comes to extraction jobs. They&amp;rsquo;ll also get the chance to dig deeper into a new mystery that has torn through the Sixth World&amp;mdash;and discover just how deep the conspiracies and cover-ups go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
