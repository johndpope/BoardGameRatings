			<description>&amp;quot;Deep in the Jungle the Ekebet, Mayan star messangers compete in the dangerous ritual race to bring glory to their city state. They must run day and night to reach the oposite city state before anyone else. With Kukulkan&amp;acute;s help, the great serpent god, they call for ancient power to reach victory&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An abstract game set in the Mayan culture for 2 to 4 players. Each player has a set of four runners that starts in their home city state and must run across to board, a jungle, to reach the oposite side, another city state. The player who reaches the oposite city state first with all his runners win the game. The pices movements are managed by a set of movement pieces. Each runner and each movement piece has two sides: day and night. When a runner moves, his piece change it&amp;acute;s side to a new status (day to night or night to day). Players need to manage their movement pieces in order to move their runners in the board according to their status each round. Some animals in the jungle block the runners path and each player can call for Kukulkan aid, special poker tokens that bend the general game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
