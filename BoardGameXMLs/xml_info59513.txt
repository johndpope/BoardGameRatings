			<description>Puladnas is a trick-taking game unlike any other trick-taking game. For one thing, it isn't the highest-valued card that takes the trick. It's the card closest to 7 that takes the trick. Secondly, players may beg to change the trump suit, but there are pros and cons to both begging and granting or denying a beg. After a few plays, you start to learn some good strategies and may even learn to be rather ruthless in your quest to gather cards that score well together. So, try a change from the old with Puladnas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
