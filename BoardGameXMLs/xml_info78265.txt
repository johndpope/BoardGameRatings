			<description>WWF Super WrestleMania is a multiplatform wrestling game based on the World Wrestling Federation, released in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is considered by many to be the first part of a trilogy, followed by other 16-bit LJN WWF games WWF Royal Rumble and WWF Raw, as it introduces the &amp;quot;tug-of-war&amp;quot; style grappling system, where moves are performed by locking up and out-tapping the other player or the computer to execute a move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All wrestlers share the same set of standard wrestling moves like scoop slams, suplexes, dropkicks, clotheslines, hip tosses, and elbow drops. The Genesis version also has signature moves for each wrestler which can be performed at any time in the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the SNES version does not contain signature moves, its roster is a bit larger, with ten wrestlers compared to eight for the Genesis version's. It also features superior graphics and sound. Gameplay modes consist of one-on-one, tag team, and four-on-four Survivor Series elimination matches. The Genesis version also contains a WWF Championship mode where the player selects one wrestler and must defeat the rest in a series of one-on-one matches to be crowned WWF Champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWF Super WrestleMania&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
