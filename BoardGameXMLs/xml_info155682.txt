			<description>Patent-Mine is a roll and move educational trivia board game for kids/adults that teaches the patent process and little known facts about African American inventors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their pawns around the board, answering trivia questions about African-American inventors. When someone has a right answer, he may continue to advance on the board. The game continues until one reaches the end line (making a full turn of the board), winning at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
