							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Berenstain Bears: Join the Team</name>
									
			<description>This game contains 48 cards (12 4-card sets) with pictures of the Berenstain Bears playing various sports like baseball, ice skating and golf. Three games may be played...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Winning Team: Four cards are dealt to each player and face-up on the table. On your turn, if you can match a card from your hand to a card on the table, you take both cards and place them face-up in a pile in front of you. If you can match a card to the top card on an opponent's pile, you may take the player's entire pile of cards. When no more plays can be made, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sport Snap: The deck is dealt out evenly among the players. All players simultaneously turn over their top card. If no cards match, turn over another card. If two or more cards match, the first player to call out a correct matching sport wins all stacks with that card on top. If you make a wrong call, you must give 1 card to each opponent. The player that wins all the cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spoons: Spoons are placed in the center of the table (one less than the number of players). Each player gets 4 cards. The dealer draws a card and either keeps it or passes it to the next player who also can either keep it or pass it etc. As soon as you have a complete set of 4 cards, take a spoon. All players then grab for the remaining spoons. The player who doesn't get one receives a letter - first an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, followed by a &amp;quot;P&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;O&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;O&amp;quot;, and finally an &amp;quot;N&amp;quot;. When one player has spelled out SPOON the game ends and the player with the least number of letters wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
