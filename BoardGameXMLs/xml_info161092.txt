							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Dog: Superior Firepower</name>
									
			<description>Destruction and fun go hand in hand in RED DOG: Superior Firepower, as it's up to you to save the Earth from the destructive Haak invaders. You'll have to climb into your dune-buggy-like Red Dog tank and blast the pesky aliens into oblivion, all the while avoiding incoming fire, lava flows, icy rivers, and more. You control your armored vehicle by steering and aiming with the analog stick, while braking and accelerating with the left and right triggers. A quick tap of the A button fires your main cannon and repeated taps send forth a flurry of missiles. Make sure and seek out helpful drones as you battle and add their guns, rockets, and electrical attacks to your arsenal. You can compete in challenging single-player contests and unlock armor, weapons, and maps that can be used in your two- to four-person Multiplayer competitions. Go head-to-head in fast action modes like Knockout, Suicide Bomb Tag, Stealth Assassin, and everyone's favorite King of the Hill. If you're looking for a simple evening of explosive, glide-and-gun mayhem against evil aliens or a few of your friends, then RED DOG: Superior Firepower is made just for you. -Back of the case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
