			<description>Build your own stairway to heaven with Insurgo, a FREE game involving strategy and real-time physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you say you want to build skyscrapers; Stack them so high that you could touch the clouds&amp;hellip; well, here's your chance. Let's see how well you do because when you go so high, many things can happen that can turn your beautiful construction into a mess of rubble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construct triangles one by one and stack them to build your skyscraper. Be careful how you attach them however, because they can easily be put off balance. Enjoy infinite possibilities and watch the real-time ragdoll physics as your tower reaches new heights and sways back and forth, to ultimately come crashing down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
