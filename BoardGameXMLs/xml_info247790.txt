			<description>Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to this wonderful description page! We plan to put on a really exciting show for you today! Are you ready for these girls to show you what they've got?! Here it is, the moment you've all been waiting for... its STARLIGHT STAGE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starlight Stage is a fast-paced set-collecting card game in which you are playing a talent manager whos aim is to get the best talent of all your rival agencies. You will start with the fresh talent of a model, an actress, and a singer. You help to build their careers by collecting lessons, events, and upgrades for them which earns them more fame. The manager with the most famous talent at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start the game with three separate decks in a vertical row. The Idol deck, Fame deck, and Event deck. From the top of each deck you draw a card for each player and lay them in a row next to the deck they were drawn from. Each player starts with the beginning hand of new talent. The actress, model, and singer. To start the game the first player has the option of drawing a card from one of the three stacks and adding it to the end of the row, increasing their options of what to purchase. They will then use their accumulated talent points to either purchase an assignment card, a fame card, or take a lesson. Play continues until the fame deck is empty. Then all players tally up their fame points and whoever has the most is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
