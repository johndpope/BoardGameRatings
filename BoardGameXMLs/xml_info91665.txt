			<description>Metropolismania is a PlayStation 2-only city-building game released on October 3, 2002 published by Natsume. The object of the game is to interact with NPCs in order to populate various towns. The game was released under a traditional CD-ROM format, uncommon to the PS2. A sequel was announced by Natsume, titled Metropolismania 2. The title was released on August 21, 2007 in North America and in Japan on July 13, 2006 by D3 Publisher. Another sequel, Metropolismania 3, was released for the PlayStation Portable by D3 publishing but in Japan only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various goals to complete in each of the five main scenarios. Goals always involve growing the town to a given population, and often ensuring that a percentage of the buildings are of a certain type, i.e. businesses, farms, or amusement facilities. There are also side stories that occur within each scenario, sometimes including bizarre instances involving smuggling rings, a cult, and even aliens. When all requirements for the scenario have been met, the player's boss will call to congratulate them and send a letter of resignation, allowing the player to move on to the next scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay also centers heavily on interaction with the in-game characters. Each character has a friendship meter that increases or decreases based on interactions such as &amp;quot;gossip&amp;quot; and giving gifts. Relationship statuses are: &amp;quot;stranger,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;know the face,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;acquaintance,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;friend,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;best friend.&amp;quot; Introducing new citizens or solving complaints is often based on good friendship status with these characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is notable for its rather poor English translation, one example includes &amp;quot;Hello, this is [name] from the Senior Citizen,&amp;quot; if a Senior Citizen were to contact the player and introduce themselves. Also, one might greet the player with phrases uncommon in English-speaking countries such as the Japanese &amp;quot;Have you eaten?&amp;quot; which is a greeting question not meant to be answered, much like the American &amp;quot;How's it going?&amp;quot; Another one is that a character saying that they enjoy watching animations. Anime is Japanese for cartoon, so the character should have said they enjoy watching cartoons. These errors also include misuse of other languages such as an Italian Pasta restaurant owner who greets the player with the French greeting &amp;quot;Bonjour&amp;quot; rather than the Italian equivalent &amp;quot;Buongiorno&amp;quot;. Translation errors like this tend to annoy some fans, while others would argue that it gives the game a unique, perhaps quirky charm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Metropolismania&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
