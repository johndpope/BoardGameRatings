			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Far, far in the future humans have found only one other Earth like world in our galaxy &amp;ndash; Majellan. Starting at the domed city of New London players begin their journey into the newly terraformed world. The world appears as an inviting paradise, filled with Earth-life. But not all is as it seems. Something has gone horribly wrong. Trapped in the domed city for hundreds of year humans tear themselves apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is where you come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a war torn city waiting for the gates to the Outside world to be opened once more. Players begin their training as a Citizen or frenzied Sergie warrior, all readying themselves for the Outside. Out there, into an untamed planet filled with alien corrupted creatures and humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is all you need to run your first games of Majellan.
