			<description>This is an expansion for &amp;quot;Don't Fall in the Mead Hall&amp;quot; and requires that game to play. The &amp;quot;Allies and Drunk Guys&amp;quot; expansion is not needed but strongly recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many stories in the Icelandic sagas about an undead creature called the draugr, or aptrgangr (lit. &amp;quot;after-goer,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;again-walker,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;one who walks after death&amp;quot;). Most would call them zombies in this day and age and they have found the Mead Hall! Think you have what it takes to keep playing? Well go and prove your mettle once again. But this time you must fend off zombies as you out drink your Viking opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will send zombies to other tables, fight zombies, and summon zombies. Just don't fall OR get bit in the Mead Hall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time you get bit the sickness at your table gets worse and you lose a heart. If you get bit when you have no hearts one of your Vikings will turn into a Zombie and stay at your table as a threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are two zombie themed Tipsy cards that you can add to your Tipsy deck if you have the Allies expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last table with at least one Viking standing is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
