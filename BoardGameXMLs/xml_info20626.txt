			<description>Musashi is the Japanese take on the tower building dexterity game genre. Unlike Jenga, you don't start out with a tower, but build it yourself, and also unlike Jenga, you don't use your fingers but chopsticks to place the tiles. On each turn, players roll a dice to decide if and how many tiles they have to place on top of the existing stack. To make things a bit more challenging, there are two types of tiles - while they are both round, the standard ones have grooves carved into them that give them some stability. However, there is also a batch of slick tiles which are much harder to put into place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
