			<description>A One-Round Tournament using Powers &amp; Pantheons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ancient kingdom of Mulhorand is one of the last remaining lands in Faerun whose inhabitants do not venerate the dominant Faerunian pantheon. A family of deities, known as the Mulhorandi pantheon, rules Mulhorand as an absolute theocracy. At one point their sphere of influence incorporated the present-day lands of Semphar, Murghom, Thay and the Raurin desert, corresponding to the height of the Mulhorandi empire, but their fortunes have since fallen considerably. Today the pantheon receives only token worship in Thay and Semphar, and their flock of worshipers in Murghom is rapidly dwindling. In addition to marginal influence in Chessenta, the pantheon has begun to extend its influence into the land of Unther, its ancient ally and enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
