			<description>Garfield's Nightmare - a rock solid platform game with gorgeous graphics - sees everyone's favourite fat feline, Garfield, trapped in a lasagne, pizza and donut induced nightmare! A severe case of over-indulgence before bed leads to a dream so bad he can't wake up &amp;ndash; without piecing together his smashed alarm clock to free him from his fretful slumber. Enemies and crazy challenges litter his path so think fast and play smart to save the day &amp;ndash; and night - for Garfield!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key Features:&lt;br/&gt; - Play through 16 challenging levels to find each of the four alarm clock pieces!&lt;br/&gt; - Tackle four different 3D, thematic worlds: Haunted Castle, Cloudy Realm, Lava World and Winter Wonderland.&lt;br/&gt; - Take on tough bosses of the dream world who must be conquered in order to progress.&lt;br/&gt; - Unlock hidden minigames to win the keys to a mysterious chest at the end of each level. Each mini game uses the Nintendo DS touch screen.&lt;br/&gt; - Help Garfield maintain his energy level by collecting lots of tasty food throughout the game including donuts and, of course, lasagne!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
