			<description>From the adventure introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of runners are hired by Mr Johnson to investigate a relatively new band that has been doing very well. He wants to take over the band, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to know he has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not much is known but this certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t just another up and coming starlet, someone has money and contacts behind her, this is going to be interesting&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the authors webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for and first run at GenconUK 2001 where 2 tables ran. Since run twice at Conception 2003. Returned to GenconUK 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both groups at GenconUK completed the adventure successfully, and managed to do it within the four hour limit, just. The two groups at Conception failed to complete the mission but seemed to enjoy themselves, which is what I consider a real success for a roleplaying scenario, did the GM and players enjoy it. The team that tackled this on its return to GenconUK also failed, this has proven a tough scenario to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suspect that run as a private game that this adventure could well take a lot more than four hours to play, maybe more like eight to twelve depending on how much time the players spend investigating it. The adventure is investigative in nature and there is more than one way to complete it so a group of players that investigate everything included will take a long time. This adventure will run very easily with a different group of characters to the group of Shadowrunners provided. Generally I found this a pleasure to write, and it's fun if demanding to run under tournament conditions as there is a lot to do. Expect to need several hours to read it, and rely on the aids provided within the adventure to find the information you want when running the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
