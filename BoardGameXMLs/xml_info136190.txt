			<description>In Ropoa The City, players compete to construct the medieval city-state of Ropoa. By creating new buildings players increase their Income and earn Victory Points. The player who can earn the most Victory Points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is in charge of constructing the city of Ropoa from nothing to a burgeoning city-state. Players take turns buying resources; Wood, Stone, Glass and Metal. Then use those resources to construct buildings within the city walls. Each building has its own resource cost and provides varying amounts of Income and Victory Points to the owning player. Also, every building is represented on the board by a 3-dimensional model;. The placement of each building will change the face of the city as well as the potential for additional Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ropoa was specifically designed to be a gateway game. But don't be fooled by the easy-to-learn, simple rules this game has a surprising amount of strategic depth and thoughtful play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information and announcements on the release of Ropoa The City will be coming early in 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
