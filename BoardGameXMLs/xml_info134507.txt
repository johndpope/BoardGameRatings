			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspetra is a console-style RPG for the PC.  At the beginning of the game, the protagonist arrives at the top of a mountain via a cloud; allegedly a wizard sent him, but the character has little recollection of facts and events.  The character is named by the player through a conversation with an early NPC, who sets him on a quest involving wizardry, swordplay, and adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character is moved about with the arrow keys and can interact with objects and people.  Most items can be either equipped or consumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
