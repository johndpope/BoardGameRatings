			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anno 1602: Creation of a New World (in the USA, Canada and Australia released as 1602 A.D.) is a game with both real time strategy and city building elements, developed by Austria-based Max Design company.&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the Early Modern period of history and is based around colony building and resource management on a series of small islands. It includes aspects of exploration, combat, diplomacy and trade. It is set in the same period as Sid Meier's Colonization, but involves more detailed colony management, with no &amp;quot;Old World&amp;quot; politics. Parts, like expansion and movement of resources, are similar to the early Settlers games. Anno 1602 is an economic, rather than combat, orientated strategy game. Players are rarely challenged in battle. The game design is noteworthy for its attempt to implement a 'progressive' artificial intelligence, meaning that the pace of the game changes in response to how quickly players act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;1602 A.D. is a simulation title by the now defunct Austrian game developer Max Design. Set in the Colonial Age, the player is responsible for the well-being of a group of settlers who set out to see the New World.
