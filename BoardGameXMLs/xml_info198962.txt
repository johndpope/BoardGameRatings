							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hub Second Edition</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An entire subsector at your fingertips!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second edition of Subsector Sourcebook 3: Hub details Subsector G of our Clement Sector setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hub Subsector is the home of The Hub Federation, a loose federation of six worlds surrounding the Hub system.  The Hub system was, until 2331, the home of The Conduit, a wormhole which connected the Earth Sector to Clement Sector.  Hub was the center of all travel and trade back and forth between the two sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remainder of the Hub subsector consists of independent worlds, some of which hate the Hub Federation and those who work quietly with them.  All of these worlds have a fierce desire to remain independent which has not been dimmed by the collapse of The Conduit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within these pages, you will find the British and German worlds of The Hub Federation, the cybertheocracy of Kingston, the wartorn world of Sophronius, and the republic of Maximon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each world comes complete with detailed information concerning the system and the planet itself, yet leaves the Referee plenty of room to use these worlds as he/she sees fit.  Made with the busy Referee in mind, this book can be used to expand your knowledge of Clement Sector or as a useful set of worlds to expand your current campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
