			<description>Many are called but few are chosen! Who will stand and fight against the forces of darkness? Fear not, for you have been chosen by the Host of Heaven to die to yourself so others may live. In this exciting new game  players are challenged to live out an ancient principle that you die to gain, and you live to die.  Filled with unusual scenarios and life changing scriptures, this game turns spirituality into practicality! Is the game about luck, or is it fate, you be the judge as you become a missionary in your own backyard. Your task  is to fight to win lost souls, and redeem your poverty stricken neighborhood back into a  plush thriving community. As players travel around the board using dice, each person will encounter 4 types of spaces: natural, spiritual, witness, and proprty spaces. Each player's goal is to equire the most souls, buy property, and build an underground church. The player with 6 souls on one property wins and game play stops. However, achievements will be divided up amongst players (most property, most money, most souls, most property). Each space corresponds with a card. Natural cards have consequences to gain money, lose turns, etc. Spirtural cards: players read inspiring passages, play act, etc. Witness cards are the only cards players can win souls with. Players can win or lose souls depending on scenior. So put on the whole armor of God as this game will put your skills to the test!  The table is set, everything&amp;rsquo;s unwrapped, and it&amp;rsquo;s game time, are you ready to die to live?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
