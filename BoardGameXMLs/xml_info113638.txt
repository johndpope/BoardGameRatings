			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adamant Entertainment is proud to present the first available product in the Kickstarter-record-breaking FAR WEST line: a digital copy of the map of the Far West that will appear in the endpapers of the Limited Edition of the FAR WEST Adventure Game rulebook, done by cartographer Andrew Law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10-page PDF can be printed and assembled into a 22 x 34 inch copy of the map of the Far West -- a vast area spanning more than 7,000 miles across. Also included with your purchase is a hi-res JPG of the entire map, for use as a digital copy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Secession Wars ended with the inevitability of a coming winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new world was created. Peace and prosperity for all. For those who had lost everything in the War, there was no place for them. They headed west, to start new lives. For warriors, even those who had fought on the winning side, there was no place for them, either. Steeped in too much blood, and possessed of a skill and trade that was no longer desired, they also headed west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Periphery lies the Frontier. Settlements began to blossom. Yet even here the flower of civilization asked too much tending, and so men and women pushed further West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Frontier. Into the Far West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I look to the North,&lt;br/&gt;the cold wind smells of pine and iron.&lt;br/&gt;I look to the East,&lt;br/&gt;the cool wind smells of jasmine and brine.&lt;br/&gt;I look to the South,&lt;br/&gt;the warm wind smells of citrus and loam.&lt;br/&gt;I will not look to the West,&lt;br/&gt;for the wind is full of dust,&lt;br/&gt;and it smells of blood and glory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;- Loora Vol, Poetess&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
