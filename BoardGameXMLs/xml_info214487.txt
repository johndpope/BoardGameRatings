							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Harper&#039;s Ferry</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the twenty second battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D. The Confederate Army is attacking the outpost of Harpers Ferry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically Major General Thomas J &amp;ldquo;Stonewall&amp;rdquo; Jackson has been assigned with the capture of the outpost of Harpers Ferry. It is a Federal arsenal that the Confederates need to acquire in their march across Maryland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harpers Ferry is a single day battle that has a time limit of 14 bounds. The Confederates must capture Harpers Ferry and disperse the Union forces. The games design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 1-2 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavor of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensional as a straight print and play or 3 dimensional, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in two halves, the Harpers Ferry seven page Battle Rules, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty one page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice. The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you continue this great series of battles with another victory? Play North or South in this the twenty second game of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
