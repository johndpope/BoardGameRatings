			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game, written entire in machine language, is fast and flexible.  You have a choice of five speeds, up to four players simultaneously, or you can compete directly against the computer.  You try to control an ever-growing line without running into a boundary, another player, or yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Compute! (August 1981) there was an action game called Blockade for the Atari, written entirely in BASIC...The use of BASIC prevented the possibility of allowing increased speeds, multiple players, or computer play options.  I wrote this version of Blockade for the Atari - called Roadblock - in machine language to add these options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roadblock was written by Brian Holness and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 38, July 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
