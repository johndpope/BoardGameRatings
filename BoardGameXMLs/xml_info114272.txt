							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deathlord</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deathlord stands revealed, reeking of pestilence. Master of a technology called magic. Spewing hordes of monsters. Exploiting every power there is... and some there shouldn't be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life in Lorn was always horrific. But it just got worse. The fiercest Samurai haven't been lucky. They're dead. The Emperor fears for his life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The the Deathlord seems to have all the time in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To vanquish him, you'll need every magic item you can win. And a few skills you didn't know existed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's either that, or lose face. Your face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
