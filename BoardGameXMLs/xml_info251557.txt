			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should have been the Prime Alpha - but for some strange reason the Prime Komputer selected Alpha Omega San. You suspect someone has been tampering with sensitive data files and programs and you wouldn't be surprised if Alpha Omega San is that person. You've invited her and her Omegas to your home in order to find out more and perhaps gather enough evidence against her. If she has been tampering with the Prime Komputer's programming, that's reason enough for exile from the Dome. You intend to ply her with drink and perhaps loosen her up with some sensual delights so that you can catch her off guard. You have also invited a long time ally, Alpha Theta Wu to your home. She contacted you earlier in the day that she would be bringing &amp;quot;guests&amp;quot; but did not give you any other information. Since she was rather mysterious about this, you are rather curious. If they prove to be a threat to Dream Dome society or the Prime Komputer they should be eliminated. Nothing can be allowed to remain a threat to the Prime Komputer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
