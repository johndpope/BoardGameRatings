							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Barbarian Reworked</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Putting the &amp;quot;reee&amp;quot; in Barbarian!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second in the Winning Warrior series, the Barbarians Reworked improves the barbarian along the same lines as the Fighter Reborn, giving him a much-needed tune-up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much like the fighter, the barbarian takes a licking and keeps on kicking &amp;ndash; but better than his armored counterpart. Resilience makes certain of that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the core mechanic of rage made into a more &amp;quot;per-battle&amp;quot; system, than a &amp;quot;per-day&amp;quot; one, the barbarian gains some additional longevity that the wizard and cleric just don't have!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the barbarian's rage powers are given their own fixing, in line with the new system of rage, allowing her to use them during a rage by giving up some of her rage duration!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win the day &amp;ndash; with a warrior!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
