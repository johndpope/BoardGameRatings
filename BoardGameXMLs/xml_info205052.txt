							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hostage Negotiator: Abductor Pack 7</name>
									
			<description>Valerie Stone was another negotiator who was constantly competing with you, but never garnered the accolades or had the level of success that you did. Ultimately it became too much for her and she's decided the only way to prove she is better than you is to force you to negotiate with her... and she knows just how to accomplish that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Abductor pack is a 16 card expansion compatible with both Hostage Negotiator and Hostage Negotiator: Crime Wave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
