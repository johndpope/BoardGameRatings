			<description>In a harbour of an island of the Antilles, 4 ships are to be loaded with goods. Each player wants to attribute his porters to the ships in order to get money when the ship leaves the harbour. In your turn, you must play one of your action cards. The card tells you how many porters you are allowed to attribute to a ship or if you may change their places. If there are as many porters in a ship as the ship needs, it leaves the harbour. All porters earn money. The player who triggered the departure must pay a commission according to the number on his played action card. But if he is the starting player of the round, he may denominate any other player with at least one porter on that ship to pay the commission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
