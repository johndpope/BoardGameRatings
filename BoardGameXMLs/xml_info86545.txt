			<description>It's that time of year! The air has gotten crisp and the elves are working overtime to ensure Santa's sleigh is ready to go on the big night! And boy have there been a lot of orders this year! From iPlods to Zebras (with Real Exploding Action), children's wish lists have gotten increasingly lengthy and complex!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, the big cheese himself has decided to bring in some migrant elves to help with demand. He even gave them their own factory floors and access to the common area! Needless to say, The pointy eared members of Christmas local #127 have become fearful of replacement if they fall behind on this year's manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Christmas spirit, players take control of one of the groups of elves competing to create toys for Santa's winter ride. The object of the game is to create more, better toys than the rival groups. The player with the most victory points in toy cards in Santa's sleigh at the end of the game is the winner and has a little job security for next year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
