							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leonardo</name>
									
			<description>Vinci, late 15th century: Someday Leonardo will become the great inventor and painter that we know so well today, but right now he is a young, exuberant, and inventive boy. He is always inventing the most incredible creations just by observing the world around him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Leonardo, players must collect inventions, gathering the right materials (i.e., cards) for each one. Each invention has a point value based on how complex it is and based on the required materials. Before starting the game, place six collection cards and three invention cards on the matching spaces on the game board. Place the three stand-up character pawns on the correct positions around the invention cards. All players share these characters and can use any of them that they want each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, each player simultaneously reveals one of three character cards and one of three movement cards. The first player moves his chosen character clockwise around the circle the number of spaces shown on his movement card, then:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    If no cards are on the space, his turn ends;&lt;br/&gt;    If a collection card is on the space, he places it face up in front of him;&lt;br/&gt;    If an invention card is there and he has all of the required materials, he can take that card and the matching invention pawn; or&lt;br/&gt;    If a painting card is there, he plays it immediately, gaining that card's special effect (take an extra turn, steal a player's material card, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining players take their turns in clockwise order in the same manner, then the player to the left of the first player becomes the first player for the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no invention or collection cards are available to fill spaces on the board, the game ends immediately. Players score points equal to the value of their inventions, plus 1 point for each material card they still have. The player with the highest score wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
