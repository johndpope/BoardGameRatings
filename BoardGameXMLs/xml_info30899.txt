			<description>From Games et al and used with permission:&lt;br/&gt;This is a truly fun game manufactured by C W Faulkner &amp;amp; Co in 1899 and is a race game covering the, then, popular hobby of cycling. Falulkner produced a series of games similar to Bikee called the &amp;lsquo;Upidee Series&amp;rsquo; Cards are laid out to provide the course and the use of a teetotum provides the means of movement. This game consists of up to six cyclists, two dice, the rules and 20 illustrated course cards. The bottom of the box lists other games by Faulkner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Rules stipulate teetotum but d6 die is pictured with game in BGG gallery. Another ebay sale has images showing a four-sided teetotum with sides numbered 1-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
