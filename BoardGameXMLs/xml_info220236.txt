			<description>My First Memory: What Animals Eat is a tile matching game featuring various animals and the foods they eat. Younger children can play it as a simple matching game, finding pairs of identical tiles, while older children might enjoy slightly more difficulty by matching animals to the foods they eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin by placing the tiles in rows, picture side down. The first player takes his turn by flipping over two tiles. If they are a match, he keeps the tiles and takes another turn. If the tiles do not match, the player returns them to their face down positions, and the next player takes her turn. Play continues until all of the tiles have been matched and collected. The player with the most tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
