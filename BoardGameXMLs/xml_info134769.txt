			<description>SEGUNDOS&amp;hellip;fuera! is a game where you are one of the boxers facing up tonite fight. &lt;br/&gt;The goal is to beat your opponent. You can get it by K.O. or by judges scoring at the end of the fight (going to the scorecards). &lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 12 rounds as in a boxing match. You have a number of attacking and defense cards (value from 1 to 5) that can be managed each round. There are different cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    attacking cards ( punch and feint+punch )&lt;br/&gt;    defending cards ( block and dodge ) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are played following a few simple rules. This will affect ENDURANCE and DAMAGE tracks of both fighters. Damage points can get a knockdown (and you&amp;acute;ll have to try if your boxer stands up or not) and if there are cuts. You have 100 endurance points to manage all over the fight. &lt;br/&gt;The way of playing cards sometimes is face down or face up (bluffing mechanic). If you play smart, you'll see it only doesn`t depend on the cards value, but also the way you raise your strategy in each round.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; At the beginning of each round, there will be an auction using endurance points to see which boxer has initiative for that round.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Feints, blocks, damage, punches, endurance, counter attacks, combos, initiative, knockdowns, knockouts... are some elements included in this funny and strategic boxing card game where you get a highest interaction each time the bell rings. Depending on your cleverness and the correct strategy the referee will raise your arm or your opponent&amp;acute;s at the end of the fight. You&amp;acute;ll win by a knockout or you&amp;acute;ll finish kissing the canvas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Sweet science...! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
