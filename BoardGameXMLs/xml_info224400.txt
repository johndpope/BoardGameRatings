			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surely cutting through the desert is safer than staying in the cities, right?! Wrong! Not only are we still fighting the zombies, we are also hot and thirsty. Maybe Las Vegas will have fewer zombies since it's in the middle of a desert...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Zombies!!! 15: Another One Bites the Dust, players venture out into the desert, hoping the zombies cannot or will not follow them there. This turns out to be a big mistake. Now players must contend with both zombies and dehydration while they search for the jewel of the desert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
