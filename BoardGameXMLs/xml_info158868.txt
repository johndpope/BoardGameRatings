			<description>&amp;quot;A Game for Learning How to Tell Time,&amp;quot; 'What's the Time? is a children's game that offers two ways to play, each of which is designed to teach young children to tell time.  In one game, children win cards by being the fastest to set their cardboard clock to the correct time as shown on the card.  The first to earn a predetermined number of cards wins.  In the other game, children are dealt a hand of cards and place them in a line in the order by the times shown on the cards.  The first to place all his or her cards correctly wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
