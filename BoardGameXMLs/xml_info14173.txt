							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duel Master 3: The Shattered Realm</name>
									
			<description>Similar in some regards to the Ace of Aces book series, Duel Master takes 2 players, each with their own book, into competition with one another.  Play is paragraph based, with each player making their own choices about what they want their character to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Shattered Realm the gods have decreed that war is inevitable between two of The Ten Kingdoms on the magic world of Orb.  Each player assumes the role of leader of one of these two kingdoms.  Players must send out their emissaries to surrounding lands to try to gain allies for the final apocalyptic battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
