			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Ambush at Sorinor, Mindcraft's follow-up to its 1992 game, Siege, players work as mercenary commanders, taking missions from six warring factions in order to make a profit.  After taking a mission from a faction, the player hires troops and buys traps in order to complete the mission.  The missions invariably involve killing off a significant percentage of enemy VIP units or protecting your own VIP units in a real-time skirmish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skirmishes are played from a top-down perspective.  The player controls and gives orders to units of troops (although a unit can be made as small as an individual trooper).  While the game plays out in real-time, the game can be paused, and the flow of time can be sped up and slowed down as the player sees fit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
