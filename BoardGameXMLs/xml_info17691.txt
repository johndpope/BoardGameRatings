			<description>Djambi, or Chess of Machiavelli is a game for 4 players that can be played with only 3. There also exists a 5-player version called Pentachiavel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game of treason. Each player is the leader of a political party composed of 9 pieces:&lt;br/&gt;1 Leader&lt;br/&gt;1 Journalist&lt;br/&gt;1 Assassin&lt;br/&gt;1 Provoker&lt;br/&gt;1 Necromobile&lt;br/&gt;4 Activists&lt;br/&gt;who roam a 9x9square board where all squares are the same except the central one, called The Labyrinth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All counters move as the Queen in Chess, except the Activist who moves the same but only for two squares.&lt;br/&gt;A piece cannot move through another piece, whether alive or dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: gaining absolute power, that is killing all other leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To do this, all players have the weapons of the actual politics: manipulation, provocation, activism, recuperation, scandal and political crime. The course to power is not a gala dinner, so all pieces can be physically eliminated. In politics, a dead is as encumbrant as a living person, so all dead pieces are kept on the board, face down.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead pieces have no color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Labyrinth is the basement of the Legal Power, the road to Absolute Power. Only a Leader may stay on this square. It makes its parti play after each opponent. But there, it can be killed by nearly all other pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Leader: can kill any piece on the board by taking its place. The taken piece is placed on any other adjacent free square of the board, dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Journalist kills a piece that is adjacent to any one of the 4 squares that share a common border with its square. It does this just after having moved. The body lies dead where it was killed. He must move at least one square before killing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Assassin, can kill any piece by taking its place. The piece is placed, dead on the place the Assassin was before moving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Provoker, mover of the living: can move any living piece if it takes its position. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Necromobile, mover of the dead: can move any dead piece if it takes its position. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Activists can kill a piece by taking its place. The taken piece is placed on any other free square of the board, dead. They CAN'T kill a leader in The Labyrinth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are most of the rules. You can find the rest (in French, sorry) at the link below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
