			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Tetris (1984).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kentris is a Tetris clone in which combinations of blocks fall from the top of the screen to the bottom, stacking higher and higher.  If the player can rotate and set them so that a full row is filled with blocks, the row will clear and buy the player more time.&lt;br/&gt;Kentris differs in that there are a number of distractions.  As two players play simultaneously, the individual player columns move about the screen.  Players can also add annoying blocks to their opponents screen on occasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
