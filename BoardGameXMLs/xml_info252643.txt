			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month is all about BASiL, Brian&amp;rsquo;s Alternative Spell (i) Law. We are featuring 33 new spell lists what is Essence part 2. These spell lists encompass the traditional Magician base lists, so this is where you are going to find you fireballs and lightning bolts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also where BASiL really starts to shine in my opinion. No longer do you have just one elemental list such as Wind Law that tries to do it all. Now, for example, Wind Law becomes four distinct lists; Defensive Winds, Attacking Winds, Moving Winds and Controlling Winds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
