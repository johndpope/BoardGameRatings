							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Errata and FAQ (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second edition of Quasar was contemplated and received preliminary work but was apparently never completed.  Between the 1st and 3rd editions of the game an online FAQ was maintained that clarified rules (with the stated intent of revising or updating referenced rules for second edition) and an online Errata was maintained that had the stated intent of presenting forthcoming rules for the 2nd edition.  None of the materials presented were substantive changes or significant from a systems perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd edition effort appears to have been abandoned after receiving minimal work in favor of the third edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
