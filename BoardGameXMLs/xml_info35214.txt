			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game that has certain elements of such well-known games as dominos, liar's dice and bridge but with new limitations placed on the tiles and on the procedure. The game is played on a board having seven hexagonal areas of the same size, each being subdivided into six equilateral triangles of the same size, and thirty-six tiles of the same size which are shaped to overlie and fill the equilateral triangular areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seven hexagonal areas are arranged such that one is in the center and the others are distributed around it, each having one side contiguous with the side of the centrally located hexagonal area and two sides which are contiguous with two other hexagonal areas. The tiles are formed in six groups, each group having a different distinctive surface marking which can be used for bidding and playing procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
