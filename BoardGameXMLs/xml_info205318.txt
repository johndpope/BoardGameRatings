							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Expedition to Castle Ravenloft: The Undead Plague</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prisoner within his domain, Strahd taints everything he touches. In his growing desperation to escape, the vampire lord turns on the population of Barovia in a mad scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the village of Barovia, the son of Priest Danovich has been slain by bandits. Strahd has arranged for an evil tome to be discovered by the priest. Mad with grief, the priest has corrupted by the vile volume. He resurrects his son as a Blaspheme, a plague bearer and plague eater. And then the first zombies appeared...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While his necromantic infection spreads and threatens to consume the village of Barovia, Strahd moves to secure what is most precious to him and to eliminate any potential threats to his plan. Danovich is dealt with but Ireena Kolyana, so reminiscent of his long-lost bride, still refuses his advances. Her father, the Burgomaster, is slain for his part in that and the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind has been removed from the mansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the mists part and a small band of outsiders are allowed entry into Strahd's domain. They are watched closely by his spies as they move to end his plague. It is against them that he will measure the efficacy of his tools and it is through them that his plan may finally be set into motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item presents a conversion strategy to adapt Expedition to Castle Ravenloft for play with 13th Age.  Note that Expedition to Castle Ravenloft is required to use this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
