							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dark Lord: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>The Dark Lord is dead. The war between Good and Evil is over. Evil has prevailed and left The Land in ruins - it is your destiny to be victorious over the powerful beings who strive to take the Dark Lord's mantle as their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve aspiring Lords seek the Dark Throne, which rises in the Eye - the menacing ring of fire in the center of The Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Lord is an independently developed board game for savvy gamers about domination and control, melding card and board game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set out from one of four Keeps that surround The Land. Build an army by exploiting the many resources The Land has to offer and expand your Lord's power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Lord features 470 playable cards with a wide variety of uses. Summon powerful Creatures with Summon cards, hinder your enemies with Spell cards and grow your power with Utility cards. Each class makes use of cards specialized and specific to that class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in Dark Lord requires the ability to effectively manage resources, out-think your opponents and create and seize opportunities through the use of cards and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
