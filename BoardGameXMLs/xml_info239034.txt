							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Garden Bird Game</name>
									
			<description>A simplified P-n-P board game with small play tiles with a design of play for younger players to help with matching four types of birds in a garden, counting colours (flower beds), counting scores along a score track, taking turns and taking tiles from a cup or bag.  The game can also be played by older players as well, as there are Advanced Optional Rules included &amp;ndash; the game can actually get quite tactical for older players. The game is designed for 2 players but can be played with 4 in pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The correct placing of the bird types and the 'wild tile' fish pond tiles scores points which are recorded on the included score track and the winner has the highest score at the end of the game.  There is also some final end-game scoring of only the coloured background tiles of the birds that have been placed within each players own columns of garden squares.  Bonus points can also be scored by correctly placing the 'wild tile' fish ponds in a player's garden column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This P-n-P home-made test version includes the game-board (that represents a garden of squares and a score track), a counter-mix and a set of game rules for use by families with younger (and older) gamers at BGG to try out.  It should only take about 15-30 mins to play a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
