							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Speed Circuit: Tournament Tracks</name>
									
			<description>The &amp;quot;Speed Circuit Tournament Tracks&amp;quot; are designed for road racing game enthusiasts who wish to expand on Avalon Hill's racing game, Speed Circuit.&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard consists of two tracks: the qualifying track (normal track), and the tournament track (double track).&lt;br/&gt;This module for Speed Circuit is intended to give the players more flexibility in track selection, an optional method for determining starting position, and a larger more exciting track for running tournaments. &lt;br/&gt;The packaging notes that the designers were the first and second place finishers at the Origins '79 Speed Circuit tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
