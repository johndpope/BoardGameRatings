			<description>Itchy &amp;amp; Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness is a side-scrolling action game. The player takes control of Scratchy as he plays through various mini golf courses, trying to achieve a good score, while at the same time avoiding Itchy's attacks. Itchy uses weapons such as grenades, bazookas, chainsaws, meat cleavers, and dynamite. Scratchy can acquire items, such as a baseball bat or throwing knives, and power-ups to defend himself against Itchy. He can also use his putter as a weapon. There are a total of nine levels, or holes, in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Simpsons: Itchy &amp;amp; Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
