			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning, Homo Sapiens was a prey species. Hunted by the creatures of darkness, we had no culture, and only the most primitive of tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norandon, as we call him, changed everything. He is called many things: Thoth, Quetzalcouatl, Enoch, Viracocha, Prometheus; but always the story is the same. The God(s) sent him to teach us the things we needed to know to push back the hated Creatures of Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a long age where the Vampires were beaten back, and we emerged into the sun. We call this the Golden Age, for the Creatures had not yet evolved defences against what Norandon had taught us, and they feared us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, belief in magic had greatly diminished in the civilized portions of the world, religious or non-religious. As belief fuels magic, magic became very difficult to accomplish in those areas. we call this absence of magic, for good or evil, the Nullity. Magic lingered on in the backwaters of society, where the supernatural was more real than science, but these areas shrank as the Nullity grew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, we, the forces of Light, the heirs of Norandon, again have both the need and the means to pick up the challenge thrown by the Dark. Unless we hold the forces of darkness at bay, civilization will crumble again, and the Darkness will cover all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
