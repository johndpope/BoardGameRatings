							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wall Street: The Game of Speculation</name>
									
			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To those who enjoy a stirring game of chance, which may be controlled, to some extent, by smart judgment, this game of Wall Street will prove a fascinating diversion . . . Just as in the &amp;quot;Street&amp;quot; itself the time to buy and sell is fraught with uncertainty, so in this game it is puzzling to determine whether to take a trick with a 1-point boost to score and be &amp;quot;sure&amp;quot; -- or hold your best card for a 2- or 3-point &amp;quot;Win&amp;quot; -- perhaps to be forced, as often happens, to take a loss of 2 or 3 points because you held a &amp;quot;good card&amp;quot; too long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parts =&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards in Blue, Red, Green and Violet&lt;br/&gt;12 Counting Cards with &amp;quot;Win&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Lose&amp;quot; and one &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;Cardboard chips in yellow, green, blue and red.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
