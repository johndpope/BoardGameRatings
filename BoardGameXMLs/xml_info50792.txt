			<description>Confessions of a Part-Time Sorceress&lt;br/&gt;A Girl's Guide to the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With tongue-in-cheek humor and plenty of self-mockery, Shelly Mazzanoble chronicles her unexpected descent into the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons world. Shelly's a girly-girl through and through, but when a friend asks her to join his D&amp;amp;D game as a 134-year-old sorceress named Astrid Bellagio, she politely agrees, never expecting to actually like it. In spite of all the stereotypes - or maybe because of them - she actually finds herself getting game.&lt;br/&gt;Part connfessional, part how-to guide, this book delves into the basics of the most popular roleplaying game, explaining how to create a character, outlining how to play - even suggesting  D&amp;amp;D-themed snacks (Magic Missle Meatballs, anyone?) - all the while taking a light-hearted look at the myths and realities of gamer stereotypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
