			<description>A children's game that teaches about the development of life on earth. Players spin the spinner and move their dinosaur-shaped pawn that number of spaces, which correspond to different species.  They progress from micro-organisms through plants to invertebrates and then vertebrates, each time doing ocean life and then land life.  There are numerous squares that make you go back 2 if you land on them, and the last 5 spaces must be landed on by exact count, all giving a catch-up mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back of the board has family trees for the plant and animal kingdoms, and charts showing forms of life appearing during different epochs of earth history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
