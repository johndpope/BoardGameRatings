							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragons are Above My Pay Grade!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A non-linear search for hidden artifacts that culminates in an attack on a huge red dragon, Dragons are Above My Pay Grade provides heroes with an electrifying start to their careers.  Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to fight a dragon, even if it is above your pay grade?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons are Above My Pay Grade is an adventure for 3 &amp;ndash; 6 first level PCs using the Pathfinder RPG rules. It is 23 pages long, fully illustrated and in color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunstone Island seemed like the perfect opportunity.  Idyllic weather, pleasant beaches, docile animals, and, most importantly, a mine absolutely bursting with gold.  Peter Grimples, owner of the Grimples Mining Corporation, was so enthusiastic to exploit these virgin resources that he personally headed the mining colony on this remote island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The volcano?  Looks pretty quiet.  The tribe of kobolds?  Nothing a group of wide-eyed heroes can&amp;rsquo;t handle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That is, until the kobolds resurrect the red dragon Varaug onto the island.  With reinforcements weeks away, suddenly the cheapest heroes money can buy don&amp;rsquo;t seem quite up to the task.&lt;br/&gt;To combat this sudden and unexpected threat, the heroes must follow in the footsteps of the legendary native A&amp;rsquo;uapa who slew Varaug many centuries ago.  Following the instructions of a turncoat kobold who would like nothing more than the death of the merciless dragon, the heroes collect the dragon-slaying tools of A&amp;rsquo;uapa hidden across Sunstone Island.  These poisons, blessings, spells, and weapons are heavily guarded, sequestered in dungeons or protected by kobolds.  As the heroes traverse the island, following clues, unlocking riddles, and completing challenges, their already formidable adversary grows stronger and the colony town that they call home grows weaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can the heroes collect enough dragon-slaying weapons to defeat Varaug before he destroys the mining colony along with any chance of future employment?  How could the party&amp;rsquo;s first contract go so wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons Are above My Pay Grade features a mining town, a fleshed out island with wild beasts and tropical hazards, a range of mini-dungeons and challenges,  and a host of original enemies, spells, poisons, items, and traps.  And, of course, the opportunity for level 1 character to face a red wyrm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
