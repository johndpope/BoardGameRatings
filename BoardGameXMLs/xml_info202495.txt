							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zombie Apocalypse Won&#039;t Just be Slow...</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies are untiring, fearless waves of mindless destruction. The proverbial horde of zombies shambling toward a village of innocent souls can bring horror to the stoutest of hearts. However... they&amp;rsquo;re really only dangerous in large numbers because, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, zombies are slow. But what if a zombie wasn&amp;rsquo;t slow? What if a zombie moved faster than you, caused multiple wounds, and could evade your attacks even better than when it was alive? The primitive horror of a mass of zombies could quickly turn to true terror from just one zombie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walking, climbing, swimming, flying, and burrowing into your homes, included here are 46 fast zombies from CR &amp;frac12; to CR 11 with multiple attacks to cause even the most stalwart group of adventurers to quail in fear. Fast zombies don&amp;rsquo;t shamble, they run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
