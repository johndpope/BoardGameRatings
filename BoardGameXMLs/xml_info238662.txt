			<description>Welcome to Gang Damai (Peace Alley), a little street on a corner of Jakarta. Gang Damai has been just like a mini Indonesia, where people from Sabang to Merauke live together. With their houses almost hugging each other, living in Gang Damai is always full of color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players should work together to keep the peace in Gang Damai by solving the problems arising in the Gang Damai neighborhood. Each troublesome resident would disturb other residents, which were shown by a token. Each player has 50 actions (if played by 2 players), 35 actions (if played by 3 players), and 25 actions (if played by 4 players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, every player must draw a solution cards then they can spend their actions to move in their neighbourhood to solve a problem. But be carefull, because not all of problems will not be easy to resolve...and player can make the problem become dire situation. The goal of the game is to solve all of the problems in the neighbourhood. The game also end when all of the players use all of their action and no more than 5 neighbour is out of the game, then all the player is considered win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
