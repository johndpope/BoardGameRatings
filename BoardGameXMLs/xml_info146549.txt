			<description>BancoBanco is a colourful card game that can be played with 2-4 players. Each player starts the game with four banks and four vaults in the colors red, green, blue and yellow. All the players also have a personal vault where they can save their precious cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with two types of cards: point cards and Banco cards. The point cards have a color, value and 1-3 symbols. These cards are used to score points or to invest in the banks. The Banco cards, which have a color and a bonus, are used only to close a bank. A player's turn has three phases. First, the active player can steal a card from an opponent by asking for it (color, value or a combination of both). Second, the player takes two actions, which can be playing cards on a bank and/or vault, saving cards in the personal vault, taking your personal vault to your hand, or burning cards. Finally, the player brings his hand back to five cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in the vaults and secure these points by closing the banks. When a bank is closed, all players must close their vault of the same color, so no points can be scored anymore. When all vaults are closed, the game ends and points are counted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
