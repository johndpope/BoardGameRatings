			<description>&amp;quot;We could start a Spy Club,&amp;quot; suggested Beatrice. &amp;quot;You know &amp;mdash; search for clues and try to find mysteries to solve!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Spy Club, players work together as young detectives to solve neighborhood mysteries. It includes a replayable campaign format, with variable unlocking content, for playing a series of 5 games connected together to tell a larger story. Throughout the campaign, you'll unlock new modules with additional rules and story elements. With 40+ new modules and 150+ cards in the campaign deck, you can reset everything and play multiple campaigns &amp;mdash; with a different story and gameplay experience emerging each time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the standard game, each player has double-sided clue cards in front of them. On your turn, you use actions to flip, draw, and trade clue cards, gain ideas, and confirm clue cards as evidence. Confirm 5 clues of the same type to solve part of the case. As you discover more and more of the solution, a story starts to emerge: your Neighbor stole something from the ice cream shop, but what? And why? To crack the case, you must find the solution to all 5 parts before the suspect escapes or you run out of clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can always play a single, standalone game of Spy Club, but the campaign mode is the recommended way to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each game plays in 30-45 minutes, and each campaign consists of 5 games.&lt;br/&gt;     Some elements from each game carry forward and affect future games, with new rules and story elements are unlocked each play.&lt;br/&gt;     The sequence of content isn&amp;rsquo;t scripted, so each campaign will unfold differently.&lt;br/&gt;     Everything can be fully reset and replayed.&lt;br/&gt;     You only unlock a small portion of the total content in one campaign (just 5 of the 40+ modules), so you can play multiple campaigns and continue unlocking new content each time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
