			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simulation for 1 to 4 persons.  Each begins as a land-owner, and by farming their land, buying and selling land, expanding their fishing fleet, building on to their manufactory, increasing their population, equipping and training more soldiers, and regulating their taxes, each player tries to increase their economic power and rank until one becomes ruler over it.  But beware plagues, rats, raiders, revolts, bad weather, and other misfortunes which may lie along the road to success.  As you progress, see the map of your holdings increase.  Playable in 1 to 2 hours, and different every time, you may have an addiction problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires 16K memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
