			<description>Pacific 1942 Cadet is a simplified version for beginners alias Cadets to play Pacific 1942 Admiral Game. &lt;br/&gt;In Pacific 1942 Cadet you will acquire the basic skills that will both enable you to enjoy the game and prepare you for the crucible of the full version of the game. &lt;br/&gt;Every Cadet aspiring to become an Admiral must be an expert in the movement of ships, aircraft and the marines; he or she must distinguish various types of weapons and be able to find the best solution to every situation.&lt;br/&gt;Later on, you can move to Admiral full version. There is nothing in the rules for Cadets that would not apply to the full version, too. Only, as in life, also in Pacific 1942it is true that grey is the theory and green is the tree of life. So how does the full version differ? &lt;br/&gt;The basic difference is represented by several slight modifications meant to make it more difficult to keep track of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s strength and intentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
