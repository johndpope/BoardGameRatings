							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kingdom Builder Generator Pack II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A kingdom full of color and flavor is great, but what's the party to do? Enter the Kingdom Builder II, with generators for people and events just bursting with hooks. Laws, fashions and armies give you a colorful backdrop against which events take place and conspirators plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom Builder II contains Law, Fashion, Army and Place Name generators from Chaotic Shiny, as well the brand-new Events, Conspirators and Kingdom &amp;amp; Hooks generators and a graphical flag generator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can generate complete kingdoms all at once, including the name, ruler, important places, army, fashion, a few laws, recent events, and some notable individuals. Or you can create each aspect separately, generating dozens of events or conspirators or place names at once and picking the ones that fit your kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kingdom Builder II was written in .NET, which means that it will run on Windows XP or newer, plus any Mac or Linux machine that has an emulator for running .NET. (Some features, such as printing, might not work on emulators.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
