							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Oracle (Issue 6 - Dec 2015)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not an actual issue of The Oracle, but is a contemporary imagining of the never realized sixth issue. It was edited and produced by...Tim Hutchings, with kind permission of Christopher Bigelow. Contributors were asked to write as if they were themselves in 1983, and more or less that's what they did. There are exceptions, of course. The Erol Otus piece is lifted directly from his contemporary Island Town adventure, one of my favorite scenarios. Each author wrote with different levels of 1980s style and roughness. Allen Ruch did an especially thorough job of this, allowing his ignorant younger self to criticize two of his favorite things: Erol Otus and the Cthulhu Mythos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
