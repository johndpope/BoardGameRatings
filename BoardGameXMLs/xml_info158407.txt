			<description>from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been said that it is impossible to make a game about superheroes, because everyone wants to be Batman. Well, I suppose when everyone isn&amp;rsquo;t trying to be Wolverine. Anyway, for the first time, everyone can now be Batman!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this case, everyone gets to be a slightly different version of Batman&amp;hellip;from gravelly throated Dark Knights to campy public service message 60&amp;rsquo;s Batmen to Scarlet Pimpernell-inspired fisticuff pulpy Detectives-In-The-Night. Sure, the comics may have proven that Batman could possibly beat Superman in a fight&amp;hellip;but who wins in a fight when Batman meets Batman?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to figure out how your universe has multiple Batmen and Bruce Waynes&amp;hellip;it just is. Make the most of it. And don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much that in the comics, most likely Batman would only get &amp;ldquo;the good dice&amp;rdquo; during his scene; remember the other Batmen around the table already have a contingency plan for whoever has spotlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
