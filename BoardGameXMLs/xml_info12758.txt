			<description>In 1989 the Main Street Toy Company published an electronic baseball card game called Main Street Baseball . This game could be played either head-to-head by two players, or solo against the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The owner of the game was expected to apply a Sticker Stat (bar code) label to either the 24 game-provided cards or his own baseball cards. As cards were inserted into the main unit, batting/pitching stats for the corresponding player would then be read and used in game play. For those who did not wish to sully their baseball cards with the adhesive stickers, a standard lineup was provided within the hand held unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stickers for player performance in the 1988 season were provided within the base game. An order form was also available to those who wished to buy stickers for the 1989 season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
