							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stone of Sisyphus</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Catalog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STONE OF SISYPHUS carries you to a &amp;quot;thinking man's&amp;quot; dungeon, wherein you must apply your skills to effect survival and to realize your goals. This is an unfriendly subterranean world populated by hideous monsters, and dripping with fabulous treasures--the latter enticing you to face the former! Your survival hinges upon hard intellect, as opposed to the wispy uncertainty of chance, so be prepared to draw deeply from your intellectual reservoir! And--the responsiveness of the program to the individual qualities of your character make this grand adventure frustratingly enjoyable for hundreds of hours before all of its elusive secrets can be unlocked!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MACES &amp;amp; MAGIC are fantasy adventures involving you and your computer. Armed only with your wits, a microcomputer, and the software provided, you can become the hero or the meal your destiny dictates. You create a character, equip him (or her) with suitable weapons and armor, and enter the dungeon in search of fame and fortune. Neither is particularly easy to obtain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are successful in avoiding or conquering the various monsters, traps, enchantments and illusions set by our nefarious dungeonmasters, you may escape with riches and glory. Your name and deeds will be recorded for posterity in the records of the dungeon. More importantly, you'll be alive. You may then use the same character in his more experienced and wealthy form when you enter dungeons on later occasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
