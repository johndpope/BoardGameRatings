			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A UNIVERSE IN FLAMES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the collapse of the Terran Alliance, and the rise of the First Star League, humankind was scattered among the worlds of the Inner Sphere. Driven by their own ambitions and united by fear of their neighbors, mighty star empires rose up from the ashes of abandoned colonies, absorbing the remains of mankind&amp;rsquo;s interstellar exodus, and gave rise to the noble Houses of the Inner Sphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Driven by greed, fear, and dreams of glory, these Houses were at war by the dawn of the twenty-fifth century. The decades of conflict would leave no realm untouched, and forever altered the course of human destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Era Digest: Age of War is a mini-sourcebook that explores the pivotal developments of the Sphere-wide fighting that ultimately led to the birth of the Star League, featuring a glimpse of life in the BattleTech universe before the age of the BattleMech, the rise of neo-feudalism, and a look at the evolution of combat from the savagery of &amp;ldquo;total warfare&amp;rdquo; to the chivalry of MechWarriors. Complete with rules and stats for several Age of War units, Era Digest: Age of War also features role-playing support for this crucial setting in BattleTech history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
