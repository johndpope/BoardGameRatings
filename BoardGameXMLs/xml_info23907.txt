							<name  sortindex="5">The Two Towers</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;This fast-moving and exciting family board game follows faithfully 'The Two Towers', the second part of the blockbuster motion picture trilogy by New Line Cinema.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An original and easy to learn gameplay full of twists and turns, allows you to experience all the adventures of the remaining members of The Fellowship as they continue their treacherous journey, battling with Mordor in their quest to save Middle-earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively you could choose to play Mordor itself as it seeks to destroy The Fellowship and gain possession of The One Ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Frodo and Sam (accompanied by Gollum) heading for Mordor, Merry and Pippin held captive by the Uruk-hai and Orcs, with Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn in hot pursuit, The Fellowship are no longer in one group. Will Gandalf's reappearance at Fangorn help in their epic struggle and, even if The Fellowship and its allies repel the attack of the Warg Riders on the Plains of Rohan and then successfully destroy Isengard, will the huge battle at Helm&amp;rsquo;s Deep prove too much? The resolve and determination of Mordor remains undiminished as it struggles to regain the ultimate power and it will stop at nothing in its quest to defeat The Fellowship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skill, strategy and luck will play their part in your success or failure and, whether you choose to play good or evil, there will be no respite and no place to hide &amp;ndash; The One Ring must be destroyed if Middle-earth is to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
