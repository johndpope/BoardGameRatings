			<description>Shantae: Risky's Revenge is a platform video game developed by WayForward Technologies for DSiWare digital distribution service. It was released in North America on October 4, 2010 and later in all PAL regions barring Australia and New Zealand on February 11, 2011.[2] It is the sequel to the Game Boy Color video game Shantae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things had been quiet in Scuttle Town since Shantae's clash with the pirate Risky Boots. During the annual Relics Hunters Expo, she and her friends see fellow Relic Hunter Uncle Mimic unveil his latest find: an ordinary-looking lamp encased in stone. Just as they begin to wonder what it is, the notorious Risky Boots crashes the expo and steals the lamp. Despite the quick battle, Shantae is knocked out, allowing the vengeful pirate to get away. Blaming the half-genie for the town being in disarray and failing to do her job properly, the Mayor of Scuttle Town fires her as the town's guardian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite no longer being a Guardian Genie, Shantae still decides to take responsibility to stop Risky Boots' newest plot. Is there more to this mysterious lamp than one expects? And what does the evil pirate intend to do with it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shantae: Risky's Revenge&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
