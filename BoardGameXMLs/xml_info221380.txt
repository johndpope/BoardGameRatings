			<description>Under the rule of the good King Brandur the land of Andor became an isle of peace; still, it had many enemies. The heroes met many unsettling creatures during their travels north and south. And now it's time for these legends of Andor to be told - as only you know how!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When did the heroes encounter the Iron King? How did they defeat the wild Hraak? And what was they secret of the Three Sisters they exposed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Die Feinde von Andor (The Foes of Andor) are a set of seven new print-and-play figures for use in your own legends, released as part of Andor's 5th anniversary celebration and fan-legend contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
