							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flush!</name>
									
			<description>A crisis has occurred in the most unlikely of places: the bathroom!! So gear up and get ready to capture the ugly creatures that have invaded the bathroom form underneath the toilet. Flush is a fast paced game where players race against the clock to get all their creatures into the toilet before it flushes and they get wet. Now you can play with the toilet water!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player starts the game by lifting the toilet lid, this will start the game and creatures will start popping out so you can capture them. Once the toilet starts to spin, scattering creatures everywhere, all players compete at the same time by attempting to capture the creatures of their headband color with the magnetic plunger--no hands allowed! Once you have shown your skill by capturing one of the creatures with the plunger attached to your headband you need to send the creature back into the toilet. Remove the creature from the plunger(now you can use your hands) and use the Flipper located on the game base that matches your headband color to flip the creature into the toilet. You need to work fast to get as many of your creatures into the toilet before the toilet flushes and sprays water into your face. Be brave and keep competing to capture the most creatures you can during the last 30 seconds of the game while the water is spraying. When the toilet stops spinning the game is over (approx. 3 minutes). This is the most fun you will ever have with a toilet. The player with the most of their colored creatures in the toilet will be the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game base&lt;br/&gt;Water basin insert&lt;br/&gt;Smiling toilet timer&lt;br/&gt;4 2-piece magnetic headband plungers&lt;br/&gt;24 magnetic &amp;quot;little creatures&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
