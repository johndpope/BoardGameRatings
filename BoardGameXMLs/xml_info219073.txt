							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Theosopher Stone</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estimated time to complete - 5 to 6hrs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Theosophers lived in an age long passed. They worshipped the essence of the life-giving sun whose nurturing spirit they called the Quintessence. Their idyllic ideologies were opposed by a cult of dark brethren whose members prostrated themselves before a mysterious deity known as Quino, the lunatic eye. Quino whose cyclops glow illuminated the night and the souls of those who worshipped him with the secrets of madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player group know little of the history of these ancients and their violent struggles. But they have a map, marked with a cross... and they have knowledge of a treasure trove abandoned and forgotten. Can they find the lost temple of the Theosophers and the wealth of a vanished people, or are some secrets best left undisturbed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
