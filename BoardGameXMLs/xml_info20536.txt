							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbarossa 25: Command Decision Series Game</name>
									
			<description>Barbarossa 25 is a scaled version of the Command Decision Series. This module recreates the initial attack of Germany on the Russian front. The scale is 1/25 of the attack with the maps set up to take advantage of the great expanse of the Russian campaign. The Command Decision rule set is required, yet the book modifies some key factors in playing this game. As an operational level game, Finland and Romania OOB are included with the obligatory Russian and German OOB. Also Weapons charts, scenario and notes are included. Other rule sets can be used for these battles that somewhat start as a board game to create the miniature battle locations for the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
