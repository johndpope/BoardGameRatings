			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;'Roller Derby takes on all the excitement of the real sport. Each manager has a team forming a &amp;quot;Pack&amp;quot;. This team has four players and one &amp;quot;Jammer&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players on a team wear the same colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board contains a unique mechanism that causes the skaters to move side to side in a realistic way. Once the board has started to rotate, the action becomes hectic, with each player trying to get his &amp;quot;Jammer&amp;quot; through the &amp;quot;Pack&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Jammer&amp;quot; is a single man with a magnet in the colored base. This man is controlled by a &amp;quot;Jammer Stick&amp;quot; of the same color. The &amp;quot;Jammer Stick&amp;quot; is held under the skating surface and engages the same color &amp;quot;Jammer&amp;quot; above. By skilfully using the &amp;quot;Jammer Stick&amp;quot;, that player can be guided through the moving &amp;quot;Pack&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Jammer Stick&amp;quot; will not control the opponent's color &amp;quot;Jammer&amp;quot;.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object is to be the first to guide the &amp;quot;Jammer&amp;quot; through the &amp;quot;Pack&amp;quot; to score the most points.&lt;br/&gt;1. 25 points or more in one game&lt;br/&gt;2. A match of five games (each consisting of 25 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
