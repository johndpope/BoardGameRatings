			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The cult movie phenomenon batters its way into your home in the most relentless arcade/adventure game of all time! From the nightmare world of the future to the mean streets of Los Angeles, The Terminator takes you right to the very edge...then pushes you over! Play urban commando Kyle Reese and pit your speed, skill and cunning against the most perfect killing machine ever devised. Or take a trip through the dark side and become The Terminator, a ruthless cyborg juggernaut bent on destroying mankind's last hope. It's your choice. One thing is certain...the fate of all humanity rides upon your next move!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Terminator was an open-world DOS game from 1991. Players could choose to play as Kyle Reese or the terminator in this game. As the terminator, players must find and kill Sarah Conner. As Reese, the player must kill the terminator before it kills Sarah Conner. The game allowed players to go at their own pace, and to decide how best to proceed. Guns could be bought (or stolen) as well as cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
