			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONJURE INK is a Game-Master-Only supplement to The Rogue Mage RPG by Spike Y Jones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leviticus 19:28 &amp;quot;Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tattoos are forbidden within orthodox society, and branding is a form of punishment, not adornment. None of the Most High's seraphs, nor any of the kylen of the Realms of Light, sport tattoos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So why have the bodies of so many Dark mortals killed in recent skirmishes been decorated with tattoos? And why are there more of them on Dark mages than on Dark mules or humans?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it just another example of Dark mortals spitting in the face of the Most High and the orthodoxy? Or have the Dragons found another edge in the conflict with the forces of Light?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game-Master-only Conjure Ink PDF contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Provides rules for conjure tattoos, including their creation, use, and risks&amp;mdash;especially risks (but the pain-wracked death of a few Dark mages is sometimes the price that must be paid for progress).&lt;br/&gt;    Includes a new conjure posing yet another threat to the stalemate between the forces of Darkness and Light.&lt;br/&gt;    Features a fully-statted Dark mage NPC illustrating the use of conjure tattoos and giving a Rogue Mage Game Master a ready-made evil plot to involve his players in.&lt;br/&gt;    Features &amp;quot;Pan-Elemental,&amp;quot; a new Faith Hunter short story, revealing a new threat to Thorn St. Croix and the New Orleans Enclave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
