							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tenochtitlan</name>
									
			<description>It is the late 15th century. In the central valley of Mexico stands the great city of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the mighty Aztec Empire. You are an ambitious citizen traveling through the city doing great deeds to achieve social advancement. Tenochtitlan is a Euro-style dice drafting game for 1 or 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features four upgradable characters, each with different special powers. Five out of six double-sided location cards are selected at the beginning of each game to create a modular board (384 possible configurations). Players travel clockwise around the board, collecting different goods (represented by dice), delivering goods and making sacrifices at temples. Careful planning and interrupting your opponent's plans are the keys to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenochtitlan was created for the 2018 9-Card Nanogame Print and Play Design Contest on Board Game Geek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
