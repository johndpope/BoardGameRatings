			<description>Carrier Air Wing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carrier Air Wing, released in Japan as U.S. Navy (ユー・エス・ネイビー, Yū Esu Neibī?), is a 1990 side scrolling shooting game released for the CP System arcade hardware by Capcom. It is the spiritual sequel to U.N. Squadron, released during the previous year. As with the original, players chose any one of three different jet fighters and battle their way through ten enemy-packed stages. Another idea carried over from U.N. Squadron is the shop, which allows players to buy weapon and shield upgrades for their jet fighter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;PlotThe 1990s was a decade of great change marked by growing friendships between old enemies and never before seen levels of co-operation between powerful nations of the world. However, in 1997, using new weapons designed in secrecy, the Middle Eastern country of Rabu threatened to destroy this fragile peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F/A-18 Hornet - The most balanced aircraft available. It can handle air-to-air and air-to-ground sorties.&lt;br/&gt;F-14 Tomcat - Dedicated air-to-air fighter. Not as capable in air-to-ground combat but it is a formidable fighter.&lt;br/&gt;A-6 Intruder - Principle ground attack aircraft. It is not well suited for air-to-air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Carrier Air Wing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
