			<description>Experience the legendary leather industry of Ubrique. Play as one of the main leather manufacturing companies and grow from a simple workshop to a leading factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins the game by selecting one of Ubrique's most famous factories. All players begin as modest workshops with a limited workforce. At the start of each turn, two 'market' cards are placed on the board. You may find either an 'order' or an 'event'. Events happen automatically and you will have to follow the instructions on them. As for orders, you may pick one out and begin manufacturing for top international fashion brands. On order cards you'll find how many handbags and wallets need to be made and how much you'll be getting paid when delivered. The bigger the order, the more workforce you'll need. The solution is hiring external workshops. But be careful! There's only a limited amount of workshops in Ubrique, so make sure they're not manufacturing for other players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, in order to manufacture handbags and wallets you'll be purchasing real leather tokens! The more packages you buy, the lower the cost. It's up to you to decide how much you're willing to invest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given your limited starting funds and factory size, it's always a good idea to start off with small orders. As the game goes on you'll be able to expand your factory and increase your workforce, requiring less external workshops to complete small orders and making it possible to pick up bigger orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced rules, players may negotiate with each other, trade leather, and share orders - just like in real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'El Rey de la Piel' is an educational game that faithfully reflects the leather goods industry, where victory depends mostly on business strategy than luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to expand your factory to the highest level and become the leading factory in Ubrique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
