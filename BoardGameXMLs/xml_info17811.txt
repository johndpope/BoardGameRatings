							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strawberry Shortcake Card Game Pick-A-Basket</name>
									
			<description>Strawberry Shortcake is having a housewarming party. She'd love to receive fruit baskets as her surprise housewarming present. How many can you collect for her? Match as many Fruit Basket cards as you can. The one with the most Fruit Basket cards at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a matching game with a twist. Players place all their matches face up in one pile in front of them. If you can match a card to the card on top of their Fruit Basket pile, you can steal ALL their matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
