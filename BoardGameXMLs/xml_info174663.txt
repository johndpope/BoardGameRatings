			<description>King Triton has lost his magic trident.  He sets out to search for it with Sebastian, Ariel and Flounder.  They find a sunken ship at the bottom of the sea, and divide into two teams.  Which team will find the trident and end up with the most objects?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Disney's Giant Board Game Book, The Little Mermaid is a roll-and-move game where players must move along a track, collecting objects along the way as they try to reach the end of the track and find King Triton's trident.  Players choose to play as either Ariel and Flounder or Triton and Sebastian, and press the &amp;quot;electronic die&amp;quot; to move along separate tracks which merge at the end.  As they progress, they may land on spaces that move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  Some spaces are also marked with objects to collect (designated by taking a marker).  The player who finishes with the most objects collected wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
