							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Futility</name>
									
			<description>Developed as an educational (or perhaps a tongue-in-cheek)game by Midland Insurance Co. in 1984, Futility is a game of buying and selling insurance.  Each player, or &amp;quot;Risk Manager&amp;quot;,  starts out with $3,000,000.  Movement around the game board, via rolling of the die, allows for the opportunity to buy and sell insurance (certificate of insurance cards).  There are also spaces where an &amp;quot;occurance&amp;quot; ...umm, occurs.  At that time you take an &amp;quot;occurance card&amp;quot; whereupon one of your insureds has made a claim.  Hopefully you bought the right insurance and the &amp;quot;occurance card&amp;quot; does not affect you, otherwise you'll end up paying some of your (ahem) hard earned cash.  Play continues around an endless loop (similar to Monopoly, say).  Risk Managers decide at what point they choose to withdraw from the game, as the rules explain: &amp;quot;when frustration level or boredom so indicates.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
