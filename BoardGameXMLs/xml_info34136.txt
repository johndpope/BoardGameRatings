			<description>Content:&lt;br/&gt;31 character cards: the x,y,z,q are out&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player draws himself 10 cards for his hand.&lt;br/&gt;Now he has 90 sec of time to build words with his characters. A word must have at least 3 characters. &lt;br/&gt;For a new second word he has to use the last character of his former word.&lt;br/&gt;The not used characters of the first old word can be taken in the hand again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When time is over, the active player gets as many points as characters are in his words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
