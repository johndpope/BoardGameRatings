							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pubcrawler: The Pub-themed Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Pubcrawler is a virtual Oxford pub tour in the form of a card game.  It takes players on a virtual Pubcrawl through historic Oxford, scoring points by sampling drinks in some of the city&amp;rsquo;s most iconic pubs.  All this without leaving home or having a drink - unless they&amp;rsquo;d like to, of course! The game also includes quirky and interesting Pub Trivia about each pub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of cards in the game: Pub Cards, Drink Cards, and Action Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pub Cards showcase a selection of Oxford&amp;rsquo;s finest pubs.  They are colour-coded by region on the Pubcrawler Oxford Map, and range in value from 20 to 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drink Cards comprise Beer, Wine, and Cocktail cards.  They are also colour-coded to match the regions where they are served as Local Drinks.  Generally you can only play colour-matching Local Drinks on pubs of each region.  However, there are also multi-coloured Guest Drinks which you can play on pubs of any region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action Cards add extra fun to the Pubcrawl but can be unpredictable!  There are three types of Action Cards:  Bonus, Bother, and Between cards.  Bonus cards help you score extra points, Bother cards cause problems for other players, and Between cards take effect between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn by turn each player builds up their own virtual Pubcrawl by playing Pub Cards and Drink Cards, while trying to slow down other players&amp;rsquo; progress. Through the Action Cards you can also earn bonuses through events like Happy Hours and Quiz Nights - but watch out for dangers like Punting Mishaps or Dodgy Kebabs which could end your night on a bad note!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can bank their points by Calling the Crawl after visiting three pubs, or double their score by visiting at least four pubs.  The player with the most points at the end of the final Pubcrawl wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
