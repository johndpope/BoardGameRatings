							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die wilden Fussballkerle: 1, 2, 3 Rrraaaa</name>
									
			<description>This is a card game based on the German children's book &amp;quot;Die wilden Fussballkerle&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two teams are facing each other on the pitch, symbolized by the two player pawns placed on the table. Each player simultaneously reveals a card that shows the goalkeeper or a striker of either team and a number representing the strength of that player. If the sum of the cards for one of the strikers exceeds the sum of the cards for the opposing goalkeeper the striker has scored and players now quickly need to grab the player pawn in the correct color. The fastest player receives a victory point chip. If you grab the wrong pawn you lose two chips instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the match the player with the most chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
