							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myrmidon (2005)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Myrmidon is a peculiar and very complex roleplaying game that combines &amp;quot;no generation&amp;quot; characters, stylized hand gestures that convey meaning, and a central card game that drives the narrative action and resolves conflict.  The game was published in a series of forum posts as a competition entry.  Access to the rules is complicated because numerous posts revise rules from previous posts, and no &amp;quot;final&amp;quot; version of the game was offered.  Also, several references were made to offsite card files (the cards containing information needed for play) that are no longer available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card game itself - the core of the roleplaying game - is quite complex and involves numerous special types of cards, each with their own rules for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
