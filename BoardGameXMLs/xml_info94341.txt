			<description>Think! is a children's memory game from the 1970s.  The game comprises a 'master' board with 72 different images upon it, a corresponding set of 72 picture cards and a set of pegs.  Each image on the playing board has a peg hole next to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each round two images are eliminated by shuffling the picture cards and placing two of them face down over the matching images on the board.  Players then place pegs into the board in whichever spaces they like to mark images.  Everyone has 10 seconds to memorise which images have been marked before the board is  covered up by the box lid.  The picture cards are then turned over one at a time to players in turn.  If a player thinks the image on the card was marked on the board, they take the card.  At the end, players get a point for each correctly taken card and lose a point for each wrongly taken card.  The winner is the one with most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: &amp;quot;The Memory Game That Really Makes You Think!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
