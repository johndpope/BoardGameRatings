			<description>The players take charge of teams of 3 animals, travelling through the African savannah. To win you must take risks -  by challenging crocodiles; by having extensive knowledge of animals; and by having a bit of luck. On the starting line, the lion already roars already impatiently, the buffalo plows his hooves in to the ground and all the other animals are in the starting blocks. Are you ready for the greatest race of the year?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
