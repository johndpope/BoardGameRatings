			<description>This is a game about mathematics. Each round the active players throws 14 6-sides dice marked with numbers between 1 and 15. The goal is then to use these numbers in 4 mathematical calculations using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. A timer is used to determine time allowed. All numbers in the used dice will added together and all unused dice is then subtracted to produce the score. Each players plays a number of rounds, but the actual winning conditions isn't specified in the rules, this must be agreed upon in advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need to be fairly good at counting to be successful in this game. For that reason it usually isn't fun for kids under 10 or so, even if the rules are very simple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
