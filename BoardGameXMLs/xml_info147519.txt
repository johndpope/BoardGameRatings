							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pumpkin Patch</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A small patch of land, used for agricultural purposes, among many others. This one is used exclusively to grow pumpkins. It seems this was a wise choice as well, as the pumpkins seem to be doing quite well. In neat rows large pumpkins have sprung up and grown to an impressive size, the pride and joy of the farmer. Some of them are large enough to make sure the farmer wins a prize or two at the next harvest festival. Never mind that selling them for the occasion will earn him a tidy profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Around the pumpkins on their raised beds the grass grows equally well in the shade of the pumpkin's sprawling leaves. A small number of scarecrows as well as the devoted work of the farmer have so far kept all pests at bay. Hopefully this will not change in the few days remaining until the pumpkins are to be harvested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
