							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The California Raisins Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the land of sunshine, palm trees and yep, you guessed it, those oh so cool California Raisins.  Raisins are coming to Hollywood from all over California to be singing and dancing stars.  In fact 'conga' lines of raisins can be seen all over the city.  But which raisins will hit the 'big time'?  It's all timing in Hollywood.  Be the first player to get your quartet on center stage and your four raisins will be the 'stars' of the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;according the the Making of The California Raisins Board Game, three artists spent more than three months to design, create and perfect the three-dimensional sculpted clay model that was photographed to make the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
