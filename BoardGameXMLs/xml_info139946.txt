			<description>Dibdib is a party game for 3-6 players.  This game includes two cloth bags, round wooden discs and cardboard heart markers.  Each player takes two heart markers.  The wooden discs are put into one of the bags and the other bag is left empty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player reaches into the bag with the discs and grabs any number of discs and places them into the second bag.  The first player then offers both bags to one of the other players.  The second player then has a choice.  Either take both bags or take only the second bag.  If the second player takes both bags, that player will repeat the steps that the first player took.  If the second player takes only the second bag, then the contents of both bags are revealed.  The first player counts the discs in the first bag and the second player counts the discs in the second bag.  The person with the most discs wins.  The loser flips one of his heart markers to the broken-hearted side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This process is repeated until a player has turned both of his heart tokens to the broken-hearted side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
