			<description>Have you get used to the basic players? Their variants will raise new challenges: a better shooting guard and center, that will force you to watch the perimeter even more; a faster forward and center, that will reach the basket more easily; a shooting guard, that will create more pass lines...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion contains 5 new players, in Red and Blue, to improve some or all of those already in BASKETmind. There are no new rules to learn, since they benefit from abilities that were already in the game, although in other player types. The expansion rulebook suggests two playing modes to introduce them, &amp;quot;Better Teams&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Draft Game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
