			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inzeladun is the Dungeons and Dragons world of Vincent N. Darlage, created in 1981.  Welcome to a world of gods and demons, of warriors and their women, of villians and sorcerers, of ghosts and vampires, and of warlords and dragons.  This is a world that never was, but should have been.  This world is painted in brighter colors and on a grander scale than the one in which we live.  The heroes of this world may not be the sort of persons we would invite to a polite party, but they're not exactly the type we would soon forget if they showed up anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;Inzeladun is a campaign world and setting for D20 3rd Edition, supporting Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.  The product is presented as a series of HTML pages with these notable major divisions:  Classes, Disadvantages, Dragons, Feats, Gods, History, Legends, Lore, Magic, Maps, Monsters, Players, Prestige Classes, Races, Realms, Relics and Magic Items, Religions, Skills Spells, Villains, Weapons, and more.  The setting has been in development since ca. 1981 and was hosted at several different sites during the 2001-2004 period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
