			<description>Hop la Puce is played with several colored discs, that are scattered across the playing area. Also in the playing area are two target rings. Players take turns launching a disc, in Tiddledy Winks fashion, trying to make them land inside a target ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has three assignment cards that he tries to fulfill. Each card shows one, two or three discs inside a ring. If a ring contains the right configuration of discs, the assignment has been completed. The first player to complete all three of his assignments wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
