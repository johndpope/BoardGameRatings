			<description>About&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue?9876543210 is an artsy, philosophical, action game for IOS devices, MAC, PC, &amp;amp; LINUX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue? was inspired by existential road trips into nowhere, Peruvian jungle drugs, and a brush with death while lost in the mountains of New Mexico. It is a quest for wonder, contemplation, and peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concept&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a dead, failed video game character wandering through the recesses of the Random Access Memory, trying to find peace in the final moments of your existence before being deleted forever...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens to dead video game characters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the garbage dump of the Random Access Memory, you travel from town to town, meeting people who offer you their lightning and their prayer. Lightning clears the way for you to move forward and prayer builds shelters in a distant town where you must frequently hide to avoid being deleted into nothingness by the garbage collector. Along the way, you are thrust into many battle challenges, the outcome of which affects your shelters. There is ultimately, no way to escape the garbage collector, but running from it buys you time to think, wander, contemplate, and hopefully be at peace with the inevitability of your deletion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game randomly assigns you 1 of the 6 characters and 6 of the 11 areas. There is no set order to the stages of the game.e final moments of your existence before being deleted forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
