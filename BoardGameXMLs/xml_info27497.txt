							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Teen-Time Game</name>
									
			<description>A self-described &amp;quot;game for pre-teen and teen age girls and boys,&amp;quot; this game is all about inter-personal relationships. Boys and girls start at the same point on the board and advance using a spinner to determine the number of spaces to move. Depending upon the square on which you land, you may gain points, lose points, receive other information (&amp;quot;Boy meets girl&amp;quot;) or instructions (&amp;quot;Advance to mall&amp;quot;). Some squares instruct you to draw a bonus card, which will also give or take away points, grant another turn or deny your next turn, you may even draw the &amp;quot;Engaged&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At two different points on the board, the girls' path and the boys' path diverge. Girls, may then land on a square that says, for instance, &amp;quot;Break heel dancing. Lose 1 turn.&amp;quot; Boys can suffer no such fate, but can only gain points, lose points, meet girl, break up, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner is the first player to reach a pre-determined number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
