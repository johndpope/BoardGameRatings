							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Futurama</name>
									
			<description>Futurama is based on the science fiction cartoon series Futurama using cel-shading technology. Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance games were planned for release, though they were cancelled due to a belief that their popularity was short-lived. Due to this, it was released on the Nintendo GameCube in Europe, although no physical proof of this has ever been found. The cutscenes of the game are presented as an entire &amp;quot;lost episode&amp;quot; of Futurama on the DVD of The Beast with a Billion Backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is a mix of action and platforming. As the game progresses, players play as each of four characters: Fry, Bender, Leela and Zoidberg. Fry's levels mostly involve shooter mechanics, possibly based on the Ratchet and Clank series, as he can use a multitude of guns. Bender's levels are platformer-oriented, based on the Crash Bandicoot series, while Leela's revolve around hand to hand combat. Zoidberg features in a short segment that plays similarly to the warthog levels from Crash Bandicoot. There are several Nibblers hidden in each level; collecting them unlocks extras such as movie clips and galleries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with Professor Farnsworth, wearing a sombrero, selling the Planet Express delivery company to Mom, explaining that it had been losing money for years due to mismanagement. The buyout gives Mom ownership of more than fifty percent of Earth, allowing her to become the supreme ruler of Earth. Soon after this, she enslaves humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Fry, Leela, Bender, and Farnsworth repair the inexplicably broken ship, they escape from Earth with the Professor's new invention, The Re-animator (which closely resembles a giant toaster), which brings the crew back to life every time they die. However, Mom pursues them in an effort to capture Farnsworth. She hopes to turn Earth into a giant warship, and Farnsworth is the only person who knows how to build an engine large enough to move the Earth. She ultimately captures Farnsworth, places his head in a jar, and sends the ship hurtling into the Sun with Fry, Leela, and Bender on board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After discovering that the Sun is habitable, they help the Sun People, then head for the planet of Bogad, where Farnsworth&amp;rsquo;s mentor, Adoy, lives. Adoy has invented a time machine, which he uses to send Fry, Leela and Bender back to a few minutes before Mom buys Planet Express from the Professor. However, the ship crashes into Planet Express, destroying the ship. This prompts them to steal the ship of the past, leaving the broken ship to be repaired by their past selves. They attempt to stop the sale, which prompts Mom to send Destructor to attack them. They defeat the robot, but the Re-animator gets damaged and falls on Destructor, causing it to fall on top of them. Angry at the fact that the robot killed his crew, the professor refuses to sell Planet Express. But after Mom bribes him with a sombrero, he sells, and the events of the game continue in an endless cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Futurama (game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
