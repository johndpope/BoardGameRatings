			<description>Grand Tour USA is the game for travel lovers. Players answer questions using their cards representing states, but no need to be a know-it-all to win. The two types of questions, speed and knowledge, make the game fun and accessible. Correct answers let players advance from state to state and pass the other players to win playing pieces and victory points. The player with the most points at the end wins the game. In this travel-enticing game, discover the states and customs of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
