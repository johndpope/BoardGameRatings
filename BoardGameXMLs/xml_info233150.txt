							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TradeWorlds: Privateer Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This features as primary mechanic a &amp;quot;Push-Your-Luck&amp;quot; mechanic in a &amp;quot;Race&amp;quot;-type scenario.  Players will be racing against each other to be the first player to complete the objective the fastest.  During the game, players will take risks in collecting credits while avoiding &amp;quot;losing it all&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is compatible with game's core and all of the scenarios.  However it is incompatible with the Tactical Core. Both expansions add a certain depth to the game which alter the way the game is played.  Because of the contrasting winning conditions, these two expansions cannot be played simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
