			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 60 x 60 inch, full color battlemap of a Hidden Village, the scale is around 15ft per inch .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning, This is a Large map, it is 5ft x 5ft and due to the high quality is a large pdf and VTT file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Allies will see nothing but rocks below when they fly above this village of huts. We should have nothing to fear hidden in this plateau until we are ready to defend this location from their ground and air assaults.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Village is a single exterior large-scale map of a village of huts hidden in a plateau in the mountains. To further hide the village, the huts have been dyed grey to appear as simple rock outcroppings when viewed from above. The scale of the map is 15-20 feet per inch/hex/square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Village is intended for use in primordial, fantasy, historical, and modern games. This map could also be useful as a village on a primitive world in a science fiction game. Whether the war is fought with sticks and stones, swords and plowshares, rifles and bombers, or AK-47s and helicopters, this is sure to be a battlefield useful across many time periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese have been fortifying the hidden village on a plateau of an island, preparing for an Allied attack as they leapfrog towards Japan. The island is in a strategic position that the Japanese believe must be taken by the Americans in order to reach the Japanese mainland. The village appears normal during the day, with plain-clothed Japanese soldiers pretending to be villagers and running inside the huts in case of the spotting of an Allied plane. The Japanese are moving up material to the village at night, positioning flak cannons and machine gun nests in caves and even in the houses themselves. When the defenses are ready, it will be a death trap for American planes and any infantry trying to take the plateau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this scenario, one player plays the Japanese defenders and one player plays the American attackers. The Japanese have access to mostly defensive weapons such as machine guns and flak guns. The flak guns can be turned towards the ground to act as anti-tank guns but the Japanese commanders believe the plateau to be unreachable by tanks and other heavily tracked vehicles. The Japanese have access to a field engineer that can create a cave at any mountainous location on the battlefield to make a machine gun nest in an important position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Americans have access to plenty of offensive weapons such as B17 flying fortress bombers and paratroopers. They should also have an American engineer crew that has created a tunnel into the plateau with explosives. The American commander chooses where this is deployed and is his main route for infantry into this scenario besides paratroops. The Japanese win by successfully defending against the American offensive whereas the Americans win by wiping out the Japanese defenses and taking the plateau. Double the point value for any type of ground vehicle in this scenario as it takes a ton of resources to get it up the plateau for either side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
