							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Innocent</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A child&amp;rsquo;s laughter when she wins a game with her parents honestly for the first time, the joy of tearing into brightly wrapped packages at Christmas, a moment of helpless laughter, without care or reservation. The Innocent is empowered by all these things; an Innocent gains their power from joy itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innocents are instinctive mages; their power doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from study and rote memorization of arcane formula; instead it comes in a rush of inspiration as they play, as they teach children, and as they craft amazing toys that are almost alive. Some Innocents claim they learned their secrets from some long forgotten fey race, from changelings and elves hidden just behind mortal eyes; others believe themselves to be half kitsune. All Innocents share a heritage; they are all the children or students of supernatural tricksters and mischievous craftsmen. The Innocent injects anime-inspired levity, innocence and a childlike sense of fun into your D20 Modern Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this PDF are the rules needed to use The Innocent in your game, including a host of new abilities and 55 new Meta-Magic feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
