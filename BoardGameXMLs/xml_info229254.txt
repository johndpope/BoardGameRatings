			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck comprising six card types: Shogun, Terrain, Samurai, Ashigaru, Strategy, Special. Cards have a force value between 1 and 10 and may also have an associated battle action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 7 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.   Preparations Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Each player fills their hand to 8 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.   Strategy Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Each player may discard up to 3 cards and draw replacements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   Tactics Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Starting with the Shogun and going clockwise, each player may in turn play (discard) 1 card. The type of card discarded will determine what effect is produced:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.   Battle Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Players take turns playing 1 card each face up to the table in front of their owner. Some cards have battle actions as described in the card list (player extra card, destroy target card etc.). When played in this phase, the battle action immediately takes effect. This continues until all players have played all cards they possibly can. A player may have a max of 1 of each card type in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.   Victory Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Each player adds up the force values of all his cards in play. The highest score wins and gains a Victory Token. All played cards are discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.   Shogun Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     The winner of the turn becomes the Shogun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7.   End Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Players may discard up to 1 card from their hand if they have any cards in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to amass 5 Victory Tokens (VT) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
