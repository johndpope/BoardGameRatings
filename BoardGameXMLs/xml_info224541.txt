			<description>Relativity is a light abstract game with unique movement mechanics. The only random element occurs during setup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take the roles of time and space and move numbered coins to try to complete tetrominoes (tetris piece shapes) while blocking the opponent from doing the same. After one round the coins are reshuffled and the players swap roles and play again. The winner is the player who completes the most tetrominos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
