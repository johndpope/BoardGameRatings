			<description>3-4 Players expansion to &amp;quot;EinStein würfelt nicht!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are as in the 2 players version of &amp;quot;EinStein würfelt nicht!&amp;quot;, with some modifications:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is 6&amp;times;6 square fields large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls 6 playing pieces i.e. stones with the numbers 1 to 6 marked on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stones of each players are set up in the six fields of one corner of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his turn a player rolls a die; if he still has the stone with the number corresponding to the rolled value on the board he must move this stone. If the corresponding stone was already removed from play (see below) the player may choose to either move the stone with the next higher or the next lower number available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his move a player may move the stone one field horicontally, vertically or diagonally towards the diagonally opposite corner. It is not allowed to move backwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player ends his move on a field occupied by another stone, be it one of the team partner, opponent or one of his own stones, then this stone is removed from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 4 players version, the two opposite players build a team each. The team that first occupies the diagonally opposite corner field with a playing piece wins. A team loses if one of the players has no more playing pieces left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 3 players version, the player surrounded by two other players plays a solo against the two other players. If the solist reaches the diagonally opposite corner field, he/she wins. The two opponents win if they beat all solist's playing pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4-player version on DevilPlay  (called &amp;quot;EinStein w&amp;uuml;rfelt nicht - Quattro&amp;quot; there)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
