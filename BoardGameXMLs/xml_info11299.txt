			<description>A German trivia game for law students and lawyers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 2,500 questions and cases from the areas of civil, criminal and public law on 1,000 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;Before the game, players agree on a number of chips to be collected. The first player to collect that number of chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Players move their tokens on a course on the board and, according to which type of space they land on, have to answer trivia questions or argue a case. In the cases, players have to take on different roles - sometimes, they have to act as a defender, sometimes as a prosecutor or judge.&lt;br/&gt;The course also contains event and risk spaces and others that challenge the players' memory. A player who successfully answers a question or completes a task earns a chip.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has collected a previously agreed upon number of chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
