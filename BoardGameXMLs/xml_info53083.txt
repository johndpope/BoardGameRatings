			<description>Subtitle: The Post Apocalypse, High-Tech, Fantasy, Western Role Playing Game &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Centuries humanity lived by trusting myth and legend, but the promise of Gods and heroes fell upon deaf ears during trying times. Slowly all turned from the mystical to the analytical. Science became the new belief system. Some struggled to merge it with the mysticism of religion, of what couldn&amp;rsquo;t always be explained. But they were too few and it was the driving force of technology that took them back. Back to an age of cowboys, high noon duels, saloons, and magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Helix: The Post Apocalypse, High-Tech, Fantasy, Western Role Playing Game, you take the Role of one of the denizens of the Wastelands. There are Cyber Mystics, those who see and wield the secrets of the Code that makes the world. Code Slingers are magic casting programmers, grafted to small CompDecks that change the world. Bullets fly fast and furiously around Gun Jacks and Gun Jills, cybernectically enhanced gun arsenals. And never, ever underestimate the Average Joe or Plain Jane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Waste is a terrible place to live. The Umbrea Corporation owned City-States abuse you. The terrain and its creatures abuse you. Your fellow denizens abuse you. Survival is war. It is you versus the Waste. You versus the Umbrea Coportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question is&amp;hellip; What are you gonna do about it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
