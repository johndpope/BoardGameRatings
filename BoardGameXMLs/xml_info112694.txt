							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hockey Blast Pro Hockey Game</name>
									
			<description>HOCKEY BLAST is an &amp;quot;old-school&amp;quot; card-chart-and-dice simulation of pro hockey. Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.  It was introduced by PLAAY Games in April of 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game differs significantly from similarly-themed hockey games in a number of ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, it re-creates hockey action totally differently than existing games like APBA and Strat-O-Matic.  Rather than re-creating a hockey game pass-by-pass and shot-by-shot, HOCKEY BLAST re-creates the action minute-by-minute.  The game charts crystallize each minute's action, and a unique &amp;quot;lull&amp;quot; mechanism allows the gamer to fast-forward past uneventful minutes.  The result is a hockey game that plays quickly, yet captures all the nuances and excitement of real hockey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, HOCKEY BLAST realistically incorporates momentum and fights into the game play. In HOCKEY BLAST, a team plays better when it has momentum.  It can gain momentum in a number of ways--by landing a big hit, scoring a goal, making a spectacular save, or having one of its players win a fight. In other hockey games, fights can occur, but have no real effect on the game other than to send participants to the penalty box.  In HOCKEY BLAST, the classic hockey &amp;quot;enforcer&amp;quot; persona has a real role, just as in real hockey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another way HOCKEY BLAST is different is that it provides fans with instructions on how to rate their own players and teams.  The company encourages this, and even posts user-created card sets for free download on its website, &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.plaay.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.plaay.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a two-piece labeled box with a game book that contains all the necessary charts, a hockey rink game board, a set of strategy cards, dice, markers for momentum and penalties, an instructions booklet, scoresheets, and two sample teams.  Full player card sets based on historical pro hockey seasons are available, along with a fictional player card series that is updated annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
