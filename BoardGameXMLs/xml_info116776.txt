							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Moon: Hera Campaign</name>
									
			<description>Savage Moon: The Hera Campaign, named with reference to the Aegophagus: the goat eating aspect of the Greek goddess.  This huge gathering of Imoons, the Hera  Cluster, drifted into human space a few months ago.  Preliminary intelligence suggests that it consists of 20 Imoons populated by a rich variety of Insectocyte forms, some of which we have encountered before and some of which are new.  The human military forces have advanced too with new technologies being available for the Hera Campaign.  Pride of  place goes to the Sniper Tower - a deadly new combat tower that seeks prey that poses the biggest threat within range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
