							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Tight Rope</name>
									
			<description>Game probably inspired by the feats of Charles Blondin, the man who walked across the Niagara Falls on a tightrope. Did you know that he was crossing the Falls and at halfway he stopped and cooked and ate an omelette?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is to be played with dice. Throw the dice, each player in turn, until one of the dice is a 1, at which time place a button on No. 1 space, and throw again for a 2. Should neither of the dice be a 2 or the sum of the two dice when added be 2, move down one space, and the next takes a turn. Always endeavor to throw the next number to the one you are on, and move down one space for each throw that you miss. When the party throwing is below the top numbers, and succeeds in throwing the number thrown for, he places his button on the number near the rope. When any doublets are thrown, it is a move to the top and next number. Continue on until you gain No. 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
