			<description>ZinZig is a wine-themed trivia game designed to both test knowledge and educate players. It requires the addition of two or three bottles of wine for gameplay purposes. Players take turns to roll and move on spaces around the circular board, receiving a wine-related trivia question each turn. A successfully answered question is rewarded with one of the four resources (barrel, grape, bottle, and cork). Some spaces allow for special actions along with the trivia question (including swapping, trading, or stealing resources). A player who has collected all four resources may enter the center of the board, &amp;quot;production,&amp;quot; no longer rolling to move but instead progressing through four final stages (crushing, fermenting, aging, and bottling). The first player to complete the production stages is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
