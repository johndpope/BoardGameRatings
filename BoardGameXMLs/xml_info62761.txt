							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scandal in Stringwater</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You open your bleary eyes to a dingy gaol cell containing a bucket, a lumpy bunk and your own sorry self. Manacles on your ankles and wrists are linked by a single hefty chain with a heavy padlock in the middle. There is no window, and the only light comes from a corridor lantern beyond the bars that make up one of the cell's walls. There is a notice attached to the bars, and you gently lift yourself to read it: Welcome to the Stringwater Humane Institute to Help Offenders Learn Excellence. We hope you will enjoy your stay. Please be aware that you have been charged with a crime. You will be offered the services of a defense advocate. The Stringwater Miscreants Charter aims to try all cases within two (2) days. Please use the time before your trial to reflect carefully upon your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability: Characters no higher than Level 4, and magic cannot be used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
