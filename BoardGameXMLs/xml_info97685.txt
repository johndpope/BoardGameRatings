			<description>200 years ago, the world of Cosmo was shocked by the appearance of a gigantic continent off Shores, south of the Ocean Sea. The Shores native embarked on the conquest of this continent to exploit its resources, including the &amp;quot;Loom&amp;quot;, and trace routes of exploration.&lt;br/&gt; To this end they created guilds, companies specialized in adventurous war, politics, knowledge and &amp;quot;loom&amp;quot;, led by the Guild Masters .&lt;br/&gt;Today, competition is raging on the continent and guilds vie for profit from lands unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player is a master of Guild. The goal is to double his personal treasure of 10 Guilders (game currency), that is to say, come to possess 20 Guilders in his personal treasure.&lt;br/&gt;There are 6 houses, so there are 6 types of different basic games (one per house), each player choosing one of the houses to play.&lt;br/&gt;Early in the game, each player has 15 guilders: 10 in his personal treasure and 5 in the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several types of cards:&lt;br/&gt;1. Territories (Land and premises)&lt;br/&gt;These maps provide resources: The Loom (magic), War, Politics and Knowledge. Each card provides 1 or 2 resources, each being either red or green, or white (neutral). Resources are used to bring into play other cards.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Auguries&lt;br/&gt;These are cards that are played at the beginning of the round (during the Winter phase) They have an effect that extends to all Guild Masters. These are external events.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Machinations which include:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Troops: armies belonging to various houses.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Creatures: the troops who live on the Continent.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Actions: they have off effects in the game&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Reactions: they can be played anytime.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; The Locus: magical places situated on the Continent.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Constructions: linked to Territories.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Equipment: benefit the troops and creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round :&lt;br/&gt; It is divided into four phases: winter, spring, summer and autumn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winter: passive phase where one put in place guidelines for the round of play&lt;br/&gt; Spring: territories, settlement construction.&lt;br/&gt; Summer: is the phase during which the fighting takes place.&lt;br/&gt; Autumn: crop production, collapse and discovery phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
