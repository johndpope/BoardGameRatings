							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ESP: The Game of Perceptive Skill</name>
									
			<description>Since telepathy works best among people who know each other, bring together three of your friends to test your perceptive skills and powers of concentration against theirs.  During the game you will acquire points by employing your extrasensory abilities to successfully determine the numbers being thought of by the other players.  This sum will be the number of spaces the player moves on the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
