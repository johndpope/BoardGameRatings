			<description>AYM (as it is abbreviated) is a tactical boardgame where players take the role of a mech pilot.  Players custom design their mechs by use of a series of transparency overlays, giving them a final visual representation of the mech they designed.  Players' mechs then enter a map via dropship, where they will need to complete the objectives of that scenario.  These scenarios include search and destroy, retrieve resources, etc.  At the end of each scenario, players gain money and experience in which they can upgrade their mechs in preparation for future scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AYM is played as a tactical board game with some basic RPG elements.  Mechs are represented by game pieces on a physical grid map of the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
