							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ironrod: The Search for the Tree of Life</name>
									
			<description>Ironrod: The Search for the Tree of Life is an LDS game based on Lehi's vision of the tree of life in 1 Nephi 8 (from the Book of Mormon). The board features a weaving path that goes through the Iron Rod, the Mists of Darkness, the Great and Spacious Building, and the River of Filthy Water. Players draw colored cards that determine what square s/he will go to next. Some special cards allow you to skip ahead, go to a certain part of the board, or force you to go backwards on the path. The winner is the first player to reach the tree of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher: Around 600 BC there lived a prophet named Lehi. Lehi dreamed about a straight and narrow path that led to the Tree of Life. In the center of the path was the Ironrod. By clinging to the Ironrod and pressing forward, one could reach the Tree of Life. Along the path, one must be very careful not to slip away and get trapped in the Mist of Darkness, the River of Water, or the Great and Spacious Building. The consequence for slipping away would cause a prolonged arrival to the Tree of Life. In order to win the game, one must reach Lehi and the Tree of Life by taking the shortest path. The surest way to reach the Tree of Life first is to stay on the path and follow the Ironrod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
