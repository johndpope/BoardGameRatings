			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The firsts are born in bursts, and the best of the rest are obsessed.&amp;quot; This is how I defined that illusive state, the 'open' or 'perfect' game, in 1976. Since perfection is all but impossible to achieve, I decided to design all-inclusive or 'peri-' games, Jigsol' is the first of the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to play with more versatility and challenge than any other word game, Jigsol' is ideal for any player who can spell 24 words or more. For those who are curious, a Jigsol is a 'jigsaw solution'. Jigsol is a legal word when playing this game.&lt;br/&gt;-E.M.W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 25 letters printed on hexagons, the timer is started and each player tries to form an interlocking word puzzle. When the time is up each player calculates his points. When all 25 letters are used a player receives a delta mark on the score sheet (small triangle) and 25 points. The game ends when someone gets 5 or more deltas, or at 200, 500 or more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
