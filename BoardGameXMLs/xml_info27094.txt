			<description>Cliff Hanger was one of Airfix's &amp;quot;Carry Case&amp;quot; games, intended to be portable fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players place protruding pegs through a wall set between them, and then hang their men from the pegs, so they cannot see each others pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They then take turns to remove a peg, hoping to dislodge their opponent's men, while retaining theirs.  The player with the most men still hanging when there is only one peg remaining wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
