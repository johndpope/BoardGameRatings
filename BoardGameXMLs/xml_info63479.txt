			<description>from the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;You've been through more in the last few weeks than most normal folks go through in a lifetime. From stolen artifacts to sythetic chemicals, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Chinatown, from firefights to fireworks: you've seen it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well...you thought you had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A boy-genius has been reported missing, and clues are few. On top of this, the gang wars are still blazing, and the Imperial Dawn is about to break. But, there are those UFO's in Central Park...and that problem in Coney Island to deal with...and naturaly, you're the only ones for the job!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NIGHT LIFE is playable as a stand-alone adventure, or as the final part of the GANG WARS trilogy. Alternate starting points are provided for characters who have not gone through the first two sections of this storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
