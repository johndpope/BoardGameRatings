							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Atomic Race</name>
									
			<description>Atomic Race is played on a 5x5 board. Each player starts with ten pieces occupying the two rows closest to them. A move consists of taking a single piece or the top piece from an &amp;quot;atom&amp;quot; (stack) and moving it in any combination of forwards and sideways moves until it reaches an empty space or a space with an opponent's piece visible (moving through spaces where the player's own color is visible).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central row of the board (the &amp;quot;plasma zone&amp;quot;) cannot contain atoms, so a single piece there controls its space until it moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to exit one's pieces off the opposing end of the board. Since the game is short, the designer suggests playing a series of games using a scoring system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the March/April 1979 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
