			<description>You are one of the first members in a U.S. company that has made its way to Japan, and you are now trying to recruit new people to join you in this great opportunity with &amp;quot;Miracle Forever Japan&amp;quot;. Can you become the richest player?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In マルチの頂点 (Pyramid Scheme), you start the game with a hand of numbered cards and choose one of them to represent the founding member in the pyramid of business supporters that you hope to build. On subsequent turns, you'll add new members to your pyramid, but the card played in the level below an existing member must have a lower number if placed on the left and a higher number if placed on the right. Some members provide special bonuses and actions, but sometimes you might need to leave a member face down to represent a prospect who didn't work out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends, players score points for the members of their pyramids; the more levels you build, the more valuable those members who support everyone above them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
