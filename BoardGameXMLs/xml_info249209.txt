			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Myork is a military superpower.  But it isn&amp;rsquo;t just because they have a lot of soldiers.  They have money and that means they have some of the best equipment in the world.  And who has the best of the best equipment?  The noble knights!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to dive into the deep end of the noble knights.  Yes, they have the best armor.  Yes, they have the best war horses.  Sure we talk about all that.  But we also get into the role-playing and the game mechanics of where their money comes from and what they need to do to keep it flowing.  Every other adventurer out there is only getting money from loot and maybe a reward or two, but handling a noble character and their money matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s all about money?  Of course not!  There are several knightly organizations, as well as the typical setting and news worthy points to make the whole things come together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 18 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 41 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
