							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Races of Gallian: The Dremund</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small of size, big of heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dremund are a race of humanoid rodents. Standing at 3 and a half feet tall, dremund look up at a world much larger than they are. But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t scare them; they instead see a challenge to which they can rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dremund integrate themselves into other cultures as merchants, using their wiles to make their business enterprises significant and indispensable factors in the local economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dremund youngsters are expected to fulfil a five-year apprentice period known as the Becoming. A young dremund that fails to enter into an apprenticeship, or who seeks more adventure in their life, may instead seek their fortune away from the community. Th eirs is an Absent Becoming. On the first day of their tenth year, the dremund youth ventures out into the world to gain life experiences and find their own path. The morning&amp;rsquo;s leaving ceremony is somber, as befitting an occasion that will separate the dremund from their family for at least five years, and from which many never return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Dremund Race.&lt;br/&gt;    Dremund NPC statblocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
