			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginner Baubles are rare, one-of-a-kind objects that are either magical in nature or else exceptional in some other way. The rules governing their acquisition and use are a little bit different to those that relate to Magic Items, but the two function similarly enough that anyone who's played 5th Edition should feel at home with their use right away. What makes them super fun and interesting is that unlike magic items, which are generally kept under lock and key until the players have chalked up hours and hours at the table (and their characters trudged through a litany of tasks and trials), Beginner Baubles instead serve as an exciting new facet of character creation and are usually provided before the players hit the table with their characters for the very first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Beginner Baubles, every adventurer is blessed with a powerful gift at the start of their career. A boon worthy of the brave deeds and legendary feats of the hallowed heroes of yesteryear, in whose footsteps they will walk as they embark on their own grand adventure. Though their story is not yet written, the call to adventure is strong, and all true heroes must heed it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And Tools of the Trade?&lt;br/&gt;Tools of the Trade is the latest entry in the Beginner Baubles line. Released monthly, each new issue in the series is packed to bursting with weird and wonderful prizes just waiting to be greedily devoured by the gluttons at your table. In addition to the baubles themselves, each supplement also includes fully-playtested new rules and mechanics, outstanding presentation and production values, a torrent of premium-quality artwork, and extra materials designed to help you get the most out of the series. Additionally, Beginner Baubles are completely setting-neutral, ready to be dropped into almost any fantasy world that allows for magic items and objects. Best of all, adopting a completely modular approach, each entry in the series can be used as a standalone supplement or in conjunction with any others that you acquire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginner Baubles: Tools of the Trade presents 20 nefarious and depraved baubles sure to appeal to those unscrupulous individuals whose moral compass never points to true north. Charlatans, criminals, felons, fraudsters, pirates, rogues; and anyone else with a chaotic, neutral, or evil alignment will find something very much to their liking here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tools of the Trade includes the following baubles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Final Sting. The terrible tools of an assassin, this set of deadly concealed claws introduces a new weapon type to 5th Edition, Bagh Nakh.&lt;br/&gt;    Sovereignty. This angel-winged cutlass once belonged to a missionary-turned-pirate, and his unusual persona has left its mark on the blade.&lt;br/&gt;    Playt. This suit of illusory armor can allow any rakish rogue to pass themselves off as a hulking paladin or heavily-armored fighter.&lt;br/&gt;    Crayona-in-hand. This magical crayon is used by murderers and miscreants to convey secret messages and ward locations against the incursion of prying eyes.&lt;br/&gt;    Zanziver's Piece. Able to make even a veteran magician jealous, this magical coin can be used to perform a wide array of tricks and feats.&lt;br/&gt;    Fawlty. Intended to ensnare and entrap those foolish enough to write in it, this peculiar guest book can be used to acquire dark and embarrassing secrets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
