			<description>OBJECT:&lt;br/&gt;Have the highest total score after five rounds of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OVERVIEW:&lt;br/&gt;In BID SIX, each round of play begins with one player rolling a set of six white dice and arranging them in a row in the middle of the table.  All players then use their own deck of 30 cards (28 bidding cards and 2 blocking cards) to win as many of the six dice as possible by placing one card next to each die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highest bidding card for each die wins that die and its points, unless someone plays a blocking card for that die.  A blocking card blocks ALL players from winning the die, including the person who played the blocking card. Used cards must be discarded at the end of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player wins a &amp;ldquo;TRIPLE&amp;rdquo; (a group of any 3 dice) in a single round of play, they get to roll 1, 2, or 3 of the black dice for additional bonus points, depending on the numbers on the three dice in their TRIPLE.  Roll 1 bonus die for a BASIC TRIPLE (any three numbers), 2 dice for a STRAIGHT TRIPLE (numbers in sequence), and 3 dice for a THREE-OF-A-KIND TRIPLE (all the same number).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player or team with the highest score after all five rounds of play (when all cards have been used) wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
