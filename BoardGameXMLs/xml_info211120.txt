							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Universal World Profile</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Universal World Profile provides advice and resources for a referee wanting to flesh out the bones of a Universal World Profile (UWP). Turn a random string of numbers into a memorable and exciting scenario setting. The need to interpret the UWP data and fill in the blanks, has no doubt dissuaded many Traveller referees from creating their own subsectors for their own roleplaying universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here then is a step by step handbook to world creation in Cepheus Engine and other Classic SF RPGs. Don't expect a technical treatise on planetary physics, though. You won't be dealing with albedo values, Bode's Law or complex square root calculations to determine the length of the world's orbital period. This book comes at world generation from another angle - from the perspective of plot. The aim of the book is to assist the referee in creating believable descriptions of his worlds, useful for referees who are putting together a scenario, and for players who want to get their heads around the world quickly, so that they can make informed decisions in-game. There is no set worksheet that must be slavishly filled in by the world creator because every planet will be unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Follow the creation of three very different worlds through the book.&lt;br/&gt;    Build unique worlds, inspired by their UWP characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;    In depth sections discuss Size, Atmosphere, Tech Level etc.&lt;br/&gt;    Dozens of comparisons with real and fictional planets from literature and movies.&lt;br/&gt;    Step by step process, allowing the referee to see the method in action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
