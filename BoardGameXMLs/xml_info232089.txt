			<description>This is a fast, fun and addictive card game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Goal: you need to discard all your cards as soon as possible. Loses the one who has the cards on hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Setup: Shuffle your deck thoroughly and deal three face-down cards in a row to each player. Then deal the same number of cards face up to cover each card that is laying face-down. Now you have six cards before each player: three face-down and three face-up covering them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t pick that cards up until you shed all the cards from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal each player three cards one more time, that will be player's hands. Place the deck of cards on the table within reach of every player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: the starting player is the one who attended a party recently, closer to the day of the game then other players. Then players are taking turns clockwise. The player lays any card on the table (to start a pick up pile) and then draws card from the deck so they have at least three cards in their hand (unless the deck has run out of cards or they already have three or more cards in their hand). The next player must lay a card equal to or higher in value than the one at the top of the pick up pile. For example: the first player lays 5, the next player can lay 5, or 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. On top of 10 player can lay 10 or 0 (the Poop) or any of the special cards. If a player has no card to cover the the previous card, they must pick up the pick-up pile (put it in their hand) and end their turn, and the next player starts a new round with any card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player can lay some cards of the same value in one turn. If a player is able to complete a set in turn (like four-of-a-kind 8*8*8*8) they can do so clearing (burning) and removing the entire pile from play. The player who clears may play another card after.&lt;br/&gt;Special cards (could be placed over any other card):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MegaPug - when played, clears the pick up pile instantly. The player who plays it starts the next round with any card, game is played to increase (the next card may have same or higher value)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BreakDancer - changes the rules from increase to decrease (so the next card may have same or lower value). When played the second time, rules changes back from decrease to increase, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poop (0) - resets the game. The next player can lay a card of any value from 0 to 10, game is played to increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Ending: when the deck runs out, you must play all cards from your hand. When there&amp;rsquo;s no cards in your hand, you have to play those cards that are laying the face-up in front of you, one by one. Then you play your &amp;ldquo;Blind&amp;rdquo; cards, that are laying face-down, one by one - no peeking!&lt;br/&gt;If you have no suitable card - take the pick-up pile in your hand and only when you shed them all you can return to play your cards on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have discarded all your cards - congratulations! You banished all your Pug-party animals! So you can chill out watching yours less lucky playmates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pug Party is an entertaining game designed for players from 6 years old. Duration: 10-30 minutes. Simple rules, a dynamic game process, illustrations of a talented artist of Ukraine &amp;ndash; this is the formula for the success of the game Pug Party. The first edition of the game was sold out for six months. Because everyone loves funny parties and everyone loves pugs: children, youth and adults are just delighted with these funny little animals. We take an incendiary party, add cute pugs, and get the most explosive and cutest Ukrainian game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
