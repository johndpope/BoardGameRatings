			<description>This is a gin-rummy-type word card game, whose object is to be the first to clear your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck has 54 cards, two of each letter and two wild cards.  Players are dealt 9 cards each for 2, 3 or 4 players, 8 each for 5, and 7 each for 6.  In a turn, a player draws one card from the draw or discard pile, lays down a word or adds to an existing word, and discards one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to go out gets one point per card in everyone else's hands; if the draw pile runs out the hand ends and the player with fewest cards wins the points.  The game is won at 25 points.  If a players spells &amp;quot;zest&amp;quot; without wild cards, he gets 25 points and wins immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
