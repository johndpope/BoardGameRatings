			<description>G.I. Joe is a 1991 run and gun game published by Taxan for the Nintendo Entertainment System based on the toyline of the same name. The game was produced by Ken Lobb and developed by the same Japanese team that later formed KID. It was followed by a single sequel titled G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor released the following year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of a team of three G.I. Joe characters, each with their own specialty. The player's goal is to navigate through six stages (with several areas each) on a mission to finally bring down Cobra. The initial character roster consists of Duke, Snake-Eyes, Blizzard, Captain Grid-Iron, and Rock 'n Roll. A sixth character, Hawk, gives orders to the team between missions, and becomes available as a playable character for the final stage.  Each level had a character that was pre-determined to lead the team, meaning that one character in the given area would be chosen by default, and the player would then select the two other operatives to complete their team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;G.I. Joe (NES)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
