			<description>Every player takes one box with square plates and one roll with rings of the same color. The 1st player places a square plate vertically into any slit of the board. Then the 2nd player places one into any slit he likes and so on. If there is a square with 3 walls the player whose turn it is to play, must shut it by placing the 4th wall. If the square which he has shut, has no number, the next player continues to play. Otherwise the same player has another turn. In shutting one square the respective player puts one of his rings into it. The squares without number count 1, those with a number count as many points as are indicated by the number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all squares are shut, the points are counted and the player who has the most, is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
