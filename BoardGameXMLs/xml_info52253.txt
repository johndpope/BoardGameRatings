			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a roleplaying standpoint, pirates are a wonderful addition to our games.  They are fierce, self-reliant chatracters with a crew of men willing to do their bidding, a ship to call their home that grants them the ultimate mobility to travel as they wish and a licence to do as they please lest someone do it to them first.  With pirates come the brotherhood and code of the sea, a form of unwritten law that creates a grand backdrop for adventures of buccaneering and bounty-chasing.  Hoist the main sails and batten down the hatches; there's glory to be had, me mates!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The is the ninth book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
