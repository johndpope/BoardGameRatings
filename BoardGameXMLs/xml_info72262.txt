			<description>Baseball Heroes is a two player baseball card game, designed by Luke Morris, that captures the psychological battle between pitcher and batter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three teams with 36 unique players line up to hit eachother out of the park! The pitching player and batting player try to psych-out eachother into striking out or throwing a bad pitch to be hammered away for a home run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baseball Heroes is a light game but includes rules for outfield and infield fielding, dropped catches, bunts, base stealing, double plays, errors, runs, balls, strikes, bullpens and more. Each batter has his strengths and weaknesses and each pitcher has his list of balls he can pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baseball Heroes is also available with full Japanese rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
