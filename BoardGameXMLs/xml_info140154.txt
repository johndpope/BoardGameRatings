							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wilderness Hexplore Revised</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;These tables describe how to run an improvised wilderness hex crawl. The idea is that the even the GM does not know what the players will encounter, since the map, features, and encounters are all rolled randomly at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Notes:&lt;br/&gt;This is a document created in support of my gaming group, and is not intended for sale. It is definitely a work in progress, and so use at your own risk. The philosophy of randomized tables like these, is that the GM is also playing a game, one that requires skill and creativity. Creating a narrative out of random results on the fly is what separates the good from the great. But as always, if the dice and tables result in something that is too boring or too brutal for your players, then use your power &amp;amp; creativity as the GM keep things fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
