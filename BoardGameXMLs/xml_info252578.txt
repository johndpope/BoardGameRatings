							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Get With The Program</name>
									
			<description>Humankind is on the verge of discovering artificial intelligence, why not outsource it to robots? Even better, let them program each other, just don't let them know how they have been programmed. Use deduction to find your teammates. Use deception to fool the opposing team. Be the first team to discover each other and activate the program!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Get with the Program, five to eight robots (players) win by finding other robots with matching code. At the start of the game every robot knows the team of the robot to their right but not themselves. They will also have partial information about three other robots. Each round robots will either trade, give, or take information they have secretly. They will use this information to deduce how they have been programmed and who is on their team. Information can be gathered faster with table talk but it can't always be trusted. When you believe the majority of your team can identify each other, end game can be triggered. You select a teammate and that teammate will select someone or end the program prematurely to eliminate you. If you are not all on the same team one player is eliminated. If you and your team chose correctly you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
