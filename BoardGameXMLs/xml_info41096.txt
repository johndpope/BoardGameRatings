			<description>A trick-taking game based on winning electoral votes. There is a card for each state, with the value of their electoral vote total (as in 1976); they are split into two suits so the votes are split evenly.  (The cards also have common info about each state: capitol, population, area, state bird/tree/flower, etc.)  There is also a card for D.C., and 3 cards for territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are dealt, players bid the number of votes they think they can win, winner declares trump suit, and trick-taking play commences, the vote for the cards acting as their rank.  The DC card is wild and captures its trick automatically; the territory cards void the tricks they are played on.  The declarer adds or subtracts their bid depending on if they won.  Winner is the first one to make 270 total votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
