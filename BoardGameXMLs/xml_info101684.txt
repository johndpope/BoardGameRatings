							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Ranchers</name>
									
			<description>Dragon Ranchers is a card game in which players build a dragon using cards that feature the dragon's attack and defense capabilities as well as other statistics. There are several rules governing traits the dragon can possess, such as no more than 10 attack or defense cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players each have a hand of five cards which they use to build the dragon. At the start of each turn, they will roll an activation die and can only use cards with a value equal to or less than that number. As the players build their dragons, cards that have been placed on the table are playable but only those with a value less than the activation number are active.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Dragon Ranchers allows players to build a dragon deck made up of various cards. When both players have constructed a deck, they then battle each other, using attacks and defensive moves as they try to defeat their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
