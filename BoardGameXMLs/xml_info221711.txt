							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lair of Ostanzibal Yent</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ostanzibal Yent is a dark elf mage so twisted and insane that he was too much even for the other dark elves. He makes his lair in a dungeon specifically designed to keep him entertained by the antics of the fools who come looking for him. If his nefarious reputation isn't enough, Yent has made it known that whatever can be stolen from his lair can be freely kept. Finally, he is not above kidnapping people to lure would-be rescuers into his web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
