			<description>A One-Round Living City Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The days since the end of the war have been busy and extremely tiring. Again yesterday you worked throughout the day with many others making the city safe, or rebuilding a destroyed area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surprisingly when you awake, you are no longer in Ravens Bluff, or at least you are almost positive that this is not Ravens Bluff. You are floating in complete darkness only the voices of other confused adventurers as company. Feeling about you seem to have only that equipment that you went to bed with. With a little experimentation it is quickly determined that none of your magical items or spells seem to be  unctioning. You can not determine if it is because of the darkness or because what feels like your continue light stone is just a normal stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You float for what seems like days, getting to meet and hear the others in similar straits. Although you have grown nether hungry or thirsty you all long to leave this emptiness, this darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
