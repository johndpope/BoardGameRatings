			<description>Vanguard V is an all-new Virtual Reality action game that takes the best aspects of flight and adventure, and throws you deep into the experience as only Virtual Reality can. Driven by music, story, and innovative VR design, Vanguard V is a celebration of gameplay to welcome Virtual Reality to the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as Qu, who has tracked the parasite menace from worlds afar and with the help of her A.I. companion, BiT, is fighting to save the planet&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants from utter annihilation. Fly in low orbit while re-entering the atmosphere, skim the waters of the ocean, dive into the tunnel from the initial impact and make your way to the center of the planet to exterminate the source of the parasite infestation. Lock on with your VR targeting system and blast through the alien threat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
