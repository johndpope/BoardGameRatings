							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Greenhouse Emissions Reduction Role-Play Exercise</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the science is so clear, why is it so difficult to make agreements that will reduce our impact on climate change? This exercise is designed to help students explore that important question in an active and engaging way. Students are cast into the roles of various important players in the climate change issue, including politicians, scientists, environmentalists, and industry representatives. Working in these roles, students must take a position, debate with others, and then vote on legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
