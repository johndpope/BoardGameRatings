							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MiniSkull Caverns</name>
									
			<description>In MiniSkull Caverns, 1-3 heroes will compete to explore the caverns beneath the ruins of MiniSkull Castle and return with riches beyond their wildest dreams.  You are one of those optimistic explorers.  Are you prepared to risk your life for diamonds the size of a wild boar?  Along the way you will encounter monsters, battle other heroes, and recover some priceless gems.  Be careful though, the more noise you make, the more you will attract the deadly denizens of MiniSkull Caverns.  Before you can escape with your spoils you must battle the affectionately, though unsuitably, named Tiny.  Dragons don&amp;rsquo;t like it when you try to burgle their baubles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: The object of MiniSkull Caverns is to guide your hero through the maze of caverns, managing your strength, and battling monsters  and other heroes, all while searching for priceless Gems.  Once you have acquired two of these Gems you must return to the center space on the map and battle Tiny in order to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 Player Variant: When playing with two players you must defeat Tiny and escape with three gems instead of two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solo Variant: Collect all four gems and escape before time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics: The mechanics use a combination of action selection using a rotating action card and player selection control card, similar to what is in Empire Engine, along with straight up dice combat against monsters and PvP dice combat with strategic modifiers the players &lt;br/&gt;choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
