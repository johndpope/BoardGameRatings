							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darkwater Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Battlemap of a Water Treatment Plant, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play and a 360 degree view from the center of the plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The water is bubbling. Interesting&amp;hellip;.AAAHHH!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare to visit Darkwater Station where murky, polluted waters are reclaimed for use by civilization?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkwater Station is a single external map of an industrial plant with a canal basin of dark water spanned by two bridges and surrounded by three buildings, a garage, and industrial equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkwater Station is intended for use in modern and near future science fiction games. It could be used in a far future science fiction game on a more backwater planet. The dark water canal has a potential use in Horror games as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkwater Station can be used in myriad ways. It could be used as a hydroelectric dam, a desalination plant, or a water filtration plant as some examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Came From the Dark Water: The water kept getting murkier and cloudier every day. HydroDamics couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less as long as the dam kept working and the power stayed on so they could fleece their customers for every watt they used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually the pollutants got so bad that it clogged the dam up. The two monitoring and relay stations of the facility put out an emergency message to the main corporation HQ for urgent help fixing the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon the failed dam started affecting the grid, causing a massive power outage. Every second the water was stalled, HydroDamics was losing money and customer trust in their grid. HydroDamics decided to send in a team of the best scientists and engineers they could to figure out the problem and fix it. But when they got to the facility they found the checkpoint outside unguarded and the facility covered in a black ichor as the pumps failed and the water slowly flooded the plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They entered the facility. The engineers got the pumps working again. Their scientist saw bubbles in the canal. He got closer to the water to investigate the phenomena. Then the dark water erupted, snagging the scientist, and pulling him into the dark depths. The dark water surged towards the engineers at the pumps and enveloped them next. The last communication HydroDamics had with the team was a desperate cellphone call for help from the last surviving engineer before his cellphone went dead with a scream of terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HydroDamics has assembled a new team of eggheads and this time they have sent in mercenaries to guard them. Will this new team figure out what is going on or meet the same fate as the first team? Everyone going in knows that there is someone or something lurking in the dark water...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
