							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wiraqocha: Scrolls of Quezacoatl</name>
									
			<description>Wiraqocha: Scrolls of Quezacoatl is a mini-expansion for Wiraqocha consisting of four scrolls. During set-up, place the scrolls with the artifacts on the four temples. (Each scroll bears the color of a temple.) When an explorer conquers a temple, he can take the scroll with the artifact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later in the game, a player can use a scroll as a die with the value indicated on the scroll &amp;mdash; but only for conquest; a scroll cannot be placed in defense on a tile. When a player uses a scroll, it returns to its matching temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If during phase 1, a player has an explorer on a temple where a scroll appears, he can take it. If the explorer leaves the temple for any reason, the player keeps the scroll until he uses it. A scroll can be stolen in a base camp as an artifact or a somnium crystal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
