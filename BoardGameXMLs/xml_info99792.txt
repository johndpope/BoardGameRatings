			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lair of the Goblin King is the first in a series of adventures that takes the characters from the beginnings of their career to eventual heroes.  It is also the first in the unique series of products that includes both an OSRIC compatible version and a version for the Altus Adventum 2nd edition game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Adventure is designed for 4-6 1st level characters who find themselves broke and stranded in the city of Piarth.  Just about out of food and ready to give up on an adventuring career, they hear word of a reward for anyone who can find out what is attacking caravans to the border towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
