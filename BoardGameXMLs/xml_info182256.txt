							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nazi Spies over London</name>
									
			<description>This is a set of rules with scenario instructions and background material to create a story set in London during WW2. Players take on the role of characters involved in a net of wartime espionage, and attempt to fulfill specific goals assigned  to their characters by the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the premises of the situation, players discuss possible ways to advanced the story. Next, players use the Matrix system created by Chris Engle to establish how likely certain proposed developments in the plot are to occur, and roll dice to determine how the story will progress. Discussion after discussion and roll after roll, an overall narration emerges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific victory conditions exist based on the mission that is being played, but as in many storytelling games what matters the most is to work as a team towards the creation of a rich and satisfying narrative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
