							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gargoyles Stone Warriors Battle Card Game</name>
									
			<description>In this card game, based on the animated TV show, players try to collect a complete set of 6 Gargoyles - Lexington, Brooklyn, Broadway, Bronx, Hudson, and Goliath. You are dealt 3 cards and start your turn by drawing enough cards to bring your hand to 4. You may then play Gargoyle cards to the table in front of you to start your set. Finally, you can attack other players with villain cards trying to take Gargoyle cards you need from them. Demona and Xanatos cards steal cards automatically. Lesser Villains must use battle cards (with a rock-paper-scissors outcome) to win a Gargoyle. Sunrise/Sundown cards turn an opponent's gargoyle to stone and prevent it from counting towards a set. The first player to complete a set of the 6 different Gargoyles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
