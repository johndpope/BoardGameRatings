			<description>Described as &amp;quot;the Game of Intrigue, Passion and Treachery&amp;quot;, Hierarchy is played on a triangular board with players starting at the bottom right before progressing in a snake towards the top of the &amp;quot;pyramid&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turns, players roll two dice to determine the colour (subject) and the difficulty of the next question.  Get the question right and the player gets another turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions can be on: Economics &amp;amp; Politics, Initials &amp;amp; Abbreviations, Professions, Advertising, Media &amp;amp; People, and Companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the option to challenge other players on the same  level as themselves - of which there are five - and the loser goes down a level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the box are six stacks of cards containing questions and answers, graded by difficulty, a triangular board that folds into a hexagon, a hexagonal player aid with the subjects and their matching colours printed on it, and a velveteen bag containing 6 tetrahedron playing pieces and two dice - one with coloured spots on it to match the subject colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
