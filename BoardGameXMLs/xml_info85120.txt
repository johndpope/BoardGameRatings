			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Spoiler is a bullet hell game for the PC. The game is a sequel to Shoot the Bullet, and plays similarly, requiring the player to take photos of various bosses while avoiding being shot. Players cannot shoot at their enemies, but use their camera to clear the screen of bullets and score points. The value of the photo is dependent on the danger the player is exposed to while taking it and the aesthetics of the image. Each stage provides the player with only one life, and they must take a certain number of pictures within a set amount of time without being killed. Double Spoiler allows the player to change the photo orientation from portrait to landscape if they want, which was not available in Shoot the Bullet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
