			<description>Officially licensed by the National Football League, All About Football is a trivia game consisting of a deck of 50 cards with 5 questions per card, 1 question each from 5 different categories.  Once a player correctly answers a question from the first category, they get that card and advance to the second category.  After collecting 5 cards (one for each category), a player must answer a question from whatever category the opponent chooses in order to win.  There are multiple decks available, each centering on a different team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
