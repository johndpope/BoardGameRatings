							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon, Fly</name>
									
			<description>From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragon, Fly&lt;br/&gt;Your village is much like the one down in the valley and another beyond the forest. A road passes through, and visitors take their rest in return for stories heard during their travels. The stories you hear fill you with dread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragonfly comes again, finally, after all these years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The villagers, especially the old ones, try to put a smiling face on the event, inevitable and awful though it will be. The dragon in the mountain will fly again. It will take what it wants from the villages, destroy everything in its wake, and&lt;br/&gt;murder bustling communities as they abandon their homes.&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the children who survive will dream of a better life.&lt;br/&gt;Or perhaps this time will be different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Note: This was a finalist in the Game Chef 2015 competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
