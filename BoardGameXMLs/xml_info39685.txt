			<description>All-time Baseball is a simulation in which participants select teams from 500 of the greatest Major League baseball players of all time (1871 through the present).  Then they play a single game, a series of games, or an entire schedule.  Each player is represented in the game by a card, with his performance based on his real-life statistics.  The stats used include batting, power, bunting, fielding, throwing, speed, pitching, and more.  Pitchers tire, and (in series or league play) must rest a certain number of days after pitching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How well would Ty Cobb have hit Roger Clemens?  Would Sandy Koufax have often struck out The Babe?  Could Lou Brock have stolen many bases against Ivan Rodriguez' powerful arm?  Would Brooks Robinson have robbed Tony Gwynn of many hits?  Play All-time Baseball with your friends and find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses the same overall system as Sports Illustrated Superstar Baseball!, from which it is derived, but with hundreds of added players and a host of other refinements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
