							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legends of Rakasa: Fordra</name>
									
			<description>Legends of Rakasa is a sandbox style (open gameplay structure) game  with hunting, crafting, battling, puzzle cracking, and more. The game box is magically packed full of endless adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends of Rakasa: Fordra introduces players to the world of Rakasa through Five Introductory Chapters. After players play through those first five chapters, players can go on to create their own unique adventures, or go to the Trivatch.com Forums page to check out game types others are creating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on tiles (some holding decks representing the Roads, the Ocean, and the Forest). While seeking to complete different objectives, players hunt across Rakasa by moving their player tokens to the different locations and battle creatures using their player equipment. Players use the parts of defeated creatures to upgrade their equipment. Though upgrading isn't ever the main objective in the Introductory Five Chapters, players are much more likely to succeed in their adventures with stronger equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with hunting, crafting, and battling using the cards in Rakasa, players perform different actions using Rakmin, a mini puzzle game included in Legends of Rakasa. Rakmin consist of small tiles and dice. The Rakmin puzzle system is used for actions such as tracking down something or unlocking items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five Chapter Story cards guide players through the introductory chapters of Rakasa. The events of these chapters play out over the space of roughly three days in Rakasa. Time passes, hour by hour each turn. Day turns to night and night to day as the events of the chapters unfold. Players may decide to work together cooperatively or work in competition with each other throughout all of the chapters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Introductory Five Chapters can be played as individual game instances (each consisting of 30 minutes to an hour of gameplay). The chapters can be played as a set of sequential events, with players progressing their equipment through the chapters. Players can also jump straight into a chapter without playing previous chapters by starting with general gear that matches the difficulty level of the game at that point in the Introductory Five Chapters. After playing through the standard chapters of Legends of Rakasa: Fordra, players will be ready to venture off and create legends of their own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
