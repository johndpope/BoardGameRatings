			<description>This puzzle puts brain versus brain in the spot light. All around the red sun! In this game, two players must face off with each other. Each gets two pegs to use. Players take turn moving a peg from one of the holes to the other. The first player to make it so the other cannot move loses and will not get the glory of the red sun! It is a think quick act quick game. The rules do not allow for time to think and strategize. You must be on your toes and always think one step ahead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
