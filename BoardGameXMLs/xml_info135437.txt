			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains a role-play scenario inspired by Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play out the main characters from the story, exploring the themes of lust &amp;amp; temptation, immigration &amp;amp; colonialism, sexuality and the role of women in Victorian culture, and in particular the theme of agency. The scenario explores agency &amp;mdash; in the sense of free will &amp;mdash; against a narrative that begins fixed and linear and becomes open and free as the characters struggle against the will of Dracula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario uses a wide range of meta-techniques and approaches that are explained inside. The book is complete within itself. The scenario is for 2-8 players, ideally 4-6 players and 1 Organiser. Typical play time is 4 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
