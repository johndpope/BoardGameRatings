			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narcissu -Side 2nd- is the prequel to the visual novel Narcissu, produced by Stage-nana. A preview version was sold at Comiket 70 for &amp;yen;200, and has since been released for free download. On May 15, 2007 the entire game was released and made available for download on stage-nana's website. The English version was released on March 31, 2010 by Agilis, after &amp;quot;close to 3 years of blood, sweat, and hard work.&amp;quot;  Like the Japanese version, this release contains both the prequel and the original. The translation was done in Proportional ONscripter, a fork of ONscripter and a clone of Nscripter, which supports English text as opposed to Nscripter which in turn, doesn't. Additionally, Side 2nd includes both games' soundtracks accessible from the menu of the game.The game has been released in English with both games included with the option of picking different translations (being from Agilis and Haeleth). The game is playable in either voiced or unvoiced with unvoiced being preferred by the creator. It has been expressed that there were inconsistencies within the original game such as Setsumi never mentioning Himeko but the original creator asks if the player could &amp;quot;think of that as her just not simply expressing it directly&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-game illustration were drawn by Goto-P except for an image by Yuuki Tsukasa and an image of Yuka by Kyalme. The staff of Cotton-soft also provided help with the design, system and sound editing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plot&lt;br/&gt;The game serves as a prequel to the first game, the plot revolves around Setsumi, the female main character from the original visual novel, and the people and circumstances that formed the character presented in the first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narcissu 2 is set about six or seven years before the events of the original Narcissu, while Setsumi was still just a regular outpatient living at home near the hospital. We meet Himeko, a former 7th floor helper at the hospital. Cheerful and full of energy, no one expected that she would one day be a patient in the same ward that she had spent so much time volunteering at. One summer day, while Setsumi was going to the hospital for an examination, Setsumi meets Himeko, and a long summer begins&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissu%3A_Side_2nd Narcissu: Side 2nd]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
