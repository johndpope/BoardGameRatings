							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Parlynne&#039;s Gem</name>
									
			<description>A Standard RPGA Network Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past week, each of you have met a female bard named Parlynne. And, for various reasons, each of you agreed to attend her performance at a local inn tonight. As you arrived, you were asked your name; and as you gave them, you were escorted to a table which was to the left of the stage, near the front of the room. You were introduced to each other, drinks and food were brought at no charge, and the house lights dimmed for Parlynne's performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
