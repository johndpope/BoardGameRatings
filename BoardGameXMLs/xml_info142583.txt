							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kill the Powerplay Hockey</name>
									
			<description>A statistical replay game, loosely based on TCS Games previous Olympic Ice Hockey game, High Sticking. &lt;br/&gt;You will find the usual features of TCS team games (rating for attack, defense, killer instinct for Overtime resolution, Third die random modifier), plus advanced rules that put in play even the powerplay opportunities and the penalty killing value of each team, to make each game a little more slower (but still very fast), but much more tense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It exists a basic version containing rulebook and data for all the WHA seasons (1972-1979) another set with the Early Leagues, from 1887 to 1926 (50 different seasons from manydifferent leagues, NHA, WCHL, PCHA, ECAHA, FAHL, CHA, and so on), a set with NHL from 1917 to 1942, and another set with NHL from 1942 to 1967.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
