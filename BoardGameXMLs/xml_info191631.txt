							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nerf Rebelle Disc Target Game</name>
									
			<description>The Nerf Rebelle Disc Target Game was released as a toy included in McDonald's Happy Meals.  It is part of the Nerf Rebelle line, designed to appeal primarily to girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has a two-sided board and can be played in two ways.  One side of the board is a combination of a dexterity game and tic-tac-toe.  The board is laid out on the floor or a table and players take turns throwing plastic discs, trying to land them in one of the spaces on the 3x3 grid.  Players may of course knock other players' discs off the board.  Like tic-tac-toe, the first player to get three discs in a row wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other side of the board is a target game.  Players take turns throwing their discs at the board, trying to land them in scoring circles.  Smaller circles have higher point values.  After each player has thrown all his or her discs, the highest total score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the rules are minimal (and conveyed only with pictures), player will have to create house rules to answer lots of questions, such as whether players may pick up and rethrow discs if no one get three in a row in the tic-tac-toe version and how much of a disc must be inside a scoring circle to score points in the target game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
