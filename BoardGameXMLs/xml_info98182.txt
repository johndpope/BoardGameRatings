							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unholy Greyl</name>
									
			<description>scenario introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Greyl wood is considered precious. Easy to shape, yet durable, it can be polished to an ebony  sheen, and when cut lengthwise displays a variegation of muted browns and reds. Nobility  especially prize the wood for furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, Greyl grows only in a coastal forest haunted by nocturnal horrors.  Surviving  loggers have spoken of yellow eyes winking in the night, and men found tied to trees by their  own entrails. Through trial and error, work crews have learned to harvest Greyl during the day,  then retreat to fortified galleys a short distance out to sea.  Whatever the creatures are who  stalk and slay under the dark boughs, they apparently cannot swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, conflicts with rival expeditions, cunningly erected traps, and the occasional nest of brown  adders make the already dangerous work deadly, and lumber crews are often shanghaied from  nearby towns to make up for casualties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PC&amp;rsquo;s can enter this adventure in several ways. They might be among the recently shanghaied,  forced to cut Greyl as virtual slaves, or more likely, hired out as mercenaries to guard the work- 2    crews. They might also wish to arrange an expedition to the Greyl woods themselves&amp;mdash;even a  modest harvest would make them wealthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they manage to survive, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
