							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Not Tonight Josephine Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for Not Tonight Josephine comes as a standard size box of trivia questions the same size as the base game, or the more well known boxes from Trivial Pursuit. As well as new questions new rules are included for how these different format questions are used in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time instead of questions from two random categories there are four colour coded cards each corresponding, each colour corresponding to a a quarter of the board. Each card has seven  questions corresponding to the categories from its section. Now you can choose to answer a non-multiple choice question from the topic directly for a chance to win a coin, or you can still treat it like the base game and draw a card with two random multiple choice questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Trouble and Quotations, the only categories that appear 4 times instead of once on the board, are treated the same as in the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Not Tonight Josephine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
