			<description>Since ancient times, the twinkling of the heavens inspired people across the globe to create stories that answered the most important of questions: &amp;quot;Who are we&amp;hellip; and how did it all begin?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open this box, and join the storytellers of old. Before There Were Stars... is a storytelling game in which each player tells the mythic creation story of &amp;quot;their people&amp;quot;. Inspired by constellation cards, players craft tales about the creation of the world, the origins of civilization, the rise of a great hero, and the end of days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This &amp;quot;feel-good&amp;quot; game lets you appreciate the boundless imagination in all of us and awards points for the best story moments &amp;mdash; allowing everyone to shine regardless of their skill as a storyteller. Playing this game is a breath of fresh air that never repeats itself, except in the fun and warmth of emotion it brings to your table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
