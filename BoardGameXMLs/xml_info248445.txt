			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cataclysmic event has changed the surface of the Earth, rendering it inhabitable. In an underground shelter, the last remnants of humanity hunker together, facing the inevitable. These people are the last of their kind, sealed behind a stuck blast door. When they are gone, they will take everything with them; their culture, their language, their ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These people are you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Last is a card-based roleplaying game. The players assume the personalities of the last people on earth, trying to live out their last moments before they die, taking humanity with them. The point of the game is not enjoyment or challenge, but reflection and empathy; how it would feel like to experience extinction at first hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as a ZIP archive include the DOC game rules, six .JPG files (print-and-play card images) and an ASCII creative commons license.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
