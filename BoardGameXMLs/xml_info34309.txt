			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to arrive at the Castle and claim victory!  The road to the castle is full of pitfalls... Beware of some of the characters you may meet along the way.  Luckily Shrek and his friends are there to lend a hand.  Sometimes Merlin's magic will help you, sometimes not... But never forget that the aim of the game is to HAVE FUN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the Game.&lt;br/&gt;___&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically a &amp;quot;move along the path&amp;quot; derivative with the addition of &amp;quot;Merlin's magic cards&amp;quot; which can have characters move forward or back along the board.  First one to 100 (by exact roll) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
