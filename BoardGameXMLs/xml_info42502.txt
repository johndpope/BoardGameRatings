							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tick Tack Word</name>
									
			<description>A word card game that uses a unique tic-tac-toe mechanism.  It has a game board, 54 letter cards, 2 rule cards, 5 blue chips and 5 red chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, deal 6 cards to each player and nine on the 3x3 grid.  In a turn, a player either: makes a word using 3 or more cards from the hand and one from the board, placing a chip of his color on the board card used and discarding the hand cards used; or simply discards as many cards as desired.  Then he draws back up to 6; if he used all his hand to make a word he draws 1 extra.  The first to get 3 chips in a row wins.  (It doesn't say anything about chips of both colors on the same card; presumably it's not allowed.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
