			<description>Brullende Sequenties is a children&amp;rsquo;s game in which they learn the meaning of the word &amp;ldquo;sequences&amp;rdquo; and become familiar with the terms &amp;ldquo;before&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; en &amp;ldquo;finally&amp;rdquo;. Players connect  jigsaw puzzle-shaped pieces with scenes from the movie Cars on it in order to complete a logical sequence. Adults can help the children by telling the accompanying stories which come with the game. The game provides 6 different sequences of 9 scenes each, which are combined if played with 2-6 players. On their turn players choose a piece from the table and check whether it can be connected with the previous/starting piece of their sequence or not. If so, they can keep the piece, otherwise they has to put it back on the table. The first player to finish his sequence wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
