			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Only Spellbook You'll Ever Need!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book, Advanced Arcana Volume II, the sequel to the most popular Necromancers of the Northwest product ever, has been long awaited, and not in vain. At over 100 pages, it not only contains over 100 new spells, but also contains alternate familiar options, alternate arcane bonds, and new rules covering the customization of spellbooks with exotic materials and inks, and a number of optional material components that can be used to enhance spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Advanced Arcana set a new standard for sourcebooks devoted to providing new spells for Pathfinder and 3.5 OGL games, by providing an overall theme into which the majority of the book's spells tied. In that book's case, the theme explored the question &amp;quot;what is the cost of a spell,&amp;quot; and included a number of spells that cost more or less than a single spell slot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Arcana Volume II continues in the proud tradition of its predecessor, though in this book the theme is not the cost of a spell, but rather an exploration of spells that can produce a variety of different effects. The popular segmented spell mechanic makes a return in the form of layered segmented spells and variable segmented spells, both new twists on the original mechanic. The book also contains modal spells (spells that can have two or more very different effects, chosen as the spell is cast), and conditional spells (spells that function differently depending on certain conditions). And, of course, a goodly number of general, all purpose spells that don't tie directly into any mechanic, but simply serve to provide support for fun and exciting concepts, and additional options for spellcasters of all sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
