							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Merv Griffin&#039;s Crosswords</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on a short-lived TV game-show. The object of the game is to fill in the blanks of an unknown word based on a clue. The difference from normal crosswords is that each player only gets one try to solve a word. If they get it right, they continue. If they get it wrong, it goes to the next player. Sometimes the opponent can &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; your word and answer before you. There are over 1000 puzzles (words) available. If you don't want to play the game like the TV show, you can also play it more like a traditional crossword. This game can be played either single-player or local/network multplayer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
