			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ego is a generic, universal rules system for any genre of roleplaying.  The game's final release was &amp;quot;Playtest Version 1.2&amp;quot; (28 April 2006) as a freely distributed PDF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Abilities and Skills with numeric scores purchased from a point pool.  Characters have four Abilities ranging up to 16 in score--Muscle, Agility, Intellect, Vitality.  Each Ability score maps to a particular number of dice which will be used as a dice pool when rolling for activities based on that Ability.  Characters also may have Advantages and/or Disadvantages.  Characters begin also with Karma Points which are used during play to influence outcomes.  Skills are resolved in the typical manner of rolling a dice pool against a target number.  Combat is handled as a Skill though there are several special maneuvers noted.  Magic and Psionics are defined in generic terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
