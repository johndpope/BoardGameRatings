			<description>From the promotional packaging inside of Zitadelle, viewable in Image 138790.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting and varied board game.  Like in the game Halma, players must get their pieces into an opposite field.  However, the way to get there is over a turntable that one is allowed to turn one quarter, so long as there is another piece in the goal.  That is how the fortune of the party will most change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played with up to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 10 meeples, of which 6 are &lt;br/&gt;to be moved into the opposite destination spaces &lt;br/&gt;of the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player is determined by chance.&lt;br/&gt;The meeples can jump over other meeples of the same &lt;br/&gt;or any other color to get to the destination &lt;br/&gt;spaces (jumping is done like in the Halma game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a player gets one of his meeples on a &lt;br/&gt;destination space, the turntable gets turned a quarter&lt;br/&gt;turn to the right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This provides for variety in the gameplay, because &lt;br/&gt;every turn changes the position of the meeples &lt;br/&gt;for every player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player, who is the first to get 6&lt;br/&gt;meeples on the destination spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4 remaining meeples are without importance for the&lt;br/&gt;outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This game is played without a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
