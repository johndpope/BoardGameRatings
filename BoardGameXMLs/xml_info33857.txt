							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn</name>
									
			<description>Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn is a Dark Fantasy strategic and tactical wargame. Play as one of four Princes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Accumulate resources by exploration, building mines and temples, and fighting for key positions. In addition to resource and strategic management, you also manage the details of your units&amp;rsquo; Formations, Fatigue, Damage Levels, Rank, Ammunition, etc. The combat dynamics revolve around a richly detailed and heavily researched simulation of the four primary weapon systems of ancient warfare: Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry. Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&amp;rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning. A modular game board provides new terrain configurations every time you play, and terrain plays a key element in how you develop your strategy and tactics as terrain effects are customized for each unit. Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases. Though not recommended for the casual gamer, Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn provides a robust challenge for anyone who desires to plumb the depths and details of ancient fantasy warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
