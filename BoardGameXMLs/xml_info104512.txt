			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GI Joe Team may be the only hope for averting enemy attack in OPERATION: DEATH STONE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the torpedo room of an American submarine speeding toward a secret destination, Duke tells the assembled GI Joe Team members the details of your astonishing mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strange meteor has landed on a remote Pacific jungle island. The meteor could be composed of an element so rare and powerful that it could help create a virtually indestructible alloy. Whoever gains possession of this element will be completely safe from attack - and can therefore destroy his enemies without fear of retribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturally, Cobra wants to possess the element as much as you do. Your job is to make sure it doesn't fall into their evil hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your codename is Outlaw, because you've been known to bend the rules from time to time. Along with Roadblock, Snake-eyes, Recondo, Blowtorch, Gung-ho, and Mutt you will have to make critical decisions at every turn. Primitive headshrinking natives, blasting volcanoes, creepy caves, and a slew of Cobras await you as you FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
