							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chaos: Path Maker</name>
									
			<description>Introduction: You are trying to construct a path, while fighting chaos, by constantly flipping and&lt;br/&gt;placing cards. Play your hand carefully, or you will lose, and chaos will destroy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Shuffle the nine cards, and draw 3 of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: On your turn, roll 1d6 twice, and flip those numbered cards. Next, place 1 card from your&lt;br/&gt;hand, or play a card to use its power. If you place a card, you must connect it to an already played&lt;br/&gt;card that has a matching symbol. If you play it for its power, discard it. It becomes a chaos card.&lt;br/&gt;You must do at least one action on your turn. After your turn, refresh your hand up to three cards.&lt;br/&gt;Drawing Cards: When you draw cards, you use the side that is face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos Cards: If you discard a card, it becomes a chaos card. Every turn, any card with a number&lt;br/&gt;one higher than its flips over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning: You win if you place at least four cards that are all connected. This means they each&lt;br/&gt;attach to another by matching symbols. You lose if you don't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
