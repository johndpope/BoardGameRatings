You end up getting in front of a loan shark who is also a crime boss, asking him for a million dollars. He places 3 briefcases in front of you and asks you to &amp;quot;pick one and open it&amp;quot;. He further mentions that &amp;quot;only one of them has the million dollars in cash, one has the trash and one has the bomb. If you end up opening the case with the cash, you walk away rich, if you open the case with the trash, you walk away with nothing but the stink and if you open up the case with the bomb then you are a roasted meat&amp;quot;. You take a good look at all the 3 briefcases, put in front of you to choose from. They all look exactly same, they all weigh exactly same, they also feel exactly same, but the only thing in which they differ is, what they carry inside. All the briefcases are completely odorless and produce no sound upon shaking them. They are completely sealed and locked. You may only choose one briefcase and you only get to know what is inside it, by opening it right there and right then. You finally choose and grab one briefcase to open it while wondering, what is inside it ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is inside it is an exhilarating and an exciting game. A number of players can play it against each other. This game of odds, chances and strategy unfolds when a number of players are confronted with a number of cards with briefcases pictures on it. To open a briefcase, the playing card is flipped upside down so that the content of that briefcase is revealed. Without knowing what is inside of each card, the players pick up and flip one card at a time, upon their turn in each round. The risk element kicks in when all the players must instinctively choose and flip a number of cards, which are to be opened one at a time upon their turns, and the content of the card is revealed. As each card is flipped or turned, the likelihood of the players having a valuable cash amount such as a million dollars in the card or something else, such as a BOMB. The pressure mounts in each round, as the number of cards are turned or flipped. The players may also come under pressure by what might be contained in their chosen card. What is inside it ? cash or bomb or something else... The players will always be curious and puzzled, but they also know that as long as they do not intentionally or accidentally open the card with a BOMB or come under attack by any other opponent player, they are fine. There are multiple variants of this game, which can be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
