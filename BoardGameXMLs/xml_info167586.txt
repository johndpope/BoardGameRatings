			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In apartment 404 in New York a week ago, in a fit of rage, Vincent Sabatell strangled his girlfriend to death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, when Detective Karl Winters was called to the scene, it appeared to be an open and shut case; Sabatell was still at the scene, detained by officers, and the evidence clearly pointed to him. When interviewed, he was surly and aggressive, but eventually broke down and confessed. He is currently held in the County Jail awaiting sentencing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winters thought nothing of the case, until a few days later. He had heard that an unsavory rock band, Sinful Season had recorded a track at the apartment shortly after the murder. Their reputation for recording at murder scenes is fairly well known. However, his interest was piqued when, speaking to the landlord for the apartment regarding some paperwork for Sabatell, he discovered that the band&amp;rsquo;s agent had enquired about recording at the apartment more than a week before the murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although he is suspicious, there is nothing more he can do &amp;ndash; he has a confession, and his Lieutenant doesn&amp;rsquo;t want anything clouding the case. Also, the band&amp;rsquo;s other tracks were recorded at murder scenes in other states. Hence, he has passed it to the investigators. He explains the situation, then unofficially hands them a copy of the case file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything is completely off the record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this is written for Delta Green, it can be played by any modern investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
