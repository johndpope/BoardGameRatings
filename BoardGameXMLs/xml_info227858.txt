			<description>An ancient, malevolent force stirs within the depths of the Eon Altar, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to YOU to stop it! Eon Altar combines nail-biting action and turn-based tactical combat with an epic story of friendship, destiny and betrayal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far so good, right? But wait, there's more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Eon Altar, we&amp;rsquo;ve captured the experience of a role-playing tabletop game and blended it into a video game. How did we pull that off? Well, the magic is in your own pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Eon Altar, each player uses their smartphone as a private screen to see their motivations, thoughts and innermost secrets. Your mobile device also offers you lines of dialogues to read out loud&amp;mdash;hopefully in your own eccentric performance you've developed for your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your actions. Your game. Your way. You play your character the way you want it. Succeed together, or die alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conclude the story with two new chapters in Episode 3.  After the defeat of Lady Allevia and putting an end to her centuries-old torment, a mysterious, powerful figure has saved you from Guild Lord Davian's attack and left you in the dark caves below the Catacombs. Ancient ruins lost to history, a malevolent race, and this mysterious figure's agenda all stand between you and Davian: survival isn't enough; your destiny awaits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
