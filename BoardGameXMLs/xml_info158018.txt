			<description>There are 4 starting points in this game: London, Lublin, Serajewo and Tarragona. From there the players have to travel to Rome. The city cards are dealt to the players and determine, which cities the player has to visit on his way to Rome. The players get a number of game coins, which they can lose on some spaces on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach Rome gets the first prize. The second prize gets to the player with the most game coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was most likely published in the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
