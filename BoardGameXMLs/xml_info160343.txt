							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SOE21 Modern  Espionage RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the second world war an elite secret force was formed to attack the enemy from within. Its methods were subversion, sabotage, assassination and terror. Many of its agents did not survive. Often captured, tortured and executed, their work was cloaked in secrecy and all but forgotten. They were the Special Operations Executive (SOE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the war they were sacrificed upon the altar of political necessity and disbanded. The victims of inter-agency rivalry. Or were they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the world of SOE21, not so very different from our own, Churchill secretly ordered that the SOE was to continue, as the hidden and deniable agent of Britain&amp;rsquo;s otherwise less acceptable activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
