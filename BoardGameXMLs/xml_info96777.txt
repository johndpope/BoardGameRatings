							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Back to Iraq (third edition)</name>
									
			<description>Back To Iraq, 3rd Edition (B2I3e) is a &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; simulation of the fighting that might occur across the northern littoral of the Persian Gulf if the US-led anti-terrorism Coalition decides on a ground war to finally settle with the Baghdad regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B2I3e is a two player wargame of low to intermediate complexity that posits this might-be war lasting about a month. We believe that is about the maximum time before the Coalition Ground force's diminishing supplies, coupled with a loss of the domestic political will necessary to continue the fighting, would bring about a settlement if victory were not achieved in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Form the introduction).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major changes with the previous editions are the units, with new Order of Battle and factors. The units also are now mostly &amp;quot;two steppers&amp;quot;. The combat table is also different at all, with separate combat tables for coalition and Militant Islamic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two scenarios, one against Iraq and Al Qaeda, and the second also against Iran and Iraq. Turkish and Syrian intervention is possible in both scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced rules cover Strategic targets, Airstrikes, Special Operations Forces, Command and Control and Additional Forces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Turn: 2 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 17 miles / 27.54 km&lt;br/&gt;Unit: Brigade to Army&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22&amp;quot; X 34&amp;quot; mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One countersheet (176 5/8&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 24 page rules booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
