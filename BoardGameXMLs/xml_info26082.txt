							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Les 45 Tours de France</name>
									
			<description>This game, releases either late '50s or early '60s, is in a very original format. The game has a 45rpm record (album size) with the instructions on it (side A contains a flat stage, side B a mountain stage), the gameboard is the backside of the record sleeve. The board has a drawing of France on it, with a track on the outside. Movement of the pawns is decided by dice rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
