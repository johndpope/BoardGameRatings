			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;--==--&lt;br/&gt;Res-Q is a collectable card game based of amazing real rescues carried out in New Zealand, designed by a Rescue Helicopter Pilot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fun part of this game is simply collecting the cards of different and unusual scenarios, all of which actually happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 packs, each consisting of 18 different scenarios and a Miracle card and a Good Weather card. Look for an Unusual card - there's one in every 360 cards and a Very Unusual card - there's one in every 720 cards. Collect them to increase your odds of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Res-Q is to save the 'patient' and thereby win cards.&lt;br/&gt;--==--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has 2 functions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Scenario &lt;br/&gt;2. Equipment, vehicles and personnel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn chooses a scenario and the other player plays equipment etc. Then the scenario card is flipped and points allocated from the played cards. If the requisite points have been reached the scenario is successfully completed. The player who is successful takes all the cards as points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
