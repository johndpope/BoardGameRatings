			<description>Fazenda (Portuguese for Farm) is basically a card-based, bidding game with a few added elements. Players use cards to bid over Cows, Pigs, and Hens which appear in random combinations each round of play. Points are scored based on the number of animals a player has in his farm at the end of each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strategy lies in knowing which animals will start paying off early and in capitalizing on the &amp;quot;Haystack Cards&amp;quot; which allow for various bonuses depending on the characteristics of your farm at the end of the 8 rounds of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may also plant fields which can pay off really well as long there's no drought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
