			<description>Author's description from the text:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding Haven is a game about dissidents rebelling against or seeking escape from an alien force of corporate totalitarianism.  And about human nature.  There is that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Finding Haven, there&amp;rsquo;s at least three general kinds of situations you can choose to play in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Discovery: your characters all begin play as na&amp;iuml;ve citizens, believing in the worldview spread by Demosian propaganda, but you discover the horrifying truth in the first session or two.  You might be taking winners of the Culling to meet a Starliner around Europa station, or supplies to and from Io.  Something goes wrong, and someone winds up seeing something they shouldn't.  DE finds out something is off, and a patrol ship goes to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Escape and Pursuit: your characters know the awful truth: the Demosians do send the winners of the Culling off to Jupiter, but there are no starliners taking them to Wonderland: they are used as incubation chambers for Demosian eggs.  When the larvae hatch, they slowly eat their way out of the paralyzed hosts.  Those culled on the other hand are used as fresh meat for adult Demosians, and occasionally recycled as cheap meat for human fast food restaurants a la soylent green.  You&amp;rsquo;ve heard of something called Haven on pirate broadcasts, a place safe from the aliens, and you&amp;rsquo;ve stolen or hijacked a ship and are trying to find it.  The Demosian Enforcers of course are trying to find you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Rebellion: In an Earth-based game, the PCs can be fighting a rebel war, probably mostly covert, against the Demosians.  Goals will include both striking against Demosian targets and trying to get their message out to the general population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment&lt;br/&gt;Finding Haven was runner-up in the English part of Game Chef 2013: Icons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
