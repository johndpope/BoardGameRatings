							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amber Hart Inn</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near a crossroads deep with the woods, the Amber Hart Inn is a home to travelers, mercenaries, and those seeking to avoid the law. With a spacious tavern, ample stables, and a variety of rooms, all of the amenities can be found here. Whether you are meeting someone for business or just passing through, you'll find a warm seat by the hearth and a tall flagon of ale waiting for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first in the new set of &amp;quot;Zero Hour&amp;quot; map products, the Amber Hart Inn is a classic location suitable for any medieval or fantasy setting. While the map has a 1 inch grid built into the art, there are no system-specific game stats given. This is an edition-independent product focusing on cartography. A vibrantly rendered location is provided - ready to be customized to your rule system and story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An overview of the location and its occupants.&lt;br/&gt;     Full color, miniature-scale map broken into 10 pages for easy printing.&lt;br/&gt;     Black and white versions of the map pages.&lt;br/&gt;     A 24x36 inch, 150 dpi, color JPEG image of the inn at 1 inch = 5 feet scale (sample image below).&lt;br/&gt;     A version of the poster map with no text or spoilers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Amber Hart Inn can provide a welcome refuge between adventures, or a location for the adventure itself. When its time to play, Zero Hour cartography is ready!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
