							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Evil Dead D6</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howdy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This here game is a horror-action adventure type of thing, set in the world of the Evil Dead Trilogy (Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Evil Dead III/Army of Darkness).  These films were written, directed and produced by Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell (among others).  Evil Dead and Evil Dead II were pretty straight-up horror flicks, with a nice dose of slapstick humor in parts.  Army of Darkness really has more action and humor than pure horror (which is perhaps why I like it the best). This game follows the vein of Army of Darkness most closely:  ultimate evil, stalwart and somewhat clueless heroes, and nearly unlimited ammunition.  Players will blast their way through evil deadite spawn, decapitate hellbound demons, and, on occasion, come face to face with unfathomable evil. There will be gore, death, black magic, lost souls, and (hopefully) a strong dose of humor along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, the Evil has been let loose upon the world.  You're alone in the woods and your girlfriend (EX-girlfriend) just turned into a deadite and ate your best friends.  You've got a flare gun, a gallon of gasoline, and a Louisville Slugger.  Are you up for it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hail to the king, baby...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
