			<description>From the Publisher's site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Magic Challenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Two or more players slip into the role of one wizard each, creating and controlling creatures by weaving spells. The one managing to destroy his opponent's protective shield wins. It is possible to attack your opponent(s) with huge masses of creatures, because spells are casted every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea behind Magic Challenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* There are many people playing table-tops and having great ideas for new games. Magic Challenge is an opportunity for those people, because the game has, like they say in computer language, an open source code: The rules are open to everyone. They can be copied and passed on to everybody. It&amp;rsquo;s not that difficult with only 3 pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
