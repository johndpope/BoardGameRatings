			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An extensive shareware variation and re-theming of Wizard's Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confidential Briefing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometime in the recent past, a well known corporation was beset with  a frightful disaster.  It seems that on a dark,  stormy night an electrical disturbance produced a tremendous power surge in the corporation's  new  30-story office complex.  The damage was minor,  except in one area.  The logic in the main computer, which controls  almost every aspect of the company's operation, was put in complete  disarray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From that time on,  the computer  took  on  a  rather  sinister disposition  toward those who used it.  First,  the computer gained control over the Computer Operator.  Then,  it began  to  influence the  other employees.  Soon the corporation's normal operation came to a halt and a cry went out for someone,  anyone,  to rescue  them from the grasp of the diabolical mainframe.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Your  mission,  should you choose to accept it,  is to find the Mainframe, defeat the Operator, and return to the Lobby alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Mission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer mainframe is located  somewhere  on  floor 27-30.  The  Computer  Operator moves it each time you begin a new mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you locate the mainframe,  you must return to the Lobby  alive to  inform the service technician where to find it.  The malevolent Operator guards the mainframe jealously.  You must overcome him  in order to get to the mainframe.  The Operator is powerful and resist your attempts, but he can be overcome by your resourcefulness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
