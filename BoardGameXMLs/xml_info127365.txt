							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wolfsworn</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Wolfsworn rider is taught from birth how to care for, train, and make use a rare breed of wolf as a powerful ally and mount in combat. Wolfsworn are skilled warriors, trained for combat while mounted on the backs of vicious and oversized wolves. They can found charging across a battlefield, savagely destroying enemies who do not have the sense enough to flee. The Wolfsworn's true power comes from the ferocity of his mount, his combat prowess that he has learned, and the devastating carnage they wreak together. Wolfsworn tend to rush head long onto the field of battle, using brutal tactics to destroy enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crashing down the steep embankment, in a cloud of dust rising from its decent, the massive black wolf and its armored rider quickly covered the ground needed to catch the fleeing ogre. With a single command, the rider pulled hard on the reigns, sending the oversized canine into a savage rage and causing it to release an unnatural howl which echoed throughout the ridge. Hearing the sound of its death swiftly approaching, the ogre realized that there would be no escape. The hulking giant turned, it&amp;rsquo;s oversized club in hand to meet the pursuers in combat, but was only greeted by the powerful jaws of the wolfsworn&amp;rsquo;s mount closing around his throat and pulling it&amp;rsquo;s bulk onto the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
