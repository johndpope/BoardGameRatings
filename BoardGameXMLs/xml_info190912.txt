			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This manuscript includes information that may be critical to the success of the players in your war bound campaign. It&amp;rsquo;s pages hold information on the medic, a mundane healer who can patch up friendlies and keep them moving until more permanent doctoring can be had. Not only that but these medics can mitigate the effects of diseases, or even some curses and the lingering effects of death. Don&amp;rsquo;t think they just sit on the sideline however the medic is also a competent melee combatant ready to hang out on the front lines. But when it comes to the darker side of war, none push through more than the shadowknight, a dark avenger, the shadowy fist of an ideal. They are not fair, but of what use is fairness in war? Also included is the legend wielder and his legendary weapon. These are the weapons of which songs are sung, and entire battles shift when someone unsheathes an item of its magnitude. The brother of the vulture stands ready to sanctify the dead and to destroy any undead that may stand before him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What good would a manuscript of war be without some strategic insights? Presenting a new feat type, strategy feats. A party tactician can extend a benefit to all allies near to him, and with each new strategy comes more vision into brilliant maneuvers which can be accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New classes and options to make the most out of any warring setting.&lt;br/&gt;     2 New Base Classes the Medic and the Shadowknight&lt;br/&gt;     2 Prestige Classes the Brother of the Vulture, and the Legend Wielder&lt;br/&gt;     New &amp;ldquo;Strategy Feats&amp;rdquo; and the Strategist Cavalier Archetype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
