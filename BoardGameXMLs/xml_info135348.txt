							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tricky Chicken</name>
									
			<description>In collaboration with Michael Schacht, one of the premiere German game designers, we bring to you the challenge of beating those Tricky Chickens at their own game. In this fast paced &amp;quot;rummy-style&amp;quot; card game, players collect cards of similar suit and lay them down to win victory points. But you've got to watch out because those tricky chickens may steal your victory points just when you think you've got the win in the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play against computer opponents, keep track of your top ten scores, and post your achievements to Facebook. Tricky Chicken follows the same rules that you've known from Michael's original game, Crazy Chicken, including the original artwork but available now in an exciting new format. Interactive help is included along with the complete rules to the original game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play now and get started teaching those chickens how it's done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
