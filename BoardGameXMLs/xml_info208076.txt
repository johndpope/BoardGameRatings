							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Throne of Lies: The Online Game of Lies and Deceit</name>
									
			<description>Based on which classes are assigned, about half of these players will be the good team (The Blue Dragon Faction), and the rest will be on the bad team (The Red Dragon Faction). These two factions want to eliminate each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To mix things up a bit and makes things more interesting, there will be some wildcard players who aren&amp;rsquo;t in either faction. These few cast-outs will either be on their own, trying to outlast everyone, or be a part of a small cult. Your goal is to be the last surviving and to eliminate all who oppose you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a game session starts, nobody knows who&amp;rsquo;s who &amp;mdash; all players&amp;rsquo; assigned classes are completely anonymous. All you know is there are maybe 10 or so other players with you, you have your own specific goal to accomplish to win, and everyone else has their own goals. You must figure out who&amp;rsquo;s on your side and who&amp;rsquo;s lying, so you know who to eliminate. (Hint: Don&amp;rsquo;t wrongfully eliminate someone on your side.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At night, the fun begins. Players can visit each other&amp;rsquo;s personal rooms and interact in new ways, meet up in private, and even sneak in and assassinate each other in secret if they want. Other things happen, like spying on rooms, and using special night-abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
