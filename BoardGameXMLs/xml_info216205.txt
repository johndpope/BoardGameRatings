			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scottish Corridor is the fifth Pint-Sized Campaign for Chain of Command, designed to be played using the campaign handbook, At the Sharp End.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty nine pages long, The Scottish Corridor follows the established Pint-Sized Campaign format, with an overview of the forces involved on both sides, their deployment shown on period maps and the course of the campaign described in detail before going on to present a mini-campaign covering the initial German counter-attack against the narrow corridor projecting down to the Odon river and Hill 112.  A mixed force of two Kampfgruppe attack in the hope of isolating the British spearhead and restoring the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign is a total of six game tables with the duration running between six and eleven games.  Briefings are provided for both sides, along with measurable objectives, period maps, force and support option listings and everything you need to play this campaign through to its conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all other Pint-Sized campaigns, this PDF is available for the price of a pint in the publisher's local pub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
