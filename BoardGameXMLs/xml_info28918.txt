			<description>From GAMES Magazine: The grass always seems greener on the other side of this six-level hill, so everyone's going over the top to win by reaching four enemy bases there. Dice rolls determine movement. You can jump single enemies (except uphill) and flip them over to become yours. A piece landing on the summit becomes a Field Marshal, which cannot be jumped but may leap and convert entire rows of enemies. However, there can only be one Field Marshal, whose allegiance proves difficult to retain; it must vacate the sacred peak immediately, allowing others to reach it and wrest control. Things can get hectic, but patiently blocking upwardly mobile forces in order to keep the fickle Field Marshal loyal usually wins. Still, this is a feisty game that can literally be enjoyed at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
