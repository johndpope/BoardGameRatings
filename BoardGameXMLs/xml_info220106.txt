							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Team Yankee: Volksarmee â€“ East Germans in World War III</name>
									
			<description>Volksarmee is a 32-page hardbook expansion to the Team Yankee tabletop miniatures wargame introducing the East Germans as the first non-Soviet Warsaw Pact army lists. The new army lists include a T-72M Panzer Bataillon, T-55 AM2 Panzer Bataillon, BMP Mot-Sch&amp;uuml;tzen Bataillon, and BTR-60 Mot-Sch&amp;uuml;tzen Bataillon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the East Germans use much of the same equipment as their Soviet comrades, there are some differences. The expansion introduces new equipment including the T-72M tank, T-55 AM2 tank, BTR-60 IFV, SA-9 Gaskin SAM, and Spandrel AT. The new equipment, as well as East German infantry, are being released as miniatures box sets with East German and Soviet data cards as appropriate.  East German data cards for existing Soviet miniatures are included with the expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also includes a fictional history of the East German units during WWIII, painting guides, and scenarios. It can be purchased as a physical hardback book or as a digital download in the Flames of War Digital app for Android and IOS systems.  A copy of the Team Yankee rule book is required to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
