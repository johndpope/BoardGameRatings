							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">buzzer</name>
									
			<description>The game has four modes: a quiz game, a taboo like game, a &amp;quot;finger on the trigger&amp;quot; game, and a game where you have to name as many words as possible fitting to a description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All games are moderated by the included big red button. The button has a clear voice output in German for that purpose. It can also count presses and has a simple timer functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The buzzer runs on 3AA batteries, a board, 4 pawns, 56 cards, 4 pencils and instructions are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When opening up the buzzer, a simple PCB with English descriptions shows up. It seems the board can hold also alternative speech chips, so it could be available in other languages as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
