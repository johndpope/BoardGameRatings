			<description>Looney Pyramids are colored pyramids that are used in many published and user-created games. They were originally part of the single game Icehouse created by John Cooper, and until 2011 they were generally called Icehouse pieces or Icehouse pyramids. The original game, Icehouse, is based on a fictional game Andrew Looney described in a story he wrote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2001-2006: One stash of hollow plastic pyramids in a clear plastic tube. Available in red, yellow, green, blue, black, clear and new colors purple, orange, and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Root Beer &amp;amp; Watermelon (2001 and 2004, respectively) - These one-of-a-kind stashes were accidentally created as a manufacturing error, and sold on eBay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2007: A full stash of gray pyramids was available briefly on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2011: Electric Yellow - one stash of hollow plastic pyramids in new color electric yellow. The color was a production error, so it was a limited run sold only through the website. Looney Labs chose to sell them exclusively to registered &amp;quot;Starship Captain&amp;quot;-level fans of Looney Labs. As this was an unofficial (and accidental) product, there was no official packaging for it. Instead, a standard stash of 5 &amp;times; 3 sizes of Electric Yellow pyramids shipped in a simple, sealed, plastic bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: A &amp;quot;stash&amp;quot; contains 15 pyramids (5 sets of the 3 sizes) of one color. The tubes were 6.69 x 1.18 x 1.18 inches or 17.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2016: Three trios (9 pyramids) were available in a new color, Kickstarter green, through the Pyramid Arcade campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
