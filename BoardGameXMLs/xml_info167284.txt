			<description>A fast-paced 2 player card game of risk and luck. Punch, kick, parry and dodge your way to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight! is a 2 player game that can be played with a standard deck of cards. Each of the 4 suits represents a different fighting move, either punch, kick, parry or dodge. Each move beats another move; for example, punch beats dodge, but parry beats punch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn, both players simultaneously play the card that they think has the best chance of beating their opponent's card. The winner gets some points, and the first fighter to get 13 points wins the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to win 3 rounds wins the fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight is currently a creative commons licensed free game that can be played with a standard deck of cards. A commercial release with expanded rules and a custom deck with original graphics is currently in the works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
