							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Politics As Usual</name>
									
			<description>In &amp;quot;Politics as Usual&amp;quot;, each player takes on the role of a U.S. Senator and competes at getting himself/herself re-elected to the Senate. A player needs 5,000,000 votes in order to be re-elected. To gain these votes, players will need to cooperate with each other to pass Pork Barrel legislation and gain voter support, as well as work on their own to raise money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box cover illustrates some of the rather humorous cards in the game, some of which play off of events contemporaneous to the game's design. In one example, a player gains 700,000 votes due to their &amp;quot;Trial Reform&amp;quot; bill which, in actuality, creates a casino in the player's state &amp;quot;specializing in bets on outcomes of celebrity murder trials.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
