			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the aftermath of a zombie outbreak, you must drive through the hordes of undead to rescue survivors and take them back to the safety of the military base.  Along the way, you should run over as many zombies as possible, and smash through various other destructible objects (cars, fences, benches) to gain points.&lt;br/&gt;In story mode, you begin with a humble taxi, and as the game progresses you can upgrade your vehicle, unlock various weapons (machine guns, flamethrower, etc.), and unlock new types of vehicles with different strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt;There is also Slaughter Mode, a survival mode where the goal is to stay alive as long as possible against increasing waves of zombies while grabbing upgrades for your vehicle and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
