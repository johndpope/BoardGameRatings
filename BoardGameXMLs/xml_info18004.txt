			<description>Similar to the more popular Super Jock Super Toe Football Game, this game utilized the same pound-the-head mechanism to propel the ball.  In Super Jock Super Touch Basketball the players attempt to shoot the ball into the hoop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player attempts 5 shots per quarter, getting 2 points for a shot made in the &amp;quot;free throw&amp;quot; area and 3 points for making a shot past that zone, five or more feet from the basket.  After playing 4 quarters the player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
