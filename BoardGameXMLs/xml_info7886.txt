			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players help the dreaming Little Boy, chased by Tigers, collect all 4 Teddy Bears &amp;amp;amp; Toy Collection. Then, get him back to bed before he wakes up. Take turns moving the Little Boy to Dream Places such as Sea Bottom, a Spooky Castle, a Huge Dragon Mouth, etc. Use Dream Tools such as a Bag of Magic Dust, Large Stilts, and even a very loud Bugle to help him on his way. You might also find Yummy Candy. But too much Candy will give the Little Boy a Tummy Ache and wake him up. However, the biggest dangers are the Tigers, who keep coming closer and closer to the Bed. Work together to help the Little Boy&amp;amp;#039;s dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tribute to the comic strip Nemo in Slumberland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
