							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eole</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eole is an important city of the universe Ecryme. As its name suggests, the city's specialty is the manufacture of dirigibles and balloons. But Eole is also famous for its glassworks, as well as its dueling lawyers: lawyers who, if they fail to win their cases before the courts, may resolve matters by resorting to duels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first chapter is rather short, and serves as a prologue to the book. Written as a series of lectures given by a professor of history at the city's University. This chapter ends with the arrest of Professor for treason!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second chapter, by far the larger, describes Eole neighborhood by neighborhood. Each of its four quarters of the town has a map of the area, an overview and some NPC descriptions, as well as details on several individual buildings. The whole is enriched with information about the city life, laws, trade secrets and other sources of scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last chapter of the book, very short, gives some tips for creating new characters, and some ideas for scenarios. It ends with a glossary of terms most popular in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
