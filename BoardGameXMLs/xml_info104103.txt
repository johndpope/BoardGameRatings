							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Babylon 5 Wars: Showdowns-4</name>
									
			<description>This issue of the Showdowns series is a follow-on to THE DILGAR INVASION (BW-103), the hottest new B5W product of 2000! With this book you can play the entire Dilgar War in scenarios, using over 20 different scenarios including the huge Final Battle at Omelos - a battle so big we had to break it into four parts! Of course, we couldn't do a book like this without ships, so you'll find more than 20 new vessels inside - such as Jha'Dur's personal Mishakur Dreadnought, and ships for the Abbai, Brakiri, Markab, Llort, and other races involved in the Dilgar War! And, as if we hadn't already packed enough cool stuff into one book, we've even added an entirely new race, the Descari Committees! How could you possibly live without this product?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
