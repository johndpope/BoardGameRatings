			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always Watch the Skies!&lt;br/&gt;. . . for you never know what might be hiding in the dark clouds above!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skies over Europe are the most dangerous of all right now. Thousands of Allied bombers lumber over France and Germany, reigning fiery death on the Axis forces below. But what waits for them in the moonlit clouds? Speeding Messerschmitts may be the least of the air crews' worries, for this is no ordinary war - this is Weird War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this core rulebook for Weird Wars: Weird War Two are complete and truly unique rules for bombing and strafing runs and deadly dogfights. You'll also find the Pilot class as well as new skills and feats for them to master their aerial adversaries. Complete statistics for all the major Allied and Axis fighters and bombers of the Western Front are also included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have ghoulish goodies for the War Master too! Inside you'll find more than a dozen creepy new flying terrors and a full-length adventure, Memphis Hell! This twisted tale concerns a B-17 that hasn't quite &amp;quot;given up the ghost&amp;quot; yet, if you catch our drift. Can your team master the fearful Flying Fortress? Or will their names be added to the roster of those who died within it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead From Above is a core rulebook for Weird Wars. You must have the Blood on the Rhine book to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
