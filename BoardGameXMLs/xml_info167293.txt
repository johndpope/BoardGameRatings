							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Consonants</name>
									
			<description>Monster Consonants is a matching game that teaches basic words and beginning consonants by using cards with incomplete words and picture clues. Players are dealt a hand of three cards, they then use the illustrations and incomplete words displayed on their cards to figure out what words they are trying to complete. Each player in turn asks another player for a letter card he thinks he needs. If the other player has the card, the first player makes sure the picture match, reads the correct word, and places the two cards face-down to score ten points. If the other player does not have the card, the first player may draw a card, and lay down any matches made. If the first player does not read the completed word correctly, another player may challenge, read the word, and steal the points. Play continues until a player reaches 150 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
