			<description>Every player undertakes a road trip through the USA. While traveling the player's goal is to visit all locations as fast as possible. To prove this to the other players every player has to get a postcard from each location.&lt;br/&gt;The players have to answer questions whenever they don't land on a location, but on an open field. The cards have questions divided into three categories: easy, medium, hard. All questions are in English and you have to answer in English (note that this is a German game).&lt;br/&gt;If a player hits a special location, he takes the postcard from that location, reads it out aloud and places it in front of him. Whoever visits all 15 locations first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
