							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Village of Kozon</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive the trials otherwise set before you? Have you the courage, the stoutness of heart, clearness of mind and strength of sinew to walk the path of survival?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This T&amp;amp;T solo will test not only your capacity for violence, stealth and greed, but for mercy, subtlety and intuition as well. Those who rely solely on the might or force of arms to resolve problems will likely learn a hard (and potentially fatal) lesson within this solo. Have you the mettle and skill to tread where many have succumbed to death before you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kozon, our second solo adventure, is suitable for normal delvers willing to walk the village's mean streets and waddle knee-deep in Goblins! Can you survive the trials otherwise set before you? Have you the courage, the stoutness of heart, clearness of mind and strength of sinew to walk the path of survival? This solo is bristling with quality art and no small number of words spread over 20 blood-soaked pages. This mini solo will take you back to the old-school days of adventuring, when the villagers always knew where to find their next savior... at the bar, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
