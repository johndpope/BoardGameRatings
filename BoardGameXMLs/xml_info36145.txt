			<description>A two player card game with a chess theme. One player plays Black, the other plays White. Each player has an identical custom deck of 52 cards, composed of Noble cards and Aid cards. The object of the game is to capture your opponent&amp;rsquo;s King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a series of challenges, where the player&amp;rsquo;s simultaneously choose one Noble card from their hands and lay it face up on the table. The players can then add up to six Aid cards from their hands, played face down, to assist the Noble. All cards are then turned face up to see which side has the highest combined Move, Attack, and/or Defend ratings. The losing Noble is captured. In the case of a tie, both Nobles are captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
