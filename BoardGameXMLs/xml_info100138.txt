			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;- H.G. Wells, The War of the Worlds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1962. Agents of an insurgent faction called the Splinter Radicals, who possess psychic abilities, have been thwarted in their attempt to assassinate President Eisenhower. After this failed attempt, the United States government recruits its own psychics under a covert department of the Secret Service: the Psychic Research Defense Agency. Even more troubling, visitations by psychic Grey Aliens are on the rise, with new psychics being reported in their wake. J. Edgar Hoover, ever seeking more power, is attempting to recruit his own psychics to monitor suspected radicals outside the scope of the law. And now the PRDA's precogs have a vision of a terrible day when the Splinter Radicals will kill newly elected President John F. Kennedy and blame the assassination on the Soviets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the next stage in human evolution. Be the hunter, or be hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunters20 a new campaign model for Modern20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New Background: Radical&lt;br/&gt;     New Occupations: Psychic Agent&lt;br/&gt;     3 New Character Disadvantages&lt;br/&gt;     New Skill: Psionics&lt;br/&gt;     39 New psionic based feats&lt;br/&gt;     Campaign Model plus NPCs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
