			<description>Kids' game consisting of forty cards: five each of a Space Ship, Pilot, Co-Pilot, Space Scanner, Control Panel, Landing Tower, Space Chart, and Blast Off. Depending on how many players participate, you take out a number of sets of these cards, then deal out 8 or 9 cards to each player and begin passing one unwanted card per turn to the left. (In the two-player game, the players can discard and draw in addition to passing back and forth.) The first player to get a full set of one of each type of card and yell &amp;quot;ORBIT&amp;quot; wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no copyright or release date on the game, but it dates from the late 1950s or very early 1960s. The card art is reminiscent of the &amp;quot;Jetsons&amp;quot; style. As one might expect, the Pilot is a boy and the Co-Pilot is a girl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was re-released as &amp;quot;Space-O&amp;quot; later, but the interior text continued to say &amp;quot;Orbit,&amp;quot; at least in early printings. It was one of Arrco's six Pla-Mor games, &amp;quot;developed, in consultation with child guidance specialists, to teach while they entertain.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
