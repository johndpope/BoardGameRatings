							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Division War</name>
									
			<description>Division War is a version of the classic card game War with a twist, designed to teach division facts.  Players are dealt an equal number of the 86 cards showing division problems.  Like in war, each player then turns over a card.  They must then solve the division problem displayed on the card.  The player with the highest answer wins and takes all the cards.  If a player's answer is wrong, he or she gives her card to the player to the right.  A wild card automatically gains all the cards in that round for the player who plays it.  Like in wars, equal answers result in a &amp;quot;war&amp;quot; where players play two face-down cards and the an face-up card, and the winner wins all the cards.  Players play a predetermined number of times through the deck or until one player has all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
