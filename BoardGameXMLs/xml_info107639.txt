			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set collecting card game with special effects. The card deck consists of cards of varying colour and titles. Players start with a small hand of cards and some cards laid face up on the table. On a player's turn, he may either use one card from hand to grab one of the face up cards, or if he can't, play a card into the open area. Some cards have a special effect when gained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to get a set of same coloured, but differently titled cards, representing a deep knowledge in a specific area important for job-searching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translated box back&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple game in which the players collect skill cards in order to get a job offer. Three skill cards of the same colour earns you one job offer! But beware, because among the skill cards, there are some that force you to draw an event card, and who knows what may happen then. The first player to get a set number of job offers wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
