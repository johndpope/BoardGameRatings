			<description>Hexehop is a Halma variant that was designed to allow for players with impaired vision.  Its board is a hexagonal grid of points, seven to a side, but with two points from each corner removed.  Also, there are no lines connecting the inner hexagon of five points to a side with the outer portion of the board, resulting in six separate starting areas of nine points each, outside the inner hexagon.  The lines and points are done in relief, and the pieces are made not only in colors but in shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played the same as Halma or Chinese Checkers, with up to six players taking turns moving their pieces one at a time to the opposite side of the board.  Pieces may move to one adjacent point or jump another piece to a vacant opposite point.  The first play to move all of his or pieces to their objective wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
