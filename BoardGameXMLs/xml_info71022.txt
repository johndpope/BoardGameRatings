			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ancient times, the First Ones enslaved all of Exodus; their plans were served well by countless thousands of unwilling servants.  Once their slaves rose up and overthrew them, however, the First Ones were cast into the depths - bereft not only of their power, but also of the vast majority of the very slaves who brought them low. The P'Tan were created to replace those slaves. The P'Tan are a created race, fashioned from elemental shadow-stuff infused into what were initially crude mortal shells.  By dark sorcery and darker worship, the First Ones made these creatures into a lasting race that could breed true without their magical influence&amp;hellip; the better to provide them with slaves for all eternity. Only a handful of P'Tan have escaped the crushing oppression into which their people were born, but those who have are perhaps the most determined foes of the First Ones in all of Exodus.  Other races have but dim memory of their primeval slavery; for the P'Tan, that existence is indelibly etched in living memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     All the information to play the P&amp;rsquo;Tan as PC Race including Personality and Relations.&lt;br/&gt;     Plus an all new P&amp;rsquo;Tan Paragon Class&lt;br/&gt;     Nearly 10 All New P&amp;rsquo;Tan Feats including Black Lightning Bolt, Black Lightning Claws, Black Lightning Recovery and Black Lightning Sheath.&lt;br/&gt;     P&amp;rsquo;Tan Arms and Armor&lt;br/&gt;     P&amp;rsquo;Tan Counters&lt;br/&gt;     Initiative and Monster Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
