			<description>Hunde und Schakale is a modern German interpretation of the ancient Egyptian game, Hounds and Jackals: Game of the Pharaohs.  It uses the same board and playing pieces (to represent hounds and jackals), but with a changed rules set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the original game, players move their pieces based on the results of a randomizer (in modern days, a die is used), and their goal is to remove their pieces from the board by moving them to the final space on the track (above the tree).  In Hunde und Schakale, the movement of a piece depends on the positions of the other pieces on the board; a piece that moves next to an opponent's forces that opposing piece to be moved in the opponent's next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal in the German interpretation is to force your opponent to move all his or her pieces to their final five spots at the end of their track, and thus winning you the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
