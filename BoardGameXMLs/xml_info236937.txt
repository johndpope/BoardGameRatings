			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They came for you just before dawn, while you slept, a smelly sack pulled over your head. Your protests were met with blows from numerous clubs until you fell silent. Manacles and leg irons were bolted on and you were loaded onto a cart and taken to the dock (where else on the gods-forsaken island could they take you?). You were locked in a cabin on board a ship and you could feel the deck shift beneath you as it left the island that had been your home for the past weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
