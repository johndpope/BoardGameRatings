			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the grand and beautiful home of a strong and free people! Your character has the fortune to adventure in the Yeomanry, a bastion of freedom and democracy rare on Oerth. Rich in culture, history, and adventure, the Yeomanry provides ample opportunity for young and energetic adventurers to find their fortunes and become the stuff of legend! Unlike its neighbors to the north and south, the Yeomanry held against both giant and humanoid invasions and Scarlet Brotherhood infiltration, and its people possess a fierce pride that is visible in every aspect of their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document served as a concise introduction to the Yeomanry for players involved in Living Greyhawk convention/tournament play.  It includes character design restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
