			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rocky trail wound between the jagged boulders and the steep, brush-covered slopes to either side. Kor slowed his pace, watching the shadows ahead. Kiev, the young thief, walked along the right hand side, intent on poking through the brush for any interesting odds and ends, when he suddenly vanished in a shower of gravel and shale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Universal Adventures Greyshroud Ridge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Adventures Expansion Pack Greyshroud Ridge brings you 9 Event cards and 9 Search cards for the Greyshroud Ridge region first introduced in Expedition to Erathor. Face Ogre Bandits, Ambushes and the restless dead of the dreaded Forgotten Graveyard. And if you take the time to look around you&amp;rsquo;ll never know what you may find, or what may find you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although you may find some use for it as an independent product, Greyshroud Ridge was meant to be used along with the Greyshroud Ridge cards included with the Expedition to Erathor Adventure Module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for use with any fantasy role playing game, this expansion pack is highly re-playable and compatible with other Universal Adventures cards. In addition, you can combine the cards with other cards from the series, or cards from other Universal Adventures products, to create your own adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
