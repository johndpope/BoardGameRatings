			<description>Rules for Yavalax&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: Simultaneously create two or more rows of exactly four stones of your color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: Square grid board at least 13x13 in size, with a&lt;br/&gt;sufficient number of white/black stones to fill the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: n-in-a-row counts both orthogonally and diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: White starts by placing a white stone at an empty cell. Players then take turns placing two stones of their color at empty cells, one stone after another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each placement, players are not allowed to create a single&lt;br/&gt;4-in-a-row of their color, unless that placement simultaneously&lt;br/&gt;creates at least one other 4-in-a-row of their color to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that players may NOT make a single 4-in-a-row of their color on the first placement of their turn even if they can make a second 4-in-a-row on their second placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In no event are players allowed to create 5 (or more) -in-a-row of their color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to make simultaneous 4-in-a-rows of their color wins immediately, whether it was their first or second placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yavalax is inspired by both Yavalath and Connect6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
