			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;This is a world of animism, where all but the most basic technology is powered by bound spirits, conjured and caged by ritual and science. But in 1945 the Allies built a new device, a thinking machine: Colossus. The result was a war that killed half of all humanity, ruined most of the world?s cities, and turned even the weather hostile. But Humanity won. Britain, China and a few other nations endured the apocalypse, while others rebuilt from the rubble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, more than a hundred years later, electricity, mass-production and other such advanced technology is anathema - steam and cogs drive the great warships of the New British Empire, the soldiers of the United Republic of Asia take the field armed with sword and musket alongside vast uranium-driven land leviathan tanks, semaphore towers and horse-riders relay messages from town to town across the expanded territories of the United States, while gigantic Difference Engines calculate and compute in vast complexes below ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a world of Broken Gears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Gears is a complete game made available free for download. It includes both a novel setting of animistic steampunk, and an easily accessible system designed specifically for the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
