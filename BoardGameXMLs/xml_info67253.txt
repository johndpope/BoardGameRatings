							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talisman  (third edition): Lost Characters</name>
									
			<description>Games Workshop made a PDF file available for download from the main GW site containing four &amp;quot;Lost&amp;quot; Characters that Jervis Johnson found on a dusty server during one wind-swept evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Characters comprised the Necromancer and Wardancer that had been previously released in White Dwarf magazine #177,  the Ogre which was from White Dwarf magazine #179 and the Pit Fighter which was previously unreleased, but did feature in the playtest version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards feature miniatures taken from GW's large catalogue of games. The Wardancer is the same miniature used in Warhammer Quest: Wardancer and the other miniatures were taken from Mordheim: City of the Damned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of note is the fact that the PDF download did not actually have the correct fonts embedded in it, so users had to remake the cards before use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
