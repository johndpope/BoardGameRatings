			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unsung Story started off as a successful KickStarter for a spiritual successor to Final Fantasy Tactics. Originally slated for a 2015 release financial circumstances at the company and layoffs led to a delay. Playdek also switched the focus from the narrative-heavy single-player game that was initially promised, to a multiplayer player vs. player game leading to project backer backlash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
