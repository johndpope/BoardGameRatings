			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Count Rolet had been in clandestine cahoots with demons for years. Now they&amp;rsquo;ve got a landing in The Spice City and the fight to oust them is on. But the city goes after the Count before vanquishing the demons . Big mistake! Look at Brustin Vos with his lidless eyes and garments woven right into his skin. That&amp;rsquo;s the direction they want to go? Sure, Brustin is a powerful demon mage and he&amp;rsquo;s wallowing in bliss, but come on! Follow his lead? Demons will win for sure and reduce humans to pea-brains fed on sensual titillations. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to fix this. Search out Avlina. She&amp;rsquo;s a good commander - just young, just inexperienced. She&amp;rsquo;s not like you with multiple issues of Toys under your belt. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the whole picture.  So straighten out Avlina and banish the demons. Just do it. Do it for the Third Age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
