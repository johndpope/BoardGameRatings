			<description>Oodles of Utils is a tabletop boardgame that has been developed to encourage players to have fun while discussing 'tribal priorities' chosen blindly at the start of the game.  These tribes each prioritises two of the four points (Money, Health, fun and Goodwill) and are then rewarded at the end of the game for having 'lived' according to their 'tribes' priorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is competitive and cooperative, which creates a warm atmosphere and brings out the best in players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a two sided board, where players throw the dice and move around the board along the path. When players throw doubles they may move forward or backwards. There are 3 levels of play, from 13+ (younger with assistance). The game takes approximately 2 hrs, depending on how much discussions people have.  The game player numbers are three to six. Five players are optimal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to earn priority points by making decisions based on your tribal priorities. Lower value points may be traded with other players, thus creating an opportunity to cooperation with other players for a win/win outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
