			<description>Sneak Peaks is an adult NSFW party game of memory, concentration and XXX cartoon boobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sneek Peaks is a naughty game for perverts with a sense of humor. If you are reading this then you most likely are in fact a pervert or know someone who is... *wink*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By definition, pervert means a person whose sexual behavior is regarded as abnormal and unacceptable...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get ready for a HOT 15 minute funny flashing matching card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play is simple. Just lay out all the cards face down and take turns flipping over 2 cards at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each scene will be shown a bit different to qualify as a match unlike normal matching games where the image is identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person with the most matches at the end wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
