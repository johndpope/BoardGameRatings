			<description>Space race game. Object of the game is to move 4 satellites completely around the orbit in a clockwise direction and into their correct position in &amp;quot;Final stage&amp;quot; marked by corresponding colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement of satellites is by the roll of the dice with a 1 or 6 to start a satellite from inside its rocket to the blast off position to begin the orbit . The satellite then moves around the orbit by exact number of spaces indicated by the dice. If a player lands on his opponents satellite, he knocks his opponents satellite out of orbit sending it back to the start. Satellites may land on hazards which sends them back to their original position in the rocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The satellites are coloured marbles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Copyright 1958 by Quality - Craft Products&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed by Raoul Inmports Inc.
