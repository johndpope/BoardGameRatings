			<description>Suomi 1918 is a quick and easy-to-learn card game about the birth of the Finnish state and the civil war and the events that led to it. Can history have unfolded differently?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of 49 cards, of which 7 are victory condition cards. The remaining cards represent significant places, people, events, and social conditions during the civil war. These are in 4 colored suits: black (social turmoil), blue (peace efforts), red (socialists), and white (conservatives).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players each have a secret victory condition representing a goal of either the Reds or the Whites. They take turns placing cards in increasing sequential order onto 4 central piles (one for each suit) and try to achieve their victory condition without the state collapsing (completing the black pile) or reaching peace through compromise (completing the blue pile). Special event cards can also cause the top card of a pile to be discarded, temporarily stalling progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
