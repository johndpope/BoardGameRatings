			<description>Panic Mode! is a cooperative Disaster Recovery card game for up to 8 players. In 25 minutes your doors will open for business, your website will start to hit peak hours, newspapers will be published, blogs will be posted and it will be another day. The problem is your systems are down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mainframe, Morale and Customer Satisfaction tracking cards start at zero. You and your team must work together to recover all three to their safe zones by playing cards. Cards will either increment or decrement one or more tracking cards, and cards may align with your assigned role to have an additional effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If players can get all tracking cards to their safe zones in 25 minutes, they win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
