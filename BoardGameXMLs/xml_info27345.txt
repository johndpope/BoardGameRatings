			<description>This game was produced by Waddingtons Games for SKI (a British yogurt manufacturer) and was available by mail order from SKI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first team coach to get all four members of their team 'fit' by reaching 100 points on the SKI fitness scale. There are no dice; instead pieces are moved round the board according to the instructions of red movement cards. They gain or lose fitness depending on the blue activity cards drawn. Fitness is recorded on dials (SKI Fitness Scales).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
