							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">20 Questions (Pepys Party Game)</name>
									
			<description>A spoken party game in which players try to guess the object on the card using closed questions (that can only be answered 'Yes', 'No', or 'Maybe'). If players fail to guess correctly within 20 questions the answerer wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the BBC Radio panel game show (which was itself based on a US radio show derived from a 19th century parlour game) the package contains twelve object cards with enough information to answer most questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
