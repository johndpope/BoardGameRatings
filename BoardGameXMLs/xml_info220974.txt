			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we like to say, this game is not for the easily embarrassed, often offended, or humorless among you&amp;hellip; Forbidden is a game for those of us that revel in watching our friends squirm, get flustered, and curse loudly. If this is you, then welcome to Forbidden!&lt;br/&gt; All players split into teams and in each round one player will try to get his team to guess the target word, without using any of the Forbidden words listed on the card.  If the player can get their teammates to guess the target word they score a point and move on to the next card, the object is to score as many points as possible in the time allowed.  However, if the player messes up and uses a Forbidden word or says any part of the target word then the card and the point go to the other team.  Additionally, if you are caught using any of the Forbidden words then you must draw a Forbidden card, these can be beneficial, but usually they are an additional obstacle that you must deal with on your next turn. &lt;br/&gt; We also have four types of special cards included in the deck-&lt;br/&gt; Skip- Allows you to skip past a difficult card without a penalty or without the other team getting a point.&lt;br/&gt; Steal- This card allows your team to jump in for a round and try to guess the target words while the other team gives clues.  Any words that you guess first will score a point for your team.&lt;br/&gt; F@*K You- Use this card to pass the most challenging cards to the other team, they must start their turn with that card.&lt;br/&gt; Wild- This card works as any one of the other cards, your choice!&lt;br/&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s it, that&amp;rsquo;s all you need to know to play the game, simple right?  However every game is unique based on who you play with and with a massive deck of Forbidden cards to play through you should expect countless hours of laughing at your friends.  &lt;br/&gt; Forbidden- A mature game, for immature people&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
