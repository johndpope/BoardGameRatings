			<description>Flipped is a quick playing dexterity game. It contains a single hexagonal tile that is used to select which challenge a player must perform and is used to perform that challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players flip the tile onto the table and must perform whichever of the six challenges is pointing at them. Some challenges are solo and others require help from another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your speed and finesse to earn points by completing challenges. Whoever has the most points at the end is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
