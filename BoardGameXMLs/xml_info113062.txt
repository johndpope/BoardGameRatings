			<description>Flocki and his doggy friends play at retrieving socks. Each player chooses a dog disc, the sock tiles are briefly displayed openly and then turned over. The active player rolls the die, this is the sock the dogs should retrieve. All players now look for this sock and place their dog disc as fast as the can onto the tile they think is the correct one. More than one disc is allowed on a tile, they are stacked. When all have placed their dog the tiles are turned over: If you did find the correct sock, you score chip points: 3 if you were the fastest, 2 if you were second and all others score 1 point. If you selected a wrong sock, you lose points. Then you switch 2 sock tiles. When all chips have been given out, you win with most points from your chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
