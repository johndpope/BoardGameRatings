							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bits of the Wilderness: Into the Wildwood</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Into the Wildwood&amp;quot; provides evocative descriptions to liven up those miles of forest travel. It provides short &amp;quot;bits&amp;quot; of description and colorful settings that could be used to describe nearly any fantasy forest, regardless of the system. This is created to be an &amp;quot;on the go&amp;quot; product, which means you don?t need to read the entire work before you can use it. The descriptions are designed so that they can be randomly generated as you play or placed carefully ahead of time. It is written to be of use to both experienced and inexperienced Game Masters, particularly those who (for whatever reason) find themselves short on time or creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes 100 Bits of description, small pieces that can be stuck in anywhere a little description is needed, and numbered so they can be used randomly. Each Bit is also provided in index card format for ease of use by Game Masters. In addition, there are 75 other descriptions that may depict a particular place (bridge, road) or describe the seasons or weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material is indexed a number of ways to allow a GM to easily find a description to fit a particular circumstance. Several descriptions are graphically depicted in the interior art by Christine Griffin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are three unique forest menaces, written especially for this book by Chris Field. Provided are detailed introductions for use by the GM, and 3.5 Edition statistics of each creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, we are pleased to feature an article that looks at how to make forests in your game realistic and yet different from each other. Written by Professor of Biology (and long-time gamer) K. H. Keeler, the article includes &amp;quot;Forest Kits,&amp;quot; quick and easy sets of information on the plants and animals common to various types of forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
