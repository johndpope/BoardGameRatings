							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Perrenland Informer</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between the Yatil and Corrusk mountains lies the remote country known as the &amp;ldquo;Concantated Cantons of Perrenland,&amp;rdquo; or Perrenland, as it&amp;rsquo;s known to the rest of Oerth. Perrenland is a land of high mountains, grinding glaciers, alpine lakes, and small settlements. This also is the land of Lake Quag, the third largest body of fresh water in the Flanaess and home to some of its most fearsome monsters. To the north, the mountains of Perrenland fade into the steppes occupied by the Tiger and Wolf Nomads. To the south, the mountains mark the borders between an aggressive Ket, a tolerant Tusmit and a friendly Highfolk. Perrenland is isolationist in outlook and isolated physically, but to adventurers it represents some of the most rugged and unexplored terrain in the entire Flanaess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as isolated in the real world is the continent of Australia and the islands of New Zealand; both located in the South Pacific. These countries form the core of Perrenland for the Living GreyhawkTM campaign. If you want to join the campaign and you live in these countries, Perrenland is the place for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
