			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The John of Gaunt Expansion is a two-card expansion for Havoc: the Hundred Years War and cannot be played without the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion introduces John of Gaunt, son of Edward III, who led a series of lightning raids striking deep into France with a force of about 10,000 men. Later in life he helped his brother's son (Richard II) consolidate power during his reign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John creates his own special battle when he comes into the game before &amp;quot;retiring&amp;quot; to his estate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Rules sheet (double-sided with English &amp;amp; German instructions)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 John of Gaunt card, to be added to the regular HAVOC deck&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Chevauchees Battle card, two-sided (Side 1 is Calais to Tours, side 2 is Tours to Bordeaux)&lt;br/&gt;- 1 Plastic ziplock bag for Havoc game Tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It appears that this expansion, and a few other promos, were later combined to form the Havoc Character Card expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
