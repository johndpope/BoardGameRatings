			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate has indeed smiled upon you, and Fate is a fickle goddess, so you were particularly fortunate that it continued smiling long enough to get you back here on planes with which you are more intimately acquainted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When your friend and playmate, the human soul `Lonzo was stolen from you, while you spent a moment gazing at a particularly awe-inspiring sunset over Mount Celestia, you were not certain that you would ever see him again. When you decided to descend the Great Chasm in search of him, you were not certain you would ever see the Lands of Light again. Here you are though!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
