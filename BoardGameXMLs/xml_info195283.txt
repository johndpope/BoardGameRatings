			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the pilot of a top of the line Mechanized Bipedal Combat Platform, commonly referred to as a Mech.  You will customize your 25' tall Mech with a selection of weaponry and upgrades, and then hunt and engage the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This solitaire game is played over a series of turns where you may engage randomly generated encounters.  Attacks are made through die-rolling that can activate a variety of weaponry and standard attacks.  While you dish out damage to the enemy, you must balance the desire to rack up victory points against the damage and heat that your Mech will accrue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that you will need to play this game are 6 standard dice, 2 printed sheets, a pencil and an eraser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A gracious nod to Drew Chamberlain whose DELVE: The Dice Game was a strong inspiration for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
