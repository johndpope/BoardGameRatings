			<description>When the inventor/magician known as Old Man Bill suddenly disappears from his house in the middle of the desert, his friends, companions and pets start worrying: what could have happened? To solve this sinister mystery, they call upon their old acquaintance, pretentious game designer Jonas Kyratzes, who builds a magical portal into the Lands of Dream. Using this portal, YOU can now interact with the wondrous and colourful world of the house at Desert Bridge, and help Harold the Talking Picture Frame and his friends locate their master, Old Man Bill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
