			<description>Toss 'N' Roll Spooky Dice Math is a small-box game with a double-sided board and three glow-in-the dark orange dice.  The 16-page instruction manual includes directions for six simple math games, including Spider's Web, Big Numbers, Match Points, On the House, Shout Out and Prime Time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spider's Web: &lt;br/&gt;The dice are rolled onto a bull's eye board divided into eight pie sections labelled one through eight.  Depending on where the die landed, it is multiplied, added or subtracted from the number of the pie piece in which it landed.  No points are scored for dice which land in the exact center or off the board completely.  The winner is the first to reach a score of 300.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Numbers: &lt;br/&gt;Using the same board as Spider's Web, players roll the three dice onto the board, then scramble to be the first to find the largest three-digit number possible, using either the face value of the dice or the number slices into which they landed.  This game teaches place value and the winner is the first to reach 2,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Match Points: &lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls one die onto the spider web board, making a fraction with the smaller of the die or number slice value (on which the die landed) being the numerator.  When a player has collected enough fractions to be one or greater, he scores a point and starts over collecting fractions.  The first player to collect five whole numbers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the House:&lt;br/&gt;Using the game board with six numbered houses, each player rolls one die onto the game board.  If the die matches any digit in the house square on which it landed, the player scores.  Scoring involves adding each of the digits of the three-digit number on the board together, then multiplying by the die value.  The winner is the first player to reach 250 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shout Out:&lt;br/&gt;A designated shooter rolls two dice off the board and one die onto the haunted house board.  Depending on which of the six house squares the die lands, all players race to perform the required math operations on the three dice first.  The first player to be the first ten times wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prime Time:&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls the three dice onto the haunted house board, then looks for prime numbers amongst the sum of the die and door number, the dice themselves and the door numbers themselves.  Any missed primes may be stolen by other players.  The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
