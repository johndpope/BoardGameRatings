							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Who: The Lords of Time</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Gallifrey has been removed from space and time, but nature abhors a vacuum. It is up to the inheritors of their legacy to forge a new Gallifrey and a new order of the Lords of Time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Up to four players may play this game. There are four sides: The Eighth Doctor from Earth, Sabbath from the Moon, and Empress Miranda from the Throne World of the Universal Empire, and the cyborg Silver who has escaped exile from the Planet A2756.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the New Gallifrey space in the center of the board by exact count wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
