							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cube Conundrum</name>
									
			<description>Cube Conundrum is a simple-to-learn game that can be played in about 10-15 minutes but is designed to be extremely flexible and provide a different game every time, depending on how you set up the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use action cards to move their cubes from start to finish along a hexagonal path. The cards send each cube forward or backward one space on every turn. Depending on the cards in your hand, you may have no choice but to help your fellow players. However, chances are good they'll be repaying you in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card affects every player on every turn. Choose Wisely!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hexagonal path includes advanced/harder gameplay options for those looking for a longer game with some twists and turns. While strategy does play a role in this game, there is an equal element of luck-of-the-draw as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
