							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Interface of Time</name>
									
			<description>A skirmish level science-fiction miniatures game based on the short story &amp;quot;A Prayer Answered Just in Time&amp;quot; published in Gateway magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Nestled in the six extra dimensions of the Calabi-Yau Manifold (which is a plane higher than the four spatial dimensions of Hyperspace) every event in space in time meets with the Interface. The Interface of Time is a great ten dimensional construct which consists of archways that lead to any world at any point in that planet&amp;rsquo;s history. Humans can only perceive the first three spatial dimensions of the Interface. Thus it allegorically appears to them as a contemplative cloister with seemingly endless arcades leading forth from a monumental courtyard.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In this game one player plays the mysterious Virtue and his human friends. The other player plays the infamous Vice and his company of evil time travelers.&amp;quot; The object of the game is to destroy the opponent's four warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
