							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missile Match</name>
									
			<description>Missile Match is an abstract strategy game in which players use simultaneous movement to try to get four pieces adjacent to each other (orthogonally or diagonally) on a 4x8 board. Players randomly draw four dominoes and place them face down along the edge of the game board to &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot; missiles onto the playing field. The dominoes are revealed simultaneously. The number on the far side of the domino is the power of the missile and the number on the near side of the domino (closest to the player) is the distance the missile fires. If two missiles land on the same space, the one with the higher power wins and knocks the other one of the board. Blank spaces on dominoes allow for players to remove an opponents piece. The first person to get four missiles in a row in the playing area is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
