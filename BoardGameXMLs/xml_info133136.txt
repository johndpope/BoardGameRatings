			<description>In Andromeda Traders you are a captain in charge of your own space ship. You can choose to be a pirate, a smuggler or an honest trader. Choose you trade route, customize your crew, buy black market goods or trade in commodities. Or simply be a raider preying on the weak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a Captain, a ship and few resources. By flying from planet to planet you will build up your cash reserves by buying and selling goods or by picking up fee paying passengers. For the desperate you can even deal in illegal goods or maybe hire marines to raid other traders cargo holds. To travel further and faster you can also hire on board extra crew- helpful when outrunning nefarious traders who have eyes on your cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seek fortune on the trading lanes and be the richest person in the Galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
