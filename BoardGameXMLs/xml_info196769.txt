							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">rFactor 2</name>
									
			<description>Presenting rFactor, the racing simulation series from Image Space Incorporated. After successfully creating over a dozen products in the previous ten years, Image Space took the next logical step, creating a completely new technology base and development process. This new isiMotor 2.0 environment became the foundation on which many exciting products were built for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our newest creation, rFactor 2, creates a dynamic racing environment that for the first time puts you the driver into a racing simulator, instead of just a physics simulator. Changing tires, track surfaces, grip, weather and lighting make rFactor 2 a true challenge to any sim racer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
