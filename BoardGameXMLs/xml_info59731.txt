							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chronicles of the Drenai</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dark Heroic Fantasy RPG inspired by the Drenai series of David Gemmell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this RPG you will create your own heroes and pit them against the evils of man, the supernatural, and most importantly their own weaknesses, for love, loyalty and honor. This will be a game of hard, often deadly choices, and in fact it's very likely your character will bite the dust before the game ends. What matters, though, is that your character dies achieving something worthwhile. The central theme of this game is that it takes struggle and self-sacrifice to become a hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chronicles of the Drenai is a low-fantasy, sword and-sorcery style RPG that emphasizes action, adventure and moral dilemmas. The only characters available are humans, with no fantasy races like elves or dwarves present. The setting is a world much like medieval Eurasia, though with rather fewer nations- apparently the continent on which the stories take place is small compared to the reallife Eurasian landmass. Magic is available, but is usually limited and pretty low-key; only an extremely powerful sorcerer would be able to fling fireballs or lightning bolts in this milieu. The game uses a rules-light system designed to encourage cinematic action and make moral choices difficult, or at least costly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
