			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the quickstart set for Coriolis &amp;mdash; The Third Horizon! In this role-playing game, you take on the role of adventurers, travelling the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along your journey, you will experience marvelous things. Ahead lies the greatest adventure of all &amp;ndash; and who knows, maybe you will be the ones who change the fate of the Third Horizon for good?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the 'This Quickstart PDF' section:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF is just a taste of the full game. Still, the material in it will be enough to play a complete scenario of Coriolis &amp;mdash; The Third Horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLAYER CHARACTERS&lt;br/&gt;At the end of this PDF, you will find five complete premade player characters, complete with filled-in character sheets. The full Coriolis rulebook of course includes rules for creating your own characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES&lt;br/&gt;After this introduction follow two chapters with the core rules for playing the game. Chapter 2 explains skills and Chapter 3 describes combat. The full Coriolis rulebook includes rules for talents, for equipment and last but not least, for ship design and space combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DICE&lt;br/&gt;You decide what your PC does, but if your actions are especially risky, the GM will ask you for a dice roll to determine if you are successful or not. Coriolis uses only normal six-sided dice, but you might need a fair number of them. We recommend at least 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DARK FLOWERS&lt;br/&gt;This quickstart PDF contains a complete scenario, called Dark Flowers. It is designed to introduce new players to the rules of the game as well as the Third Horizon game universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
