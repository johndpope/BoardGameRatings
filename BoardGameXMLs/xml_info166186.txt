Each player has an allocated colour (white or black) and takes all the discs of that colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White starts by placing one of her discs on any cell of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From now on, starting with black, players alternate turns during the game until the victory condition is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, move an opponent&amp;rsquo;s disc to a neighbour empty cell, then take a disc from your reserve and place it on the cell that you just emptied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After doing this, take any isolated enemy discs that, as a result of this move, are fully surrounded by your discs or the borders of the board (if any) and place them on any other empty cells of the board. &lt;br/&gt; GAME END&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends in one of the following cases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    A player wins a game by connecting the two opposing sides of their colour with a chain of their pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    A player loses a game by having no legal moves available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
