							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Banishment</name>
									
			<description>Banishment is an asymmetrical, semi-cooperative card game about exorcism. It runs for 15-20 minutes and suits 2-5 players. Embrace your dark side and play the part of a monstrous Demon or join a desperate band of Exorcists attempting to banish it. Either side can win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Exorcists must resolve all Ritual cards in play to banish the Demon. This is done by playing cards to match Ritual components. They may alternatively choose to use their cards for effects to buy time and protection, but this sacrifices their action in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They must manage their resources carefully, as their cards can be played to satisfy the requirements of Rituals, but are also needed to defend themselves against Demonic attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Demon wins when their Demon Dice reaches 10, and each turn that passes brings them closer to their moment of victory. The Demon is more powerful than the Exorcists, taking more actions and  disrupting the Exorcists on multiple fronts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banishment is highly interactive and almost every aspect of the game can be manipulated with the right cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cult War expansion set adds powerful new relics to the Exorcists' arsenal, as well as foul magicks that favour the Demon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have two copies of the Banishment base game as well as the expansion cards, you can play the Cult War variant, a 6-player game where two teams called Cults attempt to be the first to summon the dreaded Dark One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
