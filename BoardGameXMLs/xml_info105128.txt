							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flirt</name>
									
			<description>In Flirt, all the players flirt with each other, until they get married at the end of the game. Who loves whom? And how much?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, each player flirts with all several other players. All the actions &amp;ndash; such as flirting, sending text messages or giving your heart away &amp;ndash; bring in flirting points. Who will flirt the best, gain the most flirting points and become the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; couple?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player receives a character (or two characters in a three-player game), two hearts belonging to that character and two relationship tokens, and a pawn, which is placed on the board. Then, each player thinks up a term of endearment for himself. When players address each other, they should use this term of endearment. A player who fails to do so correctly loses a relationship point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns. On his turn, a player rolls two dice, picks one, and move his pawn as many spaces as the die shows. (In a three-player game, the player rolls one die, and selects one of his pawns to move.) After moving the pawn, the player may flirt with one character of the opposite sex whose pawn is on the same space or an adjacent space. If he does so, this strengthens the relationship between the two characters. This is measured by placing flirting points on the &amp;quot;love barometer&amp;quot;. If two characters have four flirting points, they fall in love. After four more points, they get engaged, and after another four points, they get married.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, if the pawn has landed on a heart space, the player may either give one of his hearts to another player, or ask for a heart from another player (who then has to give one of his hearts to the asker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the pawn has landed on a text message space, the player draws one of the text message cards, reads it out loud and places it face-down in front of him. If no more cards remain in the draw pile, the player can either give one of his cards away or ask to receive a card from another player (who then has to give one of his cards to the asker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a pair of characters have married. Now, each player scores points as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    For the highest relationship status achieved (with any one other character): 4 points for being in love, 8 points for being engaged and 12 points for having married.&lt;br/&gt;    -1 point for each of your own hearts, +2 points for each heart from another player.&lt;br/&gt;    -1 point for each negative text message, +2 points for each positive text message.&lt;br/&gt;    +1 point for each remaining relationship token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has scored the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
