							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hemloch: The Long Shadow</name>
									
			<description>The Long Shadow promo expansion for Hemloch includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     4 alternate ability Location cards - These 4 location cards will also include the original Location cards on the back side, making it easy for you to mix and match which version of the Locations you want to use for your Hemloch games.&lt;br/&gt;     5 Scepter cards - The Scepters are a new item that can be acquired by players, similar to Trinkets and Potions. If the players wish to play with the Scepters, at the beginning of the game, 4 Potion and 4 Trinket cards are placed back in the box, and players will have access to 5 Trinkets, 5 Potions, and 5 Scepters during the game. When two of these piles are depleted, the game ends. If a player would gain a Trinket or Potion, he may instead gain a Scepter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be found contained in Hemloch: Midnight Edition as well as Hemloch: Midnight Edition Extras&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
