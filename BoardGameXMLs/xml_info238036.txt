			<description>A Shared Illusion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SlenderLARP is a game in which regular people encounter something beyond the real world, something irrepressibly powerful and surpassing human understanding. Characters in SlenderLARP are regular people with an interest in the supernatural, whether cynical or believing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character you develop will interact with the game world (the Slenderverse) in the way you choose. Your character can be a version of you &amp;ndash; a version who likes wandering around in the dark looking for monsters &amp;ndash; or a completely different type of person. You will have some basic stats which will be easy to keep track of during the game, and will govern the results of the actions you take..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
