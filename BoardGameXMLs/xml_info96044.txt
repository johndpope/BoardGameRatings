			<description>Players in FlashWordz need to create words quickly by mooching letter cards from one of their opponents and combining the letters with cards from their own hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player receives six double-sided letter cards from the 100-card deck and places the cards on their rack. On a turn, a non-active player starts the timer, then the active player races to create a word using at least one of the letters facing him on his rack and at least one letter facing out from an opponent. Words must be at least four letters long, and a player cannot use letters from more than one opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player calls out a word before time expires (and the word is valid), then the player scores the letter cards used in the word, leaving those particular letters face up. If a player uses all six letters in his rack or an opponent's rack, then he takes another turn (after players refill their racks to six cards). If a player fails to call out a word, the first non-active player to grab the &amp;quot;flash round&amp;quot; token from the center of the table creates a word and scores it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the card deck runs out and no one can create any more words, the game ends. Players sum the letters they used in words (with wild cards being worth zero points), then subtract the point value for letters that remain in their racks. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
