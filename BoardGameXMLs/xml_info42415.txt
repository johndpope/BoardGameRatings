			<description>In Dungeon Crawl, players take the role of a brave Hero or evil Dungeon Lord in this dungeon crawler adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dungeon Crawl's included campaign, the Heroes find a link to a huge, trans-dimensional infernal dungeon that is spreading throughout the underworld of Old Earth.  It is upon the Heroes to explore the dungeons, fight back waves of Monsters and assault Monster encampments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Crawl features a vast, flexible game system with many different play modes.  Play through the 35 Adventure Campaign with the Dungeon Lord, who fields and plays as the Monsters during the Campaign.  Pit your Heroes against your friends' own characters in the Deathblow Arena.  Play solo or with friends in randomly generated dungeons that don't require a game master, and fight mighty and cruel bosses that will test the Heroes like no other Monster has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat, the bread and butter of any dungeon crawler, is quick and simple, requiring only two rolls (attack and defense) to figure out if the player has hit, and how much damage he caused.  Gameplay is streamlined for quick play, so you don't have to sit around for hours on end on a single scenario.  Each player can take their turn in just seconds, so you don't have to constantly wait for minutes for someone to make up their minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players advance in levels to learn Skills, chosen from a list based on the Hero's Race and Class.  Try different Race and Class combinations for interesting skill sets!  Heroes can join Guilds to earn benefits, and must face trials to advance in Guild rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons are built from 20 available dungeon tiles, each complete with rooms and corridors.  In the dungeons the players will search for treasures in all sorts of different furniture, and fight over 50 different monsters.  Roll on charts or use the included cards to search for treasure or lay out the dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customize your games with a slew of optional rules.  Don't like the Heroes walking around with 50,000 gold in their pockets?  Bring in the Load rules.  Decided that traveling five weeks to another city shouldn't be a cakewalk?  Invoke the Travel rules to add some peril to their journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think your gaming group might not be up to more advanced modes of play?  Dungeon Crawl comes with Dungeon Crawl Basic, an even lighter-rules version of Dungeon Crawl, designed to get new players acquainted with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Crawl is a Print-and-Play game, and it comes with several print options, to make your game as pretty or as economical as you'd like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
