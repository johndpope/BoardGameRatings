							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Canberra visitor&quot; a game about our National Capital</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Canberra visitor&amp;quot; The Capital board game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended to provide an enjoyable and stimulating way of learning about Australia's National Capital.  It is also an effective medium for teaching, learning and practising a range of skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is based on a scale map of the city showing its geographical features, the major road system and the location of 40 places of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move tokens along a road system, determining their rate of progress by trying to avoid strategically placed penalty spots and chance spots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sketches and detailed information of the 40 places are given on large playing cards and players are exposed to daily life situations in the capital through the use of chance cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed instructions for 4 games, each of increasing complexity are clearly presented in a small booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
