			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A light-weight card game, a version of UNO, based on characters  from Project Shrine Maiden, a series of amateur shooting games for Windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of a deck consisting of coloured cards numbered 0&amp;ndash;9 and some cards with special effects, players are dealt 7 cards each. A card from the deck is drawn and placed on the table, and the starting player may then only play a card from his hand that matches number or colour. If he can't, he must draw a card from the deck. Play goes on until someone managed to get rid of all his cards and thus wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the cards with special effects, there are cards that change the turn order, cards that jump the next player's turn, cards that forces the next player to draw cards, wild cards that change colour, counter cards that counter whatever the latest effect was, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About every single card has a unique illustration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
