							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Supers! Character Sheets and Templates</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product offers two things, for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first is an alternative to the standard Supers! the Comic Book RPG created by Simon Washbourne (yes with permission).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second is more valuable. Lets just say you don't have an artist friend on hand, cannot afford to hire one (I'm cheap), or suck at drawing. Well here comes this product to help you out. Outlines for each major group of characters: boy, girl, adult strong male, adult thin male, and adult female (two versions) are put ON THE SHEET, for you and your players to just add a few lines and a logo. Its kind of like Hero Machine but uses just a pencil, everyone knows how to operate those right? The last upgrade was pencil 2.0, so most people should be able to use one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
