			<description>Lowest score wins! Keep your score as low as possible by eliminating as many numbers between 9 and 1 on your scorecard as you can. Roll the 6 color-coded dice (2 red, 2 green, and 2 blue), and add the color-paired dice together (example: red 5 + red 3 = red 8). Eliminate a combination of numbers that add up to your total from the corresponding color-coded line on your card (example: red 8 can eliminate 8, 6 + 2, 4 + 3 +1, 7 +1 -- among others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose carefully -- you keep going until you get stuck, with a combination you can't use. Once you've eliminated as many numbers on each line as possible, add up what's left and hope you're the lowest!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
