It took a toll of lifes estimated at about 50-100 millions of victims. It was one of the biggest pandemic in the mankind&amp;rsquo;s history. Over 500 millions of people got sick what was almost 1/3 of humanity at the time being. There were no parts in the world saved from the infection. In 2005 a group of scientists reconstructed a structure of the virus using samples collected from a tissue of a pandemic&amp;rsquo;s victim. 2 years later as a result of experiments on H1N1, scientists infected a monkey, which died with classical disease&amp;rsquo;s symptoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2013 the mankind paid for the mistakes, the virus got out of control. Till the end of 2014 about 700 millions of people got infected all over the world and a half of them died. The humanity tried to fight the disease by quarantining epicenters and isolating healthy cities with high walls. Infected people left behind the walls lost hope for a help. The world was overwhelmed by an anarchy...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a former policeman and member of Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Guard, the elitist squad keeping order in the last living city called Asylum. Together with your team search for a forsaken patrol missing in action outside the city. On your way you will meet people infected with the virus and groups of bandits living outside the city&amp;rsquo;s walls who are a big danger for every human being. You can use armored vehicles to travel and fight various kinds of opponents. And remember, there is only a few people you can trust like Mia, a mysterious girl living outside the city...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
