							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death at Spaporte</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Death in Spaporte, the heroes are recuperating in a spa town when they are caught up in a murder mystery. The encounter can be set in any area of your campaign world; all that is required is a small town. This Critical Hit is best played out following a recent triumph for the PCs when, as part of their reward the party is directed to the small spa town by a grateful NPC who wishes them to enjoy a little relaxation for their efforts. If they rescued or helped a person of wealth she may even pay for their stay at the Spa! Other plot hooks could include the PCs&lt;br/&gt;acquaintance with a wealthy or famous person who frequents the place and has invited them to join her at the splendid bathhouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
