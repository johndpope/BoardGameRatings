							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Penanggalan</name>
									
			<description>The Vampiric Yokai is yet another nightmare made flesh by the weakening of the balance. These parasitic monsters only purpose is to move from one victim to the next, draining the host of blood whilst riding the body in search of its next prey. From a distance it is hard to work out the unnatural, jerky movements of the poor soul&amp;rsquo;s body the Penanggalan uses to get close. By the time danger is confirmed the Penanggalan has either trapped its victim in its stare, or uncoiled from its host with shocking speed and wrapped its long tendril around the hapless soul, incapacitating them and allowing it to feed and then inhabit the body, wearing the corpse like a cheap kimono so easily discarded when its use is served.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
