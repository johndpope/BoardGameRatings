							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gramo The Grammar Game of Skill and Chance</name>
									
			<description>60 grammar terms and their descriptions are the basis of this Bingo-type 'educational' game. Each player gets one of 40 'GRAMO' cards, a 5 by 5 grid where each square has a grammar term number and it's description. The caller randomly pulls from the stock of 60 tokens, and reads aloud the column letter (G, R, A, M, or O), a grammar term, and optionally, that term's number. If that term's description is on his or her card, a player marks that square with a translucent disk, hoping to be the first to get five in a row. Can be played in three difficulty levels:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Playing by the numbers. The caller reads the column letter, term, and term number. This makes the game no harder than Bingo with some grammar terms thrown in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Playing by the book. The caller omits the term number, but players have access to a &amp;quot;Epi/Gramo&amp;quot; booklet in which they can find the terms and descriptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Playing for mastery. Players no longer have access to the book and have to recall from memory all terms and their description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player calls &amp;quot;Gramo&amp;quot; when he or she covers five squares in a row on his or her card, and once verified is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
