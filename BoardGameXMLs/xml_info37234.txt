			<description>Shirtsleeves to Shirtsleeves is an educational boardgame developed by GenSpring Family Offices, a wealth management firm. Its purpose is to encourage intergenerational discussions of wealth management within families. The game name comes from the saying, &amp;quot;From shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations,&amp;quot; meaning that a family fortune earned in one generation can easily be lost by another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was featured on the news radio program &amp;quot;Marketplace&amp;quot; and a version of the story can be found online here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/06/25/shirtsleeves_to_shirtsleeves/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/06/25/sh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A summary of gameplay, excerpted from the &amp;quot;Marketplace&amp;quot; report:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Every player starts with $25 million in play money and from there the game is kind of a cross between Monopoly and the game Life. You roll the die and move your piece along a snaky row of squares in the shape of a dollar sign...every turn, you have to draw a card...Everyone starts in generation one and after a few turns...You enter generation two and then three and there's a separate deck of cards for each.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the report, GenSpring is coming out with an advanced version of Shirtsleeves to Shirtsleeves that will let players control the outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
