							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Places of Horror, Volume 1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full color set of three 32 x 30 inch, floorplans of Horror Locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes Hex, Square and No Overlay and the VTT files for online use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also comes with the new DramaScape 360 map views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Places of Horror module includes three creepy locations for terror across multiple game genres. The first location is the lair, an abode for a queen type of monster to protect her brood. The second location is the skull maze, where a guardian monster lurks that watches over the sword in the stone in the center of the labyrinth. The third location is a sacrificial fire pit with a plank leading from a dais in the middle of the jungle. All three locations have 360 degree views included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lair makes for a grotesque horror themed abode for a fantasy or science fiction creature. It even makes a surprising secret cave location for a modern game or even a pulp adventure investigation. The skull maze is tailor made for a fantasy game. The sword in the stone is a legendary treasure and can have an equally legendary guardian. The skulls are from all the fallen heroes who have tried and failed to gain the legendary treasure by challenging the beast. The lava pit is a place of sacrifice suitable for games ranging from fantasy to modern pulp adventure. Villagers on a volcanic island use the lava pit to throw in sacrifices to the fire god to remain calm.  Or villagers rely heavily on sacrifices to a whole pantheon of gods to appease them. Finally it could be a place for a secret society to perform sacrifices and blood magic for their arcane arts. The visual look makes the lava pit an appealing map to use with our ancient temple map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lair scenario is the classic slay the monsters. A rash of monster or alien creature attacks are plaguing the area. The Player Characters are contracted to hunt them down to their lair and slay the beast that has been creating this swarm of abominations. &lt;br/&gt;The skull maze is the end point of an epic quest to obtain a legendary sword. The Player Character may need this legendary weapon to kill another strong monster, but must first get past its guardian to obtain the blade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lava pit adventure may begin with a kidnapping of a Player Character ally or romantic interest that has been &amp;ldquo;chosen by the gods&amp;rdquo;.  The Player Characters must stop the sacrifice and save their ally or lover from the villagers and their shaman leader. Then the wrathful god they worship may exact their vengeance, for example with a fire elemental erupting from the lava pit. The Player Characters must face this harbinger while trying to egress with the Game Master Character they saved and making sure they survive while fireballs burst from the angry &amp;lsquo;god&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
