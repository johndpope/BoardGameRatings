							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ill-Tempered Tikis</name>
									
			<description>The natural forces in the South Pacific are out of alignment. The balance of power between the Tiki gods is in chaotic disorder. The Tiki families are at war with one another. Be the first player to collect a complete family (5 different Tikis of a single color) and bring peace and harmony back to the South Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have a three card hand. Each turn you will draw one card then play 1 card. The cards on the table in front of you are referred to as your tiki family.  At the beginning of the game there are no cards in front of you so your first 5 turns are spent building your family.  They do not need to match to have them in your tiki family. You just can't win until you have 5 different tikis with the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
