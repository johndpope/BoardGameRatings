			<description>Ren is a 2 player abstract strategic boardgame. Players alternate turns placing their stones on the board, trying to score points by forming groups (ren) of 4 or 6 stones in a row or box formation. When a group or set of groups are formed, they are immediately scored, and immediately become vulnerable to the opponent, as the stones adjacent to the scoring stone become weak and are ready for removal.&lt;br/&gt;A lonely stone can be captured when totally surrounded, so there is a lot of movement on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ren is copyrighted, but anyone can freely download and share it. The pdf document contains very concise rules with examples and diagrams, as well as a Ren board and cutout pieces, so all you need is a pair of scissors, download, print and play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;download the pdf at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.mytaras.com/ren.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.mytaras.com/ren.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
