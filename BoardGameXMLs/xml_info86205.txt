			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In All That Glitters, the characters are at the end of a long trek; the kind of thing heroes undertake all the time. They have come to a small village named Havelock; little more than a market place ringed by a wall, and the party are in need of supplies and a replenishment of their adventuring gear. In any world where heroes travel great distances on quests, this sort of settlement should be very familiar to the characters and they will be glad of the chance to stock up on weapons and rations. In order to make the encounter really seamless, your players should have found themselves tested to the limit just before they reach the market town (the text assumes this to be the case: if you have a different set-up in mind, you will need to modify some of the text). With barely an arrow to share between them, your players should be keen to hurry into Havelock and get shopping! In this encounter however, a simple purchase goes horribly awry as the legality of the PCs' coinage is called into question. They are, in fact, the victims of a scam (more accurately a series of scams) in progress in the market place being perpetrated by a gang of accomplished thieves, calling themselves the Naturals. The crooks intend to take Havelock for thousands of gold coins in a single day and make good their escape before anyone realizes what's going on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
