			<description>Igloo is a turn-based Icehouse game for 2 players (or 2 teams) which can be played on any flat, stable surface. The game uses a standard set of Icehouse pieces and is set up in a similar manner, with the pieces starting out in stash zones that are not part of the playing field. Each player plays a single piece during each turn. The game ends after all pieces have been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls 2 sets of pyramids. However, only one set of pyramids will be worth points at the end of the game. The other set are decoys. Trying to figure out which is which, from the player's style of play and skill at bluffing, adds a level of intrigue to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete rules are available at Wunderland.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
