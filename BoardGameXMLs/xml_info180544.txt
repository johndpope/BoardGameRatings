			<description>Koi is a competitive set collection card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;You are a fish breeder who has been breeding Guppies and Minnows for fisherman to use as bait.&amp;nbsp; Recently you have decided that the real money is in breeding Koi, so you started to breed them in your Guppy and Minnow ponds.&amp;nbsp; You have figured out that 5 Koi gives you the right amount of genetic diversity without breaking the bank (because Koi are expensive).&amp;nbsp; You have also fallen in love with a certain color of Koi, and any Koi with this color is what you're after for your collection.&amp;nbsp; There's a problem though; your fish breeding neighbors have seen what you're doing and come to the same conclusion.&amp;nbsp; It is now a race to get to 5 Koi the fastest so you can start breeding and making money to buy out your competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object&lt;br/&gt;To collect 5 Koi with the same color in your pond (hand) before everyone else.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br/&gt;The color of Koi you collect is your choice and can be changed at any point during the game, as long as you end with 5 Koi that have the same color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
