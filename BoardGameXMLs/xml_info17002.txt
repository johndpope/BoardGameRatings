							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Houndcats Game</name>
									
			<description>Based on the Houndcats animated series, this is a typical early 70's spin the dial and move game.  The object of the game is to be the player that reaches the most &amp;quot;trouble spots&amp;quot; at the end of the game (&amp;quot;Sparkplug to the rescue!&amp;quot;).  A deck of cards is shuffled and the first card is drawn and placed on the appropriate spot on the playing board.  Each player then spins the dial once, and EACH player must move their playing piece with the intention of reaching the spot with the trouble card (the spaces on the spinner have a number 0,1,2, or 3, related to each players color so during each spin, each player moves their playing piece the number of spaces indicated for the color of their playing piece).  Pieces can move forward or backwards and any number of players can occupy the same space.  Once a player lands on the card that represents the trouble spot, the card is taken by that player and a new card is drawn and the process repeats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
