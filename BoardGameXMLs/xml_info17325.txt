			<description>Winner's Eye View is an auto racing game designed and published by a British race car driver and instructor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are fairly similar to those of the Avalon Hill version of Speed Circuit.  Cars are built by choosing levels of gearing, amount of fuel, type of tires, etc.  Speeds are chosen simultaneously on dashboards (which are also used to track fuel, tire wear, oil pressure, etc.) with maximum acceleration and braking amounts being observed (although you can exceed them if you roll for penalties).  Corners have maximum speeds posted in each space, although they can be exceeded for more penalty chart rolls or by staying on the racing line.  There are rules for slipstreaming and pitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game elaborates somewhat on the basic Speed Circuit model.  It tracks wear separately for front and rear tires, has a few extra cornering rules, and has optional weather rules (this is where the different tire types come into play).  The movement is also more fine-grained than in Speed Circuit - here cars move one space for every 10 mph instead of for every 20 mph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One track (Monaco) is provided on 10 A4 sheets which need to be taped together, and possibly trimmed.  Metal F1 cars are provided, as are metal arrows for the dashboard panels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
