							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alexandrian Wars</name>
									
			<description>Alexander of Macedon - possibly the greatest military commander of the Ancient World. From the outset of the Persian Wars in 334 BC and the eight years that followed, Alexander was never defeated in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combined use of shock heavy cavalry, massed pikemen and light skirmishing infantry distinguished Alexander as one of the greatest tactical geniuses of all time. Re-create the battles of Alexander the Great and his father Philip of Macedon, who consolidated his rule in Greece. Replay the famous battles of Chaeronea, Gaugamela and the Hydaspes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 44 scenarios included (20 historical, 16 hypothetical &amp;amp; eight from the Table Top Series) covering actions such as Chaeronea, Pelium, Gabai &amp;amp; Hydaspes. The Table Top Series (TTS) are scenarios made up of evenly matched armies based on points. Many miniature wargamers will recognize the structure of TTS battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the main game engine there is also a scenario editor included which allows players to create their own scenarios from scratch, edit existing scenarios and also create their own Order of Battles. Detailed instructions are included on how to use the editors, calculate points for your army and even modifying the stock graphics, called &amp;quot;Paint your own army&amp;quot;. 41 maps are also included in the game covering historical and randomly generated locations, so a large amount of terrain is available for scenario designers to create custom scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
