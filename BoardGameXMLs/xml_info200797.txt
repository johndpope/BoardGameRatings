			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t like being a spectator, listening to the Game Master reading you a story all evening, Insight Fantasy should be your #1 choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insight Fantasy has all the mechanisms you would expect from a fantasy RPG, but the main difference is the player&amp;rsquo;s ability to make significant changes to the story as the GM knows it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe you want to do something unexpected, something not described in the GM&amp;rsquo;s notes; something that would change the story. Maybe you discover something that the GM didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about. This is not just possible when playing Insight Fantasy; it is a major part of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is full of surprises yet to be discovered. Many items, persons, buildings, and locations have secrets to be revealed, secrets not known even to the GM. This insight is for the Player Characters to discover, Insight that may change the outcome of their adventures or even change the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    How to create adventures&lt;br/&gt;    Creating NPCs&lt;br/&gt;    Planning Encounters&lt;br/&gt;    Animals&lt;br/&gt;    Undead&lt;br/&gt;    Monsters&lt;br/&gt;    Creatures&lt;br/&gt;    General NPCs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insight Fantasy is a further development of the Insight RPG System, a universal classless system. The list of Skills has been modified to suit a fantasy setting, and some system functions have been changed, but&amp;mdash;all in all&amp;mdash;the core system should be familiar for those who have played the Insight RPG System. You do not need the Insight RPG System Core Rulebook to play Insight Fantasy; it is a stand-alone system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
