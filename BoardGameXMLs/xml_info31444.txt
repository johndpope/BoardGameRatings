			<description>This is an anti-Nazi game from the 1940's which was produced by underground opposition forces in Belgium during the Second World War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use a crude spring to launch wooden pieces onto a board with four sections of different point values. The two outer rings included the names of German cities. The third ring had cartoon images of top Nazi officials such as propaganda minister Joseph Goebbel. The inner ring - with the highest score of 100 points - showed Adolf Hitler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box for the game shows a picture of Hitler riding atop a German V-1 rocket and wearing a British royal crown.&lt;br/&gt;(excerpts from CBC news coverage)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
