			<description>Kasse-Gasse is played with a deck of 36 cards and a die. Each card shows a word from which one letter is missing. The die shows six letters: b, d, g, k, p and t (the 'plosives').&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the cards are shuffled, and eight cards are drawn and placed on the table, face-up. Then, the die is rolled. All players now search for a word on one of the cards that can be completed with the letter rolled. The first player that finds such a card and pronounces the word correctly gets to keep the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, a new card is drawn and the next round starts. At the end of the game, the player who has collected the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
