			<description>The game is played in rounds. In each round, a planet is picked. Players then try to conquer that planet by deploying the largest amount of troops. A conquered planet earns victory points. When Coruscant, the galaxies capital planet, is conquered, the game ends and the player with the highest victory point total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troops are represented by cards; each card has one of six colors and a number from 1 to 5 on it. A set of cards of the same color can be deployed as the force trying to conquer a planet. The total sum of the numbers printed on these cards is the troop's strength. The strongest army wins the planet, earning 2 to 4 victory points for the player who deployed that army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the game is based on 2008's &amp;quot;Clone Wars&amp;quot; animated TV series, some characters from the series are featured as &amp;quot;generals&amp;quot;. For each color, there is a Jedi/Sith leader or general that can be earned during the game and then played to add a +3 troop bonus. Available leaders are Commander Cody, Yoda, General Grievous, Anakin Skywalker, Asaj Ventress and Obi-Wan Kenobi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round, players rally new troops from the card deck to conquer the next planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is rather quick and simple, strategic options are limited, and some luck is involved in getting matching colored cards from the card deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an alternate name for this game: &amp;quot;Sith gegen Jedi&amp;quot; (Sith vs. Jedi).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
