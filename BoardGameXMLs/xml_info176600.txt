							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rondo, mit der gro√üen Drehscheibe</name>
									
			<description>Rondo  is a game for 2-4 Players, with a rotary disk on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rotary disk is transparent. Except the start and end fields the whole way with all fields are covered with this disk.&lt;br/&gt;The path on the board is seperated in 2 concentric circles, with the private starts at the outside and the private destinations in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base rule is a simple, role the die and move one of your four pawns in direction of your private destination.&lt;br/&gt;The pawns have 2 sizes. If your pawn is larger or equal as the pawn before it, you can pass it with a high die number.&lt;br/&gt;If your pawn is smaller than the pawns on your way you have to stay behind it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pawn can throw out each opponents pawn if the pawn reaches exact the position of it. This is independent of their size.  &lt;br/&gt;Some fields are marked. If a pawn hits one of the marked fields, the disk is turned with all pawns on it. The new position is reached, when the players pawn is on the next marked field.&lt;br/&gt;There are only some single links between the circles and only 1 link from the inner circle to your Destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefor the rotation of all pawns may move them nearer to the destination or they have to run a full round again because they were moved on the wrong side of the link.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
