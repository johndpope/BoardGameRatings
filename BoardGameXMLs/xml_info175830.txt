			<description>A sandy game for 2 to 4 players aged 4 years and up. Children love sand and enjoy playing with it. They fill their sand moulds and build the loveliest sand figures. So, why wait ages for the next holiday or moan about the rain? After all, there's this super sand game for at home! In Pass auf, kleine Krabbe you have to fill the sand moulds with sand and cleverly place the sand figures onto the game board. However, you have to think carefully about where you build: because the waves wash everything away that is too close to the water! The game ends as soon as all spaces have been covered by sand figures or waves. Now you have to count up, who has the most sand figures on the game board. The player with the most is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
