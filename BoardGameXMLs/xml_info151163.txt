			<description>2 to 4 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;36 Fetter cards in 3 suits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Pawn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Movement track&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are Norse gods trying to stop Fenrir from reaching and devouring Odin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the pawn on the first wolf spot of the track board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3 or 4 player game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer thoroughly shuffles the deck and deals out all 36 cards one at a time to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player to the left of the dealer goes first by asking one of the other players for a card by rank and suit. The player asking for a card must already hold at least one card of the same suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player that was asked has the requested card he plays the card to the table face up starting a discard pile (the cards should be fanned so that the rank and suit are showing). Then move the pawn along the track backwards the number of spaces indicated on that discarded card. Now the asking player continues his turn and may ask the same player or another player for a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player that was asked does not have the requested card then the asking player must discard face up onto the discard pile a card of the same suit asked and moves the pawn along the track forwards the number of spaces indicated on that discarded card and now the turn to ask passes to the next player to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gods win if they discard all their fetter cards before Fenrir reaches Odin, otherwise they lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 2 player game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards and the remaining 16 cards are stacked face down on the table. A player who does not have the requested card draws one card from the stock before asking the opponent for another card. The remaining rules are the same as in a 3 or 4 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
