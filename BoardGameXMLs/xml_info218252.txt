							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spider Pete&#039;s Treasure</name>
									
			<description>Spider Pete's Treasure is a children's skill and action game for two to four players.  You've caught Spider Pete burying his hoard of ill-gotten goods and it's up to you to steal his treasure using your spinning mechanical hook before he jumps at you. The first player to steal five rings wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player controls Spider Pete and the other player acts as the pirate thief.  The thief begins by rolling the treasure die to find out how many rings he must steal this turn.  He then winds up the mechanical hook and shouts go and begins trying to fish out the appropriate number of rings from the plastic tray.  The other player immediately begins rolling and re-rolling the spider dice, hoping to get two spider icons to show.  If the thief steals the correct number of rings first, the round is over and he keeps the rings.  If the Spider Pete player rolls two spider icons first, he slaps the lever on the back of the box to cause Spider Pete to leap out!  If this happens, the thief player must return any rings he stole this turn to the tray.  Players take turns being the thief and Spider Pete until someone manages to collect 5 rings and win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
