			<description>For the first time ever, the world&amp;rsquo;s Top 5 Boat Racers have gathered for an intense competition, and you&amp;rsquo;re there &lt;br/&gt;to cheer them on! Place your bets and let the regatta begin! You love your favourite racers and they love their fans. &lt;br/&gt;The harder you cheer, the more they love you and thank you for your support!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s just one catch &amp;ndash; being the SHOWBOATs they are, they actually stop to show you their appreciation! The more people cheer for racers, the more they show off, and the more they show off, the slower they go! Every time you cheer on a racer, they&amp;rsquo;ll slow down; but cheer on the leading racer, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get rewarded! Remember, it&amp;rsquo;s not just about cheering &amp;ndash; you also have bets that you want to win! Can you use your cheers and your influence to impact the outcome of the race and go home with the most money?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
