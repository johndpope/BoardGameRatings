							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightmare Keep</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What your players say at the start of Nightmare Keep: &amp;quot;Oh, look, an underground labyrinth filled with treasure. No one who's gone in ever came out alive. Gosh, we've never seen that before, oh no.&amp;quot; (Stifled yawn.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What they say early on in Nightmare Keep: &amp;quot;Hold it! What's going on? Oh, yucccch! We're getting out! This way, this way! What's that? Oh, no!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halfway through Nightmare Keep: &amp;quot;Okay. If we stick close and look sharp and don't act stupid, I think we might get out of this alive.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the climax of Nightmare Keep: &amp;quot;Oh no. Oh no.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A would-be conqueror is raising hordes of undead insects beneath Wolover's Keep in the Veilstone Peaks. This evil being was once a lich, a powerful undead wizard -- but that was not enough. Now something strange exists beneath the Keep, something repellent-and strong beyond measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightmare Keep: for the AD&amp;amp;D game adventurer with courage, a strong stomach, and superior firepower. This adventure is set near northwestern Cormyr in the Forgotten Realms, but it fits easily into any ongoing high-level campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
