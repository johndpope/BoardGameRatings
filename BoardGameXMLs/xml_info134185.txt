			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vampire Hunter 2: Darkstalkers' Revenge is an updated version of Vampire Hunter that was released exclusively in Japan only a few months after the release of the original.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minor tweaks and changes were made to the characters move lists and the combo system, such as the removal of air chains. The game features the same character roster and soundtrack as Vampire Hunter but removed the characters introduced in Vampire Savior. Oboro Bishamon, Marionette, and Shadow were included as secret characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
