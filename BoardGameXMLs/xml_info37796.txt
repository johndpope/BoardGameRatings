			<description>A Backgammon style game of Ghostbusters versus Ghosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghostbuster player only has five pieces representing the team of Ghostbusters. The Ghost player has twenty pieces representing ghosts. The game board is the same as a standard Backgammon board. However, pieces never exit the end of the board, they just keep going around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghost player wins by capturing (landing and remaining on) all five Ghostbusters, rendering them &amp;quot;slimed.&amp;quot; The Ghostbuster player wins by capturing all the Ghosts and placing them in a Containment Field (by landing on them and sending them to the bar.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
