			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This space-based top-down shooter feels very familiar, but adds some unique features. You take control of a space ship that is trying to find a lost expedition. While out on the search, the ship is besieged by enemies coming from all sides. The player controls the ship's location and speed. The player also has a variety of weapons at their disposal that can be unleashed to destroy the swarming enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-player game consists of 22 levels. The multi-player offers a versus score attack as well as 8 player death match. The death match also sports 8 unique ships that each have their own primary, secondary, and special weapons. This adds variety to the multi-player matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
