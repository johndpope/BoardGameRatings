			<description>Hey beer lovers! It's the Rocky Mountain High Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado and you're here for a good time - not a long time. You and your friends have arrived for a weekend of fun, food and beer, but the 'suds' stop flowing when local micro-brewing entrepreneur, Harry Hopps, is found murdered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Suspects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brandy Barleywine - Harry Hopp's partner in Crystal Springs Brewery and his devastatingly beautiful fianc&amp;eacute;e. Their explosive love-work relationship caused more than a few headaches for the now-deceased master of brew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hugh Guzzle - A Canadian beer expert, eh! Hugh, an official Beer Festival judge, has spent the past several years traveling the world in a quest to find a perfect beer. In his day job, Hugh negotiates foreign beer distribution rights for micro-breweries in many different countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lonnie Lager - The drop-dead gorgeous Public Relations Director for Crystal Springs Brewery, Lonnie is a past World Cup ski champion. She is perfect for the job of promoting beer - she has a bubbly personality, pale blond hair and a dry sense of humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bud Belcher - Owner of the upstart Belcher Beer Company, Bud has created a revolutionary new kind of beer. He plans to take the world by storm with his unique 'Millennium Beer' and is looking for investors willing to take a shot at the brass ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sabrina Hartles - The wicked witch of tabloid TV, Sabrina hosts her own television talk show. She has a talent for 'murdering' her guests' reputations on-air. Coincidentally, She is Harry Hopps' ex with a big score to settle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Skunky' Brewster - A pioneer in the micro-brewing industry. Skunky, is now retired and 'fermenting' in Florida, as he likes to say. Skunky is attending the Beer Festival to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award and to settle a few old grudges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra Guests Include: (Non-Suspects)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porter Stout - The local mayor and a man who knows a thing or two about beer-drinking. Porter has worked hard to get national publicity for the festival and will stop at nothing to ensure its success. A pompous politician, he likes to work the crowd at every opportunity. Good hand-shaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heidi Stein - A special guest from Munich, Germany, Heidi is at the Beer Festival to promote the upcoming Octoberfest celebrations in her country. A past polka champion, Heidi is here for a good time, not a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
