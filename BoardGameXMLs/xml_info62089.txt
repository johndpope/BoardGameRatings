			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move over warforged, a new living construct is coming into your game! Well, by new we mean old&amp;hellip;very, very old. The relluks were made to be stony protectors for a remote island nation several thousand years ago. Unfortunately, they failed&amp;hellip;the nation was obliterated before the Relluks could even be activated. They stood in droves for millennia waiting to spring to life. The time is now! Rediscover an ancient technology in these odd beings with menacing tribal faces, crystal souls, and bodies crafted from volcanic rock. Will they avenge their ancestors? What is the source of their power? What do they do now? You can answer all these questions and more when you step out of the pages of Remarkable Races: The Relluk. colorful and original illustrations await with expertly designed rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add some new life to your 4th edition D&amp;amp;D game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
