							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Bash</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Monster Bash (called Graveyard during development) is a side-scrolling platform  video game developed and published by Apogee Software on 9 April 1993 for the MS-DOS PC. The game features 16-color EGA graphics and IMF  AdLib compatible music. It was developed by Frank Maddin and Gerald Lindsly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided in three episodes or parts. The first episode of the game is available to download under a shareware license, but the two remaining parts of the game must be purchased. The registered game also removes advertisements and reminders of the benefits of purchasing the games from the first episode and enables cheat code functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls Johnny Dash, the ten year old hero of the game, whose pet dog Tex was just kidnapped by the game's main villain, Count Chuck. During a fearsome storm a friendly monster under his bed tells Johnny that hundreds of other pets have been kidnapped as well, and that Count Chuck took them to his Under World to transform them all into evil monsters. The 'bed monster' empowers Johnny with a bottomless pocket of rocks with which to arm his slingshot. There is a secret and temporary portal in his closet that operates as a passageway for Johnny to enter the Under World, in order to defeat the Count's army and save the pets.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Monster Bash , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
