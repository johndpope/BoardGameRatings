			<description>Bujingai (武刃街), also known as Bujingai: The Forsaken City and Bujingai: Swordmaster, is stylistically inspired by Wuxia films. Its main character, Lau Wong, is based on Gackt, who assisted in the development by providing the voice of Lau, motion capture, and fleshing out the setting and story.  The female lead, Yohfa, is voiced by Maaya Sakamoto. The antagonist, Lei, is voiced by Kōichi Yamadera.  Extras include subtitled interviews with all three voice actors, an alternate costume, character gallery, video gallery, and multiple levels of difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bujingai: The Forsaken City&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the player, the game is all about duelling swordplay.  The player can use walls to jump towards an opponent, use a flying attack, perform a jumping sword thrust, spin on beams and poles, as well as use magic.  As the player advances through opponents, new martial styles, magical spells and powers, weapons, and health/strength skills are acquired. With improved powers come improved graphics from multi-colored sword swings to full cinematic combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
