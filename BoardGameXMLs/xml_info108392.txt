			<description>Speak and remember: can you introduce yourself properly and get the number of eyes, noses or ears right like all good Mishmashian Martians from planet Mishmash?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each player is a Martian. In the beginning of the game, each player receives a portrait, which indicates how many eyes, ears and noses he has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player plays a card with an eye, ear or nose on it. He then has to call another player, using a prescribed phrase which includes the count of eyes (or ears, or noses, depending on the card place) the calling player and the called player have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player gets the phrase wrong (or hesitates to long), he gets an extra eye, ear or nose (again depending on the card played) which is added to his forehead by means of a ribbon each player wears on his head. This extra feature has to be taken into account in future turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player gains his fifth additional ear, eye or nose, he is out of the game. The last player to remain wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
