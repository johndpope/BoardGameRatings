							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Recovery Search &amp; Rescue Simulation</name>
									
			<description>As a new recruit to the Search &amp;amp; Rescue team you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to track a trail to locate important objects and missing person. Guided by the knowledgeable and quirky Ranger O&amp;rsquo; Farrell, you&amp;rsquo;ll use clues dropped by park visitors to help you track a trail. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a journalist, they may have dropped a notepad which contains details on where they are planning to go. Or if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone who has a medical condition, you might come across an insulin pen that will need to be returned to its owner as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Excalibur&amp;rsquo;s Emergency Services PC Games range, in Recovery Search &amp;amp; Rescue you&amp;rsquo;ll need to adventure under the warm rays of the sun but also in the cold, dark embrace of night. If you need to search at while it is dark you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use torches and night vision goggles to assist you in your mission. Whatever the job, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to display an expert level of vigilance to look for clues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking place over a massive map, you&amp;rsquo;ll have caves, mines, monuments, forts and more to explore. But don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the vast distance as the specially designed S.A.R bike will help you get from A to B in no time at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in Excalibur&amp;rsquo;s Recovery Search &amp;amp; Rescue Simulation is a mission editor which was used to create all of the missions included in the game. Once you create a mission you can share it online with the world and download missions created by other people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features of Recover Search &amp;amp; Rescue Simulation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A massive map to explore&lt;br/&gt;    Trek through the wilderness during the day and night&lt;br/&gt;    Avoid natural hazards like quick sand, tar pits&lt;br/&gt;    Dozens of manmade objects to explore&lt;br/&gt;    Use the S.A.R bike to get to your destination quickly&lt;br/&gt;    Create your own scenarios with the mission editor and share them online with others&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
