							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pathways To Leadership</name>
									
			<description>Leadership is a set of skills that anyone can learn to use effectively. Some people are natural leaders, while others craft and hone their leadership skills. Regardless of leadership ability, this game will provide the opportunity to define specific leadership traits within six domains, provide the opportunity to interact and practice these traits with peers, and test knowledge of leadership trivia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to complete an individual path to leadership. The path for each player is unique (as it is in life) and has many obstacles to overcome to reach the finish line. Each player is challenged to make positive leadership decisions, recognize leadership traits and identify prominent leaders from many different cultures . Each play engages at least two of the players and some involve all four. The game ends when all players have completed their individual paths to leadership. Scores are tallied and used to determined leadership strengths and weaknesses for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;    * Board Player pieces&lt;br/&gt;    * Trait cards&lt;br/&gt;    * Scenario cards&lt;br/&gt;    * Leader cards&lt;br/&gt;    * Time piece (sand glass)&lt;br/&gt;    * Four sided die&lt;br/&gt;    * Score card&lt;br/&gt;    * Observation cards&lt;br/&gt;    * Leadership domains and trait description cards&lt;br/&gt;    * Leader list cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
