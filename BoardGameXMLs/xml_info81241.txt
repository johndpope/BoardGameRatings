			<description>For many centuries the treasures of the pharaoh lied hidden in his tomb until the player discovered the entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Pharaoh's Curse, one must collect one treasure from each of the screens of the game laid out in a 4x4 matrix. An extra life is awarded for each treasure, and which treasures are still missing from the tomb is displayed in a summary line at the top. In doing so there appear regularly two opponents, the pharaoh and the mummy, which then chase the player. The player should shoot them faster than they may do this with the player. Also, visible traps are arranged in the screen, which are triggered after a short delay by stepping on them. Additionally, there are keys which may open magic gates, whereas a key may not be transported through an also already opened gate - so one must collect a key nearby the desired gate. Lastly, there is a flying creature, the Winged Avenger, which picks the player on contact, carries him through the screens and drops him somewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all treasures have been collected, the player must still escape into the starting screen. Subsequently, one receives a level password and the game restarts in a higher of the four difficulty levels. On leaving a screen there will be switched to the next one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pharaoh's Curse (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
