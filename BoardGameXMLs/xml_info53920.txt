							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beyond the Prism Pentad</name>
									
			<description>The relentless passage of time sweeps across the burning plains, and the world beneath the crimson sun changes in its wake...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dragon of Tyr is gone, his evil scattered on the scalding winds. Torrential rains fall over the Sea of Silt, spinning off deadly storms that can strike anywhere in the Tablelands with only a moment's notice. Violent upheaval rocks the city-states of Raam, Draj, and Balic after the deaths of their sorcerer-kings. A new age has dawned on Athas, but will it be an age of restoration--or of destruction?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the Prism Pentad summarizes the key events from the Prism Pentad novel series and role-playing game products and updates all DARK SUN campaigns in anticipation of the revised campaign setting, DARK SUN: A New Age, featuring:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The key events of the first 10 years of campaign time, with a detailed timeline of historical events.&lt;br/&gt; - Updates and details on the changes in the world, including the seven city-states of the Tyr Region.&lt;br/&gt; - Statistics for the major personalities, including Rikus, Sadira, and the remaining sorcerer-kings.&lt;br/&gt; - A short adventure to tie player characters into the events of the climax of the Prism Pentad series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What forces have seized control of Raam and Balic? Who is the real power behind Draj? How are the citizens of Tyr handling their second decade of freedom? The answers to these questions--and many more--are awaiting you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
