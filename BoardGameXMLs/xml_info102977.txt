							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Follow Me!: Mission #1 â€“ Viva La Resistance</name>
									
			<description>User Summary w/ Publisher Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced by BOA Publishing, this unofficial expansion of the Ambush! family of games requires only the base game to play. This stand-alone mission is the first installment of a planned 4 part series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viva La Resistance places your squad in a semi-quiet sector of the front line in France. Your squad is ordered to make contact with French Resistance fighters who have arranged to link up with U.S. forces in order to pass off a downed B-17 officer that needs to be escorted through friendly lines.&lt;br/&gt;Along with your normal choice of weapons your squad will be issued Rifle Grenades and two adapters. Rules on the use of these are included with the mission. You also receive 14 new soldier cards printed on hard cardstock. There are 6 pages of new paragraphs and 2 conditions also printed back to back on hard card stock. Set includes one minor vehicle (a horse drawn wagon), and a counter for this vehicle is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a long mission as far as time to complete is concerned. Quite a lot of game time is spent in Rounds instead of operations, which tends to slow things down quite a bit. This mission can also turn deadly very quickly. If you're using a squad built up during the course of the entire series be extra cautious, don&amp;rsquo;t win at all costs. Proper tactics will aid you during this mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
