			<description>The game differs from other racing games in that the races take place on an elevated race track, with nothing to stop the player from accidentally driving off the side. Most race tracks in the game have gaps in them which will cause serious problems to the driver if he or she fails to clear them. If this occurs then the player's vehicle is hoisted back onto the track (by a nearby crane) which costs valuable time. Turbo can be used to make a car go faster, but it can only be used for a limited amount of time in each race. The game received positive reviews when it was published. The game's 3D tracks resembled a roller coaster and were something new for players. Stunt Car Racer is often described as an especially fun racing game due to its special kind of track design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Stunt Car Racer , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
