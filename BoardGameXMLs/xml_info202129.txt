			<description>At 200 MPH only inches separate your car from the car behind you. Anywhere else in the world and you would be cursing the driver. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t just any joy ride. This is the world championships and as frightening as it may be, he&amp;rsquo;s giving you the speed you need to win it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draftcar is a 2 to 10 player drafting &amp;amp; racing game. Use clever card play to reposition race cars and get your car in the lead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Racing, drafting is the term used when two or more cars drive close together at high speeds to reduce the effect of drag on their car so they can go faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In card games, drafting is a term used to describe players having to choose from a subset of choices and potentially leaving the other choices for other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
