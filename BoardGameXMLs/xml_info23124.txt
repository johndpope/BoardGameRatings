			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Auction - can you unmask the murderer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 12 to 40 guests!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At &amp;quot;The Auction&amp;quot; you will play a character in a fascinating plot of mystery, double-dealing, bribery, blackmail and intrigue. You will not just be watching, you will be completely involved in the wheeling and dealing. Can you outbid the opposition, keep your dark secret quiet and unmask the murderer? There is only one way to find out!&lt;br/&gt; A week before &amp;quot;The Auction&amp;quot; all of the guests attending will receive the front page of &amp;quot;Yesterday's News&amp;quot; - the antique dealers' magazine. This explains the background to the auction, the unfortunate death of Baroness Audry Von Munchen and the relics found on her last archaeological expedition. There will also be a copy of the guest list with a brief description of everyone attending the auction, including the character you have been given. This might be a lord, lady, the butler, a priest or even a spy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the day of the event the guests will be met by you, acting as the solicitor of the late baroness. When everyone has arrived you call the gathering to order, welcome the guests and introduce Inspector Clu d'Eau. As the events start to unravel, everybody opens their own personal envelopes of information and finds out what they have been up to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guests are soon the suspects as they start questioning, bribing and blackmailing each other. Towards the end, the auction itself takes place. All the deals and maneuvering come to fruition in a competitive flurry of bidding. After the auction the various claimants to the money make their cases and the solicitor decides between them. Inspector Clu d'Eau announces that he has solved the mystery of who has murdered the baroness. Everyone has a chance to make their accusations before the inspector reveals all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a boxed version of a murder game, &amp;quot;The Auction&amp;quot; provides you with everything you need to run a fun, participative event for 12 to 40 people. Every guest has a character, with their own objectives and money and/or props, making the game both memorable and enjoyable for all kinds of people. We have been running &amp;quot;The Auction&amp;quot; since 1989 for a wide range of companies and businesses such as IBM and American Express.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because some of the guests at &amp;quot;The Auction&amp;quot; will have to play the part of criminals (including a drug-dealer) we think this game is suitable for people aged 15 and over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have looked through the introduction, and like what you see, you should buy a password for the main game from our shop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
