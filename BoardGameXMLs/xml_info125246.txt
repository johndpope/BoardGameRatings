							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Road Junction</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two moderately busy streets meet at this urban intersection. Both streets boast a single spacious lane leading into either direction. Usually these lanes are shared by automobiles, motorbikes, scooters and cyclists. This can lead to quite chaotic conditions during rush hour. At least pedestrians are restricted to their equally spacious sidewalks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lanes and sidewalks are separated by hip high cast iron railings and traffic is regulated by a number of traffic lights. But especially during rush hour or when the roads are slick from recent rain, as it is now, it is not uncommon for a handful of police officers to keep an eye on traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intersection is, at least at street level well lit by the street lamps lining the lanes on either side. And thanks to the regularly spaced trashcans both streets and sidewalks are usually clean and clear of rubbish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the sidewalks the streets are lined by some of the cities smaller high rise buildings, and in one case by the construction site of a newer skyscraper. Most of these high rise buildings are older constructions modernized with minimal effort. At the very least the fronts facing the streets have been polished up with new marble facades, even if most landlords were to stingy to install elevators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ground floor of the buildings usually houses one large or several smaller businesses. These can be everything from bakeries and restaurants, to jewelers and banks. The floors directly above often contain offices, either for the businesses below or small law firms and the likes. The top floors are made up of affordable apartments, often enough housing the people employed a few floors further down in the very same buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
