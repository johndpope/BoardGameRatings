			<description>This game allows the player to compete in a race with either Grand Prix style cars (similar to Micro Machines) or with vehicles designed for off-roading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obstacles must be avoided and opponents must be overtaken in the Grand Prix game titled Dirty Racing while hills, bumps, and sharp curves must be navigated in the off-road event titled Dirty Racing. Players in the Dirty Racing mode are informed of any sharp turns by making them look on top of their windshield. This game can be used with the GameLink cable to provide two-player fun and entertainment. Each variation has a map with plenty of statistics. Players must qualify before each race and start out with local meets before working up to the big championship. The maps are generic and do not show any nation in particular. Players can also practice before each race in order to tune up their skils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dirty Racing has three difficulty levels: Taking It Easy (easy), Hazardous! (medium), and Totally Dirty (hard). At the shopping cut scene, players can purchase tires along with engine boosts and nitro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Race Days&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
