			<description>Freakball Team Manager is a express game, based on Blood Bowl Team Manager by Jay Little.  The game was created for the 2013 Express/In a Tin Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 players roll dice to determine their roster of &amp;quot;freaks,&amp;quot; and resolve events in a futuristic, American-Football game.  After each of 5 weeks in the game, the players can spend points to upgrade their team with better players, skills, or buy more fans of their team.  The player with the most fans at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
