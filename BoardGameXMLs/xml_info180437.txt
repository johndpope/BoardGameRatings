			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lighthouse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A child prodigy, Avery Albright saw his work with light manipulation turned into weapons. Angered by this, he created a suit of powered armor that incorporated his lightmanipulating technology. Taking the name Lighthouse, he now seeks to destroy all weaponry based on his work, as well as expose government cover ups and crimes to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to Lighthouses statistics, there is a higher powered 2.0 version featuring a versatile and more powerful version of the character to oppose your heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guest starring Colonel Freedom, a government sponsored superhero whose first mission is to capture Lighthouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
