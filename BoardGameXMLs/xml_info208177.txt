							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curses &amp; Gifts for MYFAROG</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curses &amp;amp; Gifts is a small supplement for MYFAROG, with a variety of new options for myth masters and players alike, as well as more setting information. Most of the contents is related to the religion of Thul&amp;ecirc;, but there is also other new contents. Some of the information in this small book was included in the first edition of MYFAROG, but most of the information is brand new, and all of it is adjusted to the second edition of the game. Most of the new rules and information in this booklet are very modular, meaning you can easily include them, or only parts of them, if you so wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
