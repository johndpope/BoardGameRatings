							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Comet: Crete 1941</name>
									
			<description>This is a game for two players (representing German and Allied forces) and is played out on the island of Crete, in the Eastern Mediterranean, in May 1941.  German parachute and glider troops began an assault to seize control of three airfields along the North coast at 0600 on 20 May 1941; they were to be followed by airborne and seaborne reinforcements.  COMET - Crete 1941 focuses on the action around two of the German objectives &amp;ndash; Maleme airfield and Souda (COMET was the German codeword for the western assault).  The German player&amp;rsquo;s aim is to obtain a foothold so that follow-on forces can land and take permanent control of the objectives.  The aim of the Allied player is to prevent the German reinforcements from landing and subsequently to defeat the assault forces.  The game is played in alternate turns each player being able to move playing pieces and make attacks against their opponent in succession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
