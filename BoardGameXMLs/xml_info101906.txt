							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inconfidentes</name>
									
			<description>In the year of 1787, Brazil was still a colony of Portugal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Portuguese empire imposed high taxes (called &amp;quot;Derrama&amp;quot;) upon the wealthy ones, trying to get as much gold as possible. Under pressure, influential Brazilians gather to organize a liberty movement by writing articles, poems and manifests,  spreading freedom ideas taken from USA's recent act of independence and from the French Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group of conspirators, called Inconfidentes, gathered on the state of Minas Gerais, a place that concentrated a lot of gold and valuable gems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are six characters on the game, five of them are Inconfidentes: the poet, the farmer, the bachelor, the soldier and the priest, each of them with a unique power. The last one is an imperial guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each round, players choose and move the Inconfidentes, however more than one play may select the same character. Whenever this happens, they must blind bid to decide who will be the leader of that character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players vie to spread the ideas through publishing texts (tiles) and hide them around the city, Ouro Preto, formerly named as Vila Rica, and get the population's approval, supporting the struggle to make Minas Gerais free from Portugal. These conspirators also made part of Freemasonry's secret association, and they try to build the first Freemasonry's secret house to support their fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they publish their own texts and get the texts from the others, players make &amp;quot;inconfid&amp;ecirc;ncia&amp;quot; points (victory points). Furthermore, a character may become a Freemason. If a player manages to get to the 33rd. degree of Freemasonry (all five characters become Freemasons), he becomes a Master Freemason. This gives an alternative ending to the game by finishing the game earlier, and changes Brazilian history! setting Minas Gerais free from Portugal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no one gets to be a Master Freemason until 1789, the year of the ninth and last round, everyone goes to jail. &lt;br/&gt;The player with more points (tiles) from texts published by other players, gold retrieved and Freemasonry degrees is the &amp;quot;inconfid&amp;ecirc;ncia&amp;quot; martyr and the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to forget that the historic martyr, Tiradentes, became widely famous afterwords, although was unfortunately killed, hanged for treason by Portugal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
