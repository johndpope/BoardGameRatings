							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alphabet Game</name>
									
			<description>Game published by Chevrolet in their promotional publication called Chevrolet Motoring Fun Game Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you are provided with a scene of the family enjoying a picnic. The game is to see how many things you can find that begin with a different letter of the alphabet. I think it was intended to be played in the car on a long journey. So, after a pre-agreed time limit, the first player must pass the picture over to the next player, probably in the seat next to him or her, and that player must see if they can find more than the first player, and so on, until everyone in the car (hopefully not including the driver) has had a turn. The board suggests that if you can get 18 right that would be rated as a 'Fair', 20 right 'Good' and 22 'Very good'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
