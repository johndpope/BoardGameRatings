			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Talomire is an island kingdom in the north of the world. Isolated from its neighbours by both its geography and its philosophies, it is unique in its religion and practices, its only exposure to the outside world coming from occasional travellers, or sea-faring merchants coming to trade their goods with the upper echelons of Talomiran society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is into this world you are setting foot; a world where magic is rare, dangerous and outlawed, where the wrong religious belief can spell a terrible end, or the chance of one's birth can be the difference between a life of means, and a life of terrible slavery. Fare well, adventurer. The wilds are terrible and dangerous, outmatched only by the machinations of the civilised and the powerful...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Introduction to Talomire...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document is designed for players to introduce themselves to the nation of Talomire, and for GMs  to see the realm from the perspective of the people who live within it. The realm is a dangerous place where magic is both illegal and wild, where the church rules with an iron fist, and where parties can risk life and limb for the the treasures and infamy of an adventuring life...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What Can I Expect?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Primer is designed to give players everything they need to build a fully realised backstory in the world of Talomire, and to give GMs the view of the world from the perspective of the common man. Be it race relations, maps, a starting village, legends of the realm, this Primer is set up to contain everything that we would love to know about a world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
