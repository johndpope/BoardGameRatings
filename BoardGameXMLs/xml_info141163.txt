			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Quick, Watson!&amp;quot; is a game of elementary deduction which allows you the opportunity to match specific criminals to specific crimes. All of the crimes were committed during the great train robbery in England.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After more than a year of searching, Scotland Yard rounded up seven suspects for the four crimes committed. The four crimes are assault, felony, theft, arson and illegal parking. The suspects (known criminals) are, Snidely, Brutus, Ivan, Nick, Tex, Dudley and Merle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have up to eight trials (after which time the statute of limitations runs out) to match the right criminal to the right crime. Remember, one criminal could have committed more than one of the crimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notice that you have a lie detector to help you keep track of your suspects for each trial. But, it only tells you if you have pegged a suspect to the right crime or if you have named a guilty suspect to a wrong crime. It does not tell you which one(s) of your selections is correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
