							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartoona: Expansions â€“ includes Heads on Tails and Long Necks</name>
									
			<description>Inside this box are two expansions for the creature-building, tile-laying game Cartoona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heads On Tails expansion allows Cartoona players to build wacky two-headed creatures. Included are 3 new tiles and 3 new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Long Necks expansion includes neck tiles that can be placed in-between a head tile and a body tile. These neck tiles can be placed even when the head and body have already been connected, and multiples can be played for some seriously long necks! Neck tiles can also be placed on the creatures of your opponents to disrupt their strategy, or even take away points! Included are 6 new tiles and 4 new cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both of these expansions require the Cartoona base game to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
