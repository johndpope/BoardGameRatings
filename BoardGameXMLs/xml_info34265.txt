							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boom: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Boom is a card game (for 2 or more players), which sees players avoiding a Bomb that could explode at any moment. Players will use cards from their hand to get rid of the Bomb, should it come their way, by passing it to another player. If a player receives the Bomb and cannot pass it to another player, they &amp;lsquo;explode&amp;rsquo; and are out of the game. Also if a player runs out of cards, they are also out of the game. The last player remaining will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
