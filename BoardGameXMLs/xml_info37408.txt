			<description>(From back of box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SNAPZ is a fast action family game for 2 to 4 players or teams.  It requires the electronic SNAPZ umpire and the category and alphabet cards provided.  The random interaction of these cards produce thousands of possible answers to the simple questions posed, (for example: give a name beginning with the letter for the category shown). But watch out!, at any time the game can increase in speed with the MIME TIME cards - momentarily turning the game into a fast and furious round of charades.  The aim is to get rid of all of your cards by placing them back on the SNAPS unit or to an opposing player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
