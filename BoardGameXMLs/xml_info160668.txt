			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World Cup Manager 2002 is a football (soccer) management game where you take on the role of a coach in the 2002 World Cup.  The matches are presented as a running commentary on the action.  You are able to determine training options between matches, and press conferences are held in which you select what response to give to questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an editor built into the game allowing you to fully edit all player and team data.  The game also includes additional national squads allowing a different selection of teams to take part in the world cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
