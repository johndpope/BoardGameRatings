			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You wake up from a dream in which you were being eaten by a ghoul. All you can remember was hardly being able to breathe, paralysed, and trapped in a cold vault lit by one old candle. This creature that resembled a normal human being at one time was dragging itself on its stomach toward you. Its fingernails were overgrown and stained with old blood and dirt. Its face, and its flesh was grey, and there were dark blemishes blotched across its back from when it had died. The mortis stains hadn't cleared away from beneath its wrinkled skin. All you can recall from this nightmare was its teeth biting into your forearm, your blood leaking out on the floor, and your muscles being gnawed on desperately. The sound of the ghoul biting down onto your forearm bone was what woke you up. The crunch... the gurgling... the hissing delight of laughter...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting off the pit of nausea, you peer around the room you're currently in. Your head is throbbing in pain. It appears to be a cell or a dungeon. Insects scuttle across the floor away from you back into the dark shadows as you come to. Some light from the moon outside is shining in through the barred slit which makes the window, even if you wanted to escape using the window, you wouldn't even be able to fit your head through it. There is a large, heavy door with iron grates set into the stone wall ahead of you. It has no handle, only a tiny keyhole, and a square window with three thick bars across it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever put you in here had made the intention clear that they did not want you to escape while in their absence. When the headache subsides you are able to get to your feet without suffering from too much dizziness. There is no bedding in here, but unknown lumps in the inky corners, and what looks like straw strewn about. There's another cell door across from your room, and you cannot see anything else left or right but tunnel. There is no noise either. The place is silent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
