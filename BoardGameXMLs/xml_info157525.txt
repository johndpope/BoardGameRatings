			<description>Based on the book by Jonathan M. Estes, Smart Green: The Board Game puts players in the role of small business owners looking to go green while still making money.  Players will collaborate on projects, making progress toward converting their supply chain to sustainable practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to go completely green is the winner.  The change isn't easy, though, and players will have to stay profitable to meet the goal.  Smart Green: The Board Game combines negotiation and resource management gameplay while teaching players about the principles in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
