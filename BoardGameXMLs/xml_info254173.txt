			<description>Who would win in a fight, a zombie or an alien? A giant Kraken or a fire-breathing dinosaur? A robot or a mad scientist? Now it's your chance to find out with a new card game from  Alternate Histories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way you play Monster Fight is simple, and it&amp;rsquo;s fun for the whole family, ages six and up, with fun illustrations by everyday balloons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five kinds of monsters: Zombies, Robots, Aliens, Kraken, and fire-breathing Dinosaurs. Each one is assigned a number based on their strength. There are also five colors (or zones for colorblind). Each player gets 8 cards. The first player must play a card that &amp;ldquo;beats&amp;rdquo; that monster in a fight, either by playing the next number in the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then repeat) or by playing any monster with the same color. There are also a lot of special action cards, like a Mad Scientist card that creates any monster you want, cloning machines that make other players draw a card, and even a doomsday device card that causes everyone to pass their cards to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all their cards, wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
