			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack and Dave, went to the cave,&lt;br/&gt;To fetch a pail of water.&lt;br/&gt;Jack wished for a sword, because he was bored,&lt;br/&gt;And the trip turned into a slaughter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cranky old ifrit was bound into a well long ago, and compelled to grant a simple wish to anyone tossing a coin into its depths. A family of borderland goblins recently discovered the secret of the well, and soon started abusing it, oblivious to the fact that the ifrit was deliberately misinterpreting many of their wishes. But now a party of greedy adventurers have also learned of the well, and only the goblins of the Redfang tribe can stand against the humans' murderous rampage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Savage Worlds One Sheet adventure for Saga of the Goblin Horde. It provides a simple five-scene framework which can be run with minimal preparation, leaving room for the Game Master to flesh out the story as much or as little as they wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
