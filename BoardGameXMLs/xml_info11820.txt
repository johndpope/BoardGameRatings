			<description>Each player has a board containing 16 pictures.  Each picture has three attributes:  shape, facial expression and color.  A spinner is spun which points to a picture which contains two characteristics.  Players then take a block and marks off one of the pictures on their boards which contains both characteristics shown by the spinner.  The player which covers his board with blocks first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
