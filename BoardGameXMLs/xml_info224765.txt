			<description>November 1994 - This is one of the most powerful sets ever made, and it really didn't add much that was new.  Instead, it just expanded upon core game concepts and used them for many powerful ideas. The most intreaging idea that has been a large concept was that of &amp;quot;draw and discard a card, noting its last digit.&amp;quot;  Because of this, an element of randomness was taken from a feature intended to help collectors.  Other than that, all that this set did was expand upon past ideas and bring more power.  Landmark Cards: Tarrasque (#1); Caer Allison (#3); The Coral Kingdom (#10); Creeping Doom (#28); Limited Wish (#43); Wish (#46); Vorpal Sword (#56); Ring of Winter (#61); Flaming Fist (#65); Ambassador Carrague (#88); Helm (#89); Cyric (#92); Time of Troubles (#99); Cold Cup of Calamity (c#2); Unusually Good Fortunes (c#11); and Bell of Might (c#18).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
