			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card game in which the players try to pit together couples of the same sex in order to get points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine characters (girls or boys, but not both) are lined up, each getting a certain personality from a deck of personality cards. Each player gets one date spot card. On a player's turn, they can either exchange their date spot with one of the open ones, or put another personality on a character, or show their hand card (date spot) and pick two characters who will date on that spot. If the requirements on the date spot card match the personalities of the characters, the player will earn points. A perfect match means a couple is formed, and the characters are removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is just 1 (poor) character left, or if the personalities deck runs out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
