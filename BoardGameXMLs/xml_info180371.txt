			<description>Are you bored with traditional party games where you just have to react quickly when the cards are identical or different? Do you want to play at the next level game? Do you want to think and say &amp;laquo; O my gosh! I can't remember how it works! &amp;raquo; And, at the end of the game, do you want to say &amp;laquo; ok, let's play again, I will do it! &amp;raquo; Then, Reflex'S is for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a game that combines reflexes and reflection in which players must associate colors, shapes and numbers in an unusual way. Rules are quickly understood and heat up your brain. A card with two criteria identical to yours? Grab the object corresponding to the third criterion! Two identical cards and everybody must tap on the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now, watch out, think twice and hurry up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
