			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every story has a beginning. Who were you before you became an adventurer? What did you do to make a living and survive? With this additional supplement there are over 50 additional character backgrounds ready to roll. Backgrounds range from the common farmer, to the rare vampire hunter and everything in-between. There are also an abundance of new tools, weapons, gear, and other items and equipment that can be added to your world as well as returning items featured from the Official Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Players Handbook with added detail such as vehicles, and equipment packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
