			<description>According to popular believe Wolfgang Kramer was supposed to be the first designer who introduced a points scoring track (Kramerleiste) around the board with his game Heimlich &amp;amp; Co.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But this French game published back in 1961 already had such a points scoring track over 20 years earlier which makes this possibly the first game to implement this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game each player plays a journalist trying to get the best stories whilst traveling from city to city on the board that depicts a map of the world. The game used beautiful cards depicting either countries, historical events or historical figures from that era such as General de Gaulle, the Pope, president Kennedy or Kroutchov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
