			<description>Dogs Playing Poker is a first-person, three-dimensional poker game designed to bring the famous painting to life while bringing all the fun and excitement of a home poker night right to your PC. Play against 21 different characters, including a mechanical robot dog and a cat masquerading as a dog. Play in 4 different room environments, including the Parlor, the Kitchen, the Casino, and the Executive Suite. Play Five Card Draw, Seven Card Stud, Texas Hold 'Em, Omaha Hold 'Em, and Five Card Stud, including a nearly infinite variety of wildcard variations. Highly varied artificial intelligence gives each dog its own skill level and style of play - some players play very conservatively, other dogs &amp;quot;go for broke&amp;quot; and bet it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.dogsplayingpoker.tv/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.dogsplayingpoker.tv/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
