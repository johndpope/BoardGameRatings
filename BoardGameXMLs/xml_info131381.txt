							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cartographer&#039;s Annual 2011</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the fifth year of the Cartographer's Annaul with this amazing collection. The Annual continues to inspire CC3 users with its variety and depth of styles, symbols, tutorials and examples. Dig into a year's worth of material for your maps and projects with this package. Style Packs: CC3's new features make it easy to set up a collection of tools that produce a new and unique style in your maps. The hard part is often coming up with the original idea and design. The Cartographer's Annual aims to produce a wide variety of such styles to give you an out-of-the-box way to make your maps look fresh and serve as inspiration for your own designs. Each style pack is accompanied by a mapping guide which tells you how to use the templates, drawing tools and symbols and takes you step-by-step through the creation of an example map in this new style. Symbols: Occasionally the Cartographer's Annual will provide new symbol sets designed to create a specific type of map or to supplement an existing set. Map Collections: Some types of maps crop up again and again in role-playing games: taverns, caves, small villages and their ilk. The Annual will supply example maps for these that can be quickly adapted to your own needs. It will also include ideas and suggestions for encounters and adventures in those locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
