			<description>Designer's summary from 1KM1KT page:&lt;br/&gt;I have always been fascinated by anthropomorphic creatures in mythology, literature, and fictional sources such as cinema, video games, and comics. I would ask of the reader not to label this game as a &amp;lsquo;furry&amp;rsquo; game as that term has garnered a negative connotation with some portions of the role-laying community lately. In many ways, this game is homage to one of my favorite obscure tole-playing games, the Justifiers RPG. The Justifiers RPG was written by Gideon and published by StarChilde Publications in 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
