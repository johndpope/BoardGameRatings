							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hippo Hopp</name>
									
			<description>The birds have been hopping over the Hippos back all days search for bugs. Come dusk the hippos want to rest and the birds had better watch out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hippo Hopp consists of 28 Hippo cards with a number between 1 and 8. A circle of 19 cards is placed face up and the remaining 9 are placed face down as a draw pile. Once players have had a chance to memorise the circle, all cards are placed face down. Players then take turns turning one card in the circle face up and moving the bird pawn that many spaces clockwise. If they land on a face down hippo they are safe and score one point for every face up hippo they passed. If they land on a face up hippo they take the card as a penalty (-2 points at the end of the game) and replace it from the draw pile. Instead of choosing a card from the circle, players may discard any other player's penalty card and move that many spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the draw pile is empty. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
