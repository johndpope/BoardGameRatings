			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Is Hell is a system expansion for Contagion Second Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface, it looks much like the world you and I live in. Just beneath that surface, in the shadows, rages an ancient conflict between supernatural factions who all seek dominion over the Earth and control over the souls of humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most humans go about their daily lives unaware of the conflicts that surround them, some few people learn the frightening truth that monsters are real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Contagion is violent and brutal. This book is designed to help portray some of that brutality with new feats and combat maneuvers. The world of Contagion is also a strange place filled with bizarre creatures and strange forces. These are represented here as well with new feats, creatures and rituals. The material below is entirely optional. Gamemasters are encouraged to use what they like and ignore the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War Is Hell includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New system information on Familiars and Homunculi for use with Contagion Second Edition&lt;br/&gt;     Three new Rituals including Compel Celestial, Decode True Name and Demon Summoning&lt;br/&gt;     Seven new combat maneuvers for use with Contagion Second Edition including curbstomp, coup de grace and dismembering strike&lt;br/&gt;     10 new Feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
