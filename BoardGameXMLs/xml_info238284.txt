			<description>It was only a matter of time before the farmer&amp;rsquo;s wife figured out what was happening to her delicious pies. Now she&amp;rsquo;s out for revenge. She has started poisoning the pies. But which pies? Will it be too late by the time you find out? To win the game, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to take the risk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first expansion for Pie Rats of the Carob Bean Farm adds some interesting new ways to distract your fellow thieving rat captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each pie that is looted has the potential of being poisoned. The poisoned pies have dastardly surprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three blind mice crew have a unique synergy and if you can recruit all of them to your crew they allow you to immediately loot a pie!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the new rats that have joined the farm and the farmer's wife catching on... will you be able to beat the other captains?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
