			<description>An educational trivia game. Each player plays an agreed number of counters into the pool. A pack of answer cards are dealt so that everyone has a equal number of cards. The host or hostess then draws a question card and any player can claim that they have the correct answer on one of their cards. If they are correct, they take a reward from the Pool. If they are wrong, they add some counters to the Pool. The winner is the first player to have no answer cards left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
