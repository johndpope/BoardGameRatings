							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fate: Undiscovered Realms</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;From the back of the box.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your valor has won freedom for the people of Grove, and the manxome scourge has retreated into the shadows. In the midst of celebration, a stranger appears, warning of new evil that will ensnare your peaceful town. He speaks of ancient secrets locked within a temple, and of gateways to mysterious, yet Undiscovered Realms. Typhon, an outpost built around cold, snowy dungeons, and Druantia, a land of lush forests and endless beauty. Of the temple's secrets, he divulges only the greatest: hidden within is an ancient tome - the Book of Fate, which maintains the balance between all realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The townsfolk look to you, their new champion, to take up this perilous quest and guide the stranger through the dungeon in search of the ancient temple. You will encounter new dungeons, pet transformations, weapons, monsters, and five completely new quests to test your mettle. New features include Hardcore mode (cheats disabled, more difficult monsters) and a level cap of 199 - import characters from the original Fate and continue your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
