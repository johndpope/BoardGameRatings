			<description>This is a two-player game about building a farming village in rural Vietnam. The board comes in two double-sided halves that can be fit together to form four different configurations. The assembled board displays a 6x6 grid, with each row and column marked by the face of a die. Six of the squares on the board (those with identical row and column numbers) are action spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players purchase tiles that represent resources, such as food or animals, or buildings. These tiles are then placed on the game grid. On each turn, the active player takes one die chosen from among the dice rolled by the opponent, then rolls three remaining dice and may select one of those three. The player then resolves any actions or income produced from tiles on the board where the rows and columns corresponding to the two dice intersect. Any income may be used to purchase more tiles to be placed on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are striving to reach five specific goals. The first person to reach three more goals than the opponent (3 vs. 0 or 4 vs. 1) is the winner. If no one leads by three, the game ends when all 30 non-action squares on the game grid are filled, and the player who has obtained the most goals at that point is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
