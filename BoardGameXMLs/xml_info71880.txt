			<description>&amp;quot;Spot: The Video Game is a video game developed and produced by Virgin Mastertronic in 1990/1991 for the Amiga, Atari ST, DOS computers, Game Boy  and NES. It is the first video game to feature the then current 7up mascot &amp;quot;Spot&amp;quot;, and was later followed up by platformers  Cool Spot and Spot goes to Hollywood. Gameplay is similar to Ataxx.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially the Amiga and Atari ST versions of the game were known as Infection, and were due to be released as budget titles. When the license was added the price increased, however the non-branded Infection version of the game was released by developer Gary Dunne as freeware in 1994.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Spot_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
