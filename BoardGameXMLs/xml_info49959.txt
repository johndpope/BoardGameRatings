			<description>With issue #53, July-August 1991, the Italian history magazine &amp;quot;Storia e Dossier&amp;quot; published a gamebook to be attached to the magazine. The historical setting was credited to the historian Jacques Le Goff, but the story was actually written by salvatore Baffo. The setting was Italy in Middle Ages. The mechanic is quite peculiar - sometime the reader is forced to choose every option of a paragraph before he can really advance in the story, so he can not really choose what to read but just the order in which to read. The experiment has been successful anyway, so other two gamebook followed in 1992 and 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
