			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pillbox was an early graphical artillery duel game. In addition to being sold as a stand-alone program, it was published as a type-in program in the first issue of Softside magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Softside Magazine - October 1978&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several version of Pillbox have been published by Author Gene Perkins. This particular version, which awards a victory to the side which first scores hits on five of his opponent's placements, was prepared by the author at our request almost literally at the last minute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play of the game is deceptively simple. The computer draws the &amp;quot;battle ground&amp;quot;, which consists of two gun placements separated by a forbidding mountain. Each player controls the angle of fire (0 through 90 degrees) and the muzzle velocity of the projectile. The configuration of the &amp;quot;Battlefield&amp;quot; is never the same, and your first shot or two usually winds up either hitting the mountain, or overshooting your opponent's pillbox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program runs on either Level I or Level II 4K TRS-80 microcomputer, and we think you'll find it's Fun/Keyboard Time Ratio quite satisfactory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
