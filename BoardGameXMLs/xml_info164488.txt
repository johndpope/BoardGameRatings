			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living next to the Tarn burial burrows is all peaches and cream....until the neighbor lady yells &amp;quot;Zombies Ate My Baby!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sulpher Springs was a resort retreat for the rich until an earthquake stopped the springs a few decades back. Now it is a sleepy farm community at the edge of Camphus' control. They have a number of problems they haven't discovered yet - plus the big one waiting behind the arcane undead barrier. Surely a group of adventurous souls can find something to do....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(A D&amp;amp;D 4E GSL product) Zombies Ate My Baby is part &amp;quot;sand box&amp;quot; (allowing players to visit map locations and get involved with various events) and part &amp;quot;dungeon crawl&amp;quot; (the main plot involves penetrating a burrial mound). The intent is to force players to role play a bit - as some people of the area have differing agendas and the players are asked to choose between two factions when dealing with the main plot. (Each faction has an NPC and Role Play Encounter). There are monsters they can reach agreements with and others that cannot be &amp;quot;talked down&amp;quot;. The players will have to discover which is which.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 65 page module with different encounter blocks for groups of 4 to 6 players between levels 2 through 4. There are eight 1&amp;quot; scale map pages, 31 monsters and NPC stat blocks, 4 side plots, 10 plot encounters, and 2 Role Play encounter nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
