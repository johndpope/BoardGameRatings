			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become the Best Martial Artist on Yrth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Martial Arts looks at hand-to-hand combat of all kinds, with an emphasis on what's feasible on our Earthly orb. But what can fighters do in a world where &amp;quot;fantasy&amp;quot; is reality? GURPS Martial Arts: Yrth Fighting Styles explores the violent possibilities in the GURPS Banestorm setting . . . and offers many options that can enhance the combatants of your own fantasy realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Discover more than a dozen armed and unarmed fighting styles specific to Yrth, and use the included lenses to focus suitable 'Martial Arts styles into Yrth-based ones.&lt;br/&gt;     Find out how existing advantages, disadvantages, and skills work in a fantasy world, and augment your heroes with new perks, techniques, specialties, and variants.&lt;br/&gt;     Fight like an animal (literally!) using expanded rules that cover everything from sharks to giraffes -- or exploit guidelines that let you take the action underwater.&lt;br/&gt;     Depart from the traditional! Power up styles with Imbuement Skills from GURPS Power-Ups 1: Imbuements . . . or use the included werewolf template and related abilities to bring out your inner beast.&lt;br/&gt;     Live as a knight, legionary, mercenary, dwarf, or dark elf, thanks to insight into daily routines and suggestions for suitable character templates (including two new ones).&lt;br/&gt;     Learn the martial history of Yrth's civilizations -- not only human, but also dwarven, elven, many others -- and read about the great warriors who influenced that world's fighting styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're seeking new options for fantasy adventurers, more details to enliven your elves, or fitting threats for Yrth's mightiest heroes, you'll find it in Martial Arts: Yrth Fighting Styles. The fields, forests, and seas are more dangerous than ever. Give your champions a fighting chance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
