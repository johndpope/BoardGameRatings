			<description>Imbrix is an abstract game for two players, consisting in 5 L-tiles of each colour (black and red)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the first player to create a window consisting of an empty square surrounded by tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, each player either places a new tile of his colour or recovers one tile he previously played to replace it elsewhere, regarding the placing and recovering constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To be valid, a tile should be placed touching other tiles by at least two sides.&lt;br/&gt;To recover a tile, the tile should slide from the others (i.e. not be blocked) without moving the other tiles. Then the player replaces it elsewhere, regarding the placing constraint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game: If every tiles have been placed and no window created, the players go on by recovering tiles of their colour, until an empty square could be created. The winner is the player who creates this window.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
