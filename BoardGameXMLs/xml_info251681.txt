							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mighty Pig Tug</name>
									
			<description>Ropes equal to the number of players extend outward from a mud pit. Each rope has room for three pigs. Players manage a hand of three cards and take turns either adding a pig card with a point value of from 5 to 50 to one of the spaces on their ropes or playing an action card. A fourth pig added to a rope causes another pig on that rope to fall into the mud pit. The game ends when the Mighty Pig Tug card is drawn; at that time, the player whose pigs on his rope sum to the highest value wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
