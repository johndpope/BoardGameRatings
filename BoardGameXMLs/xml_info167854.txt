			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Dragon (ダブルドラゴン), known in Europe as Double Dragon: The Revenge of Billy Lee is a game that was developed and published by Virgin Interactive for the Sega Game Gear in 1993. Despite being called simply Double Dragon in the US and using promotional artwork from the first arcade game for the box art it is not a port of that game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the boxart showing both Lee brothers, only Billy is playable. Billy is out to avenge his brother whom has been killed by the Dragon Clan. In addition to standard attacks, weapons found can be used. This includes a gun, which is a unusual equippable weapon for the series and is the first time such a weapon was equippable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
