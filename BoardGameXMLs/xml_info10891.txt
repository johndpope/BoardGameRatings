							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cat Burglar</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple.  You and your other amateur burglar buddies are in the progress of doing what you do best,  when suddenly, an alarm goes off!  The entire  neighborhood lights up with angry citizens, and it&amp;rsquo;s only a  matter of time before the police arrive.  What next?   Run!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cat burglar is the game of extraordinary  coincidence.   Like, what a coincidence - RoboCop just  happened to be leaving a grocery store just as your thief  was running away from a cop on horse back.  And as  you turn to run the other way, a parade just happens to  be crossing the street.  Standing there in disgust, you get  hit by a rude taxi driver who just happened not to see  you....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you will soon see, things can get very crazy,  very quick...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
