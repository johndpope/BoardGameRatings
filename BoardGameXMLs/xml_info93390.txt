			<description>The Linkology game is a fast and fun card game that links science concepts together in a way that reinforces vocabulary and classification skills. The deck of 100 self-checking cards contains word cards and beautifully illustrated photo cards. Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards. One card starts the discard pile. On your turn, try to find a card in your hand that shares an attribute with the top card of the discard pile. For example, if the word card &amp;quot;bone&amp;quot; is on the discard pile, you could play the picture card of &amp;quot;skull&amp;quot; from your hand. If you don't have a match, you must draw a card to add to your hand. If you're the first person with an empty hand, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
