							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime Game</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, it is possible for everyone in your family to enjoy all the fun and excitement of one of television's newest and highest rated shows with the new home version of &amp;quot;The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime&amp;quot; game. Players compete against one and other to solve the clues which will allow them a try at the word puzzle board. The tension and excitement builds as players race to be the first to figure out the clues and solve the word puzzle, but beware of the stinger. With one sting you can lose a valuable, and possibly, a game winning turn. So gather your family and friends around and enjoy the newest and exciting game you will ever play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While promoted on the show (albeit with a different box during Season 1) and mostly faithful to it, the home adaptation turns the show's giant computer and keyboard into a dry-erase board and a set of plastic tiles (later cardboard letters). The bonus round is not present, either, instead awarding the Million if a player or team wins all three rounds in a game. Further, only 48 puzzles are present, allowing for just 16 games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notably, the game also included a contestant application, which is somewhat amusing since the game was given to couples who appeared on the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
