							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crime Life: Gang Wars</name>
									
			<description>Crime Life: Gang Wars is a fictionalized simulation of gang wars, with the game play focused on street fights involving many gang members at once. Weapons include baseball bats, lead pipes, hammers and guns. The game includes over 25 story-mode missions, as well as some free-play missions. Free roam is also available as in the popular Grand Theft Auto series. The areas are relatively small but can prove useful when trying to locate your fellow gang members. The game features harsh language and violence is definitely a staple of it. The game's music is all hip-hop, reflecting the urban and hip-hop atmosphere of the game. There are various methods of earning money, ranging from mugging to burglaries. The soundtrack of the game is provided by the hip-hop group D12, which also contributed the likenesses and voices for some of the game's key characters.  This game has been cited for combining free-roam elements similar to Grand Theft Auto, and beat 'em ups similar to Final Fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as Tre, a citizen of the impoverished Hood district in Grand Central City. As a Hood resident, you're dream is to become a member of the Outlawz, the local gang. In order to get accepted by the gang boss, Big Dog, you'll have to run a few missions that involve killing some people, and you'll soon find yourself a bona fide Outlaw with a few gang members that follow you around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crime Life: Gang Wars&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
