			<description>TurboGrafx-16, fully titled as TurboGrafx-16 Entertainment SuperSystem and known in Japan as the PC Engine (PCエンジン Pī Shī Enjin?), is a video game console developed by Hudson Soft and NEC, released in Japan on October 30, 1987, and in North America on August 29, 1989.&lt;br/&gt; The TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit GPU; and is capable of displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. With dimensions of 14 cm &amp;times; 14 cm &amp;times; 3.8 cm (5.5in &amp;times; 5.5in &amp;times; 1.5in), the NEC PC Engine holds the record for the world's smallest game console ever made. (Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition (2008))&lt;br/&gt; In the United Kingdom, Telegames released a slightly altered version of the US model simply as the TurboGrafx around 1990 in extremely limited quantities. Although there was no full-scale PAL region release of the system, imported PC Engine consoles were largely available in France and Benelux through major retailers thanks to the unlicensed importer Sodipeng (Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; de Distribution de la PC Engine, a subsidiary of Guillemot International).&lt;br/&gt; In 2009, the TurboGrafx-16 was ranked as the 13th greatest video game console of all time by IGN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TurboGrafx-16&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
