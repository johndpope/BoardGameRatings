			<description>This is a very early German game, possibly 17th-18th century, and perhaps unique. The rules and the outcome from landing in various squares are certainly handwritten on the thick paper board. Differences in the shapes of the space numbers suggest  calligraphy rather than printing, with irregularities in the shapes of the spaces pointing to a hand-drawn board as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many early board games, its theme is moral improvement. The game title translates as: &amp;quot;In Heaven you will receive the Crown of Instruction&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In play, it is a typical spin-and-move along a 100-space track that spirals inward, with penalties and bonuses affecting various spaces along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
