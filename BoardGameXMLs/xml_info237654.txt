							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anchor Rock: A Nautical Adventure Setting</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anchor Rock comes alive within the pages of this book. A city of intrigue and mystery lurks just beneath the pristine surface of this island harbor. Gangs of sahaugin, cults dedicated to the creatures that dwell within the deepest stretches of the ocean, and three pirate crews all call Anchor Rock home and prove an engaging challenge for all levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salt Dwarves&lt;br/&gt;A new subrace for dwarves, the salt dwarves split away from their mountain-dwelling brethren and made their home in the rock stacks of the vast ocean. Excelling in the alchemical arts, salt dwarves stand apart from their stern cousins as a jovial race that&amp;rsquo;s always out to hear a good story from a new friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathfinder Archetypes&lt;br/&gt;New ways to build your characters such as the Brine Bomber for the Alchemist or the Wharfmaster for the Investigator easily bring the feeling of the sea to your home game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paragon Paths&lt;br/&gt;Frontline alchemists, ship captains, and patrolmen bring their own unique skills to the table as paragon path options for 4e Dungeons and Dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully Statted NPC&amp;rsquo;s and Antagonists&lt;br/&gt;Anchor Rock is a city full of character, a fact that is reflected in its inhabitants. New stats for over a dozen NPC&amp;rsquo;s and monsters are easy to adapt to locations other than Anchor Rock. All creatures are statted into both 4e Dungeons and Dragons as well as Pathfinder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
