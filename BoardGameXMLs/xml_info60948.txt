							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Keep of Lord Mmorpgus</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many times can you award a +2 mace or sword to the party before it becomes boring? How many sets of +1 chainmail do they possibly need? Wouldn't they rather have a Dire Maul of the Jumbo Shrimp? Inspired by the often pecular naming conventions of your favorite MMORPGs, The Keep of Lord Mmorpgus offers you dozens of new weapons, armor, and magical items to add some spice to your treasure tables or to use as inspiration for side adventures and quests. Besides the actual items, this 16 page, printer-friendly PDF also includes a variety of new Magical Sets, collections of magical items that provide additional benefits when used together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
