			<description>From Preface:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paladin class has captured the imagination of players since its introduction. The paladin is the most difficult class to play, not because of a lack of combat power, but because of its roleplaying restrictions. Many players would like to play one, but are afraid to try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, a well played paladin is worth the extra effort. Why is this? The other classes are fun to play because of what they can do. The paladin is fun to play because of how they do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The call of duty sets paladins apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s also something else. In the real world, we could use a few wizards to make our lives easier or clerics to heal our sick. However, we need heroes more than anything, and paladins are the epitome of heroic fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In those dreary times of real life that happen in between games, try to live your life a little more like a paladin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focus on how you accomplish your goals a bit more, rather than the bottom line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let fear run your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And never make a deal with a dragon; smite the beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Version 2.0: This version is compatible with the revised 3.5 rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
