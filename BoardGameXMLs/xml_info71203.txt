			<description>&amp;quot;Wizardry VII: Crusaders of the Dark Savant is the 7th title in the Wizardry series of computer role-playing games by Sir-Tech, preceding Wizardry 8 and succeeding Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge. It is also the 2nd in the 'Dark Savant trilogy'. It was published in 1992 by Sir-Tech Software, Inc. It was originally developed for DOS. In 1996 it was remade into Wizardry Gold, designed to work on Windows 95 and Macintosh, and distributed by Interplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crusaders of the Dark Savant picks up where Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge left off. The party had just found the Cosmic Forge, the pen that the Cosmic Lords use to script the events of the universe, after it was stolen by the Bane King and his Wizard, Xorphitus. Before the party could decide what to do with it, it was spirited away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. The Cosmic Forge was used to hide the location of the Astral Dominae, a powerful artifact with power over life itself, on planet Guardia. Because of this, its theft revealed Planet Guardia to the universe. Now, multiple forces are converging on Lost Guardia to find this artifact, including the party itself. It is after planetfall on Guardia that the story begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As there are three endings to Bane of the Cosmic Forge, there are four beginnings to Crusaders of the Dark Savant (one for each of the endings from the previous game, and a fourth for parties who are starting fresh).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wizardry_VII:_Crusaders_of_the_Dark_Savant,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
