							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Hackston I</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This HackMaster adventure for a party of 1st level PCs introduces the players to the small hamlet of Hackston. Founded over 30 years ago by the Ranger Hansen, Hackston has been goblin-free long enough that the recent rumors of goblin activity is easily dismissed as children's ghost stories. There still is an active bounty on goblin ears and in this adventure the PCs get an opportunity to investigate some of the goblin rumors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Hackston I is the first of three adventures set in the town of Hackston that give the PCs an opportunity to use the town as a rural base of operations up until the final adventure which is set for 3rd to 5th level PCs. Hackston has all the services a new group requires: a general store, an inn, a country &amp;ldquo;doctor&amp;rdquo;, a blacksmith, and a small church. Basic maps are provided for a GM to adapt and use as desired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
