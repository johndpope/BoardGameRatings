							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheers Gary</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A man with millions of fans has as many reasons not to answer all of their questions, but Gary didn't let that stop him. Starting in 2002, and continuing until two weeks before his death in 2008, he replied to every query and acknowledged every thanks at EN World, the largest Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons online community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cheers, Gary&amp;quot; collects the best of his EN World correspondence: anecdotes, puns, barbs, his love of Camel cigarettes and Bombay Sapphire gin, gloomy commentary on the Chicago Bears, hundreds of (often repetitive) D&amp;amp;D questions, and most of all, good fellowship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume is one product of the Gygax Memorial Fund's work to keep Gary's memory alive. We're pleased to make it available to you in return for your contribution toward our current goal: building a statue in his hometown, Lake Geneva.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
