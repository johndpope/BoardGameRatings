			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was first run at JimCon 6 (2016) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It was billed as &amp;quot;Star Wars meets Ocean's Eleven&amp;quot;, and was listed as a game that was open to beginner role-players as well as veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are a Rebel Special Forces unit tasked with breaking into a Casino to steal some data that is being handed off from one Imperial officer to another. The data is not where they expect it to be, and they are forced to attend a social function full of Imperial officers in order to obtain it, resulting in a final race to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
