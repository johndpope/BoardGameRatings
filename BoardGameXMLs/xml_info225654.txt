							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prestigious Paths: Sin Hunter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each release for Prestigious Paths for the Pathfinder RPG presents a single, new prestige class for your Pathfinder RPG game. Each release presents the basic prestige class information you would expect, and likely some other, related content, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sin Hunter is someone who has encountered the Deepest Dark -- the sort of evil that exists on the other side of sanity -- and survived. In their survival, they have been called by a god to rid the world of sin, no matter the cost. They are now able to track others by the sin in their souls, as well as reflect it back inwards upon a subject to render them vulnerable. They can even feed upon the darkness within a slain sinner to make themselves temporarily stronger. But they are unforgiving and brutal, make no mistake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes 1 new feat and 1 new spell suitable to the Sin Hunter and similar characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
