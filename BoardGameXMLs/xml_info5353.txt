							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quatero</name>
									
			<description>Quatero is the ideal mind game for two players and one that will surely mentally stimulate with shapes, colors, and marks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two basic rules govern Quatero during each turn, they are 1) a pattern of all four different solids in at least one row must be made and 2) an alternating end color pattern must be maintained. You have to push out one of 4 cards in the center and replace it with a card from your 3 card hand that will allow all 4 figures to appear atleast once in the 3 rows of each card in the center. Then you accumulate points labelled on the pushed out cards when 2-4 but not 1 [when 1 is on the card from your side, your opponent loses that card as well as the last card taken in the second color, either blue or red. When the deck is exhausted, add up your blue and red points accumulated and see who has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    48 playing cards &lt;br/&gt;    1 rule book &lt;br/&gt;    All packaged in a black velvet bag &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2&lt;br/&gt;Game running time: about 25 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Ages: 11 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
