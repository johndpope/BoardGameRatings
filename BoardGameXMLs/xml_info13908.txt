			<description>Print the game board, bugs and rules.  Some form of tokens can be substituted.  The spider defends and reigns supreme in its web.  But the trapped insects unite, and attempt to defeat the spider.  Will they succeed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designer's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUGS ARE REVOLTING! &lt;br/&gt;(Wait ... that didn't come out quite right ...) The Bugs are taking up arms (and they've got a lot to take up!) against their long time oppressor - the Spider.  No more having to watch where you're flying!  No more being left hanging! No more being eaten!  This time it's personal!  This time it's full scale insecticide! (Ok, ok, I know, spiders are not really insects, they're Arthropods of the class Arachnida, whereas true &amp;quot;insects&amp;quot; are Arthropods of the classes Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Pauropoda, Symphyla, and Insecta ...duh!)  It just sounds cooler this way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Download the game at: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://kenmgames.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
