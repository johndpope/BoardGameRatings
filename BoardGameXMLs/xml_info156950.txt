			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch your step, wastelander&amp;hellip; that pile of loot ahead might just be a trap!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed and written by Brandon Goeringer, this is the 6th free mutant freak in the Creatures of the Apocalypse line and the first to be offered in three nasty sizes: Juvenile, Adult and Brute!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scraplurker is a dweller of the ruins, old war zones and rubble strewn bogs. Although humanoid, these pack hunters view mankind as nothing more than the next meal. Their favorite trick is to wait in ambush, face down, exposing their junk and relic strewn backs to entice excavators and scavs in close enough to make a quick kill. Of course, what ruin looter can resist the often rare and valuable treasure items just laying in plain sight?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 8 page PDF offers the Scraplurker in three sizes, a mutation list, full page player handout version of the cover art, as well as a d100 Loot table showcasing items that one might find stuck to the back of these gruesome ambush predators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although crafted for The Mutant Epoch role-playing game, using the Outland System Game Mechanic, a GM can easily modify the stats for the three size variants shown into another post-apocalyptic game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
