							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">4Saken Cinema: Devil Films</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4Saken rulebook contains enough material to get a group up and running, but there is so much more horror to cover. Ways to expand that foundation with new rules and options which many gamers enjoy. More importantly is an opportunity to examine in detail all the ways horror changes from story to story, sub-genre to sub-genre. A movie about Satanic possession differs greatly from a television series focusing on a lone female defender of humanity. Nailing down these details can help a Director elevate a franchise, bringing extra fun and scares the players. So with 4Saken Cinema, we&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on each of the areas found under the banner of horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why start with Devil Films?&lt;br/&gt;Before we had horror stories in our books, comics, movies, television and (most important for us here) gaming, we had the storytellers around the fires. They recited their tales to teach others important lessons, or warn them of dangers, and of course to entertain. Even in these oldest tales there lurked a dark whispering presence from the Underworld spreading deceit and treachery. So why not start with one of the oldest enemies of humanity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
