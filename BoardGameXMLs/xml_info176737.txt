			<description>The Candy Man is a Symbol Matching, Set Building Strategy game for all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, each player has a hand of ingredient cards. In the middle of the table, there are five recipe cards, which show different ingredients. Players take turns drawing new ingredients and playing ingredients on the recipe. On their turn, players can either play one ingredient on a recipe, or play all missing ingredients on a recipe. If a player plays the last missing ingredient, he scores that recipe, and it is replaced by a new recipe. Play continues until a player reaches 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has different game modes. The basic game is aimed at younger players, and allows them to focus on the symbol matching. The other game modes add Golden Ticket cards to the game, which are special actions that are rewarded randomly, and Role Cards, which give the players different special powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
