			<description>Traveller Alien Module 5&lt;br/&gt;Droyne&lt;br/&gt;The Last of the Ancients&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reptilian aliens with the potential to rule the entire galaxy. We know  because they did some 300,000 years ago. Now, they seem content to farm the fields of their few planets and to maintain a much lower profile. Are they biding their time? Do they plan to again rule every planet they can see? Or is their some reason why they have retreated to their few worlds?&lt;br/&gt;The Droyne are known to be the descendants of the Ancients, a powerful race that dominated all of known space thousands of years ago, and then destroyed itself in one final war. Droyne, Traveller Alien Module 5, describes in detail this fallen race, its history, its technology, and its society.&lt;br/&gt;This alien module includes everything you need to role-play Droyne as player-characters or as NPC's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
