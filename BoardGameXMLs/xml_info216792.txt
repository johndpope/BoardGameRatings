			<description>Includes 6 different colored shooting marbles of 1&amp;quot; glass (one per player) and one straight block of wood with 5 arches one next to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the wooden arches on a flat surface a distance away from the players, based on player skill. Each player takes turns shooting their marble towards the arches, from the same spot and distance away. Marbles that make it through an arch earn points based on the value marked on the the top of the arch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player with more skill can take a 'handicap' by shooting from further away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to 50 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
