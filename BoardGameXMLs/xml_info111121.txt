			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Retro Entertainment System is a third-party game console which allows players to play their old NES cartridges.  Unlike the original system, it does not have a regional lock-out setting, so NES games released in other parts of the world are fully compatible.  It comes with two special controllers which add a slow feature and turbo versions of both the 'A' and 'B' buttons.  In addition, it is compatible with other NES controllers as well.  The console is a top-loader like most cartridge-based consoles which were released after the classic NES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
