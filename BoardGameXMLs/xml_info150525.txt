			<description>This is a party game based on guessing what type of panties a person might wear if they were to go on a date. 5 situation cards are laid on the table. These cards ask &amp;quot;What kind of girl is she,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What kind of guy is he,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How did they meet,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;When is their date,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Where will they go on their date?&amp;quot; Each player fills out the back of the situation card in dry-erase marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answers to the situation are shown, and one designated player has to decide what style and color of panties a person in the presented situation would wear. They also lay out 3 pairs of underwear that they do not think would be appropriate for this situation. To denote this, 4 point tokens are placed face down, marking which style they think is best, ok, neutral, and inappropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining players then have to vote on which pair they think is the best. The face down point tokens are shown, and points for correct guesses are accumulated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This process repeats as the players rotate, so that each player has the chance to try every role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
