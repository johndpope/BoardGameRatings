							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Descent Maximum</name>
									
			<description>Descent Maximum is the PlayStation counterpart of Descent II on the PlayStation. Unlike the first PlayStation Descent which was considered mostly a direct port, Descent Maximum was designed to better accommodate the console and contained 30 entirely new levels. These maps had similar themes to those in Descent II, but were generally smaller than their PC cousins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Descent II&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
