			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year the Temples in Fang ring their bells of winter yore. In a rhythmic tune, the&lt;br/&gt;bells chime slowly then quickly. Like a xylophone, each instrument echoes in separate&lt;br/&gt;pounds, vibrant tolling sounds highlighting the festive evening. The temples are alight&lt;br/&gt;with red, green and white lanterns; across the laneway the large tavern has decorated its&lt;br/&gt;walls with the very similar art. The air not only sounds nice but smells of sweet&lt;br/&gt;sandalwood incense. It seems to be yet another year like the last.&lt;br/&gt;You stand there in the winter solstice, listen in, and watch the temple players. A group od&lt;br/&gt;dancers dressed in heavy garb come out and take large steps. They look as though their&lt;br/&gt;acting out a bear or massive beast. They start to dance amidst the onlookers. It has&lt;br/&gt;starting to get colder so you decide to call it a night and return home in the Ming district.&lt;br/&gt;Upon arriving there are soldiers on horseback and one empty horse, its rider is handing&lt;br/&gt;your father a scroll. You hurry into your home as the soldiers depart. You ask what the&lt;br/&gt;scroll is but he ignores you. Your mother tells you that he has been selected to venture&lt;br/&gt;out into the Ice Fingers Mountains. Your father is partially crippled, although he could&lt;br/&gt;walk from one end of Fang to the next there is no chance of his survival hiking the&lt;br/&gt;mountains and possibly a mountain.&lt;br/&gt;That evening and in silence, everyone ate their meal and went to bed. As you step by&lt;br/&gt;your parent&amp;rsquo;s carrying with you a clay lantern with a tiny flame sticking out of the spout&lt;br/&gt;you spy you father practicing Chi. He&amp;rsquo;s moving his hands and legs in perfect unison then&lt;br/&gt;keels over in pain. His hip is hurting him again, and he stays in one spot for some time&lt;br/&gt;until he recovers. He picks up the sword Sukumvit gave to him at the third Trial of&lt;br/&gt;Champions. It is a magnificent piece, with a heart of steel, a head of rubies and&lt;br/&gt;shimmering eyes. The sword looks as though it were made of blue steel. It is nearly light&lt;br/&gt;as a feather. He shakes his head and frowns. You can see him fighting the tears that he&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br/&gt;no longer the champion he used to be.&lt;br/&gt;That night as you lie in bed, you cannot help but feel anxious. You are not trained in the&lt;br/&gt;art of swordsmanship like you father but you do know how to use one, you are not the&lt;br/&gt;proper age since you are only a teenager, and you are the wrong gender but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br/&gt;matter to you now. You don&amp;rsquo;t want your father to go. All of these three things could alter&lt;br/&gt;your outcome, but your father is not in faultless shape.&lt;br/&gt;You get up and tiptoe through the chilly house and quietly slide open their door and&lt;br/&gt;sneak the sword and scroll and return to your room. The scroll reads that there is a&lt;br/&gt;danger, unlike any other danger lurking ever closer toward the town. A few selected in&lt;br/&gt;Zengis are setting out to the Ice Finger Mountains to destroy a madman called Father&lt;br/&gt;Grim Holiday who is rumoured to be creating hideous objects for this year&amp;rsquo;s Winter&lt;br/&gt;Festivals, some of which are finding their way down the pass already. You have read&lt;br/&gt;enough. Your father is not going, you reason. Quickly, you go to his wardrobe, and put&lt;br/&gt;on his warrior uniform. Although you do not know what you are doing, you have decided&lt;br/&gt;to guess you way through; it has always worked before, why not now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
