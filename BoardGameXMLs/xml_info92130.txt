			<description>User Comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of 6 map sets released by FASA to expand the available terrain for BattleTech, BattleForce and CityTech games, this map set was released twice, once in 1988 and then again in 1991.  The 1998 edition was the last edition to be printed on cardstock; the second edition and future map sets released by FASA and subsequent licence holders were all printed on paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map set included 8 maps: &amp;quot;Mountain Lake&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;River Valley&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lake Area&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;BattleTech&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;CityTech&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;City Ruins&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Desert Hills&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Scattered Woods.&amp;quot;  Of these maps, BattleTech and CityTech were reprints of the maps supplied with the BattleTech and CityTech boardgames, while the Open Terrain, Lake Area and River Valley maps were all reprints of Map Set 1 maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this was released in the US/UK markets as Map Set 2, it was released in Germany by FanPro as &amp;quot;GeoTech 1.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
