							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gear Grinders</name>
									
			<description>Gear Grinders is a board game where players control one of four unique characters maneuvering around an arena to attack the other players. Each character has their own attacks, stats (attack, defense, movement), life, gear slots, gear cost, and steam tank size. Steam is used to power different attacks or shift gears from first to second gear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arena has three different steam vents located throughout. A normal steam vent, a gear vent, and a hatch vent. These can be turned on or off with a die roll. When the vents are on, moving over them can increase the amount of steam in your tank but at the cost of some life. Gear cards could appear on the gear vent with a die roll. The hatch vents are used to move a player from the gear vent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear cards are equipped by players to modify the player's stats. Playing cards are used to help launch attacks or defend. Combat is determined by a die roll adding any modifiers and comparing it to the defender's defense with their modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there is only one person left alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gear Grinders is the first game from Roll One Games Limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game time is 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the number of players and the aggressiveness of the game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
