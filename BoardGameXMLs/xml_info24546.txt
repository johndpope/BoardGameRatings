			<description>According to the given rules, the pieces, eight on each army, start in reserve off the board.  A move consists of either:  1) placing a piece from your reserve on any vacant square; 2) moving a piece to any adjacent square, orthogonally or diagonally (as a chess king), or 3) capturing an enemy piece by jumping it, like an 8-directional checker.  Multiple jumps are allowed.  When a jump is possible, jumping is compulsory, though the player may choose any jumping move available and need not capture the greatest possible number of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is either to form a line of three of your pieces, orthogonally or diagonally with no intervening spaces, or to capture six enemy pieces (i.e. reduce your enemy&amp;rsquo;s forces to two so that he cannot win).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
