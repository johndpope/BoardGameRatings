			<description>Old french abstract game of ground battle for young players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: Grab 4 of the 10 vital centers of enemy player(s)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: &lt;br/&gt;- A grid map with roads, rivers, mountains and lakes&lt;br/&gt;- A cache used for hidden pieces deploiement&lt;br/&gt;- 44 pieces per country (4 minefields, 4 missiles, 16 infantry, 8 paratroopers, 6 tanks and 6 engineers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay :&lt;br/&gt;At start, each player secretly deploys his pieces using the provided cache. Then players alternate turns playing 2 pieces each turn. A playing piece can move or eliminates an enemy piece, not both. There is no stacking allowed.  &lt;br/&gt;Each piece has its own capacities :&lt;br/&gt;- Minefields don't move but blocks enemy and friendly movement except engineers. They can be eliminated by engineers or missiles however. &lt;br/&gt;- Missiles don't move, are removed when used to destroy any enemy piece in play or to unoccupied bridge on the map.&lt;br/&gt;- Infantry can move up to 3 squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They can eliminate other pieces (except mines) by jumping over them horizontally or vertically like in checkers.&lt;br/&gt;- Tanks are treated like infantry but with a 5 squares movement and &amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot; allowance.&lt;br/&gt;- Paratroopers are infantry which can once per game be moved up to 6 squares before being played&lt;br/&gt;- Engineers are infantry which can destroy minefields or when placed on a river square be used as a bridge by other pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
