			<description>An Official Cyberpunk 2020 Adventure for 3-6 Players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Back Cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greenwar is a midlevel adventure for 3-6 players in which Corporate PCs and their associates are offered the opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to plan, arrange, and execute the hostile takeover of Liverpool Shipping, Inc., a major player in the international container shipping trade. The Browning Group is the corporate interest initiating the takeover -- a handful of opportunistic players in the cutthroat field of acquisitions. The Browning Group is willing to give the PCs free run of the operation. That includes hefty salaries, an extravagant expense budget, travel allowances, and an office in whatever city the 'punks choose. All the Group asks in return is that the 'punks achieve their goal at a minimum loss of life and with as little damage to Liverpool property as possible. Aside from that, the Browning Group doesn't care how the job gets done. All they want is Liverpool Shipping -- a prize they're willing to pay handsomely to own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back cover subtitle - One Step Ahead of the Competition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
