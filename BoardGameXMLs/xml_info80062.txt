							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prison Tycoon 2: Maximum Security</name>
									
			<description>Prison Tycoon 2: Maximum Security, is a worthy successor to the best-selling Prison Tycoon. Following in its predecessor's footsteps, it allows you to build and run your very own correctional facility from the comfort of your own home, but now with even greater attention to detail and realism! PT2 uses 3 REAL US penitentiaries; Angola, Leavenworth and McNeil Island, as its inspiration. The landscapes are designed to closely match the real locations and every effort has been made to ensure that the prison buildings have an authentic look and feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control the layout of your prison buildings and the arrangement of the rooms and facilities within them. Place dormitories and cellblocks, mess halls and gymnasiums, but don't expect to be able to build death row right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you begin you will have a low security rating and must, with effort and managerial skill, improve your prison, maintain inmate discipline and increase your security to maximum. As time passes more inmates will arrive and you must deal with each new influx as they step off the prison bus, all of them needing to be housed and fed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raise funds for the upkeep of your inmates, staff and facilities by building on-site factories where your inmates can work. Will you rehabilitate offenders by allowing them learn trade skills or educate themselves while in prison, or discuss their issues with the prison Therapist? Or will you simply send in the guards to quell unrest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
