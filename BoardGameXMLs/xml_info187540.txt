							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">RORPS: Really Odd Role Playing System</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RORPS is a comedy game system that is intended as a playable satire.  The mechanics are usable, if bizarre.  The 2nd Edition of the game is apparently the first actual edition; the 2nd Edition title appears to have been used to make the system seem more credible.  The game uses idiosyncratic language to refer to standard role-playing terms:  CowMaster (Game Master), Ouch Points (Hit Points), Poopy Stuffs (Disadvantages), and Stuff Points (Experience Points) are samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters select a Race and then generate Traits (Abilities) - the game has four:  Buffness, Breath, Hair Color, and Bowel Control.  Characters next select Skills and Poopy Stuffs (disadvantages).  The game presents a resolution mechanic (because &amp;quot;all games have rules&amp;quot;) of rolling a dice pool against a Difficult Check Number.  The number of dice in the pool is determined by the Attribute being tested.  Combat works in a similar manner; successful hits deliver Ouch Points.  The game concludes with &amp;quot;Pointless Rules&amp;quot; (movement rates, throwing ranges, etc.) to keep &amp;quot;some roleplayers&amp;quot; happy.  One of the pointless rules presents a (slightly) more complex combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
