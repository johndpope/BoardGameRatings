							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned is the third and final game in the Gabriel Knight series of adventure games by Sierra Online. The game was designed by Jane Jensen, Gabriel Knight's creator. In a departure from the previous two entries, the score is composed by David Henry, expanding on some of original composer Robert Holmes's themes. The game also sees Tim Curry return in the role of Gabriel although the voices of other re-occurring characters such as Grace and Mosely have been recast. It was released in 1999 for PCs and again in 2001 as a part of Sierra's Best Seller Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each installment in the Gabriel Knight series has had a significant change in graphic design, with the first featuring computer-generated, partially rotoscoped graphics as well as scanned comic book art and the second being entirely FMV. Gabriel Knight 3 is the first game in the series to be in full 3D. Despite critical and financial success it would be the last adventure game published by Sierra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot of the game now concentrates on vampires (previous titles concentrated on the paranormal aspects of Voodoo, and werewolves) but also has a great deal to do with the history of the Knights Templar, the proposed conspiracies relating to the Freemasons and The Priory of Sion as well as Jesus.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gabriel_Knight_3:_Blood_of_the_Sacred,_Blood_of_the_Damned,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
