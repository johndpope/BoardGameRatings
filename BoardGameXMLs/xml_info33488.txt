							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Off To War: A jolly nice set of rules for Napoleonic Land Warfare</name>
									
			<description>The book's introduction is as follows: &amp;quot;These rules are primarily for playing a wargame up to Multi-Divisional level in size. However, I have extensively used these rules for Multi-Corps level games with little difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that not every rule within this document will apply at the same time and in some circumstances you may wish to use certain rules as optional rules. The great thing about wargaming is the choice is yours. It is worth bearing in mind that in most cases, these rules are a compromise between historical fact and playability. Good luck and happy wargaming, for now you are OFF TO WAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For use with 6mm, 10mm, 15mm and 20mm scale figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
