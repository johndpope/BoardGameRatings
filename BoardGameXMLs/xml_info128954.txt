			<description>Card game that features four different games but all are fairly traditional. 36 cards being 17 with an animal, 17 with a food associated with an animal, 1 Wolf card and 1 Red Riding Hood card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For game 1 use all the cards except Red Riding Hood and her Cake. The Wolf will be the Schwarzer Peter (Old Maid) card. Whoever holds it when all the cards are paired, loses. Note for this and other games, the pairing of two cards are not the same image. You must match a food card with an animal card, i.e. Squirrel and Nuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For game 2, use all the cards. The Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood count as a pair. Turn all the cards upside down randomly. Draw two cards and if a pair, take them. When all the pairs are matched up, the one with the most pairs, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 3 is a slight variation of Game 2. Take out the Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood. Still matching pairs but the cards are divided into animal cards on the left and food cards on the right. I guess this is seen as a little easier for younger children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 4 is played like a Lotto variant. Each player gets an equal number of animal cards. The Caller has the deck of food cards. He will turn one over and announce it i.e. Thistle. If a player has the donkey card (who eats the thistle) then he can turn over his donkey card. The first player to turn over all their animal cards, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the box is an extending box. This means that it is a regular size but the sleeve inside can be lowered to show a much longer box image. This idea was probably first used by J W Spear in Bavaria but is releatively uncommon. Indeed, this is the first French game I have seen with this feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
