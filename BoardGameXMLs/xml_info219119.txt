			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high skyscraper, in the banking district in Metro City. Now a noticeably shorter skyscraper than only a few hours earlier. On the brand new windy rooftop, which was previously a large meeting room, four masked superheroes stand, quietly, humbled. Milady, here to capture Dr. Omniscient. Almandine and Aventurine, aka The Twins, here after Blue Sumac and Mr. Illusion. True Justice, whose presence was more of a coincidence, trying to lend a hand. Before, they have all done their own thing, on their own turf. For the first time, they have been forced to fight side by side, and it showed. This has been their very first defeat, and it is indeed a bitter one. Midnight is just upon the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 13th - 14th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
