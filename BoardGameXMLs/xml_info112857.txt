			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;In 2123 the first true nanite was used, it was a medical nanite that cleared the blood system by removing build-ups of hardened materials. It targeted specific materials, it was contained within a specific environment and it had enormous application to a population that had grown steadily older. It was an outstanding success and was quickly brought online to the public. The success triggered an enormous investment into nanite research and a golden age blossomed. By the year 2300 the world was much cleaner, the oceans were recovering with life, the moon had been fully colonised along with a growing orbital presence, plans were afoot to colonise Mars (special nanites were developed to not only terraform the planets eco-system but to allow men to survive better). The average age of a human had grown to over 100 years. Poverty, disease and famine were on the decline. This is the starting point of the Mechanoids. A special branch of nanite research discovered a way to create nanites that could strongly interact with the atomic crystal lattice of metals, with the careful application of energy and force at a molecular level it was possible to give metals a degree of flexibility and resilience that had enormous potential. The result of the research was what became commercially know as 'flexible metals', and more advanced forms evolved into 'living metals' and 'liquid metals'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
