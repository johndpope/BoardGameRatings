			<description>To win the game, the players have to get each of their 5 meeples in one of the 5 game circles on the board. First the gamemaster rolls a die to determine the aktive circle, which is marked with the white meeple. If a player rolls the same number as the game master, he may place a meeple on any free space of the active circle. On a roll of a 6 the player may place a meele in any circle. The spaces 1 to 4 are safe. Only meeples on a 6-space may be replaced by an opponent meeple. The replaced meeples go to the training center at the bottom of the game board and the players have to perform an athletic task. The training center can only be left on the roll of a 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game Ends, when all players have a meeple in each circle. The player with the highest point count wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are a soccer game (Fu&amp;szlig;ballspiel) and an athletics game (Leichtathletik).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
