			<description>Included adventure ties to the one from the revised GM screen. Notably includes information on adapting portions of the scenario to the Clan War miniatures system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Three years ago, the Akodo lost their Champion, Arasou, and the heart of a Lion was torn asunder by the forge of war. Today, the legacy of this event festers just beneath the surface of tensions within the heart of the Empire. Valiant heroes will be called upon to lay the demons of the past to rest, and heal the shattered peace between the houses of the proud Lion Clan.

Today, the war begins again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toshi Ranbo, ancient palace of the Lion, was captured three years ago by the Crane. The Lion Champion, Akodo Arasou, met his death within its grey stone walls. Now the Lion return to avenge him and retake the massive keep. Suddenly, among the teeming samurai on the battlefield, spectres of long dead heroes arise, lifting their swords in defiance and anguish. Have the souls of the dead broken free of Jogoku's chains to fight one more desperate battle, or has some treachery commanded them to interfere?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can your samurai's courage stand the test of death itself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Suitable for 3-6 mid-level (rank 3-4) player characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Filled with mystery and battle, Legacy is the continuation of &amp;quot;The Silence Within Sound&amp;quot; (a mini-adventure included in the revised L5R GM's Screen) Legacy can be played as part of an ongoing campaign or completely independently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Requires a copy of the Legend of the Five Rings basic rules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
