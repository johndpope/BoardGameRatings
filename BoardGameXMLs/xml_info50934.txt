			<description>Hack In The Dark Ages 250 AD to 1000 AD by Philip J. Viverito, 1 vol, 56 pgs L.M.W WORKS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A historical game system for tabletop gaming with miniature figures in the Dark Ages. This book is a stand alone set of rules based on it's predecessor Classical Hack III: Hack in the Dark and is profusely illustrated with diagrams, photographs and charts. Most players are able to play the game without much, if any, help after turn three. The primary change from First Edition is the use of a D-10 system from a percentile based casualty calculation. The first part of the book describes the basics of the game in regard to unit generation, movement and shooting. The remainder of the book is designed around the turn sequence. This takes the player basically through a typical turn describing each turn event in sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale 1&amp;quot; = 150' for 15mm and 25mm figures. Each turn = 15 to 20 minutes. Figure scale is flexible, from 5 to 200 men. Table size 4' x 6' or larger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the book contains a section on Special Add-on Tactics. There is also a general Q.R.S. or Quick Reference Sheet for playing the game. There are 39 Army Lists and four scenarios, plus play aids. Besides having a comprehensive Table of Contents there is an Index; which is not always found in game systems of this type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
