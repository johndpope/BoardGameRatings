			<description>D&amp;eacute;gage is a semi-cooperative card game that takes on the theme of the Tunisian Jasmine Revolution (or more aptly named The Revolution for Dignity by the Tunisians.  The goal is for the players to successfully eliminate the Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and his clique mafia.  The game revolves around these seven Zaba members; each have a specific power related to their personality that benefits them, but not those in the general population.  These are known as character &amp;quot;defects&amp;quot; in the game.  These &amp;quot;defects&amp;quot; are represented by various icons on the cards and indicate what &amp;quot;pressue&amp;quot; can be used to &amp;quot;eliminate&amp;quot; the character.  Once players line up enough cards with the matching icons for a character, the character is removed.  The person who dethrones the seventh character is the winner.  If the 7 characters are not removed before the end of the game, all players have lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
