Humans have underestimated the power of Atlanteans and thus the war takes place in the middle of ultimate elemental disasters - hurricanes and floods. The remains of regular troops are trying to stand up against the army of Atlanteans whos army consists of giant dinosaur-reptiles that have been tamed, and fully controlled by bionic mages of Atlantis. Battle for Atlantis features advanced and unique water technologies and special effects through waves, tsunamis, waterfalls and river flows, and the game moves the player between seabed environments and dry land. Real waves and tsunamis, floods and destruction of the landscape by water, river flows and waterfalls, splendid underwater effects - all this gives an enormous scope of creation and makes the game world of Atlantis as real as never before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
