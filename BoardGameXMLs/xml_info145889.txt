							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bakin&#039; with Bacon</name>
									
			<description>The Basics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bakin' with Bacon is a card game for 2-4 players consisting of 2 decks of cards: The Bakin' with Bacon game deck and Bacon Playing Cards (a standard deck bacon-themed deck of 52 cards + 2 jokers + 2 extra cards). The game deck includes recipe cards, action cards, wild cards, and instruction cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each recipe is made up of 4 ingredients, represented by specific cards from the standard deck. The goal is to collect all four ingredients to complete a recipe and then to complete all 3 recipes. The first person to complete all 3 recipes wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with 7 cards held in his/her hand and 3 unique recipe cards face up on the table. Players take turns in a clockwise direction. At the beginning of a turn, a player draws one card from the deck. The player ends a turn in one of three ways: applying 4 ingredients to complete a recipe, playing an action card, or discarding an unwanted card into the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a recipe is completed, that recipe and the 4 cards used to complete the recipe are no longer in play, unless reactivated with an action card that specifically affects cards that are out of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At any point during the game, if a player draws the last remaining card from the deck, at the end of that player's turn, the discard pile is shuffled and then becomes the deck to draw from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player completes all three of his/her recipes and is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
