			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Character Levels 9-11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A world of heroism and epic adventure lives inside each of us. We can all imagine a world where stalwart knights battle ancient dragons, powerful wizards duel one another with mighty magics, and the brave-of-heart rescue mystic artifacts from the clutches of evil villains. With the Castles &amp;amp; Crusades roleplaying game from Troll Lord Games, you can take the role of a hero seeking adventure in a fantastic world populated by mythic creatures and legendary beasts. Or, as the Castle Keeper, you can design the worlds and stories that make up the game, guiding friends and fellow gamers through epic adventures in your own wondrous settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dread Crypt of Srihoz was first released as a d20 module in the Dungeon Crawl Classics line. Now this classic adventure is available in an officially licensed Castles &amp;amp; Crusades edition! Specially authorized by Troll Lord Games, The Dread Crypt of Srihoz is a classic fantasy adventure perfect for a C&amp;amp;C campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For leagues uncounted, a path has followed the tortured contours of a cliff which hangs over the storm-battered shore of the icy northern seas. The eternally damp rock is covered in places by a sickly film of grey mosses and lichens, which is the sum total of all the life forms able to scratch out an existence in this gods-forsaken hell. For atop the cliff stands the entrance to the dread crypt of Srihoz, a vampire of ancient name and deadly reputation. Only the bravest adventurers dare enter this place...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
