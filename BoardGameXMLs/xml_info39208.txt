			<description>This two to six player game of the rise and decline of historical empires could be described as a cross between History of the World and Vinci with a little Britannia thrown in.  While the participants play historical empires, the game does not recreate any particular history, hence allowing players to fully exercise strategic judgment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control empires on a map of Eurasia, ranging from the earliest history to the Mongols.  As time passes empires decline and finally disappear and new ones appear, but in the meantime receive new armies depending on terrain type and empire type (steppe, desert, agricultural).  Empires have historical point centers, and also have historically-based special characteristics such as leaders, religious zeal, light cavalry, and cataphracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 80 empires, with optional rules for use of 30 event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the number of players, their familiarity with the game, and the victory target selected, the game lasts 60-140 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
