			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as one of several characters. You try to last as long as you can in this sidescrolling game. There are three lanes you can travel in and can move between them. You try to attack enemies in these lanes for points. To attack you can slice the enemies or shot them with your arrow. Enemies give you point bonuses when you kill them. Each character has a special power such as getting more of a particular enemy or getting additional point bonuses for slicing or shooting them. When the character dies you can equip its ghost to use that ability two more times. If used up you can recharge it with ghosts found in the game. Try to make it as long as you can. After each level you can see how many of each enemies you have killed and can get in game bonuses for using their corpses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
