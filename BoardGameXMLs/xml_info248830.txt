							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guardians of Xobos</name>
									
			<description>Xobos is a Sci-fi theme board game where players compete to gain control over the last living source of planet. Long, long time ago Patrons, great explorers of the universe reached Xobos and - after gathering enough power to continue their journey - they leaved Guardians to protect Xobos. Guardians of Xobos protected energy sources for centuries, but once planet faded, they start to fight between each other to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is action packed tactical battle with unique mechanics of empowering units by creating &amp;quot;links&amp;quot; between Guardians. Player can add orders on his units, so each unit can be supported by different Guardian to gain healing powers or empowering attacks. Since Guardians can be upgraded via technology, one unit can act as a &amp;quot;tank&amp;quot; with huge amount of damage or lots of healing. Also, in the game there is place to focus on economy by building structures for gathering materials and to produce smaller units called Quarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, a player must gather Energy to be able to awaken dying source and in round 15 (the last in the game) should have highest number of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 structures in Xobos to gather materials, upgrading units and to protect terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn consist of two phases:&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Tactical phase, in which players move units (Quarks and Guardians) over map and place tokens to mark attacks. After each player takes his turn, fights between units are resolved (player attacking other units declares damage he deals upon enemy unit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: Economic phase, made simultaneously by players, where each player can build connections between Guardians, create Quarks, starting building structures and build technology tiles to boost units (or enhance other military aspects of units or buildings).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important note: game has no randomness, no dice rolling or card pulling. In fact, there are no dice or cads, just Units and Technology Tiles available to buy using certain resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the beginning of the first round players need to focus on various aspect of military and economic expanse to gain control over the last, living source and each of 15 rounds is more and more intense.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
