			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grown fat and wealthy on the trade flowing along the Mauro River, Summerford is a prosperous place. River barges laden with trade goods put into the docks and the local trading post is a veritable hive of activity. The village streets are clean and Lord Fabius Ocrtooth&amp;rsquo;s guards keep the populace safe. At night, the taproom of the Rusty Rapier is busy with peasants and traders alike relaxing after a hard day&amp;rsquo;s work. Turmoil and strife, though, lurk beneath Summerford&amp;rsquo;s placid exterior. Marauding kobolds repeatedly attack the nearby Iron Hill mine slaying the miners while in the village proper the widows of the slain miners call with increasing anger for the mine to be closed. Rumours of devil worship swirl about the village&amp;rsquo;s reclusive lord and a nascent gray market has established itself on the docks. Summerford is far from the tranquil idyll it seems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village Backdrops are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single village ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure, as an adventure site themselves or as a PC&amp;rsquo;s home, Village Backdrop present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
