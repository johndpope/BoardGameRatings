							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Feast of Gold</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Tales of the 13th Age, in two parts, for characters of level 5 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventurers find themselves in Glitterhaegen in winter, at the start of the festival known as the Feast of Gold. Start by discussing with the players why their characters are in town. Encourage players to link together their reasons for being in town, and to say how their characters know other members of the party. Look for character backgrounds that match up and suggest links between the party members.&lt;br/&gt;Whatever the reason the characters have for being in town, their main business in town is now concluded and has given the adventurers a reason to be together. If nothing else suggests itself, then the adventurers have found lodgings together in one of the only inns in the city (at this time of year the rest of the inns are full).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
