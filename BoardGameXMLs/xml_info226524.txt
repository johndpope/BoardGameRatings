							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Law&#039;s Out</name>
									
			<description>Law's Out is the newest hit Western film, but no one seems to agree what exactly it's about. Some people say it's about the mysterious stranger who blew into town and toppled the baron's monopoly on coal. Someone mentioned a doctor who had a deal with the devil. I even heard someone say the sheriff shot the preacher. Should be exciting, why not check it out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, Law's Out is a fictional movie. Not in the fictional sense of &amp;quot;the events portrayed aren't real.&amp;quot; I mean it doesn't exist. It isn't a movie anyone's made, or at least, they haven't made it yet. That's where you and your friends come in. Each of you will take on the role of an actor in the film, and you'll set up plot points, ante your resources for personal gain, and try to weasel your way into a happy ending. Or a tragic ending, if that's more interesting. It very well could be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a rulebook for playing as the actor's of the fictional film Law's Out, directed and acted out by you and your friends. In the game, you will auction off everything you have for control of the story, and the player who puts the most on the line will seize more control over the story than anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Law's Out only needs a pencil and some note cards to play, although it is helpful to have a printer as well, so you can print off everyone's Role cards. Law's Out is suitable for 3-8 players, and a typical game will last 2-4 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Description from last page of PDF playbook)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
