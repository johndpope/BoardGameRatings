							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">MOBA WARS</name>
									
			<description>Moba Wars is a board game where you can carry out epic battles between two sides. Based on the current successful online games, known as MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). With the help of your minions, towers and powerful heroes, you must achieve victory by destroying the enemy's power core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moba Wars comes from the idea to build a &amp;ldquo;bridge&amp;rdquo; between two gaming worlds, computer/console games and board games. Joining both fun and rivalry in one same game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowadays, the digital era is not a myth, it's a fact. But as famous clothing fashions or good music come back and adapts to modern times, board games and wargames can also do so, in the same way, as mentioned before, bell-bottomed trousers or good rock resurface and set a trend. MOBA WARS is born for this purpose, and one of our goals being to achieve competitive events in many countries, creating a new gaming commuity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is why we have chosen the new branch of videogames, already recognized as sport and with an exponential growth of participants and followers all over the world, E-SPORTS, where we will focus on the main branch, MOBAs. Over 100 million players in 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
