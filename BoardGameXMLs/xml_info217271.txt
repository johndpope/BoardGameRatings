			<description>Simple childrens/family cooperative game where you try to keep your organic garden safe from pests, while trying to catch as many of them as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a 12&amp;quot;X 12&amp;quot; board made up of nine different numbered garden patches, 7 cardboard garden pests numbered 1-6, paperboard havahart trap, 2 dice and electric fence chart (used in harder game play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: put pests on the board in the matching black numbered/picture patch of the garden. The skunk starts the game off the board next to the number 1 space. Oldest player goes first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;1. Put the open trap on any garden patch&lt;br/&gt;2. Roll both dice to see which pests move. &lt;br/&gt;A pest is moved to its matching picture. Back and forth between its black numbered space and the bottom row of the garden with red-numbered picture/spaces. A 1 rolled, moves both a pest, AND moves the skunk onto the board. The skunk only moves on a 1, and follows the green dotted path through the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a pest ends up in the trap at the end of a turn, it is caught and moved off the board. It CAN re-enter the game if doubles of their number are rolled! Skunks cannot be removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all the pests have been caught and are off the board, OR the skunk moves through all 9 garden patches and leaves the garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the skunks departure ends the game, count up how many pests you got rid of, and try for more next time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
