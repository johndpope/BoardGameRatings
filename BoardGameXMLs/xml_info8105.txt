							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Talisman Sorcerers Tower Expansion (Fan expansion for Talisman)</name>
									
			<description>Fan created expansion:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crown of command has been stolen by an evil Sorcerer. And at the centre of the land of Talisman stands his ancient, ruined tower. In ages past it belonged to the Wizard who ruled the land, but now it is the lair of the Sorcerer. This expansion set contains a new three-dimensional game board representing the tower, and 32 Sorcerers Tower cards to add a different ending to every game. Now, to win the game, you must battle your way to the top of the tower past hideous monsters and cunning traps, and defeat the Sorcerer in mortal combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Talisman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
