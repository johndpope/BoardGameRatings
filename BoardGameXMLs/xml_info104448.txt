			<description>Photo Safari is one of several &amp;quot;LP games&amp;quot; released some time in the 80s, where the &amp;quot;box&amp;quot; is the shape and size of a record sleeve and folds out to reveal the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features a spirally linear track through the jungle, along which players move their pieces according to the roll of the die. Some squares offer photo opportunities which yield money; others force a player to take a detour or lose moves. The goal is to reach the end of the track and return. Once a player has returned to the start those still on the track begin to lose money for each move, so the winner is not necessarily the player who moves the fastest or takes the most photos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
