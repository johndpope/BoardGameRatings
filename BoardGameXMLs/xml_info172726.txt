			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAZILLIONS of years have passed since the Time of the Flush and the extinction of the vaunted Hoomanrace. Now, After the Wipe, the descendants of cockroaches, snack cakes, worms, and even lowlier things rule the Oith!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waggle the arcane zazz of hocus pokery, dementalism, smellcasting, holy rolling, danged wrangling, and contanimation! Battle hideous things that want to eat you, risen from the rubble of ancient civilizations. Enjoy a light lunch at the Primordial Soup Kitchen...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Audacious times are upon us! Lost lands and forgotten civilizations await discovery. Terrible monsters and grand treasures lurk behind every rock. There are hoards to nab, foes to stab, and tales to blab. these are the days of Low adventure, where destiny is shaped not by circumstance of birth, but by strength of snazz, zazz, and jazz. It&amp;rsquo;s a bold world for bold peeps, where life is relatively inexpensive and even the lowliest werm can become a king by his own mop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you croach enough to follow your destiny? Do you have the nuggets to take your rightful place among Oith&amp;rsquo;s most valiant heroes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If so, strap on your esophagator hide shield, pick up your battle spork, mount your slog, whisper a prayer to Jelvis, kiss your larvae goodbye, and open the goosin&amp;rsquo; book. The muck-riddled road to LOW ADVENTURE stands before you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
