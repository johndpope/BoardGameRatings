			<description>Each player gets 10 meeples. All meeples start in the center hole in the game board. At all times each Player has only 1 meeple on the board. The meeples begin on the space of their color on the inner circle and try to get to the spaces of their color on the outher circle. If a meeple gets on an occupied space, the opponent gets thrown back into the center hole to start again. When a meeple gets on a space of its own color on the outher circle, it vanishes into the hole of the same color. If there are meeples on the two other spaces of this color, they get captured and are thrown into the hole too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who has the most meeples in his compartment under the game board at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
