							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Words</name>
									
			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;You know the words. Maybe you read them in a loathsome book penned by a madman. Maybe someone cruel whispered them to you. Maybe you had the misfortune to overhear them. Maybe they were taught to you by someone you hate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can say the words and terrible things happen...you can make terrible things happen. And maybe you do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But someone said the words on TV. Some mad fool. And the words went everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
