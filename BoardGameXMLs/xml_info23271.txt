			<description>The Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hunt takes place in a future world where people entertain themselves watching a game called THE HUNT. An arena/maze is prepared where a violent criminal is put into along with less harmful people and the main actors of the game the hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The latters are taken over by the players and their object is to hunt down the so called fox, while collecting points for various actions, like &amp;quot;killing the fox&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dying a noble death&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;witty statement&amp;quot;. Maybe you know the film &amp;quot;Running Man&amp;quot;? That's it. Not 100% but very close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole spectacle is run by a referee, who plays the fox, awards points and comments on the players actions. He is the one who keeps the game running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So its a &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; death match game, where action and fast gaming are the most important ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player has to create a character, buy equipment to go hunting (weapons and armor) and maybe tell a short story about the person the represent. Even at this point you can score points for a great introduction of your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns, in which a player could take two of these actions: Movement, Use Skill, Aiming, Reloading a Bow, Attack. Actions are taken by initiative and Combat is run by an extra combat sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE HUNT comes as a simple booklet with the rules and counters to be copied and cut out. All very simple and black/white. No fancy artwork  or mounted boards, just plain paper. The maze is as simple as the rest, simple squares printed on plain paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Overtime&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
