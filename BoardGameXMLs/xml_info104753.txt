			<description>The game plays a Navy air-naval battle. It consists of two boards and two decks with cards. Each team (blue or green) has 56 cards types of ships, aircraft or 41 cards marked &amp;quot;water&amp;quot;. But the rules are differently from the game Battleship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team has 56 cards described below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 aircraft-carrier&lt;br/&gt;2 submarines&lt;br/&gt;3 frigates&lt;br/&gt;4 corvettes&lt;br/&gt;5 planes and&lt;br/&gt;41 water cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each participant puts the 56 cards covered plugged into its own board (green or blue depending on the participant's team). The first choose a number and fires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If he hits the water, it is the turn of the other participant.&lt;br/&gt;If he hits an enemy unit, he is entitled to withdraw more cards of the adversary according to the chart below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;air-craft: more 5 hits (he can turn 5 foe cards)&lt;br/&gt;submarine: more 4 hits &lt;br/&gt;frigate: more 3 hits &lt;br/&gt;corvette: more 2 hits&lt;br/&gt;plane: more 1 hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As he hits more enemy units, he will be entitled to accumulate more cards. However, the first time he hits surface water, it loses the remaining shots and passes to the opponent's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player turn the card in box 33 and hit an air-craft. Then he can turn 5 more cards. The he choose the card in box 27 and hits a frigate. So he can flip more 7 cards (the remaining 4 plus 3). But then, he choose the box 15 and hits water. At this moment he passes to the opponent's turn losing the remaining shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ther game ends when one participant hits the entire enemy fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
