							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman Returns Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This is actually three card games in one...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Batman Match game: Each player is dealt 5 cards and another five are placed face up on the table. On your turn you draw a card and, if you can match one of the cards on the table, take the pair and place it in front of you. If you can't make a match, you add a card from your hand to the center. When all the players have played all their cards, the player with the most matches wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Batman Battle Game: This is simply the card game &amp;quot;War&amp;quot; using the numbers on the cards. The main difference is that if you play an Umbrella card, you may look at the next two cards in your stack and choose the one you wish to play. The winner is the player with the most cards when the first opponent is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Penguin Panic Game: This is simply the card game &amp;quot;Slap Jack&amp;quot;. All the cards are dealt out to the players. On your turn you turn over your top card and toss it on the growing pile in the center of the table. If the card turned over is The Penguin, all players try to be the first to slap their hand down on it. The player who slaps it first wins all the cards and adds them to his stack. The winner is the player with the most cards when the first opponent runs out of cards to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
