							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CUBE: The Print and Play Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is based on the &amp;quot;CUBE&amp;quot; movies. Players wake up to find themselves in a cube. They have to find the goal and get out of the cube alive. To escape from the CUBE, you need memory and great luck. Sometimes the goal is right next to you, but sometimes it is too far to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a print and play game. The pdf includes the following components:&lt;br/&gt;- 36 cube cards&lt;br/&gt;- 6 character cards&lt;br/&gt;- 12 item cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up this game, the cube cards are shuffled and arranged upside down in a 6x6 grid. Players choose a character and place the token in the start position. On a turn, a player chooses a direction in which to move and turns over the card of the entered room. If nothing happens, the player can move safely into that room. If the card shows a trap, the player must roll a specific number on a 6 sided dice to determine if the trap could be avoided. If the trap could not be avoided, damage is taken and the room is entered. At the end of each round, the dice is rolled and the grid of cards is moved according to the dice roll. The entire grid is always changing. Characters have special powers and actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all of the players die or if one of the players finds the goal and gets out of the cube alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
