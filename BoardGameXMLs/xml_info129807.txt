							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Frontier Apocalypse: The Hermit&#039;s Expedition</name>
									
			<description>In Frontier Apocalypse, the world famous gunfight at the O.K Corral never happens. The night before, the unspeakable happens and the world was forever changed. Some blamed the South, some blamed the North, some blamed England, some blamed God or the Devil, but no one really knew what happened or why. But somehow humanity was able to survive the pulverizing chunks of moon rock that struck the planet; somehow humanity survived the various super volcanoes, massive radioactive solar flares and other terrible apocalyptic events. Frontier Apocalypse takes place over 100 years after that unspeakable event. In Frontier Apocalypse the Wild West never ended, it just got Wilder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frontier Apocalypse: The Hermit's Expedition is a solo Role Playing board/card game in the vein of games like Dungeon, Talisman, Chainsaw Warrior, and Dungeoneer. The player creates a character rolling dice, and then explores a post apocalyptic wild west by flipping cards that either reveal territories, critters, contraptions or various other events or points of interest. There are also boards to help with organization of character stats, gear and the game world. The game has several randomly chosen Expeditions that the player will need to complete with their character in order to win.Combat versus enemies is resolved by the character stats and contraptions and dice rolling. The player wins by completing their Expedition before running out of supplies or getting defeated the by various strange and weird critters who inhabit the Frontier Apocalypse world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
