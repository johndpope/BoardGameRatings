							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sellsword Miniatures Skirmish Game</name>
									
			<description>Sellsword is a simplified gaming system that prioritizes play.  Players command small warbands in small unit combat situations.  You can acquire 28mm miniatures from any source you choose.  The skirmish game uses a stat card for each unit, and each card has a brief description of an appropriately sculpted and posed miniature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sellsword is frequently played with very limited magic.  It has a number of different fantasy levels, each listed on a particular unit&amp;rsquo;s stat cards.  The more fantastic a unit&amp;rsquo;s abilities, the higher its fantasy level.  This permits each skirmish played to have a cap on the fantasy level, as the players desire.  This is different from a number of roleplaying and skirmish games currently available, where magic runs rampant and high fantasy is the norm.  The Sellsword world is perhaps just a bit darker, and a bit grittier.  In this way, the Sellsword world is also closer to our own earth.  There may be magic, but it is frequently subtle.  In similar fashion, science is very limited in Sellsword.  You may find that a lightning bolt and a bonfire both do similar types of damage.  There is no &amp;lsquo;electrical&amp;rsquo; damage, since electricity does not exist.  Most people in the Sellsword world know that bad things live in the dark corners of the world, that poison and disease are kindred maladies, and that this is the world where they earn their place in the afterlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the game seems a little daunting, don't despair.  The basic game is a good introduction to the system, and you can graduate to the full skirmish game after that.  The skirmish game is designed to be played by friends at home, or in a tournament scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you that don&amp;rsquo;t like Grids, we&amp;rsquo;ll have variant rules for that as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
