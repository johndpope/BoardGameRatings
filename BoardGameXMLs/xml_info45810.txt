			<description>This product is the core rulebook to the Altus Adventum fantasy RPG. It contains everything you need for both the GM and players to run a full campaign, including detailed combat rules, four distinct magic systems, many arcane treasures, and over a hundred fantastic creatures in the bestiary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those wanting a taste of what this game has to offer may click the &amp;quot;Demo&amp;quot; button for a brief adventure. The game is designed to bring back that old school feel of &amp;quot;kill them and take their stuff!&amp;quot; while not giving anything up in storyline or gameplay. The combat system is designed to move very rapidly, while at the same time offering a tremendous amount of flexibility to the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to expect: speedy combat system, flexibility, four unique magic styles, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What not to expect: hit points, classes, or levels.
