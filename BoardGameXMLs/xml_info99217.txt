							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cubex Playing Cards</name>
									
			<description>Cubex consists of 9 cubes, with each side representing a playing card, so you get 54 sides (1 deck + 2 jokers).&lt;br/&gt;The play is rather interesting. First you take the cubes out of the box, then, in turn order, each player selects a cube and places it back into the box. Once all 9 cubes are back in the box, the second phase begins. The starting player takes any cube from the four corners and starts to form a 3 x 3 wall of 'bricks'. The next selected cube must be taken from the space adjacent to the first cube, in clockwise order. Remember, when you choose a cube and place it, the opposite side of the cube will be facing your opponent, so you need to help yourself whilst also giving non-attractive 'cards' to your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;The main game is one where you try to get the best Brag (a form of Poker but only three cards count) hand facing you. There are other games suggested, with a form of Patience being the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
