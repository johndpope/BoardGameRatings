			<description>Gunbird 2 is a 2D scrolling shooter, sequel to the original Gunbird game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through gameplay cutscenes (and endings) it appears that the zany, uproarious (and at times rather adult) humor is considerably increased since the original Gunbird. The game has numerous similarities to the Parodius series, including the final boss in the game, a cartoon elephant playing a trumpet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seven stages in each game loop (two loops total). The first three stages are randomly chosen from possible four. At 2nd loop, enemies fire denser bullet patterns moving at faster speeds. Stage 2-1 takes place at the only stage not available in 1st loop, instead of the 1-1 counterpart. After completing 1st loop with only one player, player can choose one of two choices for a wish with magic potion, with unique ending for each choice. If 1st loop is completed with two players, a combination-specific ending is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first Psikyo shooter to feature medal-chaining: picking up 2000 point medals (when they flash) repeatedly results in a slight point increase and a coin chain, recorded separately from the score. This was later featured in Strikers 1945 III/Strikers 1999 and Strikers 1945 Plus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gunbird 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
