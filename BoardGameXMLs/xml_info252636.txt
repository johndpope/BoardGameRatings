			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From your tower window you are stare, confused, at the Prince with the White Horse. You had been waiting for something else. A place out there in the Dark Forest holds a murder of crows with very sharp claws. History can begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THERE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have made sure that your sword is within reach, and despite the cozy atmosphere, you know something is seriously wrong: You smell death and dragon fire. Black shadows sharply slash against a fateful, dark sky. Is it now you're going to be the hero?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WAS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The silence is broken: A new battle in the fight against Darkness's forces must be fought. Demons to be found and dispatched. The world's demise looms. Again. On the way you meet an unexpected stranger with an hourglass and a big, friendly smile. &amp;quot;Sorry, can you tell me what time is it?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your beloved ship has been hit, and as you rush to the alien planet somewhere far below you, your only thought is strange enough: &amp;quot;This should not happen!&amp;quot; You fail when the atmosphere of the planet drowns the ship's cabin in an irresistible flaming sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LAST&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;They are entitled not to,&amp;quot; says the man. &amp;quot;They are entitled to a lawyer. If you can not afford a lawyer, you will...&amp;quot;  You revile him before you think about his strange speech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WALK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario explores the idea of a death sentence where a large part of the action takes place at full speed somewhere between imagination and reality. Trapped in a battle between the entertainment industry's major flagship and unknown underwater forces from the outside. Suspected of mass murder. Persecuted and confused. To survive and prove your innocence, you must find the truth about yourself under several layers of illusions. If you dare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Little mirror on the wall there, who am I?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
