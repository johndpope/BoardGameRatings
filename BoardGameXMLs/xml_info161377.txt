			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Gaming Lab! Earlier this year we hosted a great event here in Brazil focused on analog game design discussion. Creators from all around came to showcase their projects, ideas, theories. The Laborat&amp;oacute;rio de Jogos was a great success, and I hope next year we'll be able to bring more international guests!&lt;br/&gt;     Patronage in Brazil! Find out who is already using this amazing platform in Portuguese language. A lot of new projects coming all around and now we're finally trying to translate everything to English!&lt;br/&gt;     Caduceus! Every issue of the Analog XP will contain a fully translated game and this month we have Caduceus, a two player futuristic game about using another body as a vessel for your brain to infiltrate a living fortress. This was the first game of the Patreon Versus to be voted as the best game yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
