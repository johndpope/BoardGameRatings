			<description>Draw 12 tiles and place them behind your screen.  Create sequences of 3 or more tiles.  First person to use all of their tiles wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first round, each player must open by creating a new sequence.  After the first round of play, players may create more new sequences or place individual tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new sequence can be created vertically or horizontally -- in crossword fashion -- but the value between tiles in a sequence must always be equal, such as 3-7-11 (spaced by 4) or 5-12-19 (spaced by 7).  TIME WARP:  If a player plays a new sequence which contains one tile of each color (red, blue, and yellow), all opponents draw one random tile from the cloth bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After their opening turn, players may add new tiles to the front or end of an existing sequence (including another player's sequence), as long as the spacing already established for that sequence is followed.  Players may also insert two or more new tiles inside an existing sequence, altering the spacing to a new value between tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play as many tiles as possible on their turn, and if they can't play at least one tile they must draw one from the cloth bag.  The first player to place all their tiles wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Sequencing, Patterning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
