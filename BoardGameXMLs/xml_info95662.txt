			<description>A Fistful of TOWs 3 is a fast-playing battalion- to brigade/regiment-level game using miniatures. Game covers mid-1930s to 2015, and army lists from WW2 and post-war eras. Each stand represents a platoon. Can be played with miniatures from 2mm up to 15mm with no modifications; for larger miniatures authors suggest possibly changing ground scale. Design ground scale is 1&amp;quot;=100m, can be played using 1cm=100m without altering any numbers. Nominal turn length is 12 minutes, but for infantry heavy games 20 or 30 minutes per turn is probably more accurate.&lt;br/&gt;Game features: &lt;br/&gt;- Troop quality is very important&lt;br/&gt;- Simple command rules&lt;br/&gt;- Includes a full battle-generator campaign system.&lt;br/&gt;- WW2 comprehensive data and army lists for Germany, USA, UK, France, and Poland.
