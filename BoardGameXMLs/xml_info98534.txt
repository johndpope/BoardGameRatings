							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trystell Campaign Setting Revised Edition</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trystell is a world of adventure. Magic, action, danger, combat, treasure, heroes, villains, gold and fame can all be found there. Elements of fantasy such as gnomes, dwarves, elves, minotaur and orcs can be found as well. Yet, in many ways Trystell is a world like our own. Plants, animals, greed, prejudice, honor, humor and deceit can be found within its bounds. Trystell is a setting ideally suited for heroic drama. It is a place where hopes, dreams, fears and ambitions await the eager adventurer. Good battles evil. Heroic adventurers fight sinister villains in epic battles, although sometimes things are a little more gray and the lines between hero an villain become blurred. Good luck in your journey into the fascinating world of Trystell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How Trystell Differs From Other d20 Games&lt;br/&gt;Trystell has a number of unique elements that distinguish it from other fantasy d20 games. Not only does the world has its own unique flavor, it has a blend of high fantasy, impossible technology and more advanced academic theorems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to mere setting differences, Trystell also has a number of different variations from the standard d20 game mechanics. The following list is by no means complete, however, it should offer an overview of the most important mechanic chances for the experienced d20 player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Trystell setting offers a number of new races, classes and feats. In addition, the Trystell settings overhauls several existing classes.&lt;br/&gt;     The Trystell game utilizes a system of determining the contacts and allies of player characters, their reputations in the game world and a system of increasing unarmed AC as a character gains levels.&lt;br/&gt;     Characters in the Trystell setting have Vitality and Wound points instead of Hit Points. This provides a more realistic and gritty feel to combat.&lt;br/&gt;     The Trystell game utilizes character options called Traits and Flaws. Traits are packages taken at character creation that helps define a characters&amp;rsquo; strengths and weaknesses; flaws are kind of like anti-feats that grant characters bonus feats for taking a weakness.&lt;br/&gt;     The Trystell setting uses a different system for determining magic. Instead of having set spell slots, a spellcaster has a pool of spell points from which she casts spells.&lt;br/&gt;     Player characters in the Trystell setting have a mechanic resource known as Action Points.&lt;br/&gt;     There are no true alignments on Trystell. Instead characters have a trait called Allegiance.&lt;br/&gt;     Armor on Trystell provides not just a bonus to AC, but a bonus to defense as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
