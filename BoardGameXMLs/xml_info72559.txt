			<description>From the box cover and Rules of Play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presidential Campaign Game - Win the election using strategy and knowledge. The object of Psephology (se-fahl-uh-gee) is to be elected the president of the United States.  The first candidate to win at least 100 votes and then move to the White House is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psephology (from Wikipedia &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psephology&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psephology&lt;/a&gt;) Psephology (from Greek psephos &amp;psi;á¿†&amp;phi;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;, 'pebble', which the Greeks used as ballots) is that branch of political science which deals with the study and statistical analysis of elections. Psephology uses compilations of precinct voting returns for elections going back some years, public opinion polls, campaign finance information and similar statistical data. The term was coined in the United Kingdom in 1952 by historian R. B. McCallum to describe the scientific analysis of past elections. In Britain the term occasionally appears in scholarly literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has 625 cards containing 2500 questions and answers, Power Politics cards, game pieces, dice, a game board and vote cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice, decide how to move your marker, read the vote bonus/penalty on the board and then attempt to correctly answer a political question to win votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes rules for 7-12 players and classroom team play, including a timed version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
