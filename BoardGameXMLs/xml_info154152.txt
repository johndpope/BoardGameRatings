							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Death of Osama bin Laden</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 1, 2011, the reigning Hide-and-Seek World Champion from 2001 to 2011 lost his title and life when United States Special Forces entered his secret hideout and shot him. Now, through the magic of ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters, you can recreate that historic moment, in a scenario constructed with the use of top secret files recovered from the women's restroom in Nordstrom's following a mysterious Tweet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLF!: The Death of Osama bin Laden is the first in a series of historical recreation rollplaying scenarios, because we at NUELOW Games believe in educating while entertaining. It is a two-page supplement that features a three part combat scenario, four pre-generated characters, several new weapons and pieces of armor (including the Princess Leia Slave Bikini Replica and the Beer Hat).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included, as a special bonus, is the Official Rolf! Character Sheet for those of you who aren't content with using the pre-generated characters we provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
