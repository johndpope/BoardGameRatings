			<description>Divoshi is a two-player abstract strategy board game themed as a battle of two savage tribes. While similar to chess at first sight, the rules are very different. It is played on a square/rectangular board which may vary in size somewhere around 7x7. Like in chess, players make alternative turns, attacking and capturing opponent pieces and trying to capture the chief. But here the similarity ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divoshi has five types of pieces, and all of them may move in eight straight directions like the chess queen, but within a limited scope. What is most specific for Divoshi is the rule of pushing/retreat and capture. If a piece enters a square occupied by an opponent piece, the latter is pushed off one square further. If there is no room for the retreat, the piece is captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules favor an aggressive playing style in which having your own chief under attack usually entails losses. The freedom of movement and the possibility of moving two pieces in one pushing move make the game unusually dynamic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
