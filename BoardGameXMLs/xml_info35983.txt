			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s good versus &amp;ldquo;med&amp;rdquo;-evil in this game of combat based on the Evil Dead film Army of Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid or chess board. Each player controls 18 creatures, represented by miniatures or counters, which are based on characters from the film (such as Ash, Evil Ash, Archers, and Deadite Warriors.) The good guys also have the Deathcoaster car at their disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to eliminate all of the opposing units. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck and card play determines when units may move, attack, and defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
