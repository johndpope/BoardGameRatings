			<description>Box Copy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone will get caught!  Put your friends in the Hot Seat to get answers to all of the questions you've been dying to ask.  The unique vocal calibration software lets you know whether or not your friends are telling the truth!  Play Truth or Lies and discover what secrets are waiting to be revealed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Truth or Lies is a party game where players answer questions about themselves or make decisions in &amp;quot;Would you rather?&amp;quot; situations.  The game uses a microphone to record player responses and analyzes them for stress levels to determine truthfulness.  Players receive or lose points based on whether they responded truthfully or lied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes the Hot Seat mode where other players can ask questions of the player in the &amp;quot;Hot Seat&amp;quot; who is also judged for truthfulness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
