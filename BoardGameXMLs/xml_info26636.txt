							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Play Fut-Bal</name>
									
			<description>Play FUT-BAL was designed and self-published by Willard H. Wendt, former Ohio University and Depauw University Quarterback. The game uses cards which depict plays to simulate football game.  Includes Football field board and metal football, plus both offensive and defensive play cards.  The game does not include a board, per se. Rather, the football field is printed on the box bottom. It is expected that you will punch small pilot holes in this box bottom with the included pushpin. The plastic football token for tracking the scrimmage line has a spike that can be wedged into these holes as you advance down the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by both players playing cards, one offensive, the other defensive.  The strategy of the game comes from trying to force your opponent to play inopportune cards, such as ones that will cause a turnover, and guessing when they will play those cards, so that you can capitalize on it.  Significant luck is involved, but there's also playing the odds through card counting and outguessing your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
