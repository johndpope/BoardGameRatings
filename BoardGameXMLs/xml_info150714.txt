			<description>From Publisher Information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spinward Marches Adventure 2: Range War is a complete game scenario for the Traveller roleplaying game. Full stats are included for T20 and Classic Traveller, but this supplement is suitable for background material for any version of Traveller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is set in the Spinward Marches region and ties in with other materials published in that area, including The Bowman Arm and Adventure 1: Call of the Wild. It can be used anywhere in the Traveller Universe or another science-fiction game setting with a minimum of effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure 2: Range War continues the story of the Steel Project, an ambitious attempt to open up a frontier world for colonization and settlement. The first settlers are now arriving on Steel and struggling to build a civilization on a harsh and unforgiving world. However, it appears that Steel was not uninhabited when the settlers arrived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only are there hostile wildlife and an enclave of well-armed squatters to deal with, but Steel is also the target of offworld raiders who seem determined to smash the cradle of Steel's infant civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caught between advancing raiders and desperate refugees, the travellers hold the fate of the Steel Project in their hands. If they cut and run, they may well escape - but escape to where? If they fight, they are outgunned and overmatched.&lt;br/&gt;Saving civilization on Steel will require more than guns and cunning. The travellers will have to broker an unprecedented deal between Imperial settlers and the squatters who call this world home. Yet there are those who would rather see the world burn that ally with old enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure 2: Range War is a thrilling adventure that will challenge the tactical and political skills of any player group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Quote:â€¨ &amp;quot;Range War was inspired by the classic Traveller adventures - Mission on Mithril, Twilight's Peak and so forth. It's a showcase of frontier life on a developing world as well as a tough adventure that will allow the players to really feel they've achieved something - helped bring peace to a troubled world - at the end. And/or get themselves shot, blown up and possibly eaten by a hungry carnivore. Range War shows that things are not black and white in the Traveller universe. In the end it's all about people just doing what they think they have to.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
