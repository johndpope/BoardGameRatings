							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mines of Tarifel</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The village is defended by a strong stone wall and towers. It is ruled by a grim dwarven Captain, the dwarf lady Grida. Tarifell is known for its stone quarries. The quarries produce some of the finest marble in this region but the mine is where the money is made. The mine is a motherlode of good iron and a few deposits of rubies for good measure. The dwarves were starting to open up another deeper shaft when a horde of kobolds took over the mines. The dwarves briefly tried to retake the mines but were pushed back by overhwleming numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lady Grida sent messengers to the nearby dwarfhold for reinforcements and aid but she has not heard anything back yet. The kobolds are costing her clan a fortune for everyday the mine is not in operation and she is desperate to get back on schedule.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Side Quests pdfs provide GMs with interesting NPCs and locations to use with or against your player group. Side Quests can be interesting stops along the road or a one shot side quest if the full party isn't present for the evening of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of a Town including tavern, meals and costs, patrons and some rumors, town goings on, any stores, brothels or other significant places of interest in town as well as a short adventure or dungeon crawl to fill a evening of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
