			<description>Who needs cards? DiceHoldem&amp;trade; is the Ideal Portable Poker Game! Played just like Texas Holdem!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use a combination of guile and luck, bluff and planning, to compete for the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using unique dice with the letters H, O, L, D, E, and M on them, players compete to make &amp;quot;hands&amp;quot; of the best combination of their 2 player dice and the 5 community dice.  The betting rounds are the same as Texas Holdem and each one rolls another community die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants are included for faster play, advanced play, and &amp;quot;Can't Holdem&amp;quot; (a two-player variant that has players bid for a guess at one of five dice that are thrown).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set includes a zippered carrying pouch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
