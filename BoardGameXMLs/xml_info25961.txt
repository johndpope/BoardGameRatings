			<description>This game based upon the Davitamon-Quick Step cycling team in 2003, is a simple roll &amp;amp; move game. The board has 60x35cms. dimensions with a track of 67 boxes on it. Players move their cyclist (either 1 or 2 cyclists each), which looks closely to the ones used in 'D&amp;eacute;marrage', by rolling a die. The rules contain 2 different versions of the game. In the basic game the winner is just the first cyclist who crosses the finish line first. In the more advanced rules the winner is the one who scores most points in the intermediate sprints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
