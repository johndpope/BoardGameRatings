							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dive: The Medes Islands Secret</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;Over the past five centuries, hundreds of ships flying every ensign have succumbed to the power of the ocean. Merchant boats, pirate ships, navy vessels...all of them have ended up covered with coral at the bottom of the oceans around the planet. But all of them guarded secrets that remained hidden over the years. Secrets that have always been a mystery...until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dive: The Medes Islands Secret, you are John Sanders, a treasure hunter and experienced diver who spends months planning and documenting a major expedition to locate and recover several ships of different ensigns around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
