							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Crawl</name>
									
			<description>Dungeon Crawl is a solitaire RPG card game designed for use with a standard deck of playing cards. It was developed by Marc Case for the 2012 Instructables Toy Contest 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Crawl uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards with the Jokers removed and a character stat and score chart. Gameplay begins by selecting a Mage or Warrior character class and drawing cards from the deck to determine stats. Mages draw cards for hit points (HP) determining health and mana points (MP) for casting spells. Warriors draw cards for hit points (HP) determining health and shield points (SP) determining defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay progresses through a series of rooms each of which contains a single monster encounter. You begin the room by drawing cards to determine the stats of the monster including hit and damage points. Next you draw for initiative with the higher card determining the order of the battle between the player or monster. The monster and Warrior turns consist of drawing an attack card with the value determining the strength of the attack followed by an opposing evasion card with the color determining its success. The Mage turn consists of either a one point Melee attack with opposing evasion draw or an attack spell with opposing evasion draw. A Mage may cast an attack spell by turning over a mana card during the players turn or a shield spell by casting during the monsters turn. Player and monster alternate turns until one of them is defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You progress to another room by defeating the monster. The defeated monster's HP is added to your cumulative score and all cards played during the round are shuffled back into the deck. Mages may sacrifice 10 score points at any time to regenerate the mana pool. Gameplay ends when you die in combat or choose to leave the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
