			<description>&amp;quot;A solo game of warfare and intrigue in the Roman Empire.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The time frame is somewhere between 50 and 150 AD. An emperor of long standing has just died. You happen to know with certainty that you are his intended successor, but he died before announcing this to the Senate. Your job: defeat the other powerful contenders to the throne and claim your rightful place as Imperator!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The designer notes: &amp;quot;The scope of the player's choices in the game is somewhat limited, possibly making this more of a simulation than a strategy game. However, it was my intent to construct something that can be played as a simple pastime rather than with a great deal of advanced forethought.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
