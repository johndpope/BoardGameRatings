							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Variations 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing new rules variations to power your Mythic adventures! Mythic Variations 2 is a collection of rules modifications for Mythic Role Playing and Mythic Game Master Emulator, giving players a new way to experience GM-less and solo role playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Variations 2 expands on the core Yes/No mechanic of Mythic, splitting questions into 5 separate types of questions, or Checks, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     FATE CHECK: To answer any Yes/No Question, exactly as was done with Mythic's Fate Chart except now without the chart.&lt;br/&gt;     DETAIL CHECK: This is used to answer any plain language Question and it replaces the Complex Question from Mythic Variations. &lt;br/&gt;     EVENT CHECK: This Check is to determine an event that is happening, has happened, or will happen. It replaces the Random Event roll from original Mythic.&lt;br/&gt;     BEHAVIOR CHECK: This Check is to determine the specific actions of NPCs on a round-to-round or as needed basis. It is rolled to determine an NPC&amp;rsquo;s behavior.&lt;br/&gt;     STATISTIC CHECK: This Check is used to determine game statistics for NPCs and other crunchy elements of your adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Variations 2 makes Mythic more useful than ever, tackling any question you might throw at it and giving your characters the kinds of adventures they deserve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
