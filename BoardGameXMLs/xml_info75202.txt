							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Assault of the Dead: Tactics</name>
									
			<description>From the Rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;Assault of the Dead: Tactics is a tactical board game with roleplaying elements, The game combines thematic elements from the Assault of the Dead game but with a combat system unlike any other previously seen in the series. In contrast to Assault of the Dead: Tactics has a character building system (that includes Perks, Weapons, and Survival kits) as well as support for solo play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assault of the Dead: Tactics is set in a fictional zombie-infested city called Cloverdale. The game's story follows through scenarios, unfolding part of the city map allowing the players to explore new and dangerous areas. As the story progresses, you and your allies discover a sinister effect behind the zombie outbreak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game-play of Assault of the Dead: Tactics differs in several key areas;  Characters move on a battlefield composed of circular tiles; movement and actions are determined by the character's Perks, Weapons, and Survival Kits he carries. Battles are low luck; a character can use any number of actions to attack, with attacks always hitting. During battle, whenever an attack is made, dice rolls determine the number of damage points the character can 'spend' on hits and weapon crits. Deal enough hits, and the Zombie is defeated leaving behind a Survival token -- used to buy actions or resupply your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the original Assault of the Dead: Tactics adjusts the level of reaction from the Zombie side based on how well the characters are doing. Do well and the game spawns more zombies, makes them aggressive, and more powerful. Do poorly, the game will end your misery soon enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
