							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steel Panthers: World at War â€“ Generals Edition</name>
									
			<description>Steel Panthers World At War General Edition includes all four Mega-Campaign games and a free v8.20 of SPWaW. What is a Mega Campaign you ask? Mega-Campaigns are specially designed and programmed campaign systems for Steel Panthers: World at War. Mega-Campaigns are non-linear; they branch into dozens of directions, depending on the victory level achieved by the player and also on his choices during play. In a Mega-Campaign, you not only face standard attack or defend types of battles, but many unusual missions and variants are also available for assignment. You may be sent to free POWs, or make an amphibious assault. You'll find dozens of pictures, backgrounds, historical documents and insights included with each Mega-Campaign, plus numerous maps to help find out where you are. As you win (or lose) battles, a map will display each location for you. For exceeding valor you may receive special awards. You will find yourself immersed in the campaign and a stand-alone battle will never feel the same again. The fact is to truly get the feel of a Mega Campaign one must experience it. SP:WaW also includes a timed play feature, giving each player a specific amount of time to conduct his turn before it ends and his opponent's turn begins. Armor, gun and vehicle units are represented by individual icons. Each infantry squad can have up to 25 men in it. Machine guns, mortars and artillery units are also realistically portrayed and crewed. Each hex represents 50 yards (meters) of the virtual battlefield, with many new terrain features added. Each game turn represents a few minutes of real time, and games can last from a few turns to entire campaigns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
