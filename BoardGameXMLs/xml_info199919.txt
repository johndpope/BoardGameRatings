			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlas Reactor is a 4v4 combat game where each player controls one of many &amp;quot;freelancers&amp;quot;, with each freelancer having its own set of unique skills.  Combat is turn-based, where players have a limited amount of time to choose how their freelancer will act in the following turn.  Once time is up, commands are resolved simultaneously in order of the game's four main phases: Prep, Dash, Blast, and Move.  The first team to eliminate opposing characters 5 times, or the team that has the most eliminations after a fixed number of rounds is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
