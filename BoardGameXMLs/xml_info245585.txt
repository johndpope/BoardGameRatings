							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Spooky, Punny, Book Titles</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list features 50 silly, spooky, book titles (mostly) inspired by real classics. Some of them are a direct play off of the original title such as The Rise and Fall of the Roman Vampire and A Comedy of Terrors. While others are inspired by characters or plot points in the original books such as Silencing That Tell Tale Heart: A Guide for the Nervous Killer and The Ecology Werecats by Dr. Doolittle. Finally, a few of the titles are inspired by more modern titles such as Cooking for Creatures by Martha Steamwart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, whether you are trying to fill the bookshelf of a well read monster or just trying to get a giggle/eye roll out of your party you'll find everything you need right here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
