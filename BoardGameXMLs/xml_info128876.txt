			<description>The board contains 61 hexes of which 5 are black, 6 red (R) and 6 blue (B). The group of hexes is called the red player's base and contains the red player&amp;rsquo;s counters at the start of the game, similarly for the blue hexes. The black hexes are impassable. They can neither be stopped on nor passed through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when the opponent&amp;rsquo;s base is completely occupied. This may be at any time after each player has had his first turn. Although the 6 occupying pieces are normally all of your own colour this does not have to be the case. If your opponent is foolish enough to leave a piece in his base then take advantage of it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take it in turn to move any one of their pieces which is not in the opponent&amp;rsquo;s base. This piece is moved in any direction of the player&amp;rsquo;s choice until blocked by a black hex, the edge of the board or a piece of either colour. A piece must be moved as far as possible in the chosen direction&amp;mdash;it cannot stop &amp;lsquo;en route&amp;rsquo;. At no time can a piece occupy the same hex as, or pass over, any other piece of either colour. A player must make a move on his turn. If he is unable to do so then he has lost the game. Once a piece has stopped on the opponent's base it may not be moved later but must stay where it is for the rest of the game. There is no penalty for moving through the opponent&amp;rsquo;s base, provided you do not stop there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
