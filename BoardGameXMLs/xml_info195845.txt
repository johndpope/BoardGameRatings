							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terrors of Obsidian Apocalypse: Haunts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On rare occasions a soul tainted by dread, fear, rage and anger  leaves its broken corpse, if it is powerful enough, that soul may return as a ghost, a wraith or some worse form of undead. If it is powerful enough, angry enough&amp;hellip;..Souls lacking the metaphysical hardiness to retain their own identity after death may also return to the living as something else, something lesser, a ghostly presence that blurs the line between a magical trap and a true undead. Inside this sourcebook you will find haunts you&amp;rsquo;ll need to enhance fear and terror in your home and local Obsidian Apocalypse including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Creeping Ectoplasm (CR 2) - A minor haunt devoid of any shred of individuality or history,manifesting as a shapeless blob of ectoplasm.&lt;br/&gt;    Doors to Damnation (CR 9) - A soldier guarded this door against overwhelming forces and cursed the invaders with his dying breath when he finally fell.&lt;br/&gt;    Hangman&amp;rsquo;s Jig (CR 5) - A desperate prisoner was incompetently hanged in this small cell.An echo of his painful death lingers and haunts anyone visiting the room.&lt;br/&gt;    Memory of the Late Mistress (CR 7) - A woman died, choked to death by her jealous lover on this bed, forever tainting it with ghostly malice toward the living.&lt;br/&gt;    Warlock&amp;rsquo;s Doom (CR 8) - This haunt is the lingering residue of a powerful magician&amp;rsquo;s final stand&amp;mdash;slivers of his spirit and the last spell he ever cast bound together in a volley of destruction unleashed against the world.&lt;br/&gt;    Plus nearly 15 more all new haunts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
