			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades ago a small but influential cult controlled a small area around the Dwarven holdings of Agar. For unknown reasons this cult died out and the shrine was lost to the sands of time. Recently the local thane has received reports that there has been renewed activity in the area and a gathering of humanoids in the area. While the thane&amp;rsquo;s men have fought bravely they were no match for this group and the call has gone out for brave adventurers to assist with the problem. While your party is young you do have an adventure or two under your belts and this may be the challenge to make you famous&amp;hellip;.if you can handle it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a low level adventurers and DM.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign! This adventure is part of my original campaign decades ago so it isn&amp;rsquo;t as polished as current work but still quite entertaining!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
