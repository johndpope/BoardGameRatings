			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to And Other Stories, the generic competitive collaborative storytelling game. Have you always wanted to tell a fairy-tale? Do you enjoy giant robots battling it out in zero-gravity? Do you want to write your own police drama on the spot? Well this is the game for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over three Acts, players take turns to frame Scenes using their characters as the Protagonist. Other players can enter the Scene joining him/her as Allies. Each Active player in the Scene takes the narrative reigns in turn and use their characters' Attributes to drive the story forward - each contributing to the unravelling plot as the game progresses. At the end of the Scene the Protagonist and Allies roll Fable dice to make the outcome of the Scene a success. But be warned! The Antagonist will thwart Ambitions, abuse Talents and play up Limitations using the dreaded Foil dice. Will the Protagonist and his Allies prevail over their antagonistic rival? Or will the Scene descend into tumult? As the Scene ends, the lights fade and the spotlight shines on a different Protagonist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
