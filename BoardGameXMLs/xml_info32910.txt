							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moon Melee</name>
									
			<description>In the not too distant future war and fighting have been banned on the planet earth.&lt;br/&gt;All disputes are now resolved on the moon through hand to hand combat. Each nation involved in a dispute chooses its 7 most powerful warriors to compete in a decisive battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moon Melee is an abstract strategy game in which players play cards to determine the movement of their warriors. The warriors are represented by dice and have a life force of 6.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving and attacking their opponents. When a warrior is reduced to a 0 life force they are removed from the game. The game takes place on a 7 X 7 square grid. The player with the most life force after 3 rounds is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
