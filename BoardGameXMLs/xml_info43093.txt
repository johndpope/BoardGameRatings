			<description>A print-and play game for the BGG &amp;quot;Make a Dice Game!&amp;quot; competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;- 49 terrain dice, 6-sided dice used to construct a board; &lt;br/&gt;- 4 action dice, 6-sided dice used as playing counters.&lt;br/&gt;(Number of terrain dice may change after more playtesting)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;The terrain dice have a single piece of terrain on each side.  They are rolled and arranged randomly in a grid to make the maze:&lt;br/&gt;3-4 players: 7x7 square&lt;br/&gt;2 players: 4x12 or 5x9&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action dice have a player-specific symbol on each side, each side has a different colour matching the colours shown on the terrain dice. Each player places their action die in the centre of the side of the board closest to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to be the first to get your action die to the opposite side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of one of the following:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Orientation - pick up your action die and put it back on the same space in any orientation you like&lt;br/&gt;(2) Movement; a die can move in one of two ways:&lt;br/&gt;(a) by tipping it over onto an orthogonally adjacent terrain die; the colour on top of the die after the move must match the colour on top of the space it is now standing on&lt;br/&gt;(b) by sliding it to an adjacent space of the same colour&lt;br/&gt;During a single turn, a player can make any number of moves, so long as each is either a legal tip or slide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
