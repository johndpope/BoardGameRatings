							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chicago is burning. So is Los Angeles, New York City, Dallas, Minneapolis, Boston, Fort Wayne, Columbus... the cities are bad places now. They&amp;rsquo;re home to the undead mindless hordes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Before, you thought zombies were a reasonable subject for indie comedies. These days, in the After, you don&amp;rsquo;t find them quite as amusing any more. The one thing your Before self and your After self can agree on is this: zombies are way overplayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would be nice if that was the worst of your problems. Alas, you don&amp;rsquo;t get to pick your fellow survivors. They picked themselves using criteria you do not share. You need them; there are more zombies than survivors by now, not that anyone&amp;rsquo;s counting. Like them? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s another kettle of twitching dismembered zombie limbs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s dawn. You&amp;rsquo;ve survived another night living cheek to jowl with your small band of fellow survivors. You have a bit of food and a box of ammo and a rusty machete. Everything smells. Good luck making it another twenty&amp;ndash;four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
