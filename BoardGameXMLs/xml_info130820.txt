							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">High-Low Rack-o</name>
									
			<description>Be the first player to &amp;ldquo;go Rack-O&amp;rdquo; on each hand by drawing and discarding until you have ten cards aligned in numerical order -- either high to low OR low to high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal cards to each player and they keep them in the order they were dealt but place them in a row face-up.  The dealer will take the top card off the draw pile and trades it with any card in their sequence, passing the removed card to the next player for them to use.  Players MUST swap the passed card with a card in their sequence.  Once the card goes around the table and reaches the dealer, it is discarded and it's the next player's turn to draw a new card.  Special Wild and Swap cards are also in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
