			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation myth described in the earlier chapter is written from a Paxian perspective. It differs to a greater or lesser degree depending upon the language, culture or race of the teller. Paxian and Venician are spoken almost universally on the continent of Ropa. The only cultures that deviate on Ropa from the Paxian myth are the Eddans and Kraeldonians. Different deities are paramount in Prissia and Venicia, but the myth is essentially the same. Dwarves and gnomes share the Stone Father myth, halflings generally accept the &amp;quot;three fruit&amp;quot; myth and elves have none, at least as it concerns Ert. Interestingly, some aspects of the Paxian myth must be true and entered the racial consciousness of all civilized peoples, for none worship a sun god or moon god, though these practices may still be found in animistic societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eddans trace their origins back to Jalkarnatur positing that the universe and gods always were that only life has a beginning and end. Jalkarnatur, seeing that many of the races raped and ravished the lands they occupied, created the Cai de Oameni (Horse People) and gave them cai (horses) as family. The Eddan culture is centuries old and has remained essentially unchanged in that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kraeldonians, unique among human cultures, acknowledge the Stone Father, though they call him Clan Giver and are unaware that this knowledge comes from the dwarves. They otherwise adhere to the Paxian myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demi-humans, with the exception of elves, generally worship the same deities as humans, but with different names. The elves worship a different pantheon but also give homage to Jalkarnatur and Amarcerddoriaeth under other names. For instance, the elves name for Jalkarnatur is Gallenature and for Amarcerddoriaeth, Nithrevel. The dwarves worship Thrasteinenvater (Stone Father) Groderde (Tavalddaear), Daschmiede (Thundefail), Ormfeuer (KasaltƒÅn), Hraherd (Saranaelwyd) and Thundarkrieger (Valkarhyfel). The gnomes pay homage to Haldhaard (Saranaelwyd), Adronheil (Szuldrwg) and Serlnatuur (Jalkarnatur). Halflings worship Wythorth&amp;uacute;lacht (Ravangroth) and Gam-dea (Kael-da). A complete listing of names for the gods is at the end of this section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elven pantheon consists of Danu, the Faerie Mother, An Fir Lea (goddess of storms and the seas), Manannan Mac Lir, Se&amp;aacute;n na Gealaige (god of wetlands), Tein Stocke (god of music), Phouk-a (god of mountains), Skeaghshee (god of forests), Anann (goddess of livestock and fertility), Babd Catha (goddess of war), B&amp;eacute; Chuille (goddess of magic), Aed (god of death), &amp;Oacute;engus (god of love and poetry), Dian C&amp;eacute;cht (god of healing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The savages in the Jungle of Malaise are animists, so therefore worship the things of nature. They do not have priests, but rely on their shamans for spiritual guidance. The barbarians in the Wild Lands follow the same pattern. And though the societies in Merka and Frieka are primitive and practice animism to varying degree, they have defined patterns of worship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Merka, the degree of civilization increases as one travels south. The Inut worship gods of the hunt and gods of the sea. The Braskans worship a variety of deities connected with their survival, individually and as a people. The southern Braskans practice a sun cult and human sacrifice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Frieka, the Banians practice a Cthulhuesque religion that is horrible to even contemplate. The Pimis and Swilis practice a hodgepodge of animism and voodoo. Some of the Cthulhu elements enter into their voodoo practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
