							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">47 Key Concepts for Inventing a Fantasy Race or Culture</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men, dwarves, elves, orcs, trolls, and goblins. These races, and many more like them, populate nearly every fantasy world ever created. Their societies, cultures, and histories have been covered in countless books, movies, video and role playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes though, when DM/GMs decide to build their own fantasy world, they realize they need to populate it with their own creations; races, cultures and civilizations unique to their beloved game world and its mythos. Though there's nothing wrong with goblins, from time to time its nice to spice things up a bit with something original and fresh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, we will provide you with 47 key concepts and questions to ask yourself when you create your own unique race, culture, or civilization for your world. From the smallest barbarian tribe to the most powerful civilization in your world, these questions will help you breathe life into your various human and non-human cultures alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By taking just a few minutes with each question, within no time you can quickly weave epic myths and legends, come up with the origins of their holidays and rituals, and determine the strengths, weaknesses, and destiny of your new culture, race, or civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have included in this guide an example race from the upcoming Greystaff: Legends Role Playing Game known as the Gorrhym in order to better explain how these key concepts come together and work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
