							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Travelers&#039; Daughter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While traveling one night, the party makes an unfortunate encounter, as a desperate mother find their camp and begs for their assistance; her young daughter has been taken in the night and her husband took off after them. Fearful for the safety of both, she has also raced through the woods, seeking assistance. And yet, not all is as it would appear as the party explores deeper and deeper into the woods in the dead of night. What really happened at the travelers' campsite? Who or what are the kidnappers and what do they want? And what shadows seem to be stalking the party through the woods?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Travelers' Daughter is a Pathfinder OGL 3.5 adventure designed for 2-6 player characters, levels 1-3. This adventure features a little more combat than many Shadowglade adventures, but a reasonable amount of role-playing an deduction as well. Product includes two (2) 6x6 battle grids for use in the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
