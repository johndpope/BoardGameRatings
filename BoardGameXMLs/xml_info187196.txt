							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Denhearth</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perched high up in the mountains on an isolated plateau, the village of Denhearth long dwelled under the deep shadow of the red dragon Cinderblaze. Established as a base for the red dragon&amp;rsquo;s army and minions, the residents suffered almost as much as those the dragon terrorised until he was slain by the gold dragon Galiantana. Now, under the direction and protection of Galiantana, Denhearth is famed for its Academy of Draconic Arts, a school of sorcery that welcomes all with the blood-born ability. But recently, the gold dragon has withdrawn from public life and rumours swirl as to her whereabouts (or death). With its second draconic ruler laid low, Denhearth could be ripe pickings for any who wish to loot her hoard&amp;mdash;or to revenge themselves upon the village&amp;mdash;and its leaders are desperate to prevent their secret from getting out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
