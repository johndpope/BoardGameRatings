			<description>Live It Up: A Game About Drugs and Consequences is a fun family game which educates about the serious consequences of drug use while reinforcing the positive aspects of a drug-free life. The primary purpose of Live It Up is to be used as an educational tool, but it is an enjoyable game that can be played casually by adults and young people as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live It Up is a useful visual, audio, and kinetic learning tool. Parents and Educators can play Live It Up with their preteens and teens, while Therapists also will find Live It Up useful for rehab patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live It Up is played with five kinds of cards: Live, Activity, Arrest, Overdose, and Sober cards. The cards are laid out face down on the table. Each player chooses cards and stacks them until they receive a Live card, in which case their turn is up. If a player pulls an Arrest card, their stack of cards go into Jail, only to be redeemed by a player who pulls a Sober card. If a player pulls an Overdose, all their cards go to The Grave, never to be played again. Players can choose to redeem their Sober cards whenever on their turn they wish, but the longer they wait, the more they risk having their own cards sent to Jail or the Grave. The object of the game is to build the most fulfilling life, and the player with the greatest stack of Live, Activity, and/or Sober cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
