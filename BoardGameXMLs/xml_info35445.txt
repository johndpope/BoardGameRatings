			<description>(From the Introduction to the Witchlord rulebook)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witchlord is the natural adaptation of fantasy role gaming converted into a board game. There is a distinct advantage to fantasy role gaming from a board; and that is it gets rid of the need for a Game Master or scenario creator. The board, cards and matrix tables contain all the information necessary and the dice determine the outcome of your adventure. No human arbitrator is necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the passages, rooms, treasure and monsters are randomly generated. This makes no two adventures ever the same. Each time you enter the Witchlord's Castle you can expect a completely different scenario stocked with new treasure and monsters. As the player moves around the board, he will receive information about the configurations of the Witchlord's Castle. This will enable the player to plot his progress on the graph paper given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player will choose one of the six Adventure Classes to play. this determines the player's spell and weapon capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's objective in the game is to collect proficiency points. This is done by the slaying of monsters and the collection of treasure. Encounters and treasure are dictated by the playing cards and matrix tables. When the player reaches the 10th stratum or proficiency level, he must do battle with one of the Witchlord's generals. If the General is vanquished, the the player has won and earned safe passage out of Witchlord's Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Witchlord Game can be played as a single scenario, or as a campaign game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
