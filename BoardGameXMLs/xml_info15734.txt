			<description>The board for this old Parker Brothers game, endorsed by the Automobile Club of America, depicts the Lincoln Highway map routes. Each player receives a Route Ticket showing six cities at five of which each player must stop. On your turn, you roll the dice and advance your token the number indicated. If the sum of the dice will carry you past a city at which you must stop, you can move only the number of spots shown on either one of the dice. The player first reaching the last named city on his or her Tour Ticket is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, the flip side of the board has a standard checker board, and the game comes with a complete set of checkers: two games-in-one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
