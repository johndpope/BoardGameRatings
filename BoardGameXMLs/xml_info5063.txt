			<description>Strategic level game of naval combat in the Mediterranean Sea during WWII.  The units represent individual capital ships, squadrons of smaller ships, air groups, and amphibious and paratroop forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have two main objectives: Destroy the opponent's naval forces and deliver supplies to their troops fighting in North Africa. A turn consists of assigning shipping routes to convoys, moving combat forces to intercept detected enemy formations, and adjusting supply levels for successfully delivering supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be linked with D.A.K. also published by Simulations Canada. When played this way, the supplies delivered in La Regia Marina are the supplies one's ground units have to fight with in D.A.K.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
