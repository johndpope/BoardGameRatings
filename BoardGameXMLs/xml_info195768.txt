							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Death Tractor</name>
									
			<description>The luck of these average, run of the mill GMO corn farmers goes sour when their loyal tractors get fed up with the modifications the family is making to their corn. They transform into horrendous, murderous death machines hellbent on wiping out the Nomsantos and returning the crops to their pristine state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the darkness has also changed the Nomsantos. You now mindlessly harvest a never ending crop while trying to destroy your competition, all while the Death Tractors hunt you down. How much corn will you harvest before your eventual death by tractor ends your pitiful life?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This totally serious, 100% accurate to life corn harvesting simulation experience will get your adrenaline pumping and nerves excited. You'll never be able to farm for corn in the same light again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
