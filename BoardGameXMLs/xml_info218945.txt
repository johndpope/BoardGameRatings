							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Kerasu</name>
									
			<description>Some rely on stealth, others guile or speed, however few on raw power such as Kerasu. Kerasu is an unstoppable machine focused on the annihilation of his enemies, cutting down foes as a farmer scythes wheat to get to his target.  He is a master with the bladed claws his favors as his weapons of choice. The speed and accuracy on his blows slicing veins and arteries in a blur of frenetic carnage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blister contains one model, one 30mm base and one full colour profile card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
