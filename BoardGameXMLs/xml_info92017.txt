							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of 200 Feats</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATS, FEATS, FEATS&lt;br/&gt;OK, in hindsight, perhaps we went a bit far. When I posted the suggestion a couple of months back for a big article filled with feats, the team jumped on this one. Really jumped. I had expected we could maybe come up with 100 or so and make a nice, tidy, little article for it.&lt;br/&gt;Wrong.&lt;br/&gt;As you can see from our cover story, we&amp;rsquo;ve gone far over expectation.In fact, we seem to have done that for the entire issue, ranking in at 85 pages, this is the largest one we&amp;rsquo;ve put together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enforcers by Todd Crapper - This isn&amp;rsquo;t about the law. It &amp;rsquo;s about retribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of 200 Feats by Todd Crapper, Shawn O'Leary &amp;amp; Tim Rose - It&amp;rsquo;s what the title says. Lots and lots of feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gatekeepers: Disciplines of the Cursed by Todd Crapper - The corrupting touch of the Far Realm has its benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Righteous Flames of Roleph&amp;rsquo;Ral by James Kitchen - Absolute power corrupts absolutely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REVIEW: Night Reign - Just how dark is the world of Falamar? by Michael &amp;quot;Neuroglyph&amp;quot; Evans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MESH HONG&amp;rsquo;s Bonus Bestiary by MESH HONG - The premiere of CA&amp;rsquo;s new monster feature, including a living essence of torment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVENTURE: The Golden Hand by Corwin Riddle - An earthquake reveals a buried secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
