			<description>Cross Days, in typical visual novel fashion, is essentially played by watching and listening to episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, clickable actions or responses when they are presented to the player. These choices are intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing the direction of the story as each is made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. In order for the player to watch all the possible endings, he or she will effectively have to replay through the game several times, making different selections along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like its predecessors, Cross Days is presented with, considerably improved, limited animation. Artwork is noticeably crisper and anti-aliased, colors are far brighter and vibrant and motion is slightly more fluid and articulate. The game is audibly stereophonic with lip-synched voice acting, sound effects and background music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cross Days&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
