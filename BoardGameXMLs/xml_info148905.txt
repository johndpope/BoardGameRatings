							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Twice-Robbed Tomb</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;A Labyrinth Lords adventure for 4 characters of 3rd level, or 6 or more of 2nd level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The domination of Pheniket the Pharaonic ended nearly two centuries ago, but stories of his ruthless ambition still haunt the region. An intruder from a sandy land to the south, with strange gods and customs, Pheniket tried to establish a colony of one in the land, and nearly succeeded. Those that followed his power did so zealously, and seemed even to love the enigmatic tyrant. His strength came from arcane pacts forbidden in his homeland, that enabled him to cause his enemies&lt;br/&gt;to disappear, and gave him vast knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* * *&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legends wax and wane, and 150 years later, intrepid treasure hunters came to the settlement nearest Pheniket&amp;rsquo;s palace and announced that they had uncovered the Pharaonic&amp;rsquo;s tomb. They looted it, with some opposition (some animated dead, a few poorly constructed golems) and came back with an armload of magic weapons, armor, and Pheniket&amp;rsquo;s grave goods. Minor prosperity hit the area for a time, not appreciated by all. Those that knew the now-deceased tomb-robbers well also know that there was part of the tomb that could not be accessed by the original discoverers, who were happy to leave with what they had, as a feeling of dark foreboding saturated that forgotten place, a malevolent presence guarding the true prize in Pheniket&amp;rsquo;s resting place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
