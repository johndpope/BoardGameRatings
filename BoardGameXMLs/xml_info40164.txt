							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Munich Decathlon Game</name>
									
			<description>MUNICH DECATHLON Olympic Game. Roll and move game similar to Avalon Hills Decathlon Game except there are no real Decathletes. Each event is scored individually by roll of the dice with the possibility of injuries occurring and then scoring is done similarly to real Decathlon Scoring. This game came out just before the 1972 Olympics and of course was tempered by what happened in Munich in the real games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
