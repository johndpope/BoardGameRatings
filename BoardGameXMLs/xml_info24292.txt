			<description>Truly like no other board game; like nothing else around, above, below or underneath, Le Jeu de Jet is a Battle game for 2 players fought over a number of Rounds between their Houses where the winner is the player who takes &amp;quot;prisoner&amp;quot; all of their opponents set of 18 pieces, called Woods.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Taking turns, players choose Woods from their Maison table  then shake them in their hand, or in a cup, &amp;amp; then throw them down into the Battle circle. These are now divided according to how they land, to be secretly built (stacked) into Houses in whatever way the player chooses ready for Battle; &amp;amp; that's when the real fun begins! Recommended Ages 9+&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
