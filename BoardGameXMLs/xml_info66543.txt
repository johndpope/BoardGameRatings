			<description>From the game's introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Tales of Wyn D'mere Role Playing Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the world of Wyn D'mere, one might ask? Well, it is a world somewhat like the Earth are familiar with, filled with people, animals, money, struggles, triumphs, tragedies, and beauty, but also very much unlike the world we know, more similar to a fairy tale or a dream, with magic, monsters, a pantheon of gods and goddesses who manipulate the mortal world, races and beings unbelieved in and treasures unthought of. Wyn D'mere is an amazing place for one to discover, a magical land of unknowns, both wonderful and terrible, a world where anything might happen, and sometimes does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wyn D'mere is a world of high fantasy, where magic exists and miracles happen, where good struggles against evil and the world exists in the balance between the two, where mighty warriors fight vicious monsters and powerful magicians discover mysterious secrets. It is a world like the fairy tales and stories one might have heard as a child, like the myths and legends people used to tell and now watch the stories of on screens large and small. Wyn D'mere is a world with stories like those to tell and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether one chooses to be a valiant warrior who fights to protect the innocent or a mighty wizard who drives back evil forces, a cunning rogue who discovers unknown mysteries or a devoted priest who enacts the will of the gods, they are now an important part of the world of Wyn D'mere. Tales of Wyn D'mere is a game of creation, writing a story, not to see how it ends, but to see whatever amazing sights and experiences that one might find along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
