							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleTech: McCarron&#039;s Armored Cavalry</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonel Marcus Barton commands the Second Regiment of McCarron's Armored Cavalry, also known as Barton's Regiment, and he is a man obsessed. He has waited forty years to avenge his father's dishonor at the hands of Lester J. Otto. He blew his first chance, but he swears he will not make another mistake. He knows he has a second chance on Marlette, and Marcus Barton will have his revenge this time or die trying. And either way he plans to take his regiment with him...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McCarron's Armored Cavalry is a BattleTech scenario pack which includes the unit's history, prominent members, and special equipment. The scenarios chronicle the campaign known as &amp;quot;Otto's Last Stand,&amp;quot; and can be used individually or as a campaign culminating in one of three different endings. &amp;quot;Otto's Last Stand&amp;quot; features deadly installations and a point-based system for customizing the defending forces, so that scenarios can be fought more than once and never be the same game twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like a number of similar scenario packs, this BattleTech expansion focusses on a particular unit; in this case, it's McCarron's Armored Cavalry, or &amp;quot;the Big Mac&amp;quot; as it's sometimes described in novels and fan circles. This scenario pack doesn't include any BattleForce scenarios, but does give more information on the unit's history and personalities than any other sourcebook out there, and introduces four new Star League era BattleMechs, along with a couple of new vehicles, which would evenutally be republished in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058. The BattleTech scenarios include a host of options that make them among the most interesting scenarios produced by FASA up to this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
