			<description>Battle for York is an area control/battle game set in a fictional world inspired by the Napoleonic Wars of the 19th century. The Empire of York has fallen apart after centuries of misrule. Now, many factions have formed, each with a different idea for how the next Empire should be run.  The game plays with 2-4 players in an hour or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this low-luck game, players carefully manage their hands of cards for one of two purposes: adding reinforcements or activating powerful tactics which may aid them in battle. There are no dice in Battle for York, so victory in battle is the result of player decision, planning, and sometimes, a careful bluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 4 unique factions, each with unique tactics and abilities to gain the upper hand in the conflict. Every faction plays differently, which provides a deep and varied strategy game in a short amount of time. For first time players, a generic shared faction is provided to help you learn the game and the mechanics before diving into the complexities of factions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take one action at a time, so there is little down time in this fast-paced game. Battle for York is a great light to medium game for game night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
