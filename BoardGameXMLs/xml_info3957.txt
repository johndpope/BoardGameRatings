			<description>The object of Bioscopy is to be the first player or team to score 20 points in each of the 4 categories of trivia (Who, What, When, and Where).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player or team puts their playing marker at the center of the board, and their 4 scoring markers on the 0 at the start of each of the 4 scoring scrolls. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine how far you may move on the board, moving in any direction they choose (but they may not visit the same space twice in a turn). The spaces on the board are color coded to each of the 4 categories of questions, and are marked with a number (10, 7, 4, and 1) that corresponds to the difficulty of the clue. Each card has 4 clues on it, descending in value (10, 7, 4, and 1). Players may hear the clues in descending value until they reach the minimum value indicated on their space on the board -- if they can successfully answer at a higher point clue value, they will receive the higher points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternate form of scoring is based on stealing points from the opponents by landing on a space on the board without a number. When this happens, the player competes head-to-head with the person that has scored the most points on that category's scoring scroll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
