			<description>In ASMV, players 'invest' in the construction of connected regions, while attempting to predict their final size, sabotage opponents' plans, and squeeze into the spaces left behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, a player uses one of their own number tiles, and a color chip from a common supply.  Most often, they will place both in an empty space on the board, subject only to the restriction that they may not create a connected region of a single color containing two or more tiles showing the same number.  Alternatively, a player may remove one color chip from the game, and place their number tile face down on an empty space, preventing it from being part of any colored region.  At the end of the game, every connected region has at most one number tile correctly describing the number of color chips composing that region:  the owner of each such number tile scores its face value in points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(description provided by designer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
