							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Ironwood</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of Ironwood was once common among the superstitious. A power-mad king, a betrayed monk, a library of evil magic, and more... a story grandfathers told children to thrill and scare. But that was long ago. Grandfathers no longer tell those stories. Children no longer beg to hear them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reference in an ancient book, a drawing and a tale, leads you to Ironwood. Distant from civilization, halfway up an unnamed mountain, you stand in front of walls long-unseen. Up here, the air is thin. The world is quiet. No buildings cluster near the keep. Yet the castle itself still stands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tales are too long forgotten to restore, yet something remains. Adventure well. Those who survive will be forever changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A solitaire adventure for low-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
