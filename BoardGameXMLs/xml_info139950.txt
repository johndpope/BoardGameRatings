			<description>Much the same as Top Trumps. However, the cards are much larger (8.8cm x 14.5cm) and each card has 3 categories and a further 3 sub-categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elder Earth set:&lt;br/&gt;Categories (Sub-categories) - Physical (Strength, Skill, Stamina), Material (Armour, Mobility, Weapons) &amp;amp; Magical (Power, Force, Fearfactor)&lt;br/&gt;Robo Legion set:&lt;br/&gt;Categories (Sub-categories) - Mechanics (Fire Power, Forceshields, Armour), Capability (Speed, Mobility, Range) &amp;amp; Intelligence (Controlability, Efficiency, Identification)&lt;br/&gt;Colony Ten set:&lt;br/&gt;Categories (Sub-categories) - Physical (Strength, Skill, Stamina), Material (Armour, Mobility, Weapons) &amp;amp; Magical (Power, Force, Fearfactor)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game: The winner is the player with either the most sets of four or the complete pack.&lt;br/&gt;How to play: First decide who will be the dealer, he or she then shuffles the pack and deals it equally between the players. Any spare cards should be placed in the pot. The dealer then picks a card and chooses either a category or sub-category and calls it, the winner is the player with the highest score. he or she then collects that hand and any card in the pot, should there be any. The winning player then continues to play. The play is then taken in turns between the players. &lt;br/&gt;A variant may be played by the addition of two dice. A player calls a category as with the previous game, then rolls the dice. the dice score is added to the card score to give the players score. The opponent repeats the procedure. The winner is the player with the highest combined score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
