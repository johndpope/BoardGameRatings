			<description>From the official publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this is read or heard of in some future time, let the record show that on July twenty&amp;ndash;third 1863 I returned to the world after being abandoned by General Edward Potter and God himself. The men by my side in Rocky Mount are all dead. Their suffering will be forgotten&amp;mdash;I am its lone witness, and I choose not to etch it into my memory. Tomorrow I will either be hero, or deserter shot dead. Either way, what happened between there and here will go to my grave with me.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Private Henry Eager, Company L, First NC Volunteers, United States Army&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAROLINA DEATH CRAWL is a swampy, Southern Gothic roleplaying card game for three or more players. At the height of the American Civil War, your characters have been abandoned deep behind Confederate lines. Can they fight their way through enemy territory and treacherous terrain back to safety? For all but one, the answer is &amp;ldquo;no!&amp;rdquo;, but the dark story you tell in trying will be memorable and thrilling. Fun and competitive, CAROLINA DEATH CRAWL gives you all the history you need&amp;mdash;you supply the desperation, depravity, and destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
