							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Rookie&#039;s Guide to Brit Cit</name>
									
			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the polluted Black Atlantic Ocean sits a small island, once the most powerful nation on the face of the Earth. In the year 2124, its empire has faded, but in its wake rises a vision of a future world leader, home to some of the most dynamic and resourceful industries in the western hemisphere. The island is England, home to Brit-Cit. This small but distinctive nation is a popular tourist attraction, conjuring images of smog-clouded streets tightly packed together, patrolled by cheerful but resolute judges and populated by hardworking citizens and cloaked murderers in the deepest, darkest alleyways, all bowing before the regal splendour of the royal family. The truth is somewhere in-between and far more complicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You Will Find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Tour of Brit-Cit: A detailed look at the sights and sounds of this Mega-City, from the faded glory of the New Old Bailey to the imposing Forbidden Citadel, home of the Royal Family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters of Brit-Cit: Full rules on the citizen characters of Brit-Cit are shown here, the prior lives and the prestige classes available to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Justice Department: A complete guide to the justice department of Brit-Cit, detailing the structure, the equipment, vehicles and of course the various types of judges that try to keep Brit-Cit safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Allotment: The radioactive wasteland that was once over half of England is now called the Allotment, home to hundreds and thousands of mutants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cal Hab: The Caledonian Habitation Zone is ruled by Brit-Cit in all but name, based around the principle of the Estates, great swathes of land controlled by a single laird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emerald Isle: Under the direction of FunRaiser enterprises, Eire has been transformed from a glowing nuclear wasteland into the Emerald Isle, the world&amp;rsquo;s largest theme park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
