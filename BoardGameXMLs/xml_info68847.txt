			<description>The boardgame has 84 playing spaces. The main title and the individual ones are in four languages: French, German, English and Polish. The aim is to reach immortality, and the end space of the game is the Immortal Man. It shows a memorial monument with an urn on the shoulders of women who stand on a column and steps, accompanied by four figures. On the memorial tablet are the words &amp;lsquo;MLEOPOLD/HERvBRAUNS/GEB1752GEST85&amp;rsquo;, which refer to Leopold of Brunswick, who drowned in 1785 while attempting to save people in a flood. He would have featured here as a model of selflessness, which was considered one of the qualities needed to attain eternal life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rewards: receipt stakes and/or moves forward, according to the rules. &lt;br/&gt;Forfeits: payment of stakes (counters) and/or moving backwards or staying an extra turn in one spot, in accordance to the rules. &lt;br/&gt;Equipment required: teetotum, one marker per player; at least 12 counters per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
