			<description>Hunted is a tabletop Tactical miniatures game in which your faction fights to survive! Whether it is small skirmishes or flat out war, Hunted can be played with 2 players or as many players as you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hunted, you control units from one of four Factions, which are portrayed with 28mm scale models:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- United Terran Defence Force, humans who are fighting to survive on an unknown planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- SESHIMAI (SEed SHIp Modulator AI, often shortened to MAI), AI control robotics whose corrupted data cores have listed all organic life as needing to be destroyed rather than protected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Predators, defending their territory from new and strange beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Herbivores, fending off new predators and old in order to continue to live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build their own armies with models in each faction and build a deck to complement it, then take turns in order to wipe out their opponents models. &lt;br/&gt;Unlike traditional miniature games, there is limited use of dice within the game, with no dice rolls to hit or save your miniatures; instead you rely on your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
