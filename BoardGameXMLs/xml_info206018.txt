							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planet of the Eyes</name>
									
			<description>Planet of the Eyes is an action-puzzle platformer with a retro sci-fi inspired aesthetic and a mystery-driven storyline. At the outset of the game, the player - an exploration robot - starts his search for the source of a pulsing signal on the planet. Along the way, the robot negotiates multiple dangers, solves environment-based puzzles, and uncovers the truth about the Planet of the Eyes through the audiologs of a surviving crew member. The fate of both these survivors and the planet itself will hang in the balance as the player contemplates a destiny that was meant to be unavoidable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
