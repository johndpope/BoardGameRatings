			<description>From the game inlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For soya plantation worker THX2240 this was the last straw. Life in the state controlled agricultural bloc seemed like virtual imprisonment. Breaking into the armoury and stealing a one person mobile Crowd control Vehicle (CCV), she decided to make her bid for freedom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agricultural bloc is split into separately enclosed compounds, each of them joined by sealed exit tunnels. Using the CCV, THX2240 can turn the reflector stations so that they guide the solar beam into the exit tunnels, shattering their seals! In this way, there is a slim chance of escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must collect reflectors on each level while defending yourself from attack.  Once you have explored the level you are on and found the sealed exit, you must strategically place and position the reflectors between the Solar Beam Generator and the exit.  Turn the solar beam on to blast your way through the exit to the next level.  There are 10 levels to penetrate before you can finally escape and meet up with the resistance.  GOOD LUCK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
