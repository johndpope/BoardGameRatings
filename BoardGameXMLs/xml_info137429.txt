			<description>A memory and action card game in the &amp;quot;Freche M&amp;auml;dchen&amp;quot; series by Kosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;48 autograph cards (3x16 pictures) are shuffled, and randomly laid out on the table, face down. Players take turns revealing one card. The card stays face up. As soon as a picture is revealed that already is on the table face-up, players try to be the fastest one to slap the first card of the pair (not the newly revealed one). The successful player gets to keep that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no face-down cards left. Player with most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
