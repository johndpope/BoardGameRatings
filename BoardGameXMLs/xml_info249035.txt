							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Pieces of Junk to Find on a Dungeon Floor</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeons are, to a degree, living places, places that will be visited by adventurers other than the characters, places that have inhabitants - whether or not those inhabitants are actually alive. As with any place that has people and creatures wandering through, and that lacks an type of clean-up crew or fine for littering, dungeons can also end up with junk and other rubbish on the floor. Such rubbish probably isn't useful for anything but clutter, but that does not mean that players won't believe that it is a clue to something. Which it might be, if the GameMaster wishes. More likely, it is simply bits of rubbish that no-one could be bothered to dispose of properly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scroll - This crumpled scroll radiates a very faint magical aura, but it is completely blank. It is the leftovers from a scroll from which the spell has been cast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover and one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
