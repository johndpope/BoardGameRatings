							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Royale</name>
									
			<description>An abstract battle game played on Strategic and Tactical Boards. The object of the game is to capture the opponent&amp;rsquo;s castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tactical Board is a 6x6 grid containing six randomly placed terrain obstacles which block movement. The Strategic Board is a 7x7 grid. The corner squares and center square on the Strategic Board are Towns, and the center square in each player&amp;rsquo;s back row is a Castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players start with six Armies on the strategic map, one located in the Castle and the other five in the surrounding squares. When opposing Armies occupy the same space on the Strategic Board, they are immediately moved to the Tactical Board for battle. A partition is placed in the center of the Tactical Board so that the battling forces may be set up in secret. The Tactical Battle concludes when one side has no pieces left, or if no pieces can move, or if no further captures can be made by either side, or if ten turns elapse without a capture being made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn gold from occupied towns. Gold may be used to recruit (purchase) new units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
