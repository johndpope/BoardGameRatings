			<description>Raging Fighter plays similarly to other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. However, unlike most modern-fighting games released at the time, instead of three to six buttons like in most other modern-fighting games, there are two buttons: one for punching, the other for kicking. Depending on what direction the player presses when he or she punches or kicks, the player can throw a different punch or kick with different properties that would be useful in different situations. For instance, if the player is crouching, he or she has three low kicks to utilize. This was a method Konami used to seriously make the most out of the Game Boy's two buttons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four different game modes: Practice, Story, Tournament and Versus. There are also seven playable characters, each individually rated in strength, speed, defense, mobility, and endurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Raging Fighter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
