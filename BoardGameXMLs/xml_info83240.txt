							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Man with the Gray Beard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are moments in any hunter&amp;rsquo;s life when she misses the important details and loses the bigger picture. There are moments in any hunter&amp;rsquo;s life where the detail that she missed, no matter how small, will result in her failure or even her death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the lucky few hunters, there is the Man with the Gray Beard. He&amp;rsquo;s been called a hundred names: Our Deepthroat, the Mole, the Insider. Most often, though, he&amp;rsquo;s just the Man with the Gray Beard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who is he and what does he do? Very few people know for sure. What&amp;rsquo;s known about him is passed around like an urban legend among hunters on the Vigil. It&amp;rsquo;s said sometimes when a detail has been missed, when lives are on the line, the Man will show up in a black suit with a manila folder or a duffle bag with that missing piece inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s saved a lot, so they say. Others say those missing pieces aren&amp;rsquo;t always helpful; sometimes they lead the hunter in a direction she isn&amp;rsquo;t ready for. Sometimes that manila folder leads to death. But why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Collection of Horrors is an anthology of Storyteller tools inspired by the Horror Recognition Guide that you can either use in conjunction with the Guide or as part of your existing Hunter: The Vigil chronicle. You can get a free introduction here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each story kit in the Collection of Horrors (which you can buy individually, as a bundle or as a subscription) contains variety of appropriate tools; usually an SAS scene, a character with a character sheet, and props ranging from maps and reports to print out and hand to your players, to short imbedded audio files that you can play at your gaming table. These kits represent a collection of evocative story tools that you can write a story around, drop into an existing SAS or even string together. They aren&amp;rsquo;t stories in their own right, but rather pieces that you can snap together into whatever shape you want. Using the Guide can add even more props and ideas to this anthology, but it&amp;rsquo;s not required to use the various story kits in the Collection of Horrors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
