							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Player&#039;s Handbook (Pony Tales: Aspirations of Harmony)</name>
									
			<description>The Player's Handbook covers character creation and combat resolution in the Pony Tales: Aspirations of Harmony roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the opening to the Player's Handbook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We wanted to build a fresh system from scratch to capture the flavor and fun that calls people to adventure in Equestria; a magical land where people don't need to choose between a flavorful character and a powerful one.  Pony Tales emphasises creativity and cooperation amongst the heroes through a hassle-free system that's built to be fun for both character creation and roleplaying.  Hopefully you'll enjoy playing in the system as much as we did - and maybe it'll help get Luna out of the dumps.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
