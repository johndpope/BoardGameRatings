							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Action News: The Game of Television News</name>
									
			<description>Following in the footsteps of history's iconic journalists comes a game inspired by the bombastic showmanship of television news.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action News: The Game of Television News is a fast-paced social card game that transforms your game group into a television news team competing against the clock &amp;mdash; and each other &amp;mdash; to tell the best news story. As a reporter, you have limited time to collect story parts, including quotes, sources, tag lines, and sign-offs. You then combine these pieces with a news event to build your story. No improvisation or trivia knowledge required!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of it as rhetorical Tetris, or an anthropomorphic set of refrigerator magnet poetry after it went to college and got a journalism degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
