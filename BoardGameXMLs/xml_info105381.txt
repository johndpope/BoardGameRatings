			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Faer&amp;ucirc;n, a land of amazing magic, terrifying monsters, ancient ruins, and hidden wonders. The world has changed since the Spellplague, and from this arcane crucible have emerged shining kingdoms, tyrannical empires, mighty heroes, and monster-infested dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This campaign map details Faer&amp;ucirc;n, the setting for DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS campaigns in the FORGOTTEN REALMS. Packed with details, this map is a great way to rediscover ancient lands, explore lost locations and confront dread threats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gale Force Nine&amp;rsquo;s Official DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS Campaign Maps are high-quality single-sided vinyl surfaces that are ideal for tracking the progress of your adventures during their campaigns! These maps lay flat for ease of play. The maps may be marked with WET-ERASE markers to temporarily record the paths your heroes travel, make notes about encounters and locations or the modify landscape to suit your own campaign. They also look great on the wall of your game room! The Campaign Maps measure 30&amp;rdquo; x 42&amp;quot;. All of GF9's Campaign Maps are based on artwork provided by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
