			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Contest Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The inhabitants organized into neighborhoods and gangs emerged to claim those neighborhoods. To this day, the government will ship criminals into Skin City, in part to be rid of 'problem' prisoners and in part to keep the society within the walls unstable. As a result of all these factors, and more, just making what should seem a simple journey cross town can be a dangerous adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play a community of characters who live in Skin City. These characters are familiar with one another, members of the same neighborhood, extended family, and/or gang. There may be conflict between the characters, but generally they are not antagonistic toward one another, if only because they are too busy working together to survive to turn on one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
