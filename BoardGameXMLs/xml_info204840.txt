							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monsters of the Entropy Wars 1: Harumbrik&#039;s Brood</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your party is making its way through the forest, trying to cover as much ground as possible before making camp. However, even at high noon the forest canopy leaves you in perpetual twilight. It's dark and dense, and the acrid stench of decaying plants and fear mingle in the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of you notice that you pass a fairy ring of mushrooms. This is not unusual in a wood like this, except that the circumference of the ring seems too large to be natural. Down at your feet you notice a set of tracks that lack the proper number of toes. A twig snaps, and to your right you catch sight of a strange creature with too many teeth and dried blood staining its chin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters of the Entropy Wars: Harumbrik&amp;rsquo;s Bood is a pack of three monsters, rating CR 2, 3, and 4. Inside, you will receive stats for the Bleightmeister, the Wallcrawler, and the Bog Sprite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bleightmeister is a forest spirit that has been warped into believing that everything must rot before its time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wallcrawler is a mastiff-sized spider, and if that weren&amp;rsquo;t nightmarish enough, the vermin can melt into walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the Bog Sprite is a cheeky little bugger that will eat your walking stick right before you fall into a sinkhole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this pack, you'll find a full stat block for each monster, art, and strategy ideas for how to implement them in-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
