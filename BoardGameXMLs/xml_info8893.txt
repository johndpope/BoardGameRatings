							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pac Man Magnetic Maze</name>
									
			<description>Pac Man Magnetic Maze from Tomy is a physical implementation of the Pac-Man video game, utilizing a maze on a tilting plane, controlled by a mechanical joystick.  Pac-Man has a magnet on his head which he uses to grab fruit as he passes under them on the board.  The metal gates that hold the fruit may be placed in different positions on the board, providing variety in each game.  Two ghosts rove about the board, moving as Pac-Man does, with the tilt of the plane.  Each of the three characters has a steel ball bearing in its &amp;quot;foot&amp;quot; to permit it to travel freely about the maze.  The ghosts and Pac-Man have opposite-polarity magnets for &amp;quot;ears&amp;quot;, which permits the ghosts to capture Pac-Man.  A timer sets the pace, and with the clock ever ticking, the player must try to snag all three fruits without allowing the ghosts to catch Pac-Man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
