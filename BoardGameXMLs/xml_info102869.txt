			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario deals with the disappearance of an ancient blade of power forged by the legendary swordsmith, Dar val&amp;rsquo;Assante as a gift to the val&amp;rsquo;Tensen family. It was lost so many millennia ago to the fortunes of war and only recently uncovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, servants of an alien malfeasance have stolen this blade. This was done in part to prevent unity among the families of the Val, but also to attract the attention of the heroes, some of whom it has already gained an interest in. Indeed, the characters themselves are the true objects of the otherworldly foe; the sword is but a welcome bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is an uncontrolled element that not even this far-seeing foe could have anticipated. With the loss of Beltine&amp;rsquo;s Serenity, the shades of the lost are unquiet and they still seek to fulfill in death, what duties eluded them in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
