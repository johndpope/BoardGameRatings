			<description>Start the Printers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a chief-editor of a major national newspaper and have to fill all 5 sections of your paper with news. You collect the news by moving over the gameboard and answering trivia. You can also steal news from another newspaper. When you have filled all the sections you have to deliver your paper to the printing-plant.&lt;br/&gt;The game is like Trivial Pursuit with a newspaper theme.&lt;br/&gt;Nice touch is that the dice is 2 times 5, the gameboard is a pentagon and the player pawn is a chair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtitle of the game: Het verrrassende 5 krantenspel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was produced as part of the celebration of 400 years of newspapers. The papers featured in this game are 5 major national newspapers of the netherlands: Volkskrant, NRC Handelsblad, Parool, trouw and Algemeen Dagblad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
