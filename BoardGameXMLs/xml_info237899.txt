							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">OFMOS: Be the CEO</name>
									
			<description>OFMOS is a fun strategy game and business simulation for 2 to 4 players. When taken seriously, it is a tool that makes business learning more meaningful and more accessible. A tool for success in a brave new world, in which the nature of employment and education is quickly becoming less clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the CEO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hired to run a company, you will oversee its expansion, restructuring, and orderly closing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will enter and exit multiple markets, introducing and retiring several products. With the overarching goal of making the most of your initial resources, you will make the sum greater then its parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you are not alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your performance will be compared to that of your opponents, fellow CEOs, who are engaged in a similar quest. Same goal, same resources, different companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In direct competition with some of the products in some of the markets, you will all strive to generate as much cash as possible, which is the only measure of success that counts in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CEO with the most cash on the table wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think Big, and Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
