			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A live-action roleplaying scenario adapted from the tabletop scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1753, a young George Washington was sent into western Pennsylvania as a diplomatic envoy to the French army. His message from the British crown was claim of ownership over the region. If the French did not exit the area, the British would force them out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The French disregarded the message, and forced the British army from its fort at the forks of the Ohio River. In its place, the French have built their own base, Fort Duquesne. Now it is a year later, and Washington has returned to settle the matter once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
