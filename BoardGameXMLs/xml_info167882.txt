			<description>The Zombie is a micro-game of cunning and bluff. Taking the concept of the famous Werewolf game (Mafia), the game features some child trying to escape a zombie invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players receive a card at the start of the round and they try to eliminate the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; player depending on their role. Players will vote each round trying to &amp;quot;survive&amp;quot; as long as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zombie is a fast game (about 5 minutes) of bluffing and deception, it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect &amp;laquo;filler&amp;raquo; for any group. The game contains only 4 cards and it take less than 1 minute to explain. The game is easy to transport, does not take space and can be played almost anywhere; in queues, in a bar, in the car, during a break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
