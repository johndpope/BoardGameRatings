			<description>A card game for 2-4+ players based on the TV show Agents of Shield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 decks:  the SHIELD Deck and the PLOT Deck.  All cards have a numerical level and most cards have one or more traits (Combat, Leadership, Support, Espionage, Computers, Engineering, Biochem).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flip over the top 5 cards of the PLOT Deck. These are called the revealed plots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    Recruit Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     A player fills his hand to 7 cards from the SHIELD deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.    Action Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     A player may reveal one card from his hand (do not discard it) and get one special benefit from it dependant on its trait (e.g. If it is a Spy card, look at an opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand and steal any 1 card)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.    Investigation Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     Play (discard) SHIELD cards from your hand with a total level matching or exceeding the level of a target revealed PLOT card. The SHIELD cards must also have traits that at minimum match the traits of the target PLOT card.  If this is done the PLOT card is captured and put into the player&amp;rsquo;s victory pile. If possible, you may capture multiple revealed PLOT cards in a single turn. Every time a revealed PLOT card is captured immediately flip over another one from the top of the PLOT Deck so that there are always 5 revealed PLOT cards available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.    Recovery Phase&lt;br/&gt;-     You may discard up to 2 SHIELD cards from your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all PLOT cards have been captured. The winner is the player who has the greatest number of PLOT cards in his victory pile when the game ends.  If tied the player with the most levels worth of PLOT cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
