			<description>What's going on in the kitchen ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The little kittens awake on the couch and are hungry. They're looking for their food. It's on the other side of the kitchen, but Bello, the dog is lying on his carpet and keeps an eye on the cup full of food (playing chips). Don't let Bello get you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A great game for kids. Start with one of five kittens on the couch, roll two dice - one moves the kitten (1-5 + Special BLACK spot for moving the cup of food), the other Bello, the dog. So, Bello is like a community character, each player moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving is allowed horizontal or vertical only, the same for eating from the cup. When the BLACK spot is on the kitten dice, it allows almost free placement of the cup of food. If Bello the dog, catches one of the kittens, he throws it back to the couch or onto the chair in the corner of the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
