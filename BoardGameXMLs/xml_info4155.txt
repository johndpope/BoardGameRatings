							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carmel Proper</name>
									
			<description>From the back:&lt;br/&gt;The charm of Carmel-by-the-Sea, a storybook village of sun-dappled forests and jewel-like beaches has been captured by this exciting new board game.  What every visitor remembers fondly and residents cherish has been re-created on a 30&amp;rdquo; x 30&amp;rdquo; game board of Carmel streets and buildings nestled among the pines.  Players draw illustrated cards with the names of businesses where they must go to make specific purchases.  They map a direct course, roll the dice and drive through &amp;ldquo;Carmel Proper&amp;rdquo; to the businesses before continuing on to the site where the last gingerbread-style home, dubbed &amp;ldquo;Carmel Charmer&amp;rdquo; by the residents, will be auctioned off.  The highest bidder wins.  However, shopping in &amp;ldquo;Carmel Proper&amp;rdquo; is full of pitfalls.  No parking spaces can be found.  Fines are levied for double parking and pedestrians fill the streets, blocking the player&amp;rsquo;s route.  A chance card may send a player close to his goal or on a detour through the beautiful 17 Mile Drive.  A wary player who catches an opponent breaking any traffic rule receives a bonus of $1000 from the violator.  Car theft is $5000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carmel Proper&amp;rdquo; is a game of distinction.  The board itself is an artistic rendering that depicts the tiny city with accuracy.  The movers are handcrafted wooden cars.  The money, beautifully printed on real parchment paper, increases the quality of the game&amp;hellip;and exquisite addition to any home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
