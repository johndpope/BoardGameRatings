			<description>MagnetX brings new twist on the abstract strategy board game genre.  It combines both action and strategy on a playing field where magnetic stones are placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MagnetX is played with 20 stones; each set of stones is unique to the game. The stones vary in from 3/8&amp;quot; up to 3/4&amp;quot;, they are polished, black stones that vary in magnetic strength. The stones are placed on a translucent acrylic board. Each stone is placed flat, or to increase difficulty, on edge such that other stones do not come into contact with any other stones already in play. Stones may be placed so they hang off the edge, or teeter in the middle of a group of stones as long as stone(s) do not fall off or come in contact with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are basic rules for the beginner and advanced rules that enhance strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
