			<description>A Dice Rolling game for baseball. The game was designed by the creator of Phase 10. It was exclusively sold in K-Mart during the 1981 Christmas season. Players would roll the dice to determine if the hit was a single, double, triple, or home run and the direction of where the &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; would go on the field. Similar to real baseball, the players would roll the dice in an alternating fashion for 9 &amp;quot;innings.&amp;quot; The high score at the end of 9 innings would win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
