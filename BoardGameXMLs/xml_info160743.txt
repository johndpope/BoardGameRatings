			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the extreme future, the galaxy is a crowded place. There are thousands of inhabited worlds and intelligent species, and very few of them get along with each other. But there is one shining example of order and peace.  &lt;br/&gt; This is the Federation of Planets, and it is protected by a valiant group of superheroes, who use their incredible powers to defend their future civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future Heroes is a role-playing game designed to simulate a superhero comic book world of spaceships, robots and superscience. It uses the Fate Core rules, with an innovative system for superpowers added on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple system allows superheroes to be quickly designed, but be every bit as complex and interesting as the heroes of the comic books. So take a look, and blast into a future fit for a superhero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
