			<description>&amp;quot;Black stories: Stadt-Land-Tod&amp;quot; is a very fast game that can be played with at least 2 players. Theoretically an unlimited number of players can join the game - the only limiting factor is the number of pencils and sheets of paper you have at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round a letter is randomly determined. Then each player writes down a substantive for each word category that start with the determined letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The categories are (among others): Place of murder, weapon, escape vehicle. They are predetermined on the sheets that come with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who manages to find a word for each category stops the round and the results from all players are compared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each word a player wrote he gets points: 5 if other players wrote the same word / 10 if no one else thought of this word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example: &lt;br/&gt;Random letter: C&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anna wrote for the category &amp;quot;escape vehicle&amp;quot;: car&lt;br/&gt;Bob wrote: cab&lt;br/&gt;Roy wrote: car&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anna and Roy get 5 points each. Bob gets 10 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After this the next round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can continue as long as the players agree on.&lt;br/&gt;Finally all points are summarized and the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is the &amp;quot;black stories&amp;quot; variant of a classical game called &amp;quot;Stadt, Land, Fluss&amp;quot; (City, Country, River) which is played by almost every child in Germany (e.g. at school during breaks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;============================&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duisburg, D&amp;auml;nemark und Donau waren gestern- in dieser bltur&amp;uuml;nstigen Version des Klassikers &amp;quot; Stadt Land Fluss&amp;quot; geht es um Mordmotive, Tatwaffen und Fluchtfahrzeuge.&lt;br/&gt;50 Blatt mit Spielanleitung&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duisburg, D&amp;auml;nemark and Donau were yesterday - in this bloodthirsty edition of the German classic &amp;quot;Stadt, Land, Fluss&amp;quot; (categories) it's all about murder reasons, weapons and escape vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;50 playing sheets and manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
