There are 3 game modes. &lt;br/&gt;The first is similar to Domino: Who was the first to create all of its 10 local brands, wins. For this, a starting location is determined on the rail system, and from there are other brands created. Those who can not create a brand draws &lt;br/&gt;new brand card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second variant is the round trip, where player roll the dice starting from a starting location must approach it the 10 local brands, which have been drawn. Each one comes forward as many stations as it has rolled. Player who visits first all the stations and returned to the residence, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third variant is similar to the first, but you must connect the route with a ticket placemarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 game board, &lt;br/&gt;     92 local brand-cards, &lt;br/&gt;     1 set of tickets, &lt;br/&gt;     6 playing pieces, &lt;br/&gt;     1 dice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
