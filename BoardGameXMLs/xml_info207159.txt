			<description>Highest Bidder is a card game for 2-5 players. Bidding is a central mechanism as players place secret bids from their hands onto point-scoring cards. Bids are placed simultaneously at the count of three and you never know which cards, how many and in which order your opponents will play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once bids are placed face down in front of each player, they're revealed one card at a time. Numbered &amp;quot;Bid Cards&amp;quot; add toward the value of your bid. Strategic &amp;quot;Effect Cards&amp;quot; affect your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points once all cards have been bid on, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
