			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;A truly innovative game in which the player takes on the role of Illuminar, a kind of druid wizard whose task is to take on Tetragorn, the Necromancer.  Gameplay takes place in three distinct stages:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Illuminar plants seeds and protects them from wandering trolls until they grow to maturity.  Occasionally, disease strikes the trees.  If untended, the trees turn into dead stumps.  All the while, Tetragorn sends his venomous spiders at the hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Illuminar and his army of ambulatory trees (raised in Level 1) assault Tetragorn's lair of spiders.  The trees take root in the vaults above the spider's egg nests, ultimately breaking in and destroying the spider larvae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Illuminar takes on Tetragorn directly, destroying headstones in his graveyard to make him appear and then dispelling him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five levels of difficulty and some very cool music, which makes good use of the Atari's superior sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
