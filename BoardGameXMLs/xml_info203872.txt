			<description>Each player has 4 playing pieces that he has to get to the 4 home spaces of his own color. At the beginning, the playing pieces are put on the table top down and are shuffled. Then they are placed randomly on all home spaces. After the colors are dispensed among the players, the playing pieces are turned up to reveal their colors. Movement is straight in all directions, but not diagonal, any number of spaces. Jumping over other playing pieces is not permitted. The first player to get all 4 playing pieces onto his home spaces wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published between 1938 and 1940.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
