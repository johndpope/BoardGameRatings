			<description>Ashw, Esbner, Ohif and Ukelele are the four piggy servants of God known as the Elemental Kings. Although they served the same &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot;, it is not their nature to see things eye to eye with one another. Each Elemental King believes in his own way of running things and this right can be earned by defeating the others. As they cannot send their entire celestial army against each other openly, this conflict is traditionally resolved by their champions in tournaments held in arenas they take turns to host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you the champion they are looking for? Will you be the most sought after in the Elemental Planes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a card game designed primarily for 2 players, though it is also playable with 4 players in a free-for-all conflict. Players take on the role of a champion serving one of 4 different pig characters, also known as The Elemental Kings, representing Fire (Ashw), Water (Esbner), Earth (Ohif) and Air (Ukelele).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a deck of 36 cards, made up of numbers 1 to 9 for each of the Elemental Kings, and starts the game with 20 LIFE. The goal of the game is to defeat all other players by reducing their LIFE to zero. Using a hand management mechanic similar to poker, players can attack and defend against other players by piecing together different ATTACK HANDS inflicting different levels of damage. Those who survives the onslaught to bring glory to his Elemental King will be rewarded with the arcane magic of his host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you believe in the cause of the Elemental King you serve ...&lt;br/&gt;or do you &amp;quot;actually&amp;quot; serve more than one ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
