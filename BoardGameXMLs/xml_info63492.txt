			<description>In Third World General each player takes turns playing cards that will either raise or lower their power and approval ratings. Players may play cards on one another to hamper their opponents' efforts. A player wins the game by being the first to reach a power base of 30 points, while not letting their approval rating drop to zero. Players are eliminated if their approval reaches zero, however players must be careful to not eliminate one another too early. If only one player remains and no winner has been determined by power points all players lose the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generalissimo, Can you survive military Junta, political uprisings, assassination, foreign intervention and your own ego to become the best Third World General?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third World General is a fast paced card game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
