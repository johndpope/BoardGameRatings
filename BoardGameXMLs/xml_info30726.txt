			<description>The Transformers Card Game consists of four games using a 36-card deck containing 18 Autobots and 18 Decepticons. The following are the four games that can be played and a brief summaryof each:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.)The Transformers Truth Game:  The object is to get rid of all your card by placing two, three or four cards on the table and declaring that they are all the same numbered card.  If any opponent thinks you are bluffing then  he declares this.  The player than shows the cards.  If the player lied than he takes all the cards.  However, if he was telling the truth then the opponent takes all the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.)Robot Battle: This game is played like the game &amp;quot;War&amp;quot; where you want to be the one with all the cards at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.)The Transformers Brainpower: This is a matching game where all cards are placed face down on the table and then two cards are flipped.  If they are the same, then the player takes the pair and goes again.  However, if the cards are different then the players turn is over. The player with the greatest number of pairs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.)The Transformers Shout: In this game, each player flips over cards one at a time.  When a card is duplicated, the first person to spot this and yell &amp;quot;transformers&amp;quot; gets all the cards on then table.  This continues until one player has no cards.  At that time, the player with the most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
