			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Everlands, dark forces have influenced the animals, which you must rescue, one game at a time.  Everlands is an abstract strategy board game, played on a hex battlefield.  Each animal has different attack directions, and many have superpowers to make them particularly special.  When you place an animal on the board, any extant, adjacent enemy animals with attack arrows pointed at that space will attack the newly placed animal before it has a chance to make its own attacks along its attack arrows.  Each animal has an attack value and a health value.  The health goes down gradually until it hits zero (or less), at which point, the animal immediately switches teams, and any constant effects kick in immediately.  Once you win a game by more than 50% of the battlefield being your animals, you will &amp;quot;rescue&amp;quot; the new infected animal that was attacking you, adding it to your arsenal for subsequent games.  Some games have additional victory conditions you must meet, as well.  The different games are glued together by a narrative, primarily comprising dialog between the animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
