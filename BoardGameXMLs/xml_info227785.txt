							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Short Game Roles: Constantine and the Council of Nicaea 325 C.E.: Defining Orthodoxy and Heresy in Christianity</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are more issues than can usually be covered in a typical Reacting class schedule. Instructors are free to pick and choose from these based on their goals and interests. The Creed issue is central to the debate. The issue of the correct date to celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus was another major factor in the actual Council and should probably be included. Many of the other issues fall into the general category of the qualifications and powers of the Bishops and several of them can be handled together. The allocation of roles allows instructors to manipulate which issues will appear in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
