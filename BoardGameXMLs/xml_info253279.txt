			<description>The Players have to get their 5 pawns from their starting spaces on the blue ring to their destination spaces in the center of the game board. Movement is determined by 2 dice for 2 pawns each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing a turn around the game board, the pawns reach a big numbered space og their own color, at which they advance to the next inner ring. A pawn reaching a star-space, also advances to the next inner ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a pawn reaches a space, which is already occupied by an opponent's pawn, the later is thrown out to the same free space on the next available outer ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a pawn reaches a space with an opponent's pawn on the neighboring space on the next inner ring, both pawns exchange their positions. This can start a chain reaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
