			<description>Promotional game made by Black Cat cigarettes. It consists of 28 cards, but only 14 cards are used in any one game. Several games should be played to find a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player is elected Banker. He starts the Pool by placing 6 counters into it. He then shuffles and deals 14 cards face down. All the other players now place a bet (counters, not real money) on any card they wish. No more than one can bet on any one card. When all bets are placed, the first card is drawn. The player who bet on it must follow the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Banker role changes hands, a new deal shall be started. But Note: Sometimes a player's call against the Bank cannot be met. The deficiency is made up as far as possible from the Reserve. Then the Bank is 'broken' and the Bank role is transferred to the player on the Banker's left. This player starts a new Bank by putting in the 6 counters that are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are:&lt;br/&gt;One In, Two In, etc. = Player puts counters into the Pool&lt;br/&gt;One Out, Two Out, etc. = Player takes out counters from the Pool&lt;br/&gt;Reserve = Every player puts 1 counter into the Bank Reserve. This Reserve is set aside in a special pool, for use on special occasions. It transfers when the Bank is transferred, and only withdraws when Bank Holiday is turned.&lt;br/&gt;Official Receiver = When turned, the Bank and Reserve (if any) transfers to the player who has backed the card, but that player pays over to the retiring Banker counters equal to the number then in the Pool (but not counting in the Reserve). The Banker taking over shall not scoop the Pool, which stays untouched and the game proceeds.&lt;br/&gt;Distribution = When revealed, every player, including the Banker, receives a counter from the Pool.&lt;br/&gt;Contribution = Every player, including Banker, puts a counter into the Pool.&lt;br/&gt;Scoop = The player backing this card scoops the entire Bank, which now transfers to him. The Reserve remains untouched. He starts a new Bank with 6 counters.&lt;br/&gt;Stake = This gives an advantage to the last player to have put down a stake of 6 counters to start a Bank. He claims 6 counters from the player who backed this card. The current Banker usually will be the one who staked the 6 counters into the Pool, but if a new Banker takes over because of the Official Receiver card or the Transfer Bank card (neither of which do not require 6 counters being paid into the Pool, so the player who benefits by this card will be the previous Banker perhaps).&lt;br/&gt;Transfer Bank = The Bank transfers to the player who backed this card, but its capital cannot be increased or the Reserve interfered with.&lt;br/&gt;Bank Holiday = The Bank's Scoop card. When revealed, the Bank scoops both Bank and Reserve, and starts a new Bank with a stake of 6 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
