			<description>The game is played on an 8x8 board representing a garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two players &amp;ndash; White and Red. Each player has sixteen pieces consisting of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A piece of garden D&amp;eacute;cor&lt;br/&gt;    Three Queens&lt;br/&gt;    A dozen Roses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The garden D&amp;eacute;cor (a statue and a bench) once set does not move and cannot be captured by either side. In other words, they act as permanent Blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Queens move and capture just like Chess Queens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Roses, once placed, do not move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two phases &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Planting&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gathering&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planting: The players first each set their own piece of D&amp;eacute;cor on any empty space on the board. This is then followed by their Queens. The players must place their Queens so no Queen can immediately attack an opponent&amp;rsquo;s Queen. Lastly, all the Roses are arranged around the board, in any remaining empty spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gathering: Once all the pieces are set, players then can move their Queens around the board, capturing an opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces &amp;ndash; both Roses and Queens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal - There are two different ways to win:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Capture all twelve of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Roses&lt;br/&gt;    Capture all three of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Queens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
