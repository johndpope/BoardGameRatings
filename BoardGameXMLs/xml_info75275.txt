							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mega Express: Spelet om EU</name>
									
			<description>A game made to encourage debate before the Swedish referendum in 1994 on joining the European Union. Players roll and move along the game board, triggering various events that include having to quickly look up answers in a book named Mega Express. Along the way they pick up votes to be used in the end game, which takes place after an arbitrary agreed-upon period of time (the rules suggest half an hour or an hour). Each player now casts their accumulated votes either for or against joining the EU, and the totals are added up to show the outcome; the rules envision several concurrent games, the votes from each session being added up to a grand total. It should be noted that the book required for proper use of the game was not packaged with it, may not accompany copies found in thrift shops, and may be difficult to obtain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
