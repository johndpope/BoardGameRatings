							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phineas and Ferb Funniest Card Game Ever!</name>
									
			<description>Goal: Players try to match the characters to the correct scene. The player with the most points from completed scenes when the last card is drawn wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 2 decks of cards (68 blue-backed and 12 green-backed) plus 9 cardboard characters. To start the game players claim the characters one at a time and are dealt 3 blue cards. Then a green card is turned up. Players take turns drawing 1 blue card and playing 1 blue card. Here are the different types of cards in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Green-backed cards = These cards give special responsibilities to the player who holds Agent P or Dr. Doofenshmirtz. For example &amp;quot;Say 'Ahh, Perry the Platypus!' before you start your turn. If you forget, you turn is over!&amp;quot; These cards also give the indicated player an extra penalty or bonus. For example &amp;quot;You may play 1 extra card.&amp;quot; A new green-backed card is flipped over and takes effect whenever the Agent P or Dr. Doofenshmirtz character moves to another player.&lt;br/&gt;    Blue-backed Character Cards = These cards move the characters around. For instance &amp;quot;Take 1 character from another player.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Blue-backed Power Cards = These cards give you special card-play powers. For instance &amp;quot;Take 1 random card from each player.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Blue-backed Challenge Cards = These cards allow you to do weird challenges against other players. For instance &amp;quot;Challenge another player to a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. If you win, take up to 3 random cards from the other player.&lt;br/&gt;    Blue-backed Scene Cards = These cards are how you score points. If you have the character(s) shown on the card you can play it for the number of points indicated on the card. For instance the &amp;quot;Unfair Science Fair&amp;quot; card is worth 10 points if you currently hold Baljeet.&lt;br/&gt;    Blue-backed Special Cards = The Mom card forces everyone to discard everything and draw 3 new cards. The 50 Bonus Points card gives 50 points to the player holding it at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
