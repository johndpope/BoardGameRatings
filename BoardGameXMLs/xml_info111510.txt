							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">On Target</name>
									
			<description>The On Target game from the Milton Bradley is a big action/skill game nearly the size of the Skittle Games of the same era.&lt;br/&gt;The five targets are pulled up and the wheel that holds them spun to set the value for each target. The player must then call a target (they are embossed with a Witch, a Skull &amp;amp; Crossbones, a Devil, a Vulture, and a Ghost) and shoot for that target using the banking corners to reach targets that aren't in front. If the target drops that score is noted and the target reset. The player may stop and take those points or may shoot for another target after they are spun again (and risk losing the points he or she just scored). First player to reach 200 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
