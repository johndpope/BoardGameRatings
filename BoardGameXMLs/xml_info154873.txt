							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fromm gang managed to escape from the high-security prison on the planet Ingo, stole an A-Wing fighter and returned to their old base on Ingo's moon - Auren.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fate brings R2-D2 and C-3PO into close contact with the Fromms - rather too close contact for comfort... When the droids' shuttle pod crashes on the surface of Auren, the Fromms seize the duo and lock them away in a cell on the lowest level of the gang's hideout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using his probe arm, R2-D2 manages to break out of the cell and now C-3PO leads the way as the pair try to make their way through the locked doorways and past the hazardous security systems installed by the Fromms to keep their base safe. Unbeknown to the duo, rescue is at hand - Jord and Thall followed the crashing shuttle pod and are on the surface of Auren. Safety lies above R2-D2 and C-3PO ... providing they can find a route up through the eight levels of the Fromm hideout and deal with all the patrolling droids...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Wars Droids is based on the animated kids TV show of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls C-3PO, with R2-D2 trailing along behind him. But the method of control is somewhat bizarre. The controls are simply &amp;quot;left&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;select&amp;quot;. With these controls the user selects from icons at the bottom of the screen. From left to right, the first four icons control movement Left, Right, Up and Down. The next icon allows C-3PO to throw a crystal - the only offensive action available against enemies. The next icon instructs R2-D2 to access a computer terminal if he is in front of one. The next icon instructs C-3PO to Duck and the final icon Pauses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that if C-3PO is walking to the left and an enemy appears, the user must quickly move four icons to the right to throw a crystal, or six icons to the right to duck! Sadly this makes the game extraordinarily frustrating to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destroying enemies is essential to pick up key-cards, which allow R2-D2 to access higher level terminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When confronted by an obstacle, e.g. a door, lift or force-field, the user must play a mini-game on the associated terminal. This is a simple 'Simon' style game, where the computer lights a series of bulbs in a random sequence. The player must remember the sequence and reproduce it. This game is repeated a few times with increasing lengths of sequences to remember. If the player succeeds, the obstacle is removed or the lift is activated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The droids have a shared health bar, which when depleted by running into enemies or other hazards, results in Game Over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
