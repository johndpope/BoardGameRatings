			<description>Triage is a wonderful card game from the French publisher Grimaud who is more well known for his releases of traditional card games.&lt;br/&gt;Aim of the game is to complete special trains and to score points for the best and longest of them.&lt;br/&gt;This is done basically by drafting and discarding.&lt;br/&gt;But what separates it from other games which are similar is a spinner with French train signals which will enhance or hinder your basic draw.&lt;br/&gt;And you can steal an opponents train if you complete it using a set number of additional cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components are of the finest sort: Super illustrated cards with locos and train cars from the steam area (featuring the famous Bugatti train...) before WW II and a patented card tray with golden applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
