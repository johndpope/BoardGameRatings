			<description>Squadron Forward is a character-based campaign system that allows you to add personality to your WWII aerial games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for aerial wargames set in the Second World War, Squadron Forward focusses on the characters within your force. Its three sections allow the gamer to generate characters, to generate a range of scenarios and follow their force through a range of missions with a broad selection of events that can affect their performance in combat and interaction with other characters in a campaign setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the perfect addition to solo games as the dynamic system presents the player with a hidden enemy and provides a huge variety of potential outcomes, keeping the games interesting and allowing the unexpected to occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squadron Forward is designed to bolt on to whatever set of WWII aerial rules you are using and may be easily adjusted to match your choice of game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
