			<description>An ancient, malevolent force stirs within the depths of the Eon Altar, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to YOU to stop it! Eon Altar combines nail-biting action and turn-based tactical combat with an epic story of friendship, destiny and betrayal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far so good, right? But wait, there's more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Eon Altar, we&amp;rsquo;ve captured the experience of a role-playing tabletop game and blended it into a video game. How did we pull that off? Well, the magic is in your own pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Eon Altar, each player uses their smartphone as a private screen to see their motivations, thoughts and innermost secrets. Your mobile device also offers you lines of dialogues to read out loud&amp;mdash;hopefully in your own eccentric performance you've developed for your character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your actions. Your game. Your way. You play your character the way you want it. Succeed together, or die alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continue the story with two new chapters in Episode 2.  The Siege of Tarnum has been broken: the remaining sellsword forces are scattered and their commander defeated. Having dealt with the Wolf of Yriel, your commitment to the Brotherhood of Keepers has been fulfilled. However, your victory is short lived. Cultists wielding the chaotic forces of their shattered god are waking the dead beneath Tarnum, twisting their forms and warping their minds into madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brotherhood of Keepers is in shambles and cannot offer any aid against the ever growing ranks of the undead. It falls to you and your group to descend the depths and put an end to the cultist's profane rituals before the living are overwhelmed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
