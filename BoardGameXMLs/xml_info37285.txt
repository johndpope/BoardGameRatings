			<description>Spritz Duell is water game to be played in a bathtub or a swimming pool, though it could be played in a sink as well. The &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; is a round plastic ring with a net attached. This is placed in the water and four flowers each of red and yellow are placed inside the ring floating. On &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;, two players fill up their squirting animals (purple and green hippo-dino looking things) and squirt water into the opposing player's flowers, trying to sink them. The first player to sink the other's flowers wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is another game on BGG called Spritz Toor, and based on the description it sounds like this one but with a Football theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
