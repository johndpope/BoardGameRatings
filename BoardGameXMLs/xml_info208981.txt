			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The Trucker's CB Radio Game&amp;quot;, this 1976 title is a roll-and-move affair that riffs off that era's fad around Citizen's Band radio. The game takes players around a lavishly illustrated map of the United States, with occasional dead-ends and many bear traps and other distractions along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inside of the box top has an extensive glossary of &amp;quot;C.B. and Trucker's Lingo&amp;quot;, and many of these terms along with nicknames for states and cities are sprinkled across the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box says the game was distributed by Priority Marketing Communications, a subsidiary of National Consumer Products Inc. based in Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
