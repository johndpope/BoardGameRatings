			<description>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice to explore places and people, historical facts and funny anecdotes? We thought so, and want to share this with you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can relate to your mother burning the latkes at Hanukkah or your Aunt&amp;rsquo;s matzo balls coming out like rocks, then JewishopolyTM, is the game for you. But that&amp;rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. At Opoly Enterprises, &amp;quot;Combining the history and humor of people&amp;quot; TM, is what we are all about. As opposed to other companies who are looking to turn a fast buck on Opoly style games, we at Opoly Enterprises are working closely with religious and community leaders to bring family values and history to games without offensive or controversial content. These games are under development, with trademarks in the application process of the USPTO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The careful undertaking of JewishopolyTMand our other game titles: Christianopoly TM, IslamopolyTM, Latinopoly, TM, and ArmenianopolyTM, are all a labor of love. We are sure you will be able to share these games and play them time and time again with family and friends. The games we produce at Opoly Enterprises are so much more than a board, a couple of dice and some cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
