			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, Spring,&lt;br/&gt;the time of year when a young man's mind turns to &lt;br/&gt;.. Pay Per View!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of the Century&lt;br/&gt;What do you get when you mix paranormal power, babes in spandex, aliens, killer robots, and baseball? Why, you get ratings! Stonebrenner the Expansive Owner has got his eye on the legendary Bat of Baseball, and he'll got to any length to get it.  He's invited nine selected paranormals (okay, whoever showed up Saturday night and a few NPC's) to play against nine of the AC Universes's most notorious she-devils in an all-out anything goes baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game of the Century is an adventure to be played in the AC Universe using the Femforce or in your own campaign with your own characters.  It is recommended for characters level 10 or higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
