							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Less Than Useful Books to Find on a Wild West Bookshelf</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement intended to flesh out the bookshelves of a Wild West setting. It may also be used in a Weird West setting. When searching through bookshelves, characters may come across books that are related to a quest, interesting or valuable. But what about the other books?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has a list of 100 different, not exactly useful, books that can be used if characters ask what books they find. Each book has its name, author and a description of its generally quite useless contents. Both fiction and non-fiction books are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Healing Properties of Cattle and Horse Manure by Arlie Fisher - Non-fiction, the author covers many, often disgusting, ways in which manure can be used to improve health and appearance, from using it in lotions, creams and masks to eating it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the cover and one the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
