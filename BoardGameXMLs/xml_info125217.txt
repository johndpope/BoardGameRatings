							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beach 3</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A narrow strip of sandy beach as it could be found on the shore of many a sea or large lake. The sand of the beach extends far into the shallow water on the one side and is separated from the road following the shoreline by a narrow strip of grass and palm trees on the other. Beach towels, umbrellas, life guards and sand castles are not the only things that can be found at the beach. At respectable distances you might find small beach bars like this one. During daytime swimmers and sunbathers alike will find refreshments here, but it is not until the sun sets that this small lantern lit establishment comes alive with music and patrons enjoying their beverages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
