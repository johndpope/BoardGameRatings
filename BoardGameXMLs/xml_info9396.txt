			<description>Fire Fight, Modern Miniature skirmish rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are a comprehensive set of rules for small unit actions since 1945. They are designed to give a playable game whilst recreating the uncertainty of modern warfare, to this end the &amp;lsquo;old fashioned&amp;rsquo; method of drawing chits is used to control initiative whilst for playability the hit chance of some weapons has been reduced, however it still does not pay to advance in the open towards an alert sustain fire machine gun.&lt;br/&gt;With these rules any action from the desperate battles of the Israeli War of Independence as described in 0 Jerusalem, to the siege of Hamburg from the Zone series can be fought, not just those in Vietnam on which many other rules concentrate.&lt;br/&gt;I would like to thank the staff of Heroic Miniatures and Wallasey Immortals Wargame Club for their help in testing the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game turn is thirty seconds long, composed of a variable number of phases between five and ten seconds depending on the initiative of the troops. The ground scale is one centimeter equals one meter which is near enough one to one for 20mm or 1/76th figures. If you wish to use 1/200th a ground scale of five millimeters to one meter is more appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
