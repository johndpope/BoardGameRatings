			<description>A cooperative, card-driven game where players take on the role of ordinary citizens trying to drive of the little green men who are invading their town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will move from location to location, rescuing trapped citizens, battling aliens and facing unexpected events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to reach the alien landing zone and defeat the alien army in a final, guns-blazing showdown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY&lt;br/&gt;The basic mechanic involves building a deck from a random selection of the game's location cards. Each game will be a different experience as players will not know which locations will be available in each play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a character template (a hero) which will determine the items, skills and abilities the player will have at their disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One at a time, the location cards are revealed and resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be events to manage, battles to fight and citizens to save. Heroes will find items as they go, putting these items to use in order to accomplish the task of defeating the aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is handled by rolling a pool of custom dice, which include hero dice, alien dice and friendly fire dice. By managing the results of each roll, the players will battle their way to victory and possibly, to defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
