							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rapture: The End of Days</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2644. Humanity has cast off religion and mi&amp;shy;grated to the stars. With science as the new savior, man&amp;shy;kind believed himself to be creating new Edens in the far flung heavens.&lt;br/&gt;But God kept His promise. The day of Rapture came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who walked the Earth with a righteous spirit and pure soul were taken into the loving arms of the Lord. Those who skulked with the devil, ignoring God&amp;rsquo;s divine laws, have been cast aside to face the horrors awaiting all sinners. As promised, the Earth burned. The clouds evap&amp;shy;orated. The rule of man, of reason and science, came to an end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that was on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And not all of Mankind was on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These far flung few who remain, forgotten by God, or per&amp;shy;haps given a second chance, now face a future where good and evil have come into sharp relief; where science has proven to be a false idol, yet one that is vital for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With communications between colonies severed, no one knows for sure what has befallen humanity. The isolated pockets of human colonists are returning to the old ways &amp;ndash; political squabbling, superstition and factional infighting are on the rise. As a tide of distrust rises among the survi&amp;shy;vors, unexplainable horrors are emerging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legions of Satan are real...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And they are coming for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapture is a pen-and-paper role-playing game of dark theological sci-fi horror. An innovative narrative-style rule system lets your focus on creating plots and terror. Ev&amp;shy;erything needed to run a game is included: character cre&amp;shy;ation, core rules, a detailed and realistic future world set&amp;shy;ting, politics, technology, foes, and even story seeds and tips for the Game Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
