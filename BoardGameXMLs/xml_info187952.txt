							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Old Masters Memory Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a variation of the classic Memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the stroke of their paintbrush, the old masters changed the art of painting around the sixteenth and seventeenth century. But also in the centuries preceding and following that, they pioneered with their characteristic painting styles and emotional depictions on canvas. The power of paint, colors, brushes and spatulas, combined with the genius of the painters created a new world, illusive in between reality and abstraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Master Memory Game challenges you to expand your knowledge and refresh your memory regarding the old masters. In the Old Masters Memory Game you seek and match two different portrait paintings from the same painter. One set of two cards always offers a clear relationship or clues. These vary from painting style to visible attributes such as colors, flowers and head dresses, or color and facial expression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
