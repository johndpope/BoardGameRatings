							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hacker Evolution: Untold â€“ Flight Zero</name>
									
			<description>From the Developer's Website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flight Zero continues where the original game ends. When all the dust has settled and everything has been shut down for good, a mysterious person enters the old headquarters of the Xenti Corporation. Nobody knows for sure who is he, or what he wants from there, but you are quickly called in to use your hacker skills to track him down. As you chase him, the story slowly unfolds. Apparently somebody has stolen a copy of the code running the old Xenti systems in an attempt to reinstate everything. This can&amp;rsquo;t happen again. You find yourself chasing the flight on which the unknown individual is, in attempt to stop him and retrieve the stolen files. Perform even higher profile hacks this time, in new environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion pack brings 3 new immersive levels, each one requiring particular skills to approach and complete. What starts off as an investigation, continues with a high profile chase and ends with a complex job of hacking a highly secure computer network&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
