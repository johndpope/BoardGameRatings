							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killing Time at Lightspeed</name>
									
			<description>Browse social media at the speed of light. Watch your friends grow old in the blink of an eye. Realise there's nothing you can do about it. Tell your friends you love them one last time. You never know what the last thing you say to someone will be. On a transport ship leaving earth, a passenger kills time by scrolling through the messages of their social media feed. As the ship leaves and moves further and further away from home, the delay between sending messages and their arrival lengthens. What feels like minutes on the ship is hours, days, weeks, even years back on Earth. Each refresh of the timeline is a tiny window into the past. What will you do in those precious few moments as the lives of everyone you know pass by? A critically acclaimed work of interactive fiction, Killing Time at Lightspeed allows players to experience life aboard a spaceship hurtling through lightspeed. Just how much can you affect other people's lives with your fleeting interactions through social media? And will it be for the better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created for the 2014 Antholojam. A text-based game structured like a social media timeline, where the story plays out faster than you can act. An attempt at exploring the connections we all have to people online who we may be powerless to help except with our words. In Late 2015, Gritfish collaborated with Matt Hamm and Marigold Bartlett to bring an enhanced edition of Killing Time at Lightspeed to Steam with a fully realised story, soundtrack and art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;- Browse social media at the speed of light.&lt;br/&gt;- Watch your friends grow old and die in the blink of an eye.&lt;br/&gt;- Realise there's nothing you can do about it&lt;br/&gt;- Tell your friends you love them one last time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
