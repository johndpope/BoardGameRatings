							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All Quiet on the Martian Front</name>
									
			<description>The Martians have invaded for a second time and the world is at war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Quiet on the Martian Front is a game with WWI-like weapons and Martian Advanced Technology, that breathes new life into the Classic Earth Invasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the beginning of the second decade of the Twentieth Century. All Quiet on the Martian Front starts in an exciting time that&amp;rsquo;s filled with the smoke of countless factories creating the first tanks, automobiles, aeroplanes, lightning guns and more. Larger than life historical figures like Teddy Roosevelt, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and many others lead the fight against the soulless Martian invaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North America is the setting for Part One, and features the forces of the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, holding the Martian invasion on the Mississippi River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In All Quiet on the Martian Front Mankind is fighting for survival: upon the steppes of Russia, across the sands of Egypt, amongst the foothills of the Himalayas, but nowhere more fiercely than in the United States of America. Our game puts you in command of the embattled armies of humanity or their implacable adversaries the Martian invaders. These opposing forces are represented by models of alien Tripod war machines armed with heat rays, black dust, and green mist, and Martian Made Human Zombie Slaves on one side versus all the tanks, infantry, artillery and other weaponry that humanity can muster on the other. Your model armies clash over a tabletop turned into a battlefield by the addition of model terrain, fortifications, and alien constructions from mysterious Cylinders to towering fortifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME PLAY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Truly innovative game system developed by some of the world&amp;rsquo;s best game designers such as Rick Priestley, Alessio Cavatore, and Ernie Baker.&lt;br/&gt;Initiative based system that determines who goes first that turn.&lt;br/&gt;Scalable game system allow players to start out with a few tripods and tanks with the ability to progress to play truly massive conflicts.&lt;br/&gt;This is a unit based game of massive conflict rather than a skirmish game.&lt;br/&gt;Rules designed for massive battles made possible through the use of 15mm (18mm) (HO) scale miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;The rules system is highly flexible and allows for hidden movement and ambushing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
