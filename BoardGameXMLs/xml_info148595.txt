			<description>FAST FACTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Nearly half a million plays on Kongregate (early alpha demo)&lt;br/&gt;- Funded on Kickstarter ($20k+)&lt;br/&gt;- 2.5 hours average session length (beta version)&lt;br/&gt;- Powerful in-game world creator (focus on ongoing user-content)&lt;br/&gt;- Unique cooperative relay mode (highly social)&lt;br/&gt;- Keyboard, gamepad, or BrassMonkey controls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CORE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race The Sun is a high-speed game that uses simple controls and is set in a procedurally generated world. The goal is to get the highest possible score by racing into the sunset, avoiding obstacles and enemies, and collecting speed boosts and other powerups to help you along the way. You fly a solar-powered craft, and the game ends at sundown, if you can make it that far!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SIMPLEX WORLD CREATOR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world creator is included right in the game, allowing anyone to make unique new game modes (or modify existing ones) and share them with the Race the Sun Community. Unique interactive objects can be created, styled, and animated &amp;ndash; with no programming knowledge. These could be simple things like falling blocks, or more detailed things like a flock of birds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CO-OP MULTIPLAYER&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer in Race the Sun takes the forms of an asynchronous, co-op, relay race. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works:&lt;br/&gt;When your round ends, you can share your progress with other players via a hyperlink. This allows another player to pick up where you left off and continue the run. When they die, they will be able to share a link, and so on, and so forth. The process repeats until 4 runs are completed, at which point your combined score is posted to a special leader-board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
