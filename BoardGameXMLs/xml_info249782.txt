			<description>Transform a standard deck of playing cards into an immersive game of two-player baseball in Hardball Shuffle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both players draw rosters of ten cards from the deck. Each card represents a ballplayer on the team, with the ballplayer's relative skill determined by the value of the card. Select one card from each roster as the pitcher, and fashion the rest into a batting order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the game begins, batters secure a hit if their card is worth more than that of the pitcher. The bigger the differential, the more bases a batter achieves. Conversely, if the batter's card value is lower than the pitcher, they are out. The standard rules of baseball apply, with three outs to a half inning and the victor is the player with more runs at game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding several wrinkles is key to a winning strategy. From the batting team's perspective, a batter automatically strikes out no matter the batting card's value if they share the pitcher's suit. On the other hand, batters become incrementally more powerful if they share the same suit as any teammates already on base. And base runners sharing the same value as the batter automatically steal a base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For their part, the fielding team must adjust for the fact that their pitcher's card is limited to a maximum value of 10, even if it is a face card. Furthermore, pitchers become fatigued over time, with a pitching card's effective value declining by one for every inning pitched. To mitigate this, a new pitcher may be selected out of a player's batting lineup between innings, with that hole in the order replaced from the minor leagues (drawn from the deck).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lest the innings start to blur together, a team's lineup is far from static. Each player demotes a batter to the minor leagues at the end of every inning, selecting from among a handful of minor league call-ups to fill the void. It is never too late for a last-minute comeback!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
