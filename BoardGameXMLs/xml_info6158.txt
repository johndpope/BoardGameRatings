							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">7 de Table</name>
									
			<description>It's hard to describe this kind of trick taking game, because the description of the game has a great chance of being longer than a single play. 7 de Table is made in Lyon (France) and has reached it's final version with engraved boxwood counters and a triangular leather bag to carry them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 principles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The first player who reaches 7 points or more wins the game&lt;br/&gt;    The points are easy to take by launching one of your &amp;quot;Centaur&amp;quot; pawns bumping into opposite pawns showing some points (one or two).&lt;br/&gt;    There is no board, and at extreme limits... there are no rules either, the players have to define what is correct or not to block the enemy fire !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems to be a dexterity game like Carom's or Pool, but it can be played in 5 minutes and everywhere if there is a table or some kind of surface. In fact, it's a true politically incorrect game, that can be played according to its rules or... not ! The rules are a bit complex and explain the multiple combination between counters and action pawns, but this complexity is more valuable for the trickiness !!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is short enough so that it can be re-played thus avoiding silly quarrels, so let's play !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
