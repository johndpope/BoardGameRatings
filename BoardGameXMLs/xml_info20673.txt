			<description>The object of the game is to advance all of your stakes to the finish line before your opponent in order to win. The game can be played opposite each other or side-by-side. When playing opposite each other, the game cards must be placed in the card bay so that the green block is at the bottom and at the player&amp;rsquo;s right. Playing side-by-side, both cards must be placed with the green block at the bottom. Stakes must be advanced vertically only. There are three (3) versions to this game: RANDOM, MIX, and FIX. Random is the basic version and should be learned first....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
