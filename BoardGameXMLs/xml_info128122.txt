							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ysgarth Minirules</name>
									
			<description>From the &amp;quot;Version IV&amp;quot; introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These aren't the complete rules to Ysgarth. The minirules are the most basic version of the rules, with enough information to play a limited game of Ysgarth, but without some of the details and refinements. Complete mechanics can be found in the full version of the 6th edition rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of these &amp;quot;minirules&amp;quot; documents were produced, typically distributed at game conventions or via the mails.  They ranged from a single double-sided page to an eight-page folio pamphlet.  The longer versions typically contained advertising materials as well as rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's designer, David Nalle, was also posting various iterations of the minirules online (as a plain text without art) as early as 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The minirules appear to have been revised fairly often. Version 2.5 is dated 1993, Version 4 is dated 1994, Version 5.2 is dated 1995, and Version 6.7 is dated 1998.  Nearly all of these documents appeared after the publication of the 6th Edition rules (in 1992).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the Version 6.1 and 6.7 documents contain minor rules errata, demonstrating the iterative development of a planned (but never published) 7th edition game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
