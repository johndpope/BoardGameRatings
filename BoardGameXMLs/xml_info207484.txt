			<description>7 Seize is a speedy battle of pirate wits that anyone can play with common bits &amp;amp; bobs found around the home along with a standard deck of cards. The Kickstarter includes deck up playing cards with custom art, 49 pieces of booty, and a box that transforms into a balance scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have 7 rounds to collect as much booty as they can. At the end of the game they weigh their pieces and the heaviest collection wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round starts with players wagering for the powerful role of Captain. Then the Captain divides some booty into 2 piles. Finally, players play another card to try to seize the best booty. They take turns grabbing pieces in order of rank from Ace to 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
