			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nature of The Game - Set thousands of years after the doom of the ancient world, people live in a new dark age; they milk their cows, plow their fields and come nightfall, offer prayers to the All-Seeing. But while their lives may seem simple, among them walk the Angelions, immortals that have kept the dark technology of the First Age alive and hidden. For two thousand years, these silent ghosts have watched over the mortal masses from the shadows, using forbidden crafts to bless the virtuous with long life and reward the malicious with swift death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What You Can Play - Thrust into the turbulent time known as the Second Age, players of Lesser Shades of Evil create and play mighty Angelion characters in the years immediately following the great treachery; divided, scattered and leaderless, they roam the world as digital ghosts, wandering from flesh to flesh, known by many names and possessing many forms. They may speak from the mouth of a child but bite with the jaws of a snake; they may walk using the legs of men, fly over cloud using the wings of birds or swim in the seas using the fins of fish. Their mortal forms may perish, but their essence lives on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 456 pages lavishly illustrated by the genre&amp;rsquo;s best artists, such as Torstein Nordstrand, Larry Elmore and Martin McKenna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A rich setting detailing the mythical Second Age of the world; its history, its wonders and its countless dangers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A point-based character generation system that allows players to build any character, from simple and wide-eyed mortals up to Rogue Golems, Awakened operatives, monstrous Archfiends and the mighty Angelions themselves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Cinematic rules - a ruleset that allows players to use six-sided, ten-sided or twenty-sided dice according to the challenge they're facing and the risks they're willing to take&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; And much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
