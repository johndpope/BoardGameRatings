							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Table Pack 19: Class of 1812 and Victory</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pack adds recreations of two pinball tables to Pinball Arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Class of 1812 was released in 1991 by Gottlieb. The playfield includes an animated, severed hand, chattering teeth and a beating heart! The main aim of the game is to to light all of the Bonus Levels in order to resurrect five characters, known as Stiffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory was released in 1987 by Gottlieb. The table is themed around motor-racing. It was the first table to have a photo-quality mylar overlay on the playfield, rather than the hitherto standard paint directly on wood. The main aim of the table is to finish the race by completing seven Checkpoints by completing specific shots. Completing checkpoints quickly is the key to a high-score, as completing each checkpoint starts a bonus counting down. At the start of the game, the bonus is 100,000 points, completing the first checkpoint scores the current bonus and resets the countdown to 200,000, and so on with the bonus increasing for each checkpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
