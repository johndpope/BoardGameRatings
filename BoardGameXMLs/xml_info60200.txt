			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Forty years ago, Hanse Davion and Melissa Steiner were joined in holy matrimony, reflecting on a personal level the joining of their two realms. The superstate formed through the union of the Federated Suns and the Lyran Commonwealth was meant to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity, eventually leading to the creation of a new Star League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it was not to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the eldest children of Hanse and Melissa are battling for control of their parents' legacy. This sourcebook details the long struggle between Victor Steiner-Davion and his sister Katherine, a struggle which raged across two realms and affected many others. Complete unit listings and wave maps show the progression of the war from its initial sparks to its devastating conclusion.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
