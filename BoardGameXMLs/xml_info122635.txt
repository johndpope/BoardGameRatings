			<description>The object of the game is to be the first to get 20 points by taking on challenges and being the fastest to find characters on the game board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player spins the arrow and draws a card of the color indicated by the arrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards represent one of the characters. The first one who puts his finger on the image of this character (exactly the same image!) on the gameboard, wins the card. He places it face up in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards are &amp;quot;clues&amp;quot;: these represent either a close-up, or the silhouette of a character. The first one who puts his finger on the image of the character wins the card&lt;br/&gt;Ps! The character on the image must be exactly the same position!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cards are &amp;quot;challenges&amp;quot;: only the player who drawn this card challenges with all other players to score point or not.  If the award is made, the player keeps the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The first to get a total of 20 points wins. Points (1 to 3, depending on the difficulty) are indicated on each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
