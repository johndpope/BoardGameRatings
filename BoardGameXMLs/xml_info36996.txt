			<description>A simple 2 player game where pieces move and capture based on a colored dot on their face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 18 pieces of their color (White or Black) to place in secret in any arrangement of their choosing within their starting area. Each piece has a colored dot in 1 of 6 colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple) and 1 of 3 sizes. Size and color of the dot determines rank, capturing ability and movement of each piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play alternates between players and ends when one player has only one piece left on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
