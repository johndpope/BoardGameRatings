			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Medical Malpractice. Of the Cthulhu Mythos Kind.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The medical arts of the late 18th Century were, by our standards, horrific in themselves. And yet, in the isolated Australian penal colonies, the standards of surgical and medical treatment were made even more primitive by a reliance on a supply of European-made drugs and treatments which frequently did not arrive. An utter lack of regulation also meant that there was no restriction on who could claim to practice medicine ... and subsequently an entire community of charlatan doctors, some well-meaning, and others shameless hoaxers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ticket of Leave #11 is our largest supplement to-date for Convicts &amp;amp; Cthulhu. It looks at the state of medical practice in the early colonies, and provides a detailed scenario seed centred upon a most unusual medical book and the curious treatments that a Parramatta charlatan has learned from its pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Officials of the Colonial Medical Service have started to hear some quite outlandish stories about strange medical symptoms reported among the Parramatta community. Some of those rumours describe strange transformations, abominations of the human form. What horrible secret lies behind these unbelievable tales? What (if anything) do they have to do with the amateur surgeon and &amp;quot;Ticket of Leave&amp;quot; convict named James Macdead? And why can nobody seem to find him?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
