			<description>From the back of the package;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most intense dogfighting action of the year&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the great pilots of the Pacific&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Dogfight with over 150 on-screen planes.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Pilot 36 detailed WWII aircraft&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; 26 missions from the entire Pacific campaign&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Dramatic, action-packed storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Online multiplayer action for up to 8 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of the Pacific is an aerial combat simulator game set in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows the player to assume the role of a combat pilot named William Crowe as he experiences the various phases of the Pacific War with Japan, beginning with the Pearl Harbor attack. There are six game modes: Campaign, Instant Action, Single Mission, Historical, Training, and Multiplayer. One or two players can play simultaneously on the console or up to eight players can play on the network via Xbox Live or using a PlayStation 2 with network adapter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different control schemes for flying the planes, Arcade and Professional. The Arcade control scheme allows for easier control of the plane via a single joystick with automatic rudders, while the Professional controls offer separate control of the pitch, roll and yaw of the plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of the Pacific also offers multiple difficulty levels: Rookie, Pilot, Veteran, and Ace. Completing missions on higher difficulty unlocks more planes and rewards the player with more upgrade points, which can be used to upgrade your unlocked aircraft after missions are accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simulation also allows players to pilot famous planes such as the P-40 Warhawk, P-51 Mustang, F4U Corsair, P-47 Thunderbolt and a number of Japanese and German planes from World War II, including several experimental planes, such as the Blohm &amp;amp; Voss BV P.215 and the J7W Shinden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Heroes of the Pacific&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
