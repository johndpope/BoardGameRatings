			<description>This game is for children Ages 4 and up and is used to learn different types of shapes, and also to recognize color and to be able to see a relation between shape and color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You divide all the tiles by color and shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then you take turns drawing bits from the pouch, trying to find a specific shape and color. You can see from your tiles which bits you are missing and so you try to find those in the pouch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also see the other players tiles and so you know if there is only one of a specific bit left in the pouch, and try to get that one and in doing so you stop an opponent from completing his tiles. This gets you a point at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who first get all bits on the tiles or who has the highest point total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
