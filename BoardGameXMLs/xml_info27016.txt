			<description>NOEL'S HOUSE PARTY is a board game spin-off from the UK's TV Show of the same name.  It involves recreations of the main features of the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Round and around Crinkley Bottom you go... in for the Music Game .... down the cellar for 'Wait till I get you home'.  But who's that at the door? - better go and find out, oh no! you've landed in the grunge tank - or worse still you've to face the NTV talent test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new and exiting family game is fast-paced and action packed and features a fully working three-dimensional 'Grad a Grand' booth complete with miniature money&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to collect the most money by moving around the board and performing a variety of actions based on the draw of a card:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NTV - act out the instructions on the card.&lt;br/&gt;KNOCK KNOCK - Guess the identity of someone from clues on the card.&lt;br/&gt;WAIT TILL I GET YOU HOME! - Guessing what answer another player will give to a question.&lt;br/&gt;MUSIC GAME - Music based trivia or performance card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other spaces require you to spin again, miss a turn or take possion of the Gotcha! (allowing you to score double points whilst you have it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
