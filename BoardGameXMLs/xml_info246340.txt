			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survival of two neighboring space civilizations depends on their ability to smuggle power pods, but they must cross through the megabarrier.  This two-player game involves both an offensive and defensive strategy.  Written for the Atari, a 64 version is included.  Two joysticks are required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For eons the Alpha and Zeta civilizations have coexisted with a mutual trade agreement.  Each uses an energy station dependent upon a combination of power pods from both sides.  An undeclared war has negated this treaty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Thief was written by Steve Low and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 43, December 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
