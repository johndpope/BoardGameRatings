							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Emergency Room Patients</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Friday night and the ER is bustling. Nurses and doctors are responding to codes while tired looking staff members call in patients one by one to get their insurance information. So who&amp;rsquo;s there and how did they manage to get busted up? This modern setting list contains 50 different patients to fill up hospital emergency rooms with. Some folks were hurt in basic everyday accidents, others are there for a mental health screening or to get patched up after being part of a crime scene.  Included is the person&amp;rsquo;s first and last name, gender, age, and details about who they are and/or why they are at the ER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
