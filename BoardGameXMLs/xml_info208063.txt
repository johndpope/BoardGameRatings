			<description>Skewered and Roasted is an Apples-to-Apples style points based game. There are two decks Events and Memories. Each round, the active player draws a Memory card (which features a situation like &amp;quot;What was my favorite classroom activity&amp;quot;) from the deck, then the other players each secretly choose the Event card in hand that best matches that player's history and plays it face-down on the table. The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the Event card that, in their opinion, best matches the Memory card, which he awards to whoever played that Event card. This player earns 1 point, and the active player marker is passed down to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has won a number of points, selected from 3 gameplay styles, that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
