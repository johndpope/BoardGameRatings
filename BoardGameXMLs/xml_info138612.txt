							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Peacekeeper</name>
									
			<description>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peacekeeper is the Guild's massive premiere construct. Its heavy armor and powerful weaponry are offset by a pair of setback Talents that can Paralyze the Peacekeeper or reduce its defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its bulk, the Peacekeeper is a very fast model, especially considering it's a Guild model. His movement is slightly above average 5/8, but he is allowed to discard a card to take an additional Walk action each activation due to (+1) Relentless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peacekeeper has two separate abilities it can use to move models. This is a great way to put enemy models into harmful terrain. It is also a great way to get them to drop a Treasure Counter or just move them off the terrain they need to be on for there Strategy or Scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peacekeeper is a big mean-looking model and people naturally want to take him out. This is actually a great trick to take advantage of. Many players will concentrate a lot of firepower on the Peacekeeper and ignore the rest of your crew. The fact that the Peacekeeper can survive a beating means they have to dedicate resources for several turns sometimes. Take advantage of this. Let your enemy take out the Peacekeeper while you maneuver to take the Strategies and Schemes you need to win the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like most Guild Minions there is not a whole lot of synergy with the Peacekeeper. He works okay in Perdita and Lady Justice crews. He does better in Sonnia Crews because he can use his abilities to push models onto Flame Pillars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exception is Hoffman. In a lot of ways they seem made for each other. Hoffman can make the Peacekeeper ignore his Experimental Automation and Faulty Circuits abilities. Meanwhile the Peacekeeper can be a great ride for Hoffman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leveticus&lt;br/&gt;This Guild construct is a big brutal enforcer with some solid stats and good Cb. It will return its investment in Scrap Counters on death as well. However, it can be unreliable and is a Control Card hog, so be wary as it could leave Leveticus high and dry. There is no additional benefit to giving this minion Blessings of Desolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
