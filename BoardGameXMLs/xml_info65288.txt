			<description>Pick-A-Part is memory with more to it. There are two sets of cards; large cards that show full drawings, and smaller cards that show individual parts of the full drawings. Each full drawing on a large card consists of three main parts. Therefor there are three small cards for each large card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both sets of cards are put face down on the playing area. You can choose to mix the large and small cards together in one group, or to have them as two separate groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn a player first flips over one of the large cards which will show a full drawing. For example: A bird in a nest on a branch. Then the player flips over a small card, trying to match it with the full drawing on the large card that's already flipped over. In the example mentioned, a matching small card should show a drawing of either the bird, the nest or the branch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no match is made, both the large and small cards are to be flipped over again, face down. If a match is made, the player gets to keep only the small card; the large card has to be flipped over again. However, if the matching small card is the last of the small cards remaining for the specific large card, then the player gets to keep both cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player is allowed another turn whenever he/she is able to collect a small tile. If a player collects both a large and a small card, it's the next players' turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should a player overlook the fact that the collected small card was the last one of the set remaining, and flip over the large card so that it is facing down again instead of collecting it, then any player in his/her own turn can still collect this large card. A player doing so has to mention that the large card he/she collects does not have any of its small cards remaining. Collecting a single large card also means that it's the next players' turn.&lt;br/&gt;A player that overlooks to collect a large card does however get another turn since he/she did collect a small card. He/she can still use this extra turn to collect the large card, so other players are warned not to rejoice openly to quickly as this might trigger him/her to do just that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player collects a large card, the remaining large cards have to be shuffled.&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a single player manages to collect a full set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards), all remaining cards (large and small) have to be shuffled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when there are no more cards to be collected. To determine the winner, the cards are counted and scored as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 point for each small card&lt;br/&gt;     2 points for each large card (except for the last collected large card; No points for that!)&lt;br/&gt;     3 bonus points for each complete set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player that gets the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
