							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Master Detective</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Another body appears on a river bank. The marks of shooting denounce another murder in the once calm city. Police alone cannot handle the investigation of all crimes, while the population and the press are demanding energetic action from the authorities. With police under pressure, authorities decide to hire private investigators in the hope of helping police unravel the recent wave of crimes plaguing the city. Players represent these investigators, and they must seek the clues hidden around the city and use all their acuteness to solve these mysteries&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master Detective is a game of medium complexity, suitable for casual and experienced players. Its main mechanics are deckbuilding and deduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each game, one crime card is randomly chosen and secretly put face down. This card contains the description of one murderer, one accomplice and one witness. The first player to discover the identity of these three characters is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the players will use their cards to walk around the city, buy stronger new cards to improve their decks and check the hidden clues, in order to solve that crime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your magnifying glass and start unraveling crimes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
