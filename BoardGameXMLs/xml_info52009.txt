			<description>This is a Japanese game with some English on the box.  Essentially it's a version of Roulette which also includes set collection.  Players can collect the season (suits) or the twelve signs of the zodiac.  The game comes with a plastic roulette wheel, plastic chips in many sizes and colors, and a chip rack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year of publication, 1964, is a guess based on the games shown in an ad flyer in the game which shows a Japanese version of the game Dogfight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
