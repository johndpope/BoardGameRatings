			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T&amp;eacute;kumel, the lost world of the Ancients, home to the mighty Five Empires sometimes at peace, often not, but always riddled with intrigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tsoly&amp;aacute;nu, The Empire of the Petal Throne, filled with her great cities and countless smaller villages, distinct cultural regions and conquered protectorates are all bound together by the worship of twenty complex deities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Religion is interwoven with daily life - they are inseparable.  This two volume set provides the most detailed and complete repository of information about each of the Great Temples, Ten Gods of Stability and Ten Gods of Change.  Each Deity is described with history and theology, rituals and complex inner ceremonies, from the basics of sacred numbers and colors to varied public and secret rituals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created by Professor M.A.R. Barker, game designer, linguist and author, this rich tapestry is the basis for all interaction on T&amp;eacute;kumel.  In these books, Robert  Alberti and Professor M.A.R. Barker have assembled the arcana of the religions of Tsoly&amp;aacute;nu, from ancient legends, to the secret ceremonies in the temples, to the deadly rituals for selecting a new emperor.  This work gives adventurers and explorers the essential details regarding the diverse Deities of T&amp;eacute;kumel and is essential for anyone who desires a thorough understanding of T&amp;eacute;kumel and its history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plunge in... a new world awaits...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitlany&amp;aacute;l Volume 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gods and Goddesses of Stability, more staid and sensible than their counterparts, wish a tranquil and peaceful progression of all things to a final amalgamation into a perfect &amp;quot;Light of Being&amp;quot; led by the Lord of Eternal Light.  They emphasize the needs of society in order to maintain the status quo.  In this volume you will find detailed information pertaining to the Gods of Stability along with details concerning their Temples and priests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
