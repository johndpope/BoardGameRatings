			<description>Despite its English name People Game is a German Word Game for at least 2 players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards show each uncommon or unusual German words with their explanation or definition. A sand timer of about 3 mins running time allows the players to do the following:&lt;br/&gt;They read one term and the definition and are allowed to write two definitions of their own. When the time is up then they offer between 3 and 5 points to their adversaries. They read those 3 definitions and have to guess which one is correct.&lt;br/&gt;If they get it right it's them who advance on the track otherwise it's the active players.&lt;br/&gt;This continues until one team reaches the end of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of the board, 420 cards, 8 standard pawns, 1 pad, 4 pencils, the sand timer and of course the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
