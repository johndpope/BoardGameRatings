			<description>1815, the world has never been so small. The gears of the Industrial Era are shaping the old English Kingdom into an Empire so big that the sun is always shining on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tempting wealth of the colonies represent a golden opportunity for you to increase your status but if you really want to be ambitious, you must dare to manipulate the political scenario and get the best advantages, otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll learn a bitter lesson: one plot is worth more than a million pounds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contenders will build ships to reach distant places like Canada, Australia and India. They will establish colonial houses and bring their workers in order to grow in power and wealth. This power assumes the form of influence towards the crown and it is the crown that can best serve all player&amp;rsquo;s interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During three rounds, players will select actions to perform both in England and in the colonies. It is a very demanding scenario, divided in two, with all players splitting their attention and trying to be as sharp and efficient as a context like this obliges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need influence to perform actions in England but, to get this influence, money needs to be spent in the colonies. Invest wise, collect more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money and status quo combined represent the wealth hold by each player and, in the end of the game, the wealthiest player will be called victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
