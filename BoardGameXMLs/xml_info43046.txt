							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Louisiana Purchase</name>
									
			<description>Louisiana Purchase is an area movement game that plays very similar to Risk, but with some added twists. 2 to 5 players fight over an area map of North America. [America, Britain, France, Spain, and the Native Americans are the 5 sides] Random event cards keep the game interesting, yet play to the strengths and weaknesses of each side. Six-sided dice are needed to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes these components:&lt;br/&gt;a map including the Eastern USA, Eastern Canada, and Latin America;&lt;br/&gt;approximately 300 square counters;&lt;br/&gt;Rules.&lt;br/&gt;(6-sided dice not included)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a similar system to The Seven Years War &amp; The War of Austrian Succession, also published by the Calumet Armchair Gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
