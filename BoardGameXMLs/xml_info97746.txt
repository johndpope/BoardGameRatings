							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spider Stompin</name>
									
			<description>The game mat has 10 spiders which light up in sequence simulating that they are moving away from the nest and towards the outside of the game mat.  All games begin with the spiders lighting up solid red near the center nest.  If this center spider is not stomped in time, it will turn off and one of the spiders on the mat's outside edges will blink red.  If this outside spider turns off before being stomped, the spider has escaped off the mat, and you will hear it bite you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like Spider-Man, your spidey senses will be tingling when you play the Electronic Spider Stompin' Game--a squishy, battery-powered (three AAA, not included) test of reaction time for one or two players. The arachnid amusement begins when you unroll the three-dimensional, vinyl floormat portraying a colorful array of 10 soft-bodied, pop-up spiders that blink red at random intervals--depending on which of five game speeds you've selected from the push-button controls on the center nest. Players score points by stomping their feet on the blinking beast before it escapes off the mat, all the while enduring smart-aleck cobweb comments like &amp;quot;Ha Ha, ya missed me!&amp;quot; or sound effects like a satisfied &amp;quot;Chomp!&amp;quot; after a successful escape. Add to the mix a razzle-dazzle underscore of silly music during each round of play, and the Electronic Spider Stompin' Game provides more than an itsy-bitsy bit of fast family fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
