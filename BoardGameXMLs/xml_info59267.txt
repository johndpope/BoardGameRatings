			<description>Quindo is a rather unusual mancala variant, which is played in a cooperative manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are ten fields in a circle, with each field connected to the one on the opposite side by a line. In each field there are three playing pieces (six colors with five pieces each, which are usually randomly placed in any way the players like).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At his or her turn, a player either moves one piece to an opposite field or deals the pieces of one field, one by one, onto the consecutive fields, always in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all five pieces of one color are in the same field, they are removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players win when all colors are removed before the 20th turn, otherwise everyone loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a non-cooperative variant and a variant with a fixed set-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
