			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new concept in word games with the great advantage of involving all the players in the fun of the game all of the time. The game can be played by the whole family &amp;amp; by any number of players. The game centers around the planners or plans. These are the 'Crosswords' made up by all the players before the play actually begins. These planners are filled out by each player in crossword fashion on a particular theme or subject e.g. Film Stars, The Sea, Sport etc &amp;amp; the rest of the players have to find the words in these plans - the player with the most points being the winner. A game concept that can grow &amp;amp; even use tiles from other word games !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
