Now you can boldly state your allegiance for your favorite House by displaying its heraldry and claiming power on a stylish resin House card as you battle your way to the Iron Throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flaunt Your Heraldry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you engage in the fierce battles and twisted intrigues of Westeros, you can collect power on a House card bearing the direwolf of House Stark, the lion of House Lannister, or the three-headed dragon of House Targaryen.
