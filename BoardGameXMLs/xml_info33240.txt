							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Games of the Pilgrim&#039;s Progress, Going to Sunday School and Tower of Babel</name>
									
			<description>An integrated three game set produced by McLoughlin Brothers, in true bookcase style. The wooden playing board has a pair of book-like spines on one side and the illusion of book pages on the others, with an outer slip case to hold everything together. The set also contains a dual arrowed spinning indicator which its makers proclaimed as &amp;quot;A Complete and Unobjectional Substitute for, and Improvement on Dice, Teetotums, &amp;amp;c.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic Pilgrim's Progress game, played on the outer board halves, a player must move both of his pieces (two pawns: a Pilgrim and a Staff) by the number of spaces indicated by the dual spinner until he reaches the Giant Despair space. He then moves his Pilgrim alone until it lands by exact count on the Golden Gate, and thence (if not displaced) to victory in the Celestial City. Rules for three other variants are also included. These use various combinations of board spaces and require differing numbers of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Going to Sunday School, played in one of the inner board halves, players spin and move around the board. Essentially, the player that lands on the most picture spaces (10 special spaces, each illustrating a virtue or a vice) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Babel, played in the other inner board half, combines a race for the top of the tower with a race to the bottom. Different rules apply to each race within the game. The winners of each half have a spin-off to determine the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rule booklet&lt;br/&gt;     12 round-headed (Pilgrim) wood pawns&lt;br/&gt;     6 pointed-headed (Staff) wood pawns&lt;br/&gt;     Dual arrowed spinner&lt;br/&gt;     Wooden game board&lt;br/&gt;     Slip case&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
