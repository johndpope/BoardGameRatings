			<description>This Monopoly variant was published as a fundraiser for the Taft High School (Lincoln City, OR) 2009 Senior Class. The board features local businesses from Otis, Neotsu, Lincoln City, Glenden Beach, Lincoln Beach, and Depoe Bay instead of the traditional properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Houses and Hotels are replaced with green and red 'customer' chips. Chance and Community Chest cards are renamed as Fate and Beachcombing cards. Other non-property spaces on the board are also renamed (Loading Zone instead of Free Parking, etc) and each feature the name and logo of a local business. Money features the Chinook Winds Casino Resort name and logo, playing pieces match the 'monopolist' pieces from Anti-Monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
