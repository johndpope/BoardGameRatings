			<description>The Heineken Spin-sation! Game was used as a premium gift in a marketing campaign by Heineken in Singapore during the Christmas season (17 Nov to 21 Dec) in 2007. People who bought Heineken beer gained points and these points could be exchanged for premiums like T-shirts, bags, sound speakers, calendars and this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is completely random. Players spin a cardboard wheel affixed to a board; the board also has spaces to place 4 stacks of cards. Depending on which segment on the wheel ends up next to where the picture of the beer bottle is pointing, the player who spun the wheel draws a chance card, which gives the player positive or negative points. The card may also have instructions or forfeits for the player to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four types of cards are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Let's celebrate cards&lt;br/&gt;These all give the player +40 points. There's also a date of some festival on the card with some advice for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E.g. +40 points. February 5th (2008) Mardi Gras, New Orleans. Don't come back without some beach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Oops! cards&lt;br/&gt;These all give the player -10 points and have an action for the player to carry out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E.g. -10 points. Collect an Oops! card from every girl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Spin-sation! cards&lt;br/&gt;These all give the player =10 points and have a forfeit for the player to perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E.g. -10 points. Tell a joke that no one in the room has heard before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Heineken cards&lt;br/&gt;These all give the player +20 points and have an action for the player to carry out (always a good thing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E.g. +20 points. Take 3 Heineken cards from the player on your right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends whenever any stack of cards on the board is used up. Players then tally their nett scores and the player with the most points wins. The player with the least number of points has to perform the Ultimate Forfeit (sic), which the winner decides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
