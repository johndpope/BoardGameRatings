			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alignment is a way of describing the moral code of a creature.  This supplement is intended to help the Game Master create a system of alignments for his or her own game world. These rules are for use with the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alignment, in a role-playing game, refers to a system of defining ethics and morality in the campaign world. The very   first role-playing game possessed an alignment system, basically defining &amp;ldquo;sides&amp;rdquo; to which the heroes and monsters belonged. Later games have expanded on this concept in several details. How alignments are defined, judged, and applied in the game world has long been a point of contention&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
