							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Ampel</name>
									
			<description>The players can choose between a car, a taxi, an omnibus, a tram and a truck. The goal is to reach space 80, while observing the traffic rules. Movement is determined by a die. On colored spaces, the players have to follow the rules printed on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is playable by as many players as vehicles are available. The board is big enough (102 cm x 70 cm) to use H0 model cars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced for the Berliner Verkehrs-Betriebe BVG in the 1930s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
