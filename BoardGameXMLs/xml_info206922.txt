							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Night Terrors: The Sum of All Fears</name>
									
			<description>Timmy was haunted by nightmares ever since he moved into the new house. Tonight, the monsters in his closet have planned a full-scale assault. Every horrible creature that ever frightened the boy will arrive at midnight to tear apart his mind, body and soul. Timmy is ready to make a stand. He will defend himself with an arsenal of incredible weaponry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now midnight. The closet doors swing open. Creatures begin to pour out. The battle is on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Terrors: The Sum of all Fears is a one-player dice game. Cards representing monsters move from the top of the board down towards the player in waves. Between waves, the player selects weapons to destroy the advancing monsters. Weapons instruct the player to roll dice and place them on monster cards as damage, sometimes with additional effects. Players must choose the best weapon for each situation and roll well! Victory is achieved by surviving all waves of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
