			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire and Ice. Your heating bill will never be the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The six Champions stood in a circle, one from each element. They stood quietly, their heads hung low. Slowly, they began to chant. The words started soft, but built in power and intensity. Each Champion began to glow slightly as they filled with power. The elements swelled and rushed to fill them. They vibrated as the chant rose higher still. Finally, their heads rose as one. Their eyes burned, seemingly consumed by the elements.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hottest and coolest Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing supplement to hit the streets in years. New spells, new professions, new training packages, and new monsters will add spice and power to any campaign game. Detailed item creation rules add a flavorful twist. But beware the corruption of such power. Find out what your characters can do when they command the elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
