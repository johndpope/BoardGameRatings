							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Revolution 20??-The Rebirth of America</name>
									
			<description>American Revolution is a solitaire parody game that pits the left vs the right in a fight to restore the nation to it's Constitutional roots.  As a 'Patriot', you use political and military power to save the nation from a President that has usurped power to become a King-like figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game the player competes against the deck for control of strategic cities across the nation. A city card is drawn.  Four opposition cards are drawn to represent gov't presence in the city. The player keeps a hand of 6 cards but can only play 3 per city to defeat the gov't presence.  There are bonuses and penalties associated with each city, opposition, and player card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must win 6 cities before the opposition (game deck) wins 6 cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
