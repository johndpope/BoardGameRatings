			<description>This is a tennis simulation. The board is made from cloth, the ball is velcro-covered. The &amp;quot;players&amp;quot; are catapult-like tennis rackets, with which the ball is shot over the net. A stamina point is deducted from the original points of a player for each square on the board he/she has to &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; to the place the ball landed. A player whose stamina is reduced to 0, loses the point. Other than that, regular tennis rules apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
