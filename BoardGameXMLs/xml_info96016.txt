			<description>The Wargamer's Guide to Midway collection of what Avalon Hill considered to be its best articles and variants. Several analysis and tactical articles appear. Two of the scenario expansions from the General are reprinted.  The guide contains, among other items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midway Thesis An in depth article on the mechanics and tactics of Midway. Serious analysis of play and probability on the battle board.&lt;br/&gt;Midway Re-worked A small suggestion changing operations on the search board.&lt;br/&gt;One Ship Invasion Fleet? Replaces the Atago &amp;ldquo;invasion ship&amp;rdquo; with transports, and their escorts.&lt;br/&gt;Midway, Bismark Style Surface battle resolution based on the 1962 version of Bismark&lt;br/&gt;Chicken Yamamoto Adds the Aleutians task force for use in the main battle. Includes destroyers (for those who use them), and a redress of the invasion fleet.&lt;br/&gt;What Next?: Destroyers at Midway Adds destroyer rules. Destroyers appear in divisions, similar to those Jutland.&lt;br/&gt;Gross Injustice to Submarines Replaces the B-17 rule with submarines. (At least submarines got hits.) Assumes original  invasion ship rule.&lt;br/&gt;Midway and the British Home Fleet Rules for British ships in Midway and other variants of the Midway system. Amusing introductory text.&lt;br/&gt;Mass or Maneuver?

Many of these a pear in parts of other articles.&lt;br/&gt;Leyte Gulf A scenario based on the desperate operation by the Japanese Navy. Introduces kamikazes for use against the massive American fleet.&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Theatre via Midway A rewrite Coral Sea variant. Cleans up minor problems from the version in the General.&lt;br/&gt;The Battle for Australia A hypothetical scenario using nearly all the ships from main game and the Pacific Theatre via Midway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
