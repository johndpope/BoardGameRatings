							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mormon Trek</name>
									
			<description>Mormon Trek is a simple roll-and-move designed to promote family discussion about the Mormon Pioneers experiences. Each game piece is a rocking chair that is being carried across the plains in wagon trains. Movement is dictated by die-roll with a custom dice featuring wagons, blessings, and tribulations. A wagon roll simple allows you to move forward. A blessing roll (golden key) lets you move to a special section of the board where you talk about blessings the pioneers experienced. A tribulation roll moves you backwards and requires you to talk about a trial the pioneers experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to successfully travel from Nauvoo, IL to Salt Lake City, UT is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
