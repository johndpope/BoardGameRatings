							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WW II Aerial Combat Fast and Easy Rules</name>
									
			<description>A miniatures air combat game for use at conventions or with history classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game may be played with 1/144 scale models or similar miniatures. Free print-and-play paper aircraft models are also provided for use with the rules. The playing board is a large hex mat with hexes about four inches in size. A five foot square map is suggested for fighter dogfights and a larger mat is needed for scenarios involving bombing runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics are included for twenty-five fighters and fourteen bombers from World War Two. Each fighter is rated for crew, guns, speed, turn, immelman, and hit points. Each bomber is rated for crew, speed, turn, hit points, bombs, guns in each of five positions (nose, top, belly, side, and tail), and bomber type (fighter bomber, light, medium, or heavy). In addition, a conversion table is included for determining game ratings for additional historical aircraft based on performance data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement sequence is determined randomly each turn by drawing cards until each aircraft or bomber squadron has had a chance to move and fire. Combat is resolved by a die roll. Victory conditions vary depending on the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
