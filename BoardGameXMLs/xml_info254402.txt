							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Exodus: Moses vs. Pharaoh</name>
									
			<description>In Exodus: Moses vs Pharaoh: will you like Moses lead your people out of slavery and into freedom? Will the Hebrew Elders support your leadership? Will a decades old murder charge be brought against you? Will Pharaoh relent and &amp;ldquo;Let My People Go!&amp;rdquo; Will Joseph&amp;rsquo;s Bones be transported for re-burial? Will you plunder the Egyptians to make up for 400 years of slavery? Will Aaron and Hur be at your right and left hand?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Pharaoh, will you keep the Hebrew slaves in order? Will your building programs proceed on schedule? Will your magicians defeat Moses at his own game? Will the gods of the Egyptians protect Egypt from the great I Am? How will the supernatural plagues be dealt with? Will your chariots crush the slave revolt before they escape across the Red Sea? Will you succeed where your historical counterpart failed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exodus is a card driven game of ten turns. Moses must lead the Hebrew people out of Egypt and across the Red Sea to freedom. If Moses fails then Pharaoh wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
