							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Backyard Wrestling: Don&#039;t Try This at Home</name>
									
			<description>The goal of backyard wrestling is largely to use the environment to defeat an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The featured wrestlers come mostly from rap group Insane Clown Posse's own wrestling federation, the Juggalo Championshit Wrestling. These include Mad Man Pondo, Sabu, Tom Dub, Rude Boy, Josh Prohibition, MDogg20 and the clowns themselves, Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. Other celebrity appearances include Miller Lite spokesmodel Kitana Baker and former World Championship Wrestling valet Tylene Buck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from the standard backyard locations, Backyard Wrestling's arenas include a truck stop, a slaughterhouse, an outdoor parking lot, a talk show set and a strip club. Each environment is littered with barbed wire-laden bats, fluorescent light bulbs, breakable tables, steel chairs and other objects players may use to injure their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also this game featured FMVs that you could unlock by completing certain objectives while fighting in the different venues. Mostly they are taken from the &amp;quot;Backyard Wrestling&amp;quot; DVD series, and they have the different songs of the game playing in the background. The first one on the backyard level was &amp;quot;Backyard Babes 101&amp;quot;, which contained the backyard babes near-naked over Bowling for Soup's song &amp;quot;Punk Rock 101&amp;quot;, featured on their Drunk Enough to Dance album. Mud pools, water pools and sun tan lotion are all featured in this clip. Other FMVs, like &amp;quot;Collateral Damage&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Kids Today...&amp;quot; are also featured, including two clips of ICP's wrestling promotion, JCW, with two of their songs playing in the background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
