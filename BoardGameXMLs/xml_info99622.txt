			<description>The fast-paced 4-in-a-row abstract strategy game&lt;br/&gt;Exercise your mind and outwit your opponents with Oversight, the new fast paced 4 in a row abstract strategy game! Oversight is set up on a board of movable squares. Two to four players compete to be the first to get 4 tokens in a row. On their turn, each player can either place a token on the board, or shift an entire row or column of moveable squares over by one space. The rules are simple but the game gets increasingly challenging as players learn from their mistakes and predict their opponents&amp;rsquo; moves.&lt;br/&gt; Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 game board&lt;br/&gt;     34 tile squares&lt;br/&gt;     48 playing tokens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
