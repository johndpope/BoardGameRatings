			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product will allow you to create an adventure for one night's gaming in 30 seconds. No, we're not kidding, nor are we exaggerating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Deck: Quests doesn't create a random dungeon (with all the negative past experiences most of us attach to that phrase), but instead a random ADVENTURE (or minor quest), in surprising detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally designed for 2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D system and now updated for 4th edition, it can be used with any fantasy roleplaying system with almost no adaptation. It was designed by two folks with varying backgrounds - one, an experienced GM, and the other almost never runs a game. So you'll find that it is perfect for both the beginning game master, and the expert GM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect for those nights when your friends want you to run a game but you have absolutely nothing planned, or when the characters head in a totally unexpected location, or use it to plan ahead, or... there are so many ways to use this Deck, we couldn't possibly list them all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product originally debuted at GenCon 2000.  It is now printed in a full-color playing-card quality deck.  We think you'll be happy with both the way the deck works for your gaming, and the quality of the cards themselves.  Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
