							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Living Pit</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one threat which even the bravest adventurer is wary of: An open hole blocking the path. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s lined with spikes, filled with acid, or simply threatens a rock-hard bottom. A well-placed pit can delay or injure an entire party, and perhaps even kill an unlucky hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet one kind of pit terrifies parties more than any other, inspiring brave souls to abandon their current dungeon to time and dust. It is so incredibly rare, most heroes will go their entire career without facing one. Yet this obstacle remains so dangerous, despite its common appearance, that parties would rather find another path than risk crossing one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These chasms go by many names. Dwarven cultures call them Deep Holes. Forest Elves have dubbed them Hidden Flytraps. Planar travellers call them Pan-Dimensional Hero Garglers. In most common tongues, it is simply &amp;ldquo;The Living Pit&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Living Pit is a trap/monster encounter designed to utterly break your favorite fantasy roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
