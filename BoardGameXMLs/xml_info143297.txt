			<description>This is a connection game playable on a Byzantine Chessboard.  In the game, players try to be the first to connect the inner part of the board to the outer part of the board, by either placing pieces from their reserve off the board, onto an empty space, or by sliding from inside or outside.  Players start with 16 pieces off the board, which can end up being recycled and relocated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A win in the game consists of a player being able to trace a path of spaces occupied with their own pieces vertically or horizontally (not diagonally), linking the inner and outer circle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
