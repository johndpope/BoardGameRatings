			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look into my eyes&amp;hellip; you must obtain&amp;hellip; Mesmerists of Porphyra!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the Patchwork Planet of Porphyra, the will to survive and use others towards that end has saved many a life- and a nation!  A towering ego that brooks no control but his own&amp;hellip; lies that cannot be unraveled&amp;hellip; mesmerist tricks that baffle, confound, and enrage foes to the point of defeat!  Such is the wonder and indispensability of the new Mesmerist class, a fascinating addition to your favorite tabletop RPG game!  In the new Mesmerists of Porphyra by Aaron Hollingsworth and Blake Morton, published by Purple Duck Games, you will meet 13 exciting new archetypes like the magical arcane manipulator, exotic elemental eye, sinister Hell-raising kytonik, foppish macaroni, hundred-eyed panoptes, unparalleled vision and incomparable master mesmerist!  Along with these amazing archetypes is an amazing amount of new material for the mesmerist; 6 new bold stares, 10 new mesmerist tricks, 7 vile tricks (beware!), 6 new master tricks, and 9 feats found on Porphyra!  Along with these are new mesmerist equipment, new magic item qualities, and the new narcissism corruption with 9 manifestations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
