			<description>Lagartus Politicus (&amp;quot;Political Lizards&amp;quot;) is a satirical strategy game where the players take a role of a political leader that will not stop at nothing to get the favor of the unions and the president. It shows how politics in Latin America works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a cabinet of political lizards, with a dominant political ideology (right wing, left wing or center). Depending on its current ideology, a player will be able to hire certain politicians (ties of colors red, blue, grey) in the main board by auctioning in the different media (Tv, radio, internet and press). This auction will determine order of turn as well as which politicians he can acquire. A player can also auction for tamales that will give the player points and money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will try to match the symbols in the ties of the lizards with the union cards to acquire them. Unions will give the players money to the lizards of th same ideology and bills that the cabinet must pass by spending coins and politicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, players can send some of their politicians to the president board to do lobby. The player at the end of the game with more tie cards in the president board will gain points by a mayority mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, player's will try to acquire Unions by bidding on the media (TV, Radio, Internet, Press), while trying to get &amp;quot;tamales&amp;quot; (a tipical Colombian food) to give to the people and buy votes. The Unions will ask for a set of political ideologies in the player's cabinet, so, the player will have to hire politicians of the proper ideologies to get their support. Finally, a leader can send his politicians to make lobby with the president, to earn more points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spanish description:&lt;br/&gt;Dise&amp;ntilde;ado por David Laverde como s&amp;aacute;tira a la forma que funciona la pol&amp;iacute;tica, Lagartus Pol&amp;iacute;ticus es un juego inteligente que pone a los jugadores en el papel de lagartos pol&amp;iacute;ticos que intentar&amp;aacute;n armar un gabinete pol&amp;iacute;tico seg&amp;uacute;n conveniencia para poder ganar el respaldo de distintos gremios (transporte, comunicaciones, etc).
