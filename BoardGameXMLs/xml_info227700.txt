			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fool And His Life Are Soon Parted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city of Hunstoc is experiencing a rash of calamity. Livestock and horses are falling ill, children and elderly people are dying off without any explanation, and the city&amp;rsquo;s clerics can&amp;rsquo;t manage to cure the mysterious malady. The Mayor's Office has posted a bounty on strange clockwork creatures that keep emerging from the nearby foothills outside Hunstoc&amp;rsquo;s gates. Investigating these sinister happenings leads to a massive underground complex full of devious puzzles, dangerous traps, and alchemical wonders beyond anyone&amp;rsquo;s wildest imaginings&amp;mdash;and only the most cunning of adventurers will survive the journey into its depths!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What would you do for limitless wealth? How far would you delve? What horrors would you be willing to face? Would you repeatedly risk your own life, or those of your friends or countless innocents, in order to have anything you wanted? The Gilded Gauntlet brings the classic feel of dangerous trap-laden tournament-style dungeons to Jon Brazer Enterprises&amp;rsquo; Deadly Delves product line, and is fully compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.
