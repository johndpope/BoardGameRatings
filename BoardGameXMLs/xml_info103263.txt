			<description>From the back of the module:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reviving from cryogenic slumber Recon Team V-3 find they were in the Nevada high desert as expected. Their mission is simple: conduct reconnaissance of eastern Nevada; evaluate what could be used and what is needed to help rebuild the U.S.; then report that information to Prime Base. What they find is a land of steam locomotives, cattle drives, six-shooters, and a brewing range war with the local Indian tribe. Unable to contact their superiors, the team must rely on their general orders, find a missing Indian girl and try to keep the peace. It won't be an easy task!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game package contains all the information, maps and systems necessary for the Project Director to run this scenario. This package includes information on new weapons, the Commando Ranger Reconnaissance vehicle, detailed cache contents and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
