			<description>Laboratory Syntesis! A team of researchers working on the study of new proteins. But a procedural error caused the Genetic Material discarded, were free to recombination with some types of dangerous viruses. Now, besides the study, researchers also must deal with the activation of these viruses and learn undoing the consequences of these activations, which may directly affect all searches. And in this context that best take advantage of the situation, the winner is ...&lt;br/&gt; In Syntesis, players will have to create one or more proteins. To do this you have to create a correct sequence of amino acids that determine each protein. For this, Nitrogen Bases Adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine must be placed in proper sequence. But watch out, because viruses can be activated, which may interfere with the search for all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
