			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Police Procedural RPG for one person&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a US Marshal, Federal Agent, former spy, crime scene investigator, or local police officer. You have been recently transferred/blacklisted/assigned to a new unit and assigned a new partner or reconnected with an old friend. You are feeling out your role in the new world you find yourself in. Your goal is to serve the public trust, to protect the innocent, and to uphold the law, as much as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need are these rules, a deck of cards, and an imagination. It also helps if you like police procedurals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
