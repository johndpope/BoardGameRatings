							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Family Matters</name>
									
			<description>To play Family Matters (MSRP $24.99, for 2-6 players ages 7 and up) family members and/or good friends each select a colored peg and take a seat (by placing it) in the family car. Each player takes turns driving it through the town, responding to a host of funny, thought-provoking card and Playbook-based questions. Once everybody has driven, the car races toward the finish line (Weekend Wish) to see whose idea of family fun will soon come true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family Matters&amp;trade; invites players aged 7+ to share stories, discover trivia, do funny things and creatively explore 140 make-believe, location-based issues (&amp;quot;Fake Family Crises&amp;quot;) from totally new perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herding your family into a single room is hard. Convincing them to talk plainly and calmly about personal or emotionally charged topics is next to impossible. As communication, or a lack thereof, has such serious consequences, effectively addressing this kind of stuff - sooner NOT later - matters a lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If only there was a way to playfully facilitate self-expression and encourage collaborative conversation...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter Family Matters, the game parents will wish their family played when they were kids. And if you&amp;rsquo;re a kid, you&amp;rsquo;ll be glad yours did. &lt;br/&gt;Game Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players pile into the family car, taking turns driving through town, responding to questions and/or tasks along the way. Once everyone has driven, the car races toward the finish line (Weekend Wish) to see whose idea of family fun will soon come true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Start Guide:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Players each write down their &amp;quot;Weekend wish&amp;quot; on Page 10 of the Playbook&lt;br/&gt;2. Players select a peg and place it into the car by age - youngest first, please. &lt;br/&gt;3. The driver parks the car at anyone one of the four possible starting points. &lt;br/&gt;4. The driver rolls the cube to start the car and move it forward. &lt;br/&gt;5. The driver does whatever the space suggests: (i) read/respond to a card that matches the space, (ii) move from one &amp;quot;Black Hole&amp;quot; to another or (iii) resolve, with other passengers, a location based Fake Family Crisis (found on pages 14-41 in the Playbook)&lt;br/&gt;6. See page 6 of the Playbook for instruction on how to resolve a Fake Family Crisis.&lt;br/&gt;7. Only after resolving a Fake Family Crisis is it time to change drivers (and car seats). &lt;br/&gt;8. Once all players have driven, reach takes a turn rolling toward the board's center. &lt;br/&gt;9. The first player to land upon the Weekend Wish space &amp;quot;wins&amp;quot; the game. &lt;br/&gt;10. The entire family must grant the winning player's Weekend Wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
