			<description>Quink is played using five pieces each of five different colors on a 7x7 board. At the start of the game the pieces are arranged in cross formations on specific board spaces, with each cross containing one piece of each color and the center of each cross being a different color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A move consists of a player moving a piece orthogonally any number of empty spaces. There are five special spaces which when landed on let the player make another move with the same piece or a piece of the same color, counting it as part of the same move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to get the five pieces of each color in a connected group. The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle or by multiple players; the designer suggests playing with two by trading off setting up boards for the opponent (the goal being to solve the opponent's puzzle in fewer moves than they solve yours), or any number by each trying to solve the same puzzle in the fewest moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
