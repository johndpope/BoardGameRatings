							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paradox Basic Rulebook (Faight Industries) Version 3</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Paradox Basic Rulebook, Version 3, is published in &amp;quot;tablet&amp;quot; format with smaller pages which partially explains the more-than-double page count from the previous version.  It retains the same six-chapter organization and most of the text from the previous edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character generation includes the selection of a Profession (class), then to Boons and Banes (advantages and disadvantages).  Characters generate Attributes, which have been reduced to fifteen, still places into three groups:  Physical, Mental, and Spiritual.  Finally, Skills are selected and assigned a Level.  There are two character creation mechanisms--a Basic Method, which follows a prescribed pathway, and a general free-form method which is for experienced players.  Character generation software is provided for players who wish to use it instead of performing a hand-build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
