			<description>Disney's Kim Possible: What's the Switch? was released in North America on October 19, 2006, in Europe on November 17, 2006, and in Australia on February 15, 2007. It is the first Kim Possible game to appear on a home console, as all the other Kim Possible games were designed for hand-held systems. The subtitle is a pun on one of Kim's catchphrases. It is also the first to feature voice acting, all the actors voice their characters. The game was featured in a demo on Official Playstation Magazine's demo disc issue 111. Both Kim and Shego are playable characters. In each stage, control is relayed between the two of them as they chase Dementor and Monkey Fist around the world. Rufus is also playable at certain points in the game, but only when playing with Kim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teen heroine Kim Possible and sidekick Ron Stoppable arrive at Monkey Fist's castle to stop villains Dr. Drakken and Shego from stealing a magical Monkey Idol. However, when the two teams fight over the Idol, Ron and Drakken get their minds switched with each other's bodies. Before Kim or Shego can do anything, Professor Dementor appears and steals the Idol himself. Realizing that she needs the Idol to switch Ron and Drakken back to normal, Kim takes off in pursuit, unaware that Shego is also on the trail. As a result, the two girl's paths cross continuously, ultimately forcing the two rivals to team up and stop Dementor, who has partnered with Monkey Fist in an all-new scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Kim Possible (video game series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
