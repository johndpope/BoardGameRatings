							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chaos Gods Come to Meatlandia</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you always wanted to play a Bard but hate that they've been weak for so long, this book is for you. Compatible with all OSR systems, the  world of Meatlandia is bloody and horrific and just a little silly. It resembles Stuart Gordon's Reanimator more than H.P. Lovecraft's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 New City: Meatlandia, which is ruled by the Meat Lord and his juicy meat magic. The city seethes with intrigue as the stalwart Rust Lord and his warriors, the hidden assassins of Death's Hand, and the all too friendly cultists of Our Lady of Sorrows all vie for control of Meatlandia. None of them are truly prepared for the great worms that swim up from the bowels of the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 New Classes: Meet the disgusting Carnomancer, the fourth wall breaking Chaos DJ, the charming Raconteur, the spider-headed Kaldane, and the reality altering Nexus Bard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;42 New Spells: Carnomancers use buckets of blood and metric shittons of meat and as they grow in power they risk transformation into hideous worms themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are new monsters, nutritional supplements, magical meat items, hidden catacombs, lots of maps, and five game seeds to get you started playing right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanics in this book are unbalanced, ridiculous, and overpowered. Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
