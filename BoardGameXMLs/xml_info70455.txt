			<description>Nya lexikon is a Swedish card game for small children, similar to Scrabble Card Game, but much older. The game consists of 64 cards. One of the cards is a wild card, all the others have a letter and a score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with 10 cards. Each turn, a player takes a card and then either plays a complete word, adds to an existing word, or replaces one letter in an existing word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player runs out of cards, all the others sum the scores of their remaining cards. Players reaching 100 points are out of the game; the last player in the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
