			<description>Baseball-themed collectible card game using cards representing actual major league baseball players.  From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is considered the hardest thing to do in all of sports.  A pitched fastball will arrive at the plate in four-tenths of a second.  A batter has two-tenths of a second to decide if he wants to attempt to hit the ball.  The ball is over the plate for less than twenty-thousandths of a second.  For a batter to make contact and put the ball in play is a skill beyond reason.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now imagine trying to hit that ball.  In a real game...with the ball changing locations...with the crowd screaming in your ear...with the winning run on second...in the bottom of the 9th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Top of the Order is an interactive card game in which players match their baseball teams against each other in a game that is as close to the real thing as you can get without stepping into the batter's box.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
