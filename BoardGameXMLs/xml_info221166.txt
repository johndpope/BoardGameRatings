							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Test of Honour: The Samurai Miniatures Game â€“ Masked Men</name>
									
			<description>Warrior Monk Masahiro has vowed to fight the injustices of the Japanese clans. He and his followers battle the power of the samurai, taking the armoured face-plates of their fallen enemies as badges of victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stealing face-plates idea has no historical grounding, but we thought it was a cool idea that might well have happened. Perhaps more importantly it demonstrates what a different look you can create by changing the heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior Monks meanwhile are an established part of the history of the period and had many conflicts with the ruling samurai clans. Like the other new metal character models Masahiro has his own character card (costing an extra point or two to recruit), or you can simply use one of the standard samurai cards (yes, even though monks weren&amp;rsquo;t samurai!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
