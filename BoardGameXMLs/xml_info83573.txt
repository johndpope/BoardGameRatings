							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gangs of Freeport</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a time, the thieves of Freeport were a scourge the likes of which the worst pirates could only envy. They were dangerous. They were organized. They were smart. For years, a powerful thieves guild thrived in the city of adventure, growing ever richer as the honest citizens --- well, honester citizens --- suffered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a century gone by that the Sea Lord Marquetta engaged the guild in the so-called Back Alley War, breaking their back and scattering them to the four winds... or the gibbet. The gangs that plague Freeport today are a pale shadow of the guild that was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men and women of great vision and limited morality have often attempted to rebuild the guild, to unite the gangs into a new great power. All have failed. Any attempt to forge the gangs into a force to match the guild of old is doomed to failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's the funny thing about Freeport, though. The city's come a long way, and &amp;quot;doomed&amp;quot; just isn't what it used to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Gangs of Freeport, the PCs find themselves swept up in events as a mysterious power, making use of techniques both mystical and malign, shows signs of succeeding where others failed. The various gangs of the city work together, and the Sea Lord's Guard proves helpless to stem the rising tide of crime. Only through keen observation, determined investigation, and the judicious use of bloody violence can the characters uncover an old evil behind the threat, and take steps to put it down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gangs of Freeport is an adventure for four characters of 5th to 7th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
