							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wildebeest Chess</name>
									
			<description>Wildebeest Chess is a large chess variant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chess variant attempts to bring balance between leapers and riders in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a board of ten rows and eleven columns. Each player has eleven pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, two camels, one queen, one wildebeest, and one king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A camel has an extended knight jump: it goes one square in one direction and three in the other. Camels may jump (like knights) over occupied squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wildebeest has the combined moves of a camel and knight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
