			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure module, part of the Adventure Anthologies series, is for use with the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game rules, and is intended for 3-6 characters of levels 2-5. If you don't have the Basic Fantasy RPG core rules, please visit &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.basicfantasy.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.basicfantasy.org&lt;/a&gt; and download a free copy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ages ago, when the village near the marsh was settled (on order of the king, being all villagers were disgraced and exiled refugees), a family of Magic Users known as the Wrenwalds served as the settlement&amp;rsquo;s overlords. The Wrenwalds weren&amp;rsquo;t particularly good or kind, but they did protect the villagers from the ravages of the marsh&amp;rsquo;s beasts, and as long as the heavy and oppressive taxes rolled in, nobody died from Magic Missile. One day in the reign of Lord Justin Wrenwald III however, this all came to an end. One night while the family reveled with friends, the Swamp Witch Julieann demanded entrance as an honored guest. Seeing the ugly Hag (and fearing not the stories of her horrible power) the lord laughed in her face and ordered her put off the grounds. For this insult the Swamp Hag cursed the family, and horrible magics rose from Dark Realms. Many simply died; others transformed into living death, and the very estate itself took on the taint of Evil. A few villagers who served on the grounds escaped to the village to tell the awful tale, and since that night the villagers have avoided the grounds like the plague. It is said the ghosts of the dead still haunt the grounds, and the sounds of life can be heard from within, but that if anyone goes there, they never return. The current governor has done nothing to alleviate the people&amp;rsquo;s fear of the old ruin, and has decreed that anyone going to the ruins and not returning shall be deemed a suicide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
