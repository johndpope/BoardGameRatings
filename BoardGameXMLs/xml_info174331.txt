			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In Suitcase Scramble, Paddington must go through the Brown's house to fill his suitcase so he can accompany Mr. Gruber on an exciting trip to France!  You must make sure he packs all of his useful items. . .  Paddington has to be quick because Mr. Gruber is in a big hurry.  Be careful that he doesn't lose any of his items while he packs.  The first player to fill Paddington's suitcase with all 10 items wins the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has flat cardboard suitcase marked with ten items Paddington must pack in his suitcase. On their turn, they spin a spinner and move along a track. Each space is marked one of Paddington's ten items. If they need it, they may take a marker with the that item and cover its space on their suitcase. Some spaces allow the player to take a marker of their choice. Players circle the track until they have collected all their items. The first player to fill their suitcase and reach the &amp;quot;bon voyage&amp;quot; space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
