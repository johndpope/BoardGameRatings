			<description>From pagat.com:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vira is a Swedish three-handed plain trick game using an ordinary 52-card pack. Each player is dealt 13 cards and the undealt stock of 13 cards can be used by the players to improve their hands. Bidding determines who plays alone against the other two. There is a large range of contracts, involving various ways of using the stock and various possible objectives for the lone player, the aim being either to take at least a certain number of tricks or to lose all the tricks. Contracts to lose every trick are called mis&amp;auml;r contracts, from the French mis&amp;egrave;re (misery).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there are four players at the table, then the player to the dealer's right is dealt no cards and takes no part in the play of that hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
