			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have always sacrificed a little of your hard-won gold to Ylsenor, the god of the rogues. In return, you have enjoyed more than your fair share of good fortune. Today, just as you think your luck has finally run out, your deity snatches you from death's jaws, but now you are expected to entertain the great Dissembler. Take on his challenge, and prove his faith in you is well founded, and the rewards may be great. Fail him, and you may never have the opportunity to pay homage to him again...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapscallion is a solitaire Adventure module for play with Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls. Any Rogue character of 1st to 3rd level may explore its 142 adventure paragraphs. It has been written with the 7th/7.5th Edition of the Rule Book in mind, though it will adapt to earlier Editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
