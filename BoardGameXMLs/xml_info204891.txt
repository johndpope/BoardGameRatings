							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Sunken City</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sunken City is a perfect environment for your underwater adventures. It shows a great city where most of the buildings are crumbling ruins, only some of them survived to the fury of the elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scattered through the city there are massive skeletons of sea monsters, sunken ships and monoliths dedicated to long-forgotten gods. The roads and the streets are barely visible in the greenish and murky surface of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This colorprint features four 8.5x11&amp;quot; maps that should be joined to form the whole city in a gorgeous 17x22&amp;quot; map. A special layer called &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; has been added to this product, it can be toggled to show the city as it would appear to a sailing ship on the surface of the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
