			<description>From the Publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computerama is a wacky family computer board game for two to six players, ages 8 to adult. This game combines many exciting features of other well known, and successful games all into one fun-filled event. Is it a Poker game? A Bingo game? Or a Word game? Yes, yes and yes! It&amp;rsquo;s all those and so much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt Computerama Cards to start the game. The first player to finish their three cards and get to the Finish space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful of the many challenges that can confront you during this game. Don&amp;rsquo;t get caught between a &amp;ldquo;Rock, Paper, and Scissors.&amp;rdquo; Also always know when to &amp;ldquo;TIC, TAC, or TOE.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt; </description>
