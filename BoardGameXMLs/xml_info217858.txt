							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeon Delver Enhancer</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do your player characters ever seem less like heroes, and more like cardboard cutouts? Do your campaign&amp;rsquo;s nefarious arch-villains fail to inspire fear, or even interest? Do you need help with your next story hook or adventure campaign, creating compelling protagonists and enemies that your players or readers will never forget? Look no further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DUNGEON DELVER ENHANCER is specifically designed to enrich every aspect of character design, turning stereotypes into unique and engaging personas. You can design thousands or even millions of characters with this system, and no two will ever be alike. Best of all, with repeated use you can create fully detailed individuals ready for role-playing or story-telling in just 15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elaborate systems in this book are both isolated and interlocked, which means that you can use all of them without creating internal conflicts. Or, you can pick and choose the systems that help you the most, turning your least favorite aspects of character creation into the most enjoyable ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vast array of character customization systems featured in this book includes: given names; family names; nicknames and epithets; sub-class themes and alternate level titles; alternate names for multi-class combinations; attribute descriptors; initial spell repertoires; spell caster themes; racial lore for demi-humans; Useful Secondary Skills; handedness determination; bardic sub-themes; specialized thieving talents; fighting styles and weapon preferences; known languages; background themes; racial clan ancestry; famous ancestors; blazons and coats of arms; Social Standing; starting wealth; druidic clan backgrounds and spirit companions; enchanted familiars; and barbarian and orcish tribal themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also includes full systems for determination of appearance, eye color, hair color, skin color, unusual physical traits, and hundreds of different personality quirks and behaviors. A bonus system even allows you to create tens of thousands of names for parties, fellowships and mercenary companies, with just two quick die rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
