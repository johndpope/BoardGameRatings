			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequel to the best-selling &amp;quot;Temple of Apshai,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Hellfire Warrior&amp;quot; gives you the challenge of more command options and more detail than you've ever imagined!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four new levels with sixty rooms each will test the character of the most experienced, the most intuitive, the most intelligent adventurer. On Level 5, you'll have to outwit giant insects to stay alive. On Level 6, you'll discover that it's as much a puzzle to solve as a dunjon to explore--because the only exit is hidden somewhere within the complicated labyrinth. On Level 7, you're constantly trying to escape from skeletons, ghouls, mummies, and even invisible ghosts. But the culmination of your adventure is on Level 8, an underworld haunted by lost souls, guarded by dragons, riddled with bottomless pits and blasts of hellfire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of your journey is to rescue the warrior maid Brynhild, to bring her back to sun and air, to break the spell that binds her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is your alter ego strong enough to overcome the legions of the lost? To slay the nine-headed pyrohydra? To kill the great bat-winged demon? To cross bridges of flame, endure soul-numbing cold--to face death and live? Only you can answer those questions, because only you can know!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all is not lost, because &amp;quot;Hellfire Warrior&amp;quot; includes an Armory where you'll bargain for 5 kinds of swords, 5 types of armor, shields in 2 sizes, for bows and arrows. You can visit the Apothecary and buy healing salves, 13 potions available by the vial or draught. You can enter the Magic Shoppe and turn ordinary weapons into enchanted ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember, the bargaining is up to you. You must determine what you need to destroy the monsters. You must discern what potions will help you reach the end of your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To say that the challenges are great in &amp;quot;Hellfire Warrior&amp;quot; is the ultimate in understatement!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Graphics! Computer-generated map! (Apple uses high-resolution &amp;amp; color!)&lt;br/&gt;     Real time!&lt;br/&gt;     A fantasy role-playing experience!&lt;br/&gt;     For ages 10 through adult&lt;br/&gt;     Complexity: Intermediate&lt;br/&gt;     Playing time: 30 minutes to forever!&lt;br/&gt;     For one player &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
