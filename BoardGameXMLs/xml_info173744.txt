							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superhero Subplots #1</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the scenario, the ongoing quest, provides the meat in any campaign, a good Gamemaster needs more ingredients to add substance to the adventure, she occasionally needs to spice up slower parts of a gaming session. With that in mind Big Finger Games offers the GM&amp;rsquo;s Cookbook line of pdfs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM&amp;rsquo;S COOKBOOK: Superhero Subplots #1 is designed to provide you with guidelines for developing subplots for your superheroic campaign. A detailed sample subplot is included as well as a 3-page worksheet for developing and tracking subplots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superhero subplots are a staple of comic book storytelling. They are secondary to the main plot but allow a writer or, in the case of a roleplaying game, the GM and player to explore elements of the characters that aren&amp;rsquo;t normally featured. Subplots allow you to put some flesh on the bones of a hero, adding some dimension to the character&amp;rsquo;s personality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
