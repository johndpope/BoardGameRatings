			<description>This is a mod for the cardgame Illiad which is originally based on the Trojan war between the Greek states and Troy over Helen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes have been made to convert the game into the 7 states of late ZhanGuo (Warring States) period of China ca. 4th-3rd century B.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distinctive elements of late Warring States warfare have been incorporated into the game, whilst trying to stay within the original spirit of the Illiad gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State Banners (Heroes)&lt;br/&gt;1.  Zhao&lt;br/&gt;2.  Wei&lt;br/&gt;3.  Han&lt;br/&gt;4.  Yan&lt;br/&gt;5.  Chu&lt;br/&gt;6.  Qi&lt;br/&gt;7.

Only the missile infantry of the first 2 rows of the &amp;quot;missile-formation&amp;quot; can attack. Units killed within the formation are removed and the formation is reassembled downward. Cavalry and Chariots can be attacked by missile troops in &amp;quot;missile-formation&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've also bumped the game up to a 7 player game to match the 7 warring states. The 7 banners of the 7 warring states now replaces the 6 heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've increased some of the unit numbers and decreased others to enable the additional 7th player, to take into account the new crossbowmen, as well as to rebalance the game towards a slightly higher emphasis on missile troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gorgon is now 7th Month Hungry Ghost Festival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanatos is now Zhan Shen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helen is replaced by the Mandate of Heaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City/Tireme replaced by the duality of Civil/Military City/Fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agamemnon, Athena &amp;amp; Poseidon have been replaced by Bian (Tablets),a Bamboo Bian, a Stone Bian (for Civil City) &amp;amp; a Bronze Bian (for Martial Fortress) respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chariots are now split into lower value Cavalry &amp;amp; higher value Chariots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trojan Horse is now a Yunti Che.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elephant is now Chao Che.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harrows are now Crossbow Traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All other units remain basically the same except labeled in their Chinese equivalent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go here for more info: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.act.com.sg/zhanguo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.act.com.sg/zhanguo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
