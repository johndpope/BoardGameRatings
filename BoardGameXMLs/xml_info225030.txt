			<description>Duplicitous is a light, simple, bluffing game of truth and deception for 2-players that plays in 5 minutes and uses only 9-cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 1 card and a common deck of 7 cards is setup.  On a turn the start player draws a card and announces the card to be either a colour or number.  Their opponent must determine if they are telling the truth or if they are lying. &lt;br/&gt; The winner collects the card face-up and the process repeats until all 7 cards are played - the player with the most cards at the end of the round is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duplicitous was designed for the The 2017 9-card Nanogame PnP Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
