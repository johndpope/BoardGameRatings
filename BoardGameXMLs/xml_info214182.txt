			<description>Warlock's Journal&lt;br/&gt;Issue 29&lt;br/&gt;September 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winning entry was Carthage, Louisiana &amp;ndash; Gateway to Kisatchie by Michael McNeill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s topic is &amp;ldquo;Right Here in River City.&amp;rdquo; The challenge given was to describe a city on a river, in any genre, in less than 800 words. The locations described range from island fortresses to alien planets to alternate realities. Writers were allowed to submit more than one piece, and a few people chose to do so. Each entry is presented anonymously, however, and listed simply in alphabetical order by title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
