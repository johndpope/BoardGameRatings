			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a continuation of the SoulCalibur series as it is brought over to a handheld gaming device. It remains true to the original concept of the series. The game is still a 3D fighting game, in which two combatants battle one another in large, open arenas. This edition is very similar to SoulCalibur IV, although it removes the Star Wars characters while adding in Kratos from God of War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game features 29 different playable characters. There are five different modes from which the player can choose: Quick Match (drops the player right into a fight), Trials Mode (which pits the player against opponents one after the other until the player is defeated), Versus (ad hoc battle between two players over wireless connection), Training (which allows the player to practice moves against an immobile opponent), and Gauntlet (this main &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; mode of the game ). The game also features the ability to customize existing characters, or to create your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gauntlet mode of the game is the longest portion. It is based on a non-canonical SoulCalibur story in which the player's chosen character follows Hilde around the world in search of medicine for her ailing father. Each encounter in this mode is mission-based and the player must discover the criteria that will allow them to be successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
