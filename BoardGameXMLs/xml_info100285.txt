			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demonmaster is a Quest for the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game. It is a two-part Quest; the first part takes place within the pirate town of Gaxdon, while the second takes place in the wilderness beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For eight days and nights you have been at sea, but your journey is nearing its end, a fact for which you are grateful. A little over a week ago you had learned of attacks on the city of Gaxdon, a place known to be a hotbed of thieves, assassins and pirates. Normally, you would avoid a place like that like the plague, but the rumours of these attacks caught your attention and prompted you to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attacks, so the rumours said, happened every night by a horde of demons under the control of a demonmaster - an insane summoner of demons who, somehow, is able to control them with the force of their will alone. These men and women are extremely dangerous and unpredictable and are a great force of evil in the world, so you made the decision to see if these rumours were true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You set sail from Port Bannon on the White Maiden, a merchant ship with a reputation of trafficking stolen goods. Again, this is not something you would normally do, but most respectable ships avoid Gaxdon. Without much choice, you bought passage onboard the White Maiden and set out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the voyage the crew tell you what they know. Each night the demons attack from outside the walls, assaulting relentlessly until the dawn. They then disappear before reappearing again as soon as the sun is down. The demonmaster is said to be hiding somewhere outside the city walls, but the exact location has not been able to be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the ship sails into the harbour you catch your first glimpse of Gaxdon. It is a rundown, ramshackle town, and you get the impression that you are not going to like it here...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
