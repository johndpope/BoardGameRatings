							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Extraordinary Extras: Arcane Ancestry</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Her blood boiled with the green flame of her fey ancestry as she tapped into the latent magic within. Tiny eldritch lights began to dance around her head like a brilliant cyclone of sparks. Lillith loosed the power that she had gathered, shaping it with her will as it flew. The fiery emerald lance plunged inexorably toward the charging ogre with a shriek like a banshee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are those who are born with the blood of ancient power in their veins, and by exercising their will, can shape and control that power... usually. The following charts and information are intended to add life and depth to a flat or lackluster arcane practitioner in your fantasy world. These features can be randomly generated or they can be used to provide some sparks of inspiration for players and DMs alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be used to enhance any arcane caster including wizards, sorcerers, bards and warlocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
