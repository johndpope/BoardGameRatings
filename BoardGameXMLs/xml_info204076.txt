			<description>This is an unexpectedly thought-provoking game based on a very simple roll-and-move track. The box says it was produced in a limited edition and &amp;quot;Created by a Vietnam Marine&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each move, the player must draw from a deck of 124 cards. Most (82) require the player to ask a question of the player to his left, and if that player answers correctly, that player moves ahead the number of spaces on the card. There also are five &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; cards, which ask &amp;quot;no move or point&amp;quot; questions like, &amp;quot;If you were President, would you throw a lot of parties?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the key to the game is the set of 37 issue cards. These ask questions such as &amp;quot;If you were president, what would be your position on a national health plan?&amp;quot; The player asked has up to 2 minutes to answer, and all players (including the answering one) then vote. If a majority approve, the answering player moves ahead the number of spaces on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the rules are written for 2-4 players, this would probably work better for somewhat larger groups, especially within a classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
