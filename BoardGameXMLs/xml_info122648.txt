			<description>A discussion-based, roll and move board game,with an optional role-playing element. It can be played competitively or with elements of co-operation. Each player starts at home, is born in a different position in life, has certain life-long qualities, and is faced with certain events and choices. The aim is to go home, and the game ends when one or more players have completed the journey and acquired the necessary number of tokens.The game is different each time it is played - depending on the players and the life events that crop up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two journeys:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Through age: by moving through the quadrants of the board representing childhood, youth, prime and vintage, each with a gateway into the next.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;Towards home: by accumulating tokens of particular colours, representing the different strands of home: shelter, family, community, environment and inner peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When one player goes home, s/he is able to help others do so with any extra tokens. At the end of the game, each player may tell the story of his/her character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the book of the same name (formerly The O of Home) by Jennifer Kavanagh. A significant percentage of the profits will be going to a national charity for homeless people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All materials from sustainable sources, or recyclable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
