			<description>30 years ago...civilization as we know it was blasted to smithereens. Later we learned what happened - that it was the rebellion of machines, but back then it was pure chaos. Bombs vanquished cities and factories, architecture and culture, science and social etiquette. In the radioactive pyres, raging pandemics and chemical assaults an immense number of good people lost their lives. Today...the nuclear holocaust marks an end to taxes, school exams and insurance brokers, so there were some perks to all this mess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neuroshima Tactics is a dynamic skirmish wargame with immense tactical possibilities. It's a stealth shooter, with a twisted Mad Max vibe. Sneaking. Shooting. Neuroshima. Are you in? This is a 28mm tabletop based game. The English rulebook is available for free download online. &amp;quot;Tough guys in full battle gear: heavy guns, Kevlar armour and unquenchable thirst for battle. There's no room for wusses among their ranks - they are the strongest regular Squads of the Outpost, a true elite. They carry out the riskiest missions, defend the most important strategical spots, on front-end posts, where the enemy is superior in numbers. Hardened in the heat of battle and very experienced, they are key Outpost unit. They can break the enemy resistance in a flash, and hold the seized zones for indefinite amounts of time. They're great in defense - perfect in attack. They're awesome shooters, and even if they get hit, their sturdy armour and great Constitution allows them to push through more, than anyone else could take.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assault Troopers II, The Outpost. Blister includes: 1 Assault Trooper 3 figure, 1 Assault Trooper 4 figure, 2 bases, 1 dual language location card &amp;amp; 5 counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
