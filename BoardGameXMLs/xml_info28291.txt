							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Principles of War: 19th Century â€“ Army Lists for Africa, India, Asia, the Far East, the Americas and post World War One</name>
									
			<description>[From the inside cover]&lt;br/&gt;These lists are designed to cover warfare around the world from the Napoleonic Wars until the opening of the First World War, with some lists to cover the chaotic period after the war including the Russian Revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within each list, the armies have been sorted by conflict with participants where possible listed together. You will note that each army list has a points value listed against it, all armies do not have the same points values, this is because some conflicts were smaller than others and we did not wish to artificially inflate army sizes just to get a standard points value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
