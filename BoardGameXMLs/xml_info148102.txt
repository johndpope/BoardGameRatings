							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Basilisk Lander</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basilisk Lander is a full-color, 48 x 30 inch, floor plan of a scifi transport shuttle, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Card version contains eighteen, double-sided card tiles. Each over-sized tile is 8&amp;rdquo;x10&amp;rdquo; and printed on sturdy 12 point card stock. The UV coating on the tiles keeps them spill resistant, lets you peel transparent tape on and off them without damaging the tile, and allows you to mark the tiles with dry wipe markers then wipe them clean. As you can see in the images below, the card version has the square grid overlay on one side and the hex grid overlay on the other side. We recommend getting the Zip File combo as well (or at least download the PDF Preview) so you can see how the tiles all lay out. The full layout map is not included with the printed card pages to reduce their cost to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Help! This is Basilisk Lander. We are being attacked from within by escaped prisoners and need immediate assistance...&amp;rdquo; [Transmission ends abruptly]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basilisk Lander is a large multiple room map of the inside of the shuttle with the surrounding hull. The rooms inside include the bridge, a passenger room, a cargo room, and two bathrooms. The Basilisk Lander is armed with three major gun turrets and two smaller forward firing weapons. This product includes two 360-degree panoramic views of the passenger and cargo rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basilisk Lander is intended for use in near or far future science games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basilisk Lander makes an excellent shuttle for moving people and goods between two nearby celestial bodies. For example, the Basilisk Lander would make an excellent moonbus between the Earth and the Moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cryogenic chambers in the cargo hold are used for prisoner transport. In one scenario, the cryogenic chambers malfunction, thawing out the prisoners. The prisoners awaken, knocking out any guards in the cargo room, and then start taking hostages in the passenger section of the ship. The communications officer of the ship calls for help just before the prisoners breach the bridge door. The Player Characters could be space marines, mercenaries, planetary security, or just happen to be in the sector to get the distress call.  Once the prisoners take the bridge, they have access to the ship&amp;rsquo;s weapons. The Player Characters need to figure out a way to sneak towards the ship to board it without being detected. If they fail and are detected, they will have to deal with the ship&amp;rsquo;s gun turrets either taking out the guns or the power to the ship&amp;rsquo;s weapons. The prisoners might start killing hostages if they think a rescue is being attempted as well. Can the Player Characters save the hostages and the shuttle from the prisoners?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
