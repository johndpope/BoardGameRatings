			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical Hits is a series of fantasy encounters created to be dropped into an existing campaign or played as a single evening's entertainment. This popular range of products provides DM and player alike with unusual and interesting, sometimes comical but always memorable encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A Rat by the Tale, the party are hired to rid a town of its fearful rodent problem and find the town's missing rat catcher, Ben Twostacks. Can they find the errant civic worker, and return him to his employers, or will the smelly fellow convince them that he and the town have been wrongly treated by the council? Or is there a darker fate awaiting the party in the sewers below?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
