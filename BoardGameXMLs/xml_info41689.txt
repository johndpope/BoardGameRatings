			<description>Placement rules are just like Blokus. Every new piece must touch your existing piece diagonally, and diagonally only. They can touch, or not touch, opponent piece in any manner as long as there are no overlaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player gets the two L pieces, the other the T and the S. Again, like in Blokus, players start from opposite corners. However, unlike Blokus, once a player has placed his two pieces down, he will replace the piece that was not the one last played. The replaced piece must be moved into a different position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring occurs as follows. For every square of any opponent piece that the newly replaced piece touches, the player scores one point. (For example, if the green player just played the T, he scores two points.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player has reached 40 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
