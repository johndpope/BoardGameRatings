							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Rulebook (First Edition)</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">Holmes Edition</name>
									
			<description>Page two preface: This book is based upon the original work published in 1974 and three supplementary booklets published in the two year period after the initial release of DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS. It is aimed solely at introducing the reader to the concepts of fantasy role playing and the basic play of this game. To this end it limits itself to basics. The rules contained herein allow only for the first three levels of player progression, and instructions for the game referee, the &amp;quot;Dungeon Master,&amp;quot; are kept to the minimum necessary to allow him to conduct basic games. This is absolutely necessary because the game is completely open-ended, is subject to modification, expansion, and interpretation according to the desires of the group participating, and is in general not bounded by the conventional limitations of other types of games. This work is far more detailed and more easily understood than were the original booklets nonetheless, for with it, and the other basic components of the game, any intelligent and imaginative person can speedily understand and play DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS as it was meant to be played. Players who desire to go beyond the basic game are directed to the ADVANCED DUNGEON &amp;amp; DRAGON books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
