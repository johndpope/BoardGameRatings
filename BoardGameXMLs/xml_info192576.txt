							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Adequate Commoner</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adequate Commoner for the Pathfinder RPG presents a new perspective on what is probably the most overlooked character in any game: the Commoner NPC class. Now commoners can be more than just faces in a crowd and cannon fodder. They can be the player characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adequate Commoner puts several new twists on these (traditionally) non-player characters, providing new ways to use them to infuse new life into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to play a commoner with lofty goals? Try out the Gear Commoner or Mythic Commoner. We&amp;rsquo;ve also tossed in some Commoner Jobs to better customize your character with new options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interested in New Commoner Feats and New Commoner Traits? Well, those are here too, as well as ways to use creative feat combinations towards creating an effective fighting style. And what would these fighting styles be without a selection of Commoner Weapons?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even a superior commoner is not likely to survive a life of adventure for long without some help. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;ve provided an arsenal of New Tools, Consumables, and Ammunition, as well as New Magic Items and New Alchemical Items of particular interest to such an aspiring hero. And if that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to not just keep your commoner alive, but bring them victory, how about checking out the new concept of Improvised Traps?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rounding out such goodies are tactics and suggestions for running a commoner character game, as well as Cooks&amp;rsquo; Day Out, a beginning adventure for commoner characters just hoping to survive the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;hellip; and there&amp;rsquo;s more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, if you&amp;rsquo;re bored with the exceptional and fed-up with the extraordinary, how about giving the mundane a try?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We promise, your commoners will never seem common again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
