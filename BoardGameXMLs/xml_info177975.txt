			<description>Smic Smac, Collect the food cards to feed your hedgehog so they can sleep. Card game for 2-4 players. Includes 64 playing cards. Comes in a box with magnetic snap closure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, turn over the food cards.  If there are more hedgehogs awake than those drawn on the food cards, you may collect it.  You may choose to hibernate your hedgehogs on your turn because when the 4 winter cards in the food cards open, the game ends and anyone with hedgehogs awake will lose!  The player at that time with the most food will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
