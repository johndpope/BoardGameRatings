							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tymor</name>
									
			<description>Tymor is a fast-paced, easy-to-learn, and highly replayable fantasy strategy game for 2-4 players. Set in a compelling world struggling to recover from a legendary apocalypse, it features a modular map that changes every game, an innovative season mechanic, and three ways to score victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Tymor is to excel in three categories of leadership: Kingdom building, trade, and battle. Throughout the game, players will dispatch their Priests to build and upgrade Settlements, their Merchants to trade in other players' lands, and their Soldiers to claim and defend territory. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is crowned King or Queen of Tymor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tymor's unique season mechanic not only determines the productivity of the players' territory, but their odds of success in battle as well. To prevail in Tymor, you must anticipate the chaotic seasons, outwit your rivals, and build a new kingdom of legend, just as the long dark of the world seems to be lifting at last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
