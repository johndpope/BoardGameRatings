			<description>Jingoistic card game. The box exhorts &amp;quot;Buy Empire Goods from Home and Overseas&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;Players must collect sets of cards belonging to one country. These sets are irregular, some may include 5 cards, others only 2 cards, and so on. In addition, each country has a Key Card and until you get this card into your hand, you do not known how many cards make up the set.&lt;br/&gt;An alternative game is also described in the rules. One player is elected President (this is an honoury task because the President is a non-playing participant). The President keeps all the Key Cards and then shuffles and deals out the remaining cards. Step 3 in the rules for this game has a printing error; it says 6 countries are distributed to the players when it is meant to say '6 counters'. In a turn, a player may ask each player in turn, for a card from a certain country. If someone offers an incorrect card, that player has to add a counter to the Pool. If a correct card is offered, that player takes a counter from the Pool. When all the sets have been collected, the winner is the one with the most counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
