			<description>If only&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone has something about their past they desperately wish they could change. A terrible loss, that missed opportunity, the greatest of mistakes. If only you had known that that one tiny detail would make all the difference. If only you could do it again, everything would be different now. But if you WERE given the chance to rewrite history, would be brave enough to take it? Could you face the unknown and its unforeseen consequences? Could you fight fate to create the Perfect Moment?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Perfect Moment, players are racing to rewrite history in their favor using a deck of only 18 cards. Players will use equipment, exploit paradoxes in the time-space continuum and author their own revision of the past. Featuring a clever multi-sided card system, every card is used by both players based on what they can see. Equipping that card for yourself may just give your opponent the ability they were looking for. Every turn players will activate up to revealed two cards which each have special effects.  After the effects are resolved, the player can optionally score a card to earn up to 3 points depending on how closely they match it.  The first player to 16 points wins.  It will take careful planning and a bit of luck to avoid failing like you have so many times before. This time will be different&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
