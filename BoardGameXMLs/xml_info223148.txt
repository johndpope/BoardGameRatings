			<description>This game can be played in 4 different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.The players have to get their 2 figures to the center of the game board. Movement is determined by a die. If a figure reaches or overtakes an opponent figure, this figure loses it's hat and can't move until the player rolls a 6. At the marked spaces the figures of the same color advance to an inner circle. The colored spaces between circles are safe spaces. The figures may stop there, even if they rolled more than is required to reach that space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The players have to build their figures by rolling a die for the parts they need to assemble their figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. This is a combination of game 1 and 2. The players have to assemble their figures before they may enter the boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The game is played as a pachisi variant with 2 meeples per player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
