							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Collusion</name>
									
			<description>Collusion is a mobile-enhanced board game that mandates lying, stealing, cheating, and murdering in order to win. Players must work together while simultaneously plotting against each other in order to gain influence over the region. Selling out an ally to an enemy, blackmailing an opponent, or paying another agent to carry out an assassination on your behalf is all in a day's work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as a Spy Master from one of several agencies. Your goal is to maximize your influence over the region at the expense of the other agencies. How you go about that is not important to your superiors - just don&amp;rsquo;t get exposed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using your advanced espionage device (your phone) you can secretly send messages to other players, hack into their devices, disrupt their gameplay, order assassinations on the black market. While an AI adapts the gameplay based on in-game allegiances, the cards in each player's hands and their current missions. All while managing your agents on the board to carry out your secret objectives and obtain intel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
