			<description>From the Alpha PDF introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BE WARNED! The versions of events and the racial, corporate, and government background I offer are not the versions you learned in school or were told by your parents. It is in these sections that I have buried the truth between lines of accepted and sanitized knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wish you luck on your future endeavors and remember that it is in your best interest to act like you never read this information. To pretend you never learned some of the secrets contained within while you interact with the galaxy at large; while you sail through this Sea of Stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
