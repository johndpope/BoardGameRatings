			<description>Yukk! is a dinner simulation.  The parents have prepared a variety of &amp;quot;yucky&amp;quot; foods and the players are competing to see who can clear their plate first.  The mechanics are somewhat deterministic, and the game seems better suited to younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game play involves discarding a food card if possible.  If not, the player can play a food card on another person, or play a special card such as &amp;quot;switch plates&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;feed the dog.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
