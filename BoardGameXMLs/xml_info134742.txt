							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Knossos</name>
									
			<description>Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have just been thrown into a dark, stinking pit...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are isolated and alone in the maze at Knossos, Crete. Somewhere, a minotaur is tracking your scent. Can you find the only door without becoming a minotaur's meal?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knossos is a 3-D graphic simulation. Mazes are represented by a perspective view, as though you are actually there. These graphics are not the simple, square graphics you have seen before. An entirely new representation has been implemented &lt;br/&gt;giving a true cave-like quality. And like all Med Systems 3-D graphics, lightening fast screen generation is standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other features include chalk with which to mark the floor for reference points, randomly generated mazes, distance counters for exit, and monster graphics. A typical game might last 15-20 minutes. This is the first truly 3-D arcade game ever &lt;br/&gt;offered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-Game Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE - Escape from the Minotaur's labyrinth beneath the city of Knossos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESCRIPTION - The player is placed at a random point in a 20X20 maze and must find the one wall with a cross on it. Walking into this wall enables the player to leave the labyrinth and escape the minotaur. The only object the player carries is a stub of chalk which may be used to mark the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knossos contains a random maze generator as well as a fixed maze. The fixed maze is recommended for beginners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
