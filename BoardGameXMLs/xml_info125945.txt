			<description>From the publisher:'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is for all the fans of giant robot cartoons and live action shows who want to roleplay those kind of characters, but have found other systems too wargame-like. RoboMACs tries to have more of a dramatic, cinematic flavor to it, and tends to replace hard numbers with general traits and 'hooks.' The rules tend to be tilted more towards combat between humanoid or animalform Robos as opposed to vehicles, since that captures more of the feel of the genre. Vehicle combat rules are presented, but detailed rules for creation of totally nonhumanoid &amp;quot;Robos&amp;quot; (such as starships, bases and non-transforming aircraft) are not part of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
