			<description>Klassekampen is a political game modelled on the classical Monopoly game. Each player represents a political party. Votes replace currency, and players strive for control over political issues instead of shares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanism of the game parallels a traditional Monopoly game. Votes are used to take control over more political issues, which again are used to gain more votes. The aim of the game is to conquer all other players by overtaking all their votes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published by Klassekampen, a Norwegian radical-left newspaper (the term Klassekampen means 'class struggle'). The game is not sold, but is rewarded to readers who helps the paper in getting more subscribers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
