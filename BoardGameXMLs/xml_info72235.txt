			<description>You start the game with 50% health. The object is to get to 100%, but the luring sides of life and the challenges are plentiful and you can easily fall into the pits that will give you lower health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Health game is a good mix of questions, brain trainers and - if you are up for it - physical exercises (can be played without if you choose)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two different categories of cards (questions and exercises) in the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F-cards contain questions about Food, Fitness &amp;amp; Family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W-cards are challenges for your Will, Wit and Well-being. Some of these 'exercises' call for the use of the timer included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more correctly you answer questions and solve your challenges, the healthier you become - at least in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
