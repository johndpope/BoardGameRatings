			<description>Basically a &amp;quot;trouble style&amp;quot; game with cards.  Classic Moves was developed in the early 1990's by Moore and Moore Industries of London, Ontario.  Players begin with 4 marbles in a &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; zone, and they must be moved around the board to the player's &amp;quot;Home Base&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is accomplished with a 56 card deck, with numbers 1-12, and a number of &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a centre &amp;quot;shortcut&amp;quot; that can also be utilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also play with a partner, assisting them once their marbles are &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
