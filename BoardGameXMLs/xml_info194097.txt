			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2013 Mayfair Games conducted a big game and set a world record for the most people playing in the same Catan game at the same time&amp;hellip; 922 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group experience shared by the players and the combined mutual excitement in play resulted in one of the great events in the world of gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mayfair has created this kit to provide players the means to conduct a little or not so little, big game experience for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;Need an ice breaker for parties? Need something for new friends to meet old friends?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catan: The Big Game Event Kit offers the ability to conduct a six player Catan game with a few unique rules. More than 6 friends? Multiple kits can be used to provide play for as many people as you wish to join in the play. Just daisy chain the boards together and add as many friends as you can find. Hundreds of friends? Read the big game how to guide which will walk you through planning your big game event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To provide an economical solution, player wood is replaced by die cut, development and resource cards are replaced by small format cards, and the maps are printed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The big game is the best large scale experience you could have with any game, and Catan is perfectly suited to give you your money&amp;rsquo;s worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
