			<description>Translates roughly to &amp;quot;hiding game&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;off the grid game&amp;quot;: during WW-2 in the Netherlands, people who ran the risk of being deported to Germany regularly went in hiding. Anne Frank obviously being the most well known example. Not just Jews, also men in the prime of their age, eligible for draft to work basically as slaves in the German factories. For instance lots of Dutch soldiers who fought the German invasion were either deported directly as POW right after the war or &amp;quot;arrested&amp;quot; in the years after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the liberation a number of Dutch games were produced, based on events during WW-2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based upon that theme: going into hiding to prevent being caught by the German occupiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
