			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OK, Ace, you survived everything that von Richthofen and the Flying Circus threw at you. Well, that was four long years ago - and yesterday's medals don't pay the rent. But just a minute, here's an ad:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Airmail Pilot wanted . . .&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can almost smell the gasoline as the ground crew fuels your J-4 Jenny biplane to her 26-gallon limit. Precious mail is loaded into the cargo area, tagged for Chicago. The weatherman reports severe icing above 6,000 feet, so you know you have to keep the plane low. It will be a dangerous flight, but you knew that when you took the job. The mail must go through. So, in the tradition of Lindbergh and a hundred unsung heroes, you bravely turn your plane into the wind. The engine roars. Suddenly you're aloft on the first leg of your journey. Dayton's socked in by fog. You change your course for Lucasville. Lightning zigzags the sky. A massive, fast-moving thunderstorm forces you to land in a cornfield. As the weather clears, your plane leaps once more into the sky. But even clear skies can cause problems - violent air currents buffet your fragile wooden aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your fuel is down to two gallons as Lucasville comes into sight. You make it! Refuel and head for Chicago. But you're not out of trouble yet. There's a wind shear at the Chicago airport. You have to land in a shifting crosswind. Can you make it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIRMAIL PILOT from INSTANT SOFTWARE. Unlike any other computer simulation you've ever experienced. Challenging. Difficult. But never impossible. An event in a cassette. Crash or fly, it's so realistic, you can almost feel the wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
