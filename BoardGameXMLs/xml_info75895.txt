			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great Naval Battles is a series of computer games by Strategic Simulations  which simulate combat between naval vessels. It consist of five separate games, four of which depict various phases of World War II. Each game combines a wider view of the action on a fleet scale, as well as controls for individual ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great Naval Battles Vol. III: Fury in the Pacific, 1941-1944 is a direct sequel to #2 and depicts the remainder of the Pacific Ocean war. It was not considered to be as strong a product as the previous two games, as it had some problems with bugs. the game structure was problematic due to some attempts to include air combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
