			<description>This game is mostly about knowledge about animals. There are animal cards with a photo on the front side and the answers to 6 questions (&amp;quot;What's the name?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Where does it live?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What does it eat?&amp;quot;, ...) on the back. (The questions are the same for all cards.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the game contains one board per continent, with 12 numbered fields. Accordingly, there are 12 animal cards per continent in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with several game variants that are similar to other quiz games. Most of the variants given in the official rules however are neither very playable nor very balanced. At least the game comes with plenty of material for making up your own rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the TV documentation series of the same name with Prof.Dr.Dr.h.c. Bernhard Grzimek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
