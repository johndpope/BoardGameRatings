							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Dhasar (New Base Class)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primal power drives many to seek out the secrets of the elemental plans of existence. The Dhasar is one such individual, seeking the means to not only channel such energies but to eventually infuse himself with the very element of his obsession. A spontaneous arcane spell caster, the dhasar learns to call forth creatures native to the plane of his calling as well as eventually becoming infused with the very element he worships. This supplement also includes new feats designed for the dhasar's special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
