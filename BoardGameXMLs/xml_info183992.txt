							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch Recruitment Manual</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you want to add meaning or purpose to your life? Would you like travel the world, or even to other planes of existence? How about extensive training along with a chance for paid college tuition? How does a really cool tattoo sound? You just might be right to join the ranks of the Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch &amp;mdash; better known as Demon Hunters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brotherhood agents fight on behalf of Heaven to battle the forces of Hell. Demon slime-wretches, werebadgers, and promiscuous vampires are all out there, waiting for a righteous smack-down. An evil organization, sponsored by -Satan- Larry, works to kill angels and the forces of good. They are known as the Order of the Infernal Scepter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important part of Brotherhood training is Tabletop Combat Simulations. You and your friends can take part in a Demon Hunters mission from the safety of your home, bar, or yogurt stand. All the rules, characters, and adventure notes are contained in this booklet. Just bring dice, friends, and your imagination! The wisdom and experience gained may one day save your life in the field. Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to consider -sacrificing your life- committing yourself to the Brotherhood, look for the Demon Hunters Role Playing Game &amp;mdash; a resource that allows you unlimited access to tabletop training scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
