			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battlefield Germany is a strategic wargame depicting an invasion of Western Germany by the Warsaw Pact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a traditional strategic world war three game: players take turns moving divisions (infantry and armor, as well as helicopter units) on an hex-based map showing Eastern and Western Germany, Czechoslovakia and the eastern regions of France. Combat is resolved by comparing the opposing units' strengths, players gain Victory Points by occupying cities. The side with the most Victory Points at the end of the chosen number of turns wins. The game also includes the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played against the computer or another player. Unlike some other games in PSS's Wargames Series, Battlefield Germany doesn't include arcade sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
