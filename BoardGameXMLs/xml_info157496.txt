							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume IV</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume I, and its successors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 15 mythic spells, from charm monster to confusion, lesser. With the spells in this book you can create clones of creatures while they are still alive, producing perfect (albeit slightly less powerful) replicas of them that live and breathe. If you prefer to make friends the old-fashioned way, use mythic charm person to take advantage of a creature&amp;rsquo;s friendly attitude towards you to affect a permanent change the mundane way more easily. If information&amp;rsquo;s what you crave, use mythic commune to get more meaningful answers than simple &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;no,&amp;rdquo; and mythic commune with nature not only grants you more insights into the local area, but also lets you direct what kind of information you gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t wait: get your hands on the latest mythic spells now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
