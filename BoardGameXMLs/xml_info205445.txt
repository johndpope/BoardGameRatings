			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The waters that promise eventual doom are also a source of life. The sea supports the fishing fleets and the trading boats that help move goods from the Reaches. The hardy people of the Archipelago build their homes in small communities on the slopes of their islands. They raise their sheep and goats, tend to terraced fields and fish. Some delve into the earth in search of copper, tin, silver and gold. Most villages and certainly every island has a brownsmith toiling in the heat of their foundries and forges to make and repair the bronze tools their people depend on. The brightsmiths crafting silver and gold into fine items and jewelry are far more rare, usually found only on the larger islands and those in the Inner Sea. In these same places you find the luxury of larger towns and even kingdoms! Nobility is a luxury few islands can afford and most communities defer to a counsel of elders or a Wizard in matters of justice or planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is distributed as a series of documents, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 40-page DOCX Island Crashers&lt;br/&gt;- 3-page DOCX Character Generation (example)&lt;br/&gt;- XLSX CharGen 1&lt;br/&gt;- XLSX CharGen 2&lt;br/&gt;- XLSX Island Generation Tables&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
