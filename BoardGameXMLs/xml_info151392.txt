			<description>Hei Su Hong Su is a battle of wits between two opponents, played on an elegantly crafted board framed in genuine cherry or mahogany. Each game includes an authentic Chinese i-ching coin. In Hei Su Hong Su, when tokens are moved off one end of the board, they return on the opposite side. Additionally, unlike other popular strategy games, players are permitted to move neutral and their opponent&amp;rsquo;s tokens as their own. Hei Su Hong Su is truly a unique and intriguing strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hei Su Hong Su, one player is red, other is black. At the start of the game, each player has nine pieces set up in a square in opposite corners on the board, with 18 white pieces occupying the other two corners. Players take turns &amp;ldquo;sliding&amp;rdquo; rows or columns of pieces by removing a piece from an edge and adding it to the other edge. If a player traps a piece by surrounding it with 4 of his color (including &amp;ldquo;wrapping around&amp;rdquo; to the other side of the board), it is replaced with with one of that player's pieces. If a player captures and replaces a white piece, the &amp;ldquo;tug of war&amp;rdquo; marker moves 1 in his favor on the scale. If a player captures and replaces an opponent&amp;rsquo;s piece, the marker moves 2 in his favor on the scale. The game ends when the marker has moved all the way to the end of the scale; that player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
