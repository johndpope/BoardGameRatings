							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Seers: The Old Testament</name>
									
			<description>Seers is a card game themed around Old Testament history. Players are given a hand of cards with various scriptural stories or events on them. One side of each card has just an event name, while the other side contains a Book, Chapter, &amp;amp; Verses for the event, as well as a date of the event. Players will test their knowledge of Biblical history.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns playing a card into a central chronology, choosing where their card sits relative to other cards. Play can be for correct dates relative to other cards, or for chapter and verse. If a card is playeed correctly, it remains in the timeline. If incorrect, the player must draw a new card, and try again next turn. The first player to be rid of all their cards is victorious.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, correctly playing certain cards may trigger special events that alter the board state. Players hands may be swapped. Cards may be removed from the timeline. A player may be forced to attempt a certain card. A variety of special powers are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
