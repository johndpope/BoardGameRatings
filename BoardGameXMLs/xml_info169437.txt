			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A slithering, creeping evil lurks just beyond safety of the light. Indeed, the King of Shadows is up to no good this night, and his beastly minions are getting hungrier by the second. You had better get clicking if you want to live! Can you survive until dawn in this whimsical and spooky nightmare outing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go To Bed: Survive The Night is an eerie &amp;ldquo;bedroom defense&amp;rdquo; game, where you are tasked with helping a young boy stay alive from dusk &amp;rsquo;til dawn as waves of malevolent shadow beings come slithering out from the darkness. Light and darkness play heavily into the game mechanics and power-ups, and you&amp;rsquo;ll spend a lot of time frantically battling unholy beasties before they can get their fangs on the young lad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
