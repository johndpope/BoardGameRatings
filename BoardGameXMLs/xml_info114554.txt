			<description>Spangle is a deduction game for 4-10 players that can be played with a Shibumi set. It uses a 4&amp;times;4 set of stacking spheres in 3 colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are members of a family who are decorating their new house. The winner is the player or players who have succeeded in decorating most of the house with the color of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim: At the end of the game, when the thirtieth ball is placed on top of the pyramid, count the balls left in the sack. The color that has the fewest balls left in the sack is the winning color and any player that chose this color at the beginning of the game wins. In case of a tie between colors, count the number of players that have chosen each color. The winning group is the one that has the fewest members. In case of another tie, both group win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup: Place all 48 balls (16 of each color) in the bag. Each player looks in the bag and chooses one ball of any color he likes, which he keeps hidden at all times. This is the color of his preference and his aim is to use that color as much as possible in the house.  &lt;br/&gt;Find the veto number which will be used throughout the game by dividing the number of players by two, rounded up.&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player plays first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: When a player's turn comes, he points at a legal position to play a ball and proposes a color to place. He is allowed to describe why he thinks this is a good choice. Other players are free to discuss and question the suggestion.&lt;br/&gt;After 1-2 minutes pass, the active player calls for a veto vote. Every player who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want this placement must raise their hand.  If there are enough raised hands to reach the veto number then the placement is cancelled, otherwise the active player searches the bag for the appropriate color and places it in the suggested area. Either way play continues to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legal Plays: If there is no other ball of the same color in the desired level, then you can place the ball anywhere on the level. If there is at least one, then you must necessarily place the ball adjacent to an existing ball, whether horizontally or vertically. If the balls of the desired color are completely cut-off by balls of the other colors, you are free to enter the level again at another point.&lt;br/&gt;To place a ball on the upper levels, you need to place them on top of at least 2 more balls of the chosen color, whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Rules for the same level placement are still applicable&lt;br/&gt;In this game dropping is not allowed. You are only allowed to place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Veto: After a failed suggestion due to vetos, the next vote&amp;rsquo;s veto number is increased by one. That way, it gets harder and harder to stop placing balls. If at least one ball is placed the veto number resets to the starting value&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Etiquette: When searching the bag for a ball of the color of your choice, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t count the remaining balls, just grab the first ball you spot. Scrambling around the bag is forbidden.&lt;br/&gt;It is perfectly legal to hold grudges, intentionally veto the player to your right so you can place a ball with a higher veto number, bluff to mislead other players from guessing your chosen color and use imaginary reasons for why each color looks better at the house.&lt;br/&gt;When the game is over, what&amp;rsquo;s done is done and any grudges should be unmade, just as the pyramid is taken apart.&lt;br/&gt;You can imagine different applications to each level: level 1 could be the carpets, level 2 the walls, level 3 the furniture and level 4 the lighting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
