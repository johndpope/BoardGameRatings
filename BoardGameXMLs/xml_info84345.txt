							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Master Performers: Sourcebook for Bards, Rogues and Assassins</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook presents all kinds of new and unusual types of artists and performers. While many of the prestige classes described therein focus on a character&amp;rsquo;s ability to deliver masterful performances in a variety of arenas &amp;mdash; from reciting poetry and dancing to singing and playing a musical instrument &amp;mdash; some members of these classes use their uncanny abilities to perform as simple guises, while others consider their art to be their sole interest and indeed their only true passion. Using a combination of charm, guile, and a myriad of talents, the members of the fifteen prestige classes presented in this sourcebook are extremely gifted and versatile characters. While Bards, Rogues, and Assassins are naturally more attracted to these prestige classes, anyone who meets the requirements can become a member of any of these classes. Some of these prestige classes, in fact, are especially well suited for characters hailing from other professions, such as warriors and spellcasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
