			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick a shape card and lay it down.  Add another!  Then another!  Take turns adding new shapes until . . . You've made a Silly Body.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules give four different games that you can play with the shape cards:  We Made It Together - a cooperative variant in which the players take turns laying down cards until they both think they've made a silly body; On Our Own - a competitive variant where each players takes 20 or 30 cards and makes as many silly bodies as he or she can; Use 'Em All Up - a competitive variant where each player takes 20 or 30 cards and uses them all to create one incredible silly body; and Jump and Switch where after completing one of competitive variants you switch cards with your opponent and play the game again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shape cards have many different shapes and colors, but are made out of very flimsy cardboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
