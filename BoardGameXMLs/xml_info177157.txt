							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skylanders: Trap Team (Nintendo 3DS)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skylanders: Trap Team for the Nintendo 3DS is the 4th installment of the Skylanders series to be released for the 3DS.  The 3DS versions of Skylanders are considered companion stories to their big brothers on the consoles and PC.  Swap Force for 3DS has its own story and play style. Here are some of the main differences:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A different story about a beloved and bumbling Hugo, assistant to the series resident floating head, Eon. On a trip to the Eternal Archives, Hugo accidentally reads a book titled &amp;quot;The Most Boring Book Ever&amp;quot;. It was called that so people would avoid it, as it is actually a prison for the vile Dream Sheep. Freed from the book, the Dream Sheep uses magic to put all of Skylands into a deep slumber. It's up to the Skylanders to gather three legendary magical bells and wake the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Much stronger emphasis on platforming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Double jumping is possible with all Skylanders (there is no double jumping in the console version).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You can import all your Skylanders into the game via the portal at once and switch between them with the touch screen.  This maximizes portability so you don't have to drag all that plastic out with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     You do not need any trap plastic items to trap villains.  This can be done with no extra plastic pieces on the touch screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Single Player is the only option for the story but you go only and play Skystones (card game) with your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
