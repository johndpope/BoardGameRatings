			<description>Jeux Noir (&amp;quot;Black Games&amp;quot;, working title) is a card game inspired by film noir. It takes the darker end of the noir murder mystery, setting the players up as Private Investigators competing/co-operating (as they desire) to solve a murder.&lt;br/&gt;Working alongside the police, players must uncover all the information they can about the suspect, and eliminate methods and motives for the murder until they have enough information in their hand for the &amp;quot;big reveal&amp;quot;, where they explain to their lesser fellow detectives the full details of the murder, and collect their reward from the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player interaction involves trading of cards, with constant tension about any given move aiding an opponent's victory. But should the players let paranoia get the better of them, they will be forced to collaborate, and even then their lack of cooperation may allow the murderer to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
