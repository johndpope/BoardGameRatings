							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zener</name>
									
			<description>Zener is a 2-player tactical move game inspired by the &amp;quot;Zener cards&amp;quot; used in experiments of extrasensory perception (ESP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 5 pieces with the same symbols as the Zener cards and in your turn must move two different pieces, being a mandatory movement and another free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player, in his first move, must move the piece with the same symbol that his opponent moved last (this is the mandatory movement).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By moving your piece to the same quadrant of your opponent's piece you will block it by limiting your opponent's options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win the game who first cross the board with any piece or block all of your opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
