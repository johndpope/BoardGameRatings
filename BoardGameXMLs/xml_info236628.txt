			<description>A Two-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round One: The Killing Spree&lt;br/&gt;Round Two: All Hallows Eve&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Awaki Valley contains an elven controlled kingdom of elves and humans. Its races had lived in relative harmony for decades, but that has changed recently, and the presence of an elusive serial killer known only as the Will O'Wisp has only agitated the tensions. The killer has committed dozens of murders in and around the valley, including some against politically important targets. The humans blame the elves for their inability to stop the Will O'Wisp, and the elves accuse the humans of secretly supporting the Will O'Wisp, as most of his politically sensitive targets have been elves. What neither group realizes is that the Will O'Wisp himself doesn't care about politics or race relations; he has his own agenda. Something else neither group realizes is that these are not the first Wisp Murders (as they have been called) to occur in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
