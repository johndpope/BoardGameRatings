			<description>&amp;quot;Card game for 2 players. Theme: The US Mogadishu Operation in Somalia on October 3, 1993. One player is the Americans. The other player is the Somalis.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each side uses its own custom deck of cards. Each deck has three suits of cards. There are fifteen cards in each suit, each of which has a force value from 1 to 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a series of card play battles where each side attempts to play cards having the highest Combat Force Total. The American force total is based on the play of Soldier, Weapon, and Tactics Cards. The Somali force total is based on the play of Combatant, Blunder, and Tactics Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;If the Americans win 3 hands in a row, they are able to extract their comrades and escape. The game ends when this happens.&amp;quot; The American player wins if the historical US casualty figure is not exceeded, otherwise the Somali player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
