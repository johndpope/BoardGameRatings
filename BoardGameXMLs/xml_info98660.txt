			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jerome, the second member of the Three People in the Abyss. In devotion to his sister, Jerome gave up his position as the heir of his clan to follow Hel into exile. Like their leader Dead Moon, he is working with the Azur Alliance under the orders of the High Arbiter Aizen. As a born warrior, Jerome has inherited the ancient combat skills of his family and has combined them with the pirate queen personal style, which makes him a particularly deadly foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warrior/Prowler - Dark Azur Alliance - Level 40&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innate Abilities: Infiltration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stealth (Subterfuge, Effect) - Jerome becomes Hidden. Upkeep: 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark of Death (Subterfuge, Attack) - +3 Attack / +3 Damage. This skill can be used only if Jerome is Hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maw of the Leviathan (Subterfuge, Effect) - Target unit inside Jerome's Control Zone loses 1 action point and may not move this turn. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt;Limit: 1 per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hell Wave (Ki, Attack) - -1 Attack. Hell Wave affects all enemy units within 2 inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled. Requires additional Anima Tactics figures to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
