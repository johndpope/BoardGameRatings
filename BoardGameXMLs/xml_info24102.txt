			<description>Action Stations is a World War I naval game, based on the MIGHTY HOOD/BATTLESHIPS AT WAR system. Includes the rulebook, reference cards, game markers, and 136 individually-rated color ship counters (on heavy stock) from British, German, French, Italian, Austrian navies. The standard game includes additional rules modules (and ships/counter) for merchants, armed merchants, and destroyers. The 76 merchants and destroyers are printed in black on color cardstock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are very similar to the MIGHTY HOOD/BATTLESHIPS AT WAR WW2 rules, with some modifications for WWI combat and formations. The several scenarios include Jutland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a DTP game: you'll need to mount and cut apart the counters before play. Additional ships (Russians, more CL and B from the countries in the main rules) will be made available later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
