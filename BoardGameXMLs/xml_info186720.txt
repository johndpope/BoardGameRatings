			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the system begin with a character concept, background, and description.  Characters have four Attributes: Body, Quickness, Mental, and Virtue, with a Rating of 1-20 with 4 being an average human and 10 being a human maximum.  Characters also have a variety of derived scores, most involving combat performance.  Skills are purchased from a point pool derived from Attributes.  Each Skill has a Level running from 1-10; the system enumerates sixteen skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All actions are resolved by the GM setting a Difficulty Score.  Any Attribute or Skill bonuses, or situational bonuses are penalties, are added/subtracted from the Difficult Score--the die roll never is modified.  The character then rolls 1d20 and attempts to &amp;quot;roll under&amp;quot; the Difficulty Score.  A roll of 1 always means success; 20 always means failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
