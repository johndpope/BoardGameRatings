They will pay a mean price on their own turf, from the plains of the high desert, to the swamps of the bayou, to the east Asian mountains, down to the depths of the undead underworld. Nothing can stand in his way, nothing will stop him on the vengeance trail&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gunstringer is a Kinect title, using player's body to control the main character a marionette on strings - movement,  aim and fire are the main actions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
