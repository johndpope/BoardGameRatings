			<description>Negotiator is a stock market game in which players has four tokens to move around the board to buy and sell stocks, and participate in auctions.  Players are encouraged to negotiate with other players and form partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shares basically have fixed buying and selling prices, although they can be changed somewhat through event cards ('Bulletin' and 'Bonus'). Shares in a company can only be sold when a player or partnership of players sell all the stocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
