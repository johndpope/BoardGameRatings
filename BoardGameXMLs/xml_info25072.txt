			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love to play cards?  Love to play golf?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can do both with STRATEGY GOLF.  The first game to combine the fun of cards with the challenge of golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With STRATEGY GOLF, your cards are your clubs.  Every player is dealt ten cards before each hole.  By using the distance charts, players must strategically plan out what cards they are going to use to reach the green and putt into the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But don't count your birdies before they hatch.  Because if you match cards with another player, you lose yardage.  This could put you at the bottom of a lake or deep in the sand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever happens, you'll probably have to think quick and come up with a new plan of action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best part is, you don't have to be a golfer to win at STRATEGY GOLF.  You just have to play your cards right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;  - Deck of cards (standard)&lt;br/&gt;  - Score Pad&lt;br/&gt;  - Distance Charts (4)&lt;br/&gt;  - Mounted board depicting a 9-hole course&lt;br/&gt;  - Player markers (4 golf tees)&lt;br/&gt;  - Pncil (1)&lt;br/&gt;  - Rulebook (3 pages - includes Beginner, Intermediate and Professional rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
