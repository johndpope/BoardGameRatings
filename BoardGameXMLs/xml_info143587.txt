			<description>Cooking Party Cards is a light social game for food lovers, child cooks, aspiring chefs, and fans of kitchen disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be creating unique dishes, sitting in judgment on your fellow players, and maybe even preparing the winning meals to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round one player will be the judge. When playing as a judge, a player chooses one &amp;quot;Assignment card&amp;quot; and reads the cooking assignment to the other players, who take on the role of &amp;quot;Chefs&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing as a Chef, a player follows any special rules of the assignment to assemble a hand of &amp;quot;Ingredient&amp;quot; cards and then uses these cards to invent a food dish to present to the judge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example assignments:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Chef's Choice&amp;quot;: Chefs prepare a single dish of their choice. Judge deals each Chef 7 cards; they may trade in up to 3; they must use at least 4.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sabotage&amp;quot;: Judge deals each chef 7 cards and instructs each Chef to pass one card to the player clockwise. Chefs must use the card passed to them in their final dish. After exchanging cards with their neighbors, Chefs may trade in up to 3 and must use at least 4.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Special Ingredient&amp;quot;: Judge chooses a Special Ingredient of their choice from the Ingredient deck and places it face up on the table, and deals each Chef 7 cards; they may trade in up to 3; they must use at least 3, in addition to the Special Ingredient.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Distasteful Dish&amp;quot;: Judge deal each Chef 7 cards; they may trade in up to 3; they must use exactly 4 cards to create the worst tasting dish they can think of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Chefs create their dishes, they take turn describing them to the judge, who chooses how to divide up points to the chefs based on the quality of their creations. The role of judge then rotates for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have had a chance to play the role of judge, scores from each round are tallied up; the winner is the player with the most total points over all rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
