			<description>A game of imagination and insight in which you make up words from the letters that chance brings your way. The multitude of variations that crop up as you play the game make every game go different and exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;containing:&lt;br/&gt;13 letter dice (d6)&lt;br/&gt;1 cup&lt;br/&gt;1 timer (1 minute)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the players controls the game:&lt;br/&gt;He or she takes charge of throwing the dice and making sure, with the aid of a sand-glass timer, that the players do not overrun the time. To begin the game he puts the timer on the table and throws the thirteen dice. each player, using the letters that turn up on the letter face of the dice, then tries to make a word. each letter has a value which is indicated beside it. The player who, within the allotted time, manages to make the word with the highest score (the sum of all letters used) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
