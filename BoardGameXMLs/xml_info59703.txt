			<description>A French game played on a board on which the numbers 1 to 70 are marked. The players put their stakes on the numbers they wish to back. The banker draws a ticket, calls out the number and the player who has backed it receives sixty-four times his stake; the other stakes go to the banker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
