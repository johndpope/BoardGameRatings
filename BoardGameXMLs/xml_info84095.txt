			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playouts are layouts to be printed and used at the game table during play. In this PDF, you will find a small keep. It is four stories high with a sub-level that includes storage space and cells for prisoners or beasts. Consider the staircases somewhat fudged for use with a five-foot equals one inch grid. One could claim this keep has a garrison from one dozen to three dozen guards, if one considers the beds as bunk beds and assumes that those on duty give up their beds to those who are not. The artillery is somewhat downsized from the great siege machines and meant to be akin to spear-throwers. The final two pages include a blank background and Playouts bits in case you wish to add to the keep, change a few things around, or build something of your own in the same style. This small keep is perfect as a roadside toll collector, a starter-stronghold for up and coming PCs or even as a wizard&amp;rsquo;s tower of sorts. A GM could also claim it has long since been abandoned by civilized folks and now must be scourged of evil creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
