			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take Command!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Commander bridges the gap between hero-level small-group adventuring and large-scale battlefield action, bringing you a brand-new character class, the general! These great leaders are capable of wielding a squad of soldiers like a living weapon, trained in complex tactics and with extraordinary acumen on the battlefield.  If you've ever wanted to adventure with your own personal army at your back, this is the class for you!  At the same time, the rules for this class are fully compatible with the kingdom-building and mass combat rules introduced in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Campaign and expanded and enriched in Ultimate Rulership, Ultimate Battle, and Ultimate War from Legendary Games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Commander includes an amazing array of class abilities and specialized stratagems, feats of command and leadership, and alternate favored class bonuses. It also brings you over a dozen archetypes for the general, from the criminal kingpin to radical revolutionary and the righteous redeemer to the marauding warbringer! It also presents the general's evil opposite, the hordelord, commanding a relentless zombie horde on their path of depravity! Whether your characters lead the armies of heaven or stand in the vanguard of villains, Ultimate Commander opens up a whole new route to victory and conquest!  Check out this 42-page supplement and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
