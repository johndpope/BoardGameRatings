			<description>Chariots of Stonehenge is a racing game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  The players race around the outer portion of Stonehenge in futuristic vehicles.  Each turn, you must choose how to split your power crystals between moving obstacles to hinder your opponents, and thrusting your vehicle forward, around, and through obstacles.  You may place obstacles according to the cards you have in hand.  Players play as nastily as possible, blocking and diverting each other at every opportunity, without sacrificing too much speed.  Wreck, and you permanently lose a power crystal.  Fortunately, each player has five more power crystals at regular intervals around the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chariots of Stonehenge is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
