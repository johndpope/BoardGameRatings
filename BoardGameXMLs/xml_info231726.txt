			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Davokar region has a grim, horrifying past, and that which has been forgotten by most is sometimes rediscovered by the curious and the greedy. This way, struggles that were laid to rest centuries ago can come to life and cause much grief and destruction, to both Ambrians and the barbarian clans; the hunger of a few awakes the famished powers of ancient times, and the common woman, man and child has to suffer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the forest of Davokar there is a muddy hill where brave explorers are digging for treasure. All that stands between them and the woods is a simple palisade, maybe sturdy enough to deter packs of smaller predators but hardly enough to stop the real dangers roaming the wilds. You and your companions arrive at the dig-site, to join the excavation or possibly tasked to keep an eye on what is happening there. Before long you will discover that what looks like a harmless hill in the woods actually has the potential to threaten the safety of the entire region. Do you have the will and courage to stand up to the powers of old? If so, do you have what it takes to send them into the eternal night?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes the scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Fever of the Hunt&lt;br/&gt;        The Bell Tolls for Kastor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
