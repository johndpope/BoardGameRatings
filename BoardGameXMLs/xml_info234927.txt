			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relic Worlds is a series of stories about a galaxy where alien species once spread across the cosmos, but somehow disappeared. They left behind millions of relics and artifacts scattered across thousands of planets, some of which are valuable, and some of which are very powerful.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;It is the early part of the 24th century, and humanity has colonized planets on many different star systems. As they did, they found no sentient alien life; at least none that had developed any form of technology. They have, however, found the remains of vast alien civilizations. Giant ruined cities lay empty, abandoned by their citizens who all disappeared mysteriously. It is a mystery worth unveiling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several Relic Worlds product and game lines; most focus on miniatures skirmishing.  This item uses a roleplaying approach based on Savage Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
