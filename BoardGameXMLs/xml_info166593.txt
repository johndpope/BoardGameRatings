			<description>Hometown Story (ホームタウンストーリー Hōmutaun Sutōrī) is a 2013 life-simulation video game for the Nintendo 3DS created by Harvest Moon creator Yasuhiro Wada, developed and published by Toybox Inc. and distributed by Natsume for North America and Rising Star Games for Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main character is in charge of running a shop inherited from their deceased grandmother. The player is capable of arranging and stocking the shelves of their shop to their preference and can eventually expand on the size of the shop. In a similar vein to the Harvest Moon series the player is able to interact and befriend various townspeople. The town that the player resides in will consist of ten people at first and eventually build its way to one hundred non-player characters that the player can meet depending on their actions over the course of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hometown Story&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
