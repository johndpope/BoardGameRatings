			<description>The title, translated into English, might be: &amp;quot;Scrapping Premiums: The Game&amp;quot;.  Players attempt to control routes to recycling centers, where they exchange their plastic &amp;quot;clunker&amp;quot; cars for aluminum ones.  This game was created by a German auto parts manufacturer to keep his metal milling machines in use during an economic downturn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players drive around the board in their old cars. When they pass certain squares, they get money from the bank. When they have enough money, they can go to the car dealer in the center of the game board to exchange their old car for a new one, then drive home with it, kicking out other old cars on the way. When a player has no more old cars and has brought all the new ones home, the game ends and the richest player (in cars and money) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
