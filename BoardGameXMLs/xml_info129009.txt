			<description>B-Movie Hero is a push your luck dice and card game with a little bit of strategy thrown in.  &lt;br/&gt; Your goal, as a lowly B-Movie hero, is to kill as many monsters as you can to survive. This means you will have to barricade yourself in whatever relatively safe place you can find, scavenge around for supplies, and of course, duct tape multiple weapons together to create one massive weapon of destruction that by all means should not work, but does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you accomplish this goal is simple. Each turn a card is flipped over from the Situation Deck. These cards contain global effects that help/hinder your dice rolling, or supply locations for you to clear out and possibly barricade yourself in for added protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once this is done, 3 dice are grabbed at random from a group of 12. The dice contain everything from weapons to barricades to scavenging abilities and killing sprees. The dice are rolled and placed aside for points, barricades, weapons, etc... But if you roll 3 &amp;quot;Bite&amp;quot; symbols before voluntarily ending your turn, you lose any points you might have gained. Play continues until somebody reaches the agreed upon victory points to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
