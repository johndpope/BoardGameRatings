			<description>The name of the game is &amp;quot;wargame&amp;quot; translated in English. This game was published in the Netherlands somewhere between 1880 and 1900 (judging by the material used, the publisher and the uniforms in the picture). It was published by a cookie factory for marketing purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background of the board is an illustration of Dutch troops attacking a revolting native town in the Dutch East Indies colony (probably in Atjeh). There are 90 numbered dots (white and red) on the board, the rules are printed in the lower left and lower right corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is is played like Game of Goose, with 2 dice and pawns. Each player rolls two dice to decide who goes first(highest roll starts). The rest of the players take their turn clockwise. Each turn a player rolls two dice and moves his pawn according to his roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game every player pays ten chips to the bank. Whenever a player ends his move on a white dot nothing happens and the next player gets to roll the dice. The red dots are 'special event' dots. These events may be positive or negative for the player. For instance: roll again, get wounded (and move backwards to the hospital) or get killed (and have to start all over again). In most of these cases the player also pays chips to or receives chips from the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to reach nr. 90; the dot at the heart of the native town. This player is honored with the Ridder Kruis (Knight's Cross) and receives all chips in the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
