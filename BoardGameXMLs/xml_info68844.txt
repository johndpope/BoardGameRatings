							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Noddy&#039;s Train Game</name>
									
			<description>This game uses the children's book character, Noddy, created by Enid Blyton in 1949. It is a four-track race game in which each player has a plastic playing piece in the shape of a railway engine. The pieces are of different colours, matching the colours of the four tracks. Players use a spinner instead of dice and they follow instructions that are given along the trackways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rewards: forward movement. &lt;br/&gt;Forfeits: backward movement, missed turns. &lt;br/&gt;Equipment required: markers, in the form of a steam engine driven by Noddy, coloured plastic, teetotum, marked 1 to 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
