			<description>Sportsgame, football (soccer)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a season in the Danish Superliga (known as Faxekondi Ligaen, when the game was released).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game: To finish as #1 in the league.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through comparing dice rolls with stats on the fielded football-players, the gameplayers move the players up and down the gameboard (football field) and hopefully score goals (just like a real football match).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the off-season gameplayers can transfer their players and buy better players for their team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
