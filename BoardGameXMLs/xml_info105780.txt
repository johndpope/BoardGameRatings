			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally released with Seaman, the Dreamcast mic utilized one of the accessory ports in the Dreamcast controller to allow you to communicate via voice in online games.  It was a must have accessory for those playing titles such as Alien Front Online and Planet Ring, but it had a little known life as a Long Distance Call Support device when using Planetweb Browser 2.6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
