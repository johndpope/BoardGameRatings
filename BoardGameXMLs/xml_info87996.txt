							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elf War</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As more children of the High Ones gather at the Palace, the realization grows that elfin tribes are widespread in the world. Mindful of the successes of Cutter's great quest, it is decided to send out organized parties to explore the World of Two Moons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are selected to be explorers, and your party feels eager to participate in such a glorious undertaking. You equip yourselves and wait for the weather to warm. From the Palace you stare Hubward, toward which you will soon Travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There, across the icy plains, a great range of mountains rises. What wonders lay behond them, and what dangers? Perhaps you can help embattled tribes to safety; perhaps you can reunite hitherto unknown elfin tribes with their rightful heritage and with others of their kind; perhaps whe you return yo uwill be as honored as Cutter himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELF WAR is a pair of linkable adventures for Elfquest set in the cool valleys and beside the icy waters of the Hubward wilderness. The 'Elf War' adventure is the shorter, playable in 1-2 sessions. 'Beyond The Frozen Mountains' is a multi-session adventure, to be extended or condensed as the gamemaster desires. Relevant character statistics accompany both parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
