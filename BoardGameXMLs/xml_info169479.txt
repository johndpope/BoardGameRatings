			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the sixth entry in our line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jinsokuna Chirashi-class (literally translated to English as &amp;quot;Swift Flyer&amp;quot;) yacht is a vessel first created by Hiruna Kabushiki shipyards which orbit Earth's moon in the early 2200s.  Since then, the ship's design has been used for a wide variety of purposes including as a luxurious yacht, a pirate marauder and a light escort ship.  However, it is probably best known as the basis for the Star Hawk, the ship used by the title character in the popular holovid series Superpirate!.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jinsokuna Chirashi-class yacht is a perfect ship for player characters.  This sleek 400-ton ship has a crew of six and is ideal for any group of trouble shooters, smugglers, pirates or even a wealthy character with his/her entourage.  Four variants are provided here:  The opulent Swift Flyer yacht, the dangerous Vulture-class pirate marauder, the fearsome Wolf-class light escort and the popular Star Hawk as seen on Superpirate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 6: Jinsokuna Chirashi comes complete with beautiful views of the each of the variants.  Each variant is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, each variant comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, the Jinsokuna Chirashi could easily be used in any Traveller setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
