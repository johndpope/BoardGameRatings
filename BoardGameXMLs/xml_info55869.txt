			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dorns have always borne the brunt of the Shadow's wrath, from the time before the Fortress Wall, to the Last Age. Their lands in the north are now beyond hope &amp;ndash; the dark god's forces turn to the other races of Eredane for less troublesome slaves, more easily bought mercenaries, more capable governors. In the black eyes of Izrador, the Dorns are good only as breeding stock for his legates, as food for his orcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a final battle for freedom comes, it will not be in this forsaken place. If a culture is to survive and live on in the next age, it will not be that of the Dorns. Like the doomed dwarves in their mountains, like the all-but-exterminated halflings of the plains, the Dorns' tale nears its end. But, the ancestors of these proud warriors have awakened from their sleep among the eternal spirits of Aryth. The royal bloodlines of some clans are yet untainted. The dark god's forces spiral ever closer to a state of constant infighting, paranoia, and self-destruction. The time of the Dorns may be coming to an end, but it will be an end that will be told in tales, sung in sungs, and lived in dreams for the rest of time. Honor can never be eclipsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Honor and Shadow includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A gazeteer and history of the Northlands of Erenland.&lt;br/&gt;     New rules for environmental hazards and deprivation, both good and ill.&lt;br/&gt;     New spirits of the Northlands, both benign and malevolent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
