							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amaurote</name>
									
			<description>Amaurote was released in 1987 by Mastertronic on their Mastertronic Added Dimension label with music by David Whittaker. The origin of the city name Amaurote derives from &amp;quot;Utopia&amp;quot; by Sir Thomas More (1478&amp;ndash;1535).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the game's instructions:&lt;br/&gt;    The city of Amaurote has been invaded by huge, aggressive insects who have built colonies in each of the city's 25 sectors. As the only uninjured army officer left after the invasion (that'll teach you for hiding!) the job falls to you to destroy all the insect colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls an &amp;quot;Arachnus 4&amp;quot;, an armoured fighting-machine that moves on four legs. The player must first select a sector to play in via a map screen and then control the Arachnus as it wanders an isometric (top-down in the Commodore 64 version) view of the cityscape attacking marauding insects and searching for the insect queen using a scanner. The Arachnus attacks by launching bouncing bombs. It can only launch one at a time so if a bomb misses its intended target the player will have to wait until is explodes or bounces out of the play area before they can fire again. Once the queen has been located, the player can radio-in a &amp;quot;supa-bomb&amp;quot; which can be used to destroy the queen. The player can also radio-in other supplies such as additional bombs and even ask to be pulled out of the combat zone. Extra weaponry costs the player &amp;quot;dosh&amp;quot;, the in-game currency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Amaurote&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
