			<description>The game was invented by Marino Carpignano in 2016.&lt;br/&gt;An 8x8 unchequered game board is used with a certain number of bi-colour counters, white on one side and black on the other, like in Othello. At the beginning, the board is empty. Black moves first. &lt;br/&gt;The Black player's first move is obligatorily on one of the 8 squares along the North side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, each player will choose an entry square for their counter, placed along one of the two next side rows (clockwise) with reference to the last piece played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A counter slides (also jumping over any other counters already present on the game board) along the line perpendicular to the selected side, and stopping on the first empty square encountered.&lt;br/&gt;Ambiguous moves are forbidden: that means you are not allowed to place your counter on a square that may be reached from both sides where you can play in your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game the counters are captured by flanking them; the result of a capture is instead the same as in Othello. &lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to be the first to complete an orthogonal or diagonal line of at least four counters of the player&amp;rsquo;s colour, avoiding a simultaneous alignment of four or more of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
