							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cardboard Heroes: Castles â€“ The Keep</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create the Castle You Want&lt;br/&gt;Cardboard Heroes Castles are great-looking 3-D structures that fold up for play, and fold down again for travel and storage! They're heavy cardstock, but they're die-cut and pre-scored to make them easy to build, and they're designed to fold and unfold without damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set can be used by itself to create either a castle with enclosed courtyard or a massive towered keep. Or use it as an expansion to the Walls and Towers set. The more sets you add, the bigger your castle gets . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cardboard Heroes Castles are full-color (of course), gorgeous, and totally portable. When the game's over, just fold 'em up and go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
