							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mists of War</name>
									
			<description>A fictional wargame (WW2 themed) for two players in which quite a few things are foggy at the start of the game. To have a better chance of winning you will try to find out what kind of units the enemy has, how many are fielded and where they are located. And hopefully, you will find out your opponent&amp;rsquo;s objective before it is too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hearth of Mists of War is a true double-blind game system without using an extra player as an umpire. You might call it a block wargame because of the cubes, but it goes much further into hiding information than the standard games in this genre. The cubes in Mists of war are not just hidden units, but are used as a system of fog of war which comes and goes according to what your units can actually see. Besides the cubes, Mists of War also gives the players a secret objective to win the game. Furthermore, a player receives a number of force points unknown to the other player which he can spend on buying troops. The more force points you get, the harder your objective will be.&lt;br/&gt;Activation of units is done by selecting zones. Selecting more zones gives your opponent more benefits.&lt;br/&gt;It uses a randomless (no dice) combat outcome in which all the units in the selected zone can act together and add their strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
