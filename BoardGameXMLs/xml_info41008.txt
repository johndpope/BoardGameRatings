							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Polish Tank Battle</name>
									
			<description>Polish Tank Battle is a modern chess-like game played on an 11x11 diagonally symmetrical grid. Two players each command an army of 13 tanks plus one general who has the exclusive ability to enter and pass through the purple contaminated area in the middle. All pieces move and capture as queens from Western Chess. At the start the tanks are located on the 14 dark green and orange spaces, respective to the green and orange tanks. There are also 20 tree spaces on the board that tanks may not enter or pass through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to enter the opponent's base with as many tanks as possible, scoring two points per tank. Any other surviving tanks not in the far base also score one point for the player. If your general stands in the corner where the enemy general started you score an additional point (3 for that tank). The game immediately ends when one side has moved his final remaining tank into the enemy base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
