							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Crypt of  Kur-Ka</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Eldritch RPG Adventure for 2 to 4 low level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back-story synopsis&lt;br/&gt;A human teenager named Forlin Silver was hunting moose near the closest mountain range, a place dwarves once called their home. The young boy was aware he was approaching the hallowed grounds of ancient dwarven crypts, and knew better than to go near such a sacred place, uninvited by the dwarven priesthood. But it mattered not, because Forlin was quite venturesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lying at the outskirts of dusty ruins, only a few crypts remained undamaged, their entrances carved out of the mountainside, surrounded by crumbling citadels and abandoned temples of ancient times. Forlin passed a crypt of particular interest, one he knew was ordinarily sealed shut. Forgetting all about hunting moose, his curiosity took over. He lit a torch, and entered the dark entrance hall. To his disappointment, all of the rooms seemed devoid of the riches he heard about in common dwarven stories. Until, that is, he discovered a room containing an ornate fountain. A carved dwarf head spit water into its rectangular basin, and sitting atop the water basin&amp;rsquo;s edges were nine golden statuettes, representing key figures of the dwarven people&amp;rsquo;s past. On both sides of the fountain there were two small iron braziers, unlit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fearing the worst if he dared touch something, Forlin went back to the town of Bloodspring, revealing his fantastic discovery to Borakr Nord and Ulric Willow, two promising local warriors, both of whom he idolized. Borakr admonished the boy to keep this news a secret between them. However, initially, Ulric was against this, thinking it better to report the open crypt to the town elders. But Borakr convinced him to keep his mouth shut, in the interest of personal gain. Forlin, excited about treasure, agreed to guide the two warriors to the crypt. Once there, Borakr and Ulric would enter the crypt and steal the statuettes to sell them at the nearest port. The gold would then be split equally among the three of them. Borakr however, had other plans in mind&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their preparations to empty the crypt, Forlin&amp;rsquo;s older sister Freyla spied on them, and immediately alerted the town&amp;rsquo;s elder about what was going on. Although she did not hear the whole story, the elder knew this meant trouble, especially since the town&amp;rsquo;s dwarves were unaware of the situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
