							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruyang: The Shattered City</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for Exilium, the science fiction roleplaying game of post-human loss and redemption by Greg Saunders, using the Open D6 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exilium Mission Seed: Ruyang, the shattered city&lt;br/&gt;Location: Steel equatorial region&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the three cities destroyed by &amp;lsquo;total event&amp;rsquo; weaponry during the conflicts on Steel, Ruyang has become the home of scavengers, deserters and criminal factions. Despite the high radiation levels and the apparent use of unknown weaponry, some of which seems still operational, Ruyang remains a hive of underground activity and as such a potential home of Shadows. Strangely, the unusual Shrika can be found in the city in large numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions Seeds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF presents a short mission seed for the Exilium roleplaying game of posthuman loss and redemption, and describes the origin and history of Ruyang, the shattered city, including some of the notable locations and factions as well as possible Shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that Ruyang is system neutral so could be used for other science fiction roleplaying games, although some of the factions etc. do not have context outside of Exilium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
