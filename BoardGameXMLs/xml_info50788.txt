							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The First Year of Our Reign</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Year of Our Reign is a sprawling companion to Reign, Greg Stolze's acclaimed game of epic rulers and clashing cultures.  The first six supplements, along with an encyclopedic gazetteer of the setting and its cultures, has been revamped, re-organized, and packed into a single reference.  Look inside to find...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Assets to fine-tune the details of a nation, family or cabal's capacities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A system of polearm fighting particularly suited to madmen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Step-by-step directions for creating your own schools of magic for Reign, or new spells for the schools already described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Tiny elephants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A city governed by an oligarchy of nocturnal eye-eaters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Beasts of burden that can jump thirty feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Many, many Esoteric Disciplines, including at least one for each Skill that lacked one in the main book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Everything you need to throw a fistfull of d10s and create culturally nuanced Dindavarans, Imperials or Ob-lobs, ready to play, with interesting history guaranteed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
