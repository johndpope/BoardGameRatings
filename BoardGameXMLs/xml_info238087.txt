							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robot Arena</name>
									
			<description>In the near future discarded robots are being bought up to take part in brutal arena battles. Which robot will win and be allowed to call itself the champion of the Robot Arena?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player controls a robot in an arena battle. You gain points by damaging other robots, or by claiming the center of the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player receives their own character board and fifteen tokens to distribute among their robot's body parts (head, left and right arms, left and right legs). During a players turn, that player can take up to two actions out. Actions include movement, repairing, and attacks. Attacks include shoving, which moves the target a number of spaces, as well as melee and ranged attacks. Most attacks result in a limb point check, for instance when punching the point value of the strongest arm of the attacking robot is compared to the targeted limb of the defending robot and a higher value on the attacking part leads to the defending robot losing one hit point in the targeted limb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doing damage to opponent robots, as well as holding the center area of the board gives points. The first robot to gain 24 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
