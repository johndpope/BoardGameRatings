							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lebanon &#039;82: Operation Peace for Galilee</name>
									
			<description>Operation Peace for Galilee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lebanon &amp;lsquo;82 is a simulation of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in &amp;lsquo;82, an attempt to clear out PLO terrorists and expel elements of the Syrian army from the country. Hoping to establish the pro-Israeli Christians as the legitimate government in Lebanon, the Israelis sent in the IDF, which soon became embroiled in vicious urban battles. The game also includes a 1975 scenario, as well as a 2006 scenario, showing the evolution of Israel&amp;rsquo;s ongoing struggle against the PLO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lebanon &amp;lsquo;82 utilizes the Fire &amp;amp; Movement combat system that is designed so that players can augment their units with &amp;ldquo;Support Fire&amp;rdquo; during the course of the battle. From artillery to air strikes, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. Lebanon &amp;lsquo;82 also includes rules for a possible Syrian entry, and features the Syrian Surface to Air Missiles! Israeli air support could come under fire from Syrian fixed SAM batteries; more support fire will be necessary, but assets are limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lebanon &amp;lsquo;82, the attritional design of the Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare; Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties during a game, accurately replicating the realities of combat, especially during the street fighting encountered in 1982. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management &amp;mdash; not merely odds ratios requiring numerical superiority. A stunning map of Lebanon depicts the entire battle area, ranging from the Israeli border to the capital Beirut itself &amp;mdash; including all of the famous battle sites, such as the PLO refugee camps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
