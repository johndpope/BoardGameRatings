			<description>The players have to move 4 or 6 pawns into the center of the game board. Movement is determined by a die. Under certain conditions, the mpawns can change from an outer into an inner circle. On the green circle there are 4 meeting places. The first two opponents to meet there combine their pawns (stack one on the other) and are allies for the rest of the game. They win or lose as one. The combined pawns can be separated, if an opponent lands on a space that is already occupied by two combined pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
