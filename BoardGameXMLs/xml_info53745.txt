			<description>Pop-A-Word is a word-forming dice game, self-contained in the familiar Kohner Pop-O-Matic mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a player's turn, the tray containing nine letter cubes is popped and jiggled until lying flat in the center. The player then makes the highest-scoring word possible from the letters showing face-up, the score being the total of the point values on the letters used in the word. Letters cannot be used multiple times unless showing on multiple faces, and a blank can be used for any letter, though that letter scores 0. Bonuses of an extra turn and extra points are earned for words of 6 to 9 letters. The game continues until a player reaches 200 points or some other agreed-upon total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an alternate game where all players form his or her own word simultaneously from the same pop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
