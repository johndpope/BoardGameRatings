			<description>From 1KM1KT web page for game:&lt;br/&gt;Dave Morris was once asked if he could go back and rewrite Dragon Warriors, his RPG gamebook series from the 1980s, what would he change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He answered that he would have taken the advice of a friend and make the entire system revolve around a single six sided die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I decided to take that as a challange!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result is K U B O S, a low fantasy Role Playing Game of Action, Adventure and Six-Sided Heroics. I hope you enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
