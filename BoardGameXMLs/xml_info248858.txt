			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dead have risen from their graves, and the zombie apocalypse is now at hand. Your hometown has been overrun, and who knows how the rest of the world is faring? But here&amp;rsquo;s the twist: you aren&amp;rsquo;t some weak and puny mortal; you&amp;rsquo;re a vampire, a terrifying creature of the night. You were resting when the outbreak started, but now you&amp;rsquo;re awake, and your food source is being wiped out&amp;mdash;so what are you going to do about it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Bile is a narrative, lightweight RPG of emergent storytelling, where vampires manage their human resources in a world that&amp;rsquo;s fallen to the zombie horde. The reader is presented with a sandbox-style scenario that can be played with or without a Game Master, requiring no preparation and minimal bookkeeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a mixture of red, green and blue d6s&amp;mdash;three dice for rolling on the oracle tables, and five dice for each player. You&amp;rsquo;ll also need about half a dozen white d6s to represent human survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
