							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Espresso Fishing</name>
									
			<description>Espresso Fishing doesn't ask you to fish with caffeinated drinks &amp;mdash; no, instead you use the espresso to keep yourself awake when you're out on a hot lake fishing for hours at a time. To get the fish, though, you need to first test your luck with the dice...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the active player rolls three blue dice and two red dice. After the first roll, she can roll each die individually at most one more time. After doing this, she can either fish or poach depending on what she's rolled. If she has at least one hook, one worm and a wave, she can fish by rolling the white die &amp;mdash; and she rolls it a number of times equal to the product of the hooks and waves that she has. The white die features 1-2 fish, a boot (which nets you nothing for that roll), and the sweet ZZZZZZs of someone who fell asleep; catch the Zs and your fishing time ends immediately. If you use one of your two espresso tokens prior to rolling, however, Zs become boots and you can keep rolling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you roll a full house or four- or five-of-a-kind, you can steal 1-3 fish from other players. With a special full house, you can reclaim an espresso chip or move one fish from the lake or another player's pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the lake is empty, whoever has the most fish wins. In a tie, the tied player holding the yellow fish wins &amp;mdash; but if neither of them has the yellow fish, then they're out of the game and the player with the nextmost fish wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
