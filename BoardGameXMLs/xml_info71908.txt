			<description>The SHIP Card Games are easy-to-learn and start having Fun fast.  Space N Time uses a sci-fi theme but, enjoyment of SNT goes way beyond the sci-fi niche.  The Object is to collect Cards &amp;amp; match &amp;lsquo;sets&amp;rsquo; for points. Each Player starts with 6 Cards. A Players &amp;ldquo;turn&amp;rdquo; is called a Time Loop &amp;ndash; which consists of 3 Steps: 1) Turn in &amp;lsquo;sets&amp;rsquo; of Cards (example: 3 Shuttle Cards = 5 pts.), 2) Attack another Player (optional), 3) Draw two Cards from the Deck. You do not have to do Steps 1 &amp;amp; 2 but, drawing your two Cards officially ends your Loop.  Players have an option to Attack any other Player, following the Card Rank, to gain Cards or get rid of unwanted Cards.  Game play can go to a point threshold like 100 points or Players can just keep track of &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; play to 5 or 10 &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no &amp;quot;histories to learn&amp;quot; or magic spells to keep track of.  The basic nature of SHIP Card Games is not complicated (&amp;ldquo;Fun for all ages&amp;rdquo;), but there are subtleties and nuances that provide a challenge and sophistication that&amp;rsquo;s not initially apparent.  In addition, BONUS OPTIONS add a strategic vector and extends the Game.  The SHIP Card Games can be easy going or get fast paced when you and you're friends are 'into it'.  Games can last for minutes or hours.  Combine multiple Decks and you can have as many people in a Game as you like and play longer Games.  DON&amp;rsquo;T FORGET, you can also play SOLO, the solitaire version!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you get to know the SHIP Card Games, you'll discover many nuances and preferences. There are strategies concerning: turning in 'sets', Battling, when to 'retire' a Generation, ending the Game and others. Games can be played to: a point threshold like 100 points, the 1st Player to get 10 &amp;quot;wins&amp;quot;, the 1st Player to get 10 Starships, the 1st Player to 'retire' their last Generation, and more. You can also play SOLO, the solitaire version - which has BONUS OPTIONS, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
