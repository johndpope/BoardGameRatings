			<description>In Jet Set Casino, you join the distinguished class of people who swan around Europe spreading their fortune over the gambling tables of high-class casinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eager and hungry to &amp;quot;conquer&amp;quot; more casinos than your opponents in a short space of time, you have various means of transport at your disposal: private jets, sports cars, luxury yachts and the like. Each has particular properties that can help you blaze a trail from Monte Carlo across to Gibraltar round to St Petersburg, back to London and on to Helsinki in time for tea. Whoever has been to the most casinos after each player has been the &amp;quot;dealer&amp;quot; once, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jet Set Casino is all about successful negotiations. You must clinch the best deals with your opponents to get hold of useful casino cards and the right transport cards to get there. Those who have successfully visited a casino during their turn have the right to participate in a genuine casino game: they play a round of 'Seven-and-a-half' (not unlike 'Vingt-Et-Un') to compete for a further free casino visitation. The game also demands a good sense of strategy - from choosing the all-important starting casino, to obtaining the best transport cards for each different phases of the game - plus a little luck, as that's what gambling is all about, really...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jet Set Casino has just been released in mainland Europe, and will be available shortly in the UK.
