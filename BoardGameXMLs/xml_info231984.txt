							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Svimmitch the Secretary</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The line between good and evil is finer than the sharpest blade. But it does exist, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to be on one side, oh so close to the other. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to pass from one side to the other without intending to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a secretary, Svimmitch keeps many secrets. The king&amp;rsquo;s, the council&amp;rsquo;s, and his own. He has become more and more disillusioned over his years watching the government.  Svimmitch strongly believes in law and order, and the chain of command. Whether he agrees or not, he does what his superiors tell him, and expects subordinates to follow his orders. Punishment - severe - is what you get when you don&amp;rsquo;t do as you&amp;rsquo;re told.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
