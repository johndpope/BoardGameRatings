			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A non-canon fan supplement for Vampire: The Masquerade that presents one of the extinct clans in an alternative way that makes them an allowable clan in the modern World of Darkness setting. A later alternative take on this supplement was created: A Modern Clan Cappadocian &amp; Related Bloodlines Primer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Preface;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document contains information on the Cappadocian Clan for use in the Modern Nights. It is not designed to be compatible with the canon history of Vampire: the Masquerade or Dark Ages: Vampire. It is assumed that when the Giovanni attempted to destroy the Cappadocians, they failed. Cappadocius himself was diablerized because that was all part of his Master Plan, but his Clan fought back successfully and destroyed the Giovanni.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cappadocians become a Camarilla Clan who practice the art of Necromancy and spend their nights searching for scholarly insight. They're a Clan of academics, doctors, theologists and scientists always searching for answers to where they fit into the world and how the world fits together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large faction of the Clan, enraged at the folly of Cappadocius and full of rage, joined the Sabbat to become the Cappadocian Antitribu, the sorcerous shock troops of the Sabbat. These dark magicians raise zombie armies and rot their enemies alive. They enslave ghosts as spies and agents. The unholy magic of their bloodline is potent and they're all too happy to use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The largest Cappadocian bloodline, the Lamia, also survived the Giovanni's attempted coup and played a large part in destroying the upstart Venetians. These warrior-women joined with the Cappadocian Antitribu in the Sabbat, spreading plagues among the mortals and slaying whatever vampires they can lay their hands on for the greater glory of their Dark Mother.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
