							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The League of Mediocre Villains</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medicority, Assemble!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all villains are created equal.  For every truly terrifying villain of world-shaking proportions, there are dozens of lesser villains who lack the ability to make themselves a threat to society.  Individually, these villains may be so lame that no hero (or group of heroes) could take them seriously.  When they combine their forces, though, there may be Hell to pay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When seven of the world's most average and lackluster villains combine forces, they may actually become dangerous.  It isn't so much that they have a great chance for success, but their failure is likely to be seven times more spectacular.  Suddenly, adventurers had better sit up and take notice, because these villains can do more damage with their mistakes than any villain could accomplish with success!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And when you throw one or two villains in who are actually far more dangerous than they let on, it may unleash a new terror on the world that will threaten the very future and destiny of all mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, are you ready for a globe hopping adventure of surprisingly epic proportions, leading to an epic battle on an infernal space station?  Ready or not, here comes the League of Mediocre Villains!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for HOT CHICKS: The RPG. You will need the core rulebook in order to play.  The characters and adventure are based on information from our supplement Villain-Net, and will rely on that supplement for history and reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
