			<description>Invisible is a simple card game in the style of Dobble, but with more gorgeous art as usual from Korona Games and more interesting methods of playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To sum up: Just draw a card, place it face up in the middle of the table and find what is missing from the items of the wizard or the witch, or even what is the only thing there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some tricky cards as well, in which everything is visible or invisible. The player who tells and hits the symbol of the item first gets the card and the victory point belonging to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is party game and a lot of fun for all ages, just strike the symbol, take the cards and laughing will be guaranteed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
