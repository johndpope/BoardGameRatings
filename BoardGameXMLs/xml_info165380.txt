			<description>Would you like to experience the sensations of a professional rider competing in the &amp;ldquo;Grande Boucle&amp;rdquo;? Then immerse yourself in an incredible virtual Tour de France 2014 on PlayStation&amp;reg;4, PlayStation&amp;reg;3 and Xbox 360&amp;reg;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select from one of the official teams and take part in this supreme test of endurance. Compete as one of the riders in a bid to reach the Holy Grail of professional cycling: the yellow jersey! Go on a reconnaissance trip of a specific stage, decide the composition of your team and the rider with whom you will start the race and then launch into the epic stages. The English countryside, the route through London with its iconic landmarks, a cobbled stage in Northern France (every rider&amp;rsquo;s nightmare), the grueling mountain stages or a solo time trial that could in fact decide the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
