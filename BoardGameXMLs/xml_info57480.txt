			<description>Rendezvous in Krakow, Version 2.2, Book One of the Vistula Epic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the survivors of the US 5th Division, Krakow sounded like a city out of a fairy tale... a castle, an evil king, even a flying carpet. More importantly, Krakow sounded like an island of peace in a war-torn world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reality was different...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rendezvous in Krakow is the first of three linked adventures forming The Vistula Epic for Twilight:2000 2nd edition. Krakow has been spared the worst of the war's devastation, and has declared itself a free city. The war is banished, and individuals are free to come and go... so long as they leave the war behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background material includes street maps with points of interest, from Wavel Castle to the &amp;quot;Wojo&amp;quot; munitions plant. Many non-player characters are described in detail as well as the Krakow ORMO and the marauder bands of the surrounding countryside. The city's economy, culture and atmosphere combine to make the Free City of Krakow a rich adventure environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set against this backdrop is the adventure which thrusts the player characters into the midst of intrigue and treachery as they pursue the secret of Operation Reset, and in the process gain the attention of several intelligence agencies and Krakow's most interesting (and dangerous) citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional information:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rendezvous in Krakow is a revised version of the 'Free City of Krakow' (an adventure supplement for Twilight:2000 1st edition). It contains much of the information presented in Free City of Krakow, but updated to make it compatible with Twilight:2000 2nd edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second and third of the linked adventures in The Vistula Epic (Death on the Vistula and Warsaw Phoenix) were never published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
