			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Taxibo is a unique Surinamese board game, which takes you by taxi through the centre of Paramaribo. It is a game for 2 to 4 players and consists of 1 dice, 16 pieces in 4 colours and a board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website:&lt;br/&gt;First Surinamese boardgame, developed by Gerrit Baron for the whole family. Taxibo is a taxi game which takes place in Paramaribo. Each of the four players owns a taxi company, who's four cars stand in four different garages. very exciting and above all educational.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discription: Taxibo is a basic role and move game with some similarities to Sorry. Players move their pawns (taxi's) by rolling dice. The board represents (in an very abstract manner) the streets of Paramaribo. The end goal is getting all four taxi's to the central square. The players who first achieves this wins. Some of the spaces of the board are related to famous sights in Paramaribo and require a player who lands on them to do things such as skip turns, roll again, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
