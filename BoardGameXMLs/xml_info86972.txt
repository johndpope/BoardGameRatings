							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Field Guide, Volume I</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Field Guide is a brief synopsis of the races found in the Emerging Forms line of products from Primal Urge Games. It provides a brief snapshot of each race, including artwork, alignment, preferred class, and supplementary material for the races in the series. The Field Guide serves as a preview for those interested in different volumes in the series, as well as a reference for those already using races from the series. This volume highlights the first thirteen races from the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the volumes in Emerging Forms are designed to work atomically, with no dependency between the races. The series takes a modular approach to races. The races are intended to be used freely with other races in the series, as well as races found in a host of other products, including the standard fantasy races. Enough material on the behaviors and motivations of each race is presented to weave the race into an existing campaign world, or create a new campaign world. Purchasing a single race will not take away from your enjoyment of the product. Of course if you enjoy one of the races, we would encourage you to pick up other races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From user summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collects basic stat info from Aegire, Alratheen, Cyndarim, D'Ah Rien, Grizimilak, Jhardwyn, Lidaem, Pergothi, Rin, Ryonth, Thozeran, Xeshaal and Zure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
