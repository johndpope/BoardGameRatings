			<description>Wheel of Fate is a racing/war game for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the Aztec board game Patolli, the goal of the game is to be the first player to move 3 of their 5 tokens across the circuit from their start square to their end square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use accelerators to quickly traverse the board, ambush your opponents to send them back to the start, engage in wars between multiple players, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes hand packed in a cardboard box and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1x Aztec Calendar game board&lt;br/&gt;     1x Drawstring Pouch&lt;br/&gt;     1x Printed Rules&lt;br/&gt;     5x Two-Sided Fate Dice (Only has 0 and 1 on the dice)&lt;br/&gt;     32x Player Tokens (8 of each color: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only those with the favor of the gods and the skill to use it will claim victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is 18&amp;quot;x18&amp;quot; when unfolded (9&amp;quot;x9&amp;quot; when folded) and the playing pieces are approximately 3/4&amp;quot; each. All dice and tokens come in the drawstring pouch and the board and pieces are packed inside a 9&amp;quot;x9&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot; cardboard box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first game produced by Garsidian Games. Each game is made to order, numbered in the order it was crafted, and comes with a hand written thank you note.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
