			<description>Nubericoo! is a set of four simple games using a deck of flash cards showing circles and squares with divisions expressed as fractions, decimals and percentages. &lt;br/&gt;The games are intended to teach basic math skills in fractions, decimals and percentages.&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a deck of 48 flash cards, 1 info card and 2 rules cards. The games that can be played with the cards are:&lt;br/&gt;Memory - a simple matching game using pairs of cards with the same value&lt;br/&gt;Higher Or Lower - 10 cards are laid out face down and players guess if each successively revealed card is higher or lowewr than the previous one&lt;br/&gt;Whole Numbers - a rummy game where players try to collect a set of four cards adding up to a whole number&lt;br/&gt;Beat It - players are dealt 3 cards; they then place the cards in front of them, one face up and two face down. At each turn they have to decide if they want to replace a card with a card they have drawn. The player with the lowest value when the game ends (if cards run out or a one whole card is drawn) wins.&lt;br/&gt;The game is published by a Singapore company and the cards are printed in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
