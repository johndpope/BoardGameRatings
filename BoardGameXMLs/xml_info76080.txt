			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;Anachronox (pronounced /əˈn&amp;aelig;krənɒks/) is a 3-D, third person computer role-playing game produced by Tom Hall  and the Ion Storm games studio and released in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay was notably influenced by console RPGs such as Chrono Trigger, one of Tom Hall's favorite video games[1], although character statistics and item collection have been simplified and the emphasis is on exploration and story-telling rather than RPG-style character building. The player plays the part of Sylvester &amp;quot;Sly Boots&amp;quot; Bucelli, a down-and-out detective in the slums of an alien world called Anachronox. This world sits inside a giant, hollow sphere called Sender One, which is the center of the galaxy's network of space-lanes. Recruited against his will to investigate a mystery concerning the very nature of the universe, Sly travels throughout the galaxy, meeting many characters along the way, some of whom can join the player's party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
