			<description>&amp;quot;What is this? A prodigy? A collective hallucination? This is not a movie. This is not a child&amp;rsquo;s play. This is not even the real world, as you&amp;rsquo;ve known it until now, at least...This is more&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For fifteen years players had to customize their own deck: now, at last, they can customize their cards too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prodigy Game Cards is a card game, you don't collect it, proper for experienced players; every player drives a group of people &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; in it: these people are called WIPper, in specific places around the world, that in order to prevail on the adversaries fight for many purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These characters, at first sight, seem just common people, but possess increased ability that we called &amp;quot;prodigies.&amp;quot; It is a WIPper who succeeds in these &amp;quot;prodigies&amp;quot;. Who is not able to do it, is without bond. Four types of bond exist and each is represented, in the game, by a different color:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular - yellow: those people that can modify their phisical structure and their molecular density in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;Elementary - green: they possess the ability to channel, to send forth and to check different types of energy using the body as catalyst.&lt;br/&gt;Feral - red: they possess a combination of Dna human and animal, that allow them to possess animal physical powers.&lt;br/&gt;Psionic - blue: they are the WIPpers that possess some superior mental abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play a game of Prodigy Game Cards it needs at least two players. Every player must possess WIPper (the protagonists of our history), Places (where they fight) and a deck of Prodigies (the special actions that are able to do).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Prodigy Game Cards you can directly reach a new level of personalization: the Prodigies have  the technology Scracth&amp;amp;Play, developed in collaboration with Cartamundi, that allows the players to personalize, in phase of construction of the deck, every single paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every Prodigy possesses three levels of power: low, middle and high. &lt;br/&gt;According to the strategy and experience, and according to the objective that the player want to get during the game, he decides what value &amp;quot;to release.&amp;quot; To increase a low value, is necessary to remove the patina that covers the left yellow panel of the paper; to increase the value, without going to far, it is recommended the panel (orange) found to the center; if you need  values of maximum power, it needs to set the right the panel (red) free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
