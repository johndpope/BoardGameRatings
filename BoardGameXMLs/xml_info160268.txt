			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World we live in provides the stage for all sorts of action &lt;br/&gt;pact stories. These tales of cops and robbers, sleuths and spies, and other forms of modern action constantly play out in people&amp;rsquo;s imagination. With that premise in mind, we present this book that allows you to craft a contemporary setting of your very  own, populated by evil villains and desperate situations that call upon the very best your heroes have to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a game of your imagination where you get to tell stories by taking on the rolls of the characters that you create. It&amp;rsquo;s a game that offers a multitude of choices &amp;ndash; more choices than even the most sophisticated computer game, because the only limit to what you can do is what you can imagine. The story unfolds like a movie, except all the action takes place within your own imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume, the Modern Campaign Setting for the 4th edition of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;reg; game, offers a wealth of new character options, including a new race and new classes, new skills, and new feats. It introduces the craft power source used by the Smart Hero, along with a new approach to summoning creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 1 introduces a new race for a high tech campaign world. The Robot makes its d&amp;eacute;but within these pages and provides different options depending on the Progress Level of the campaign. Six new classes make up most of chapter 2. These classes are the Charismatic Hero, Fast Hero, Psychic Hero, Smart Hero, Strong Hero, and the Tough Hero. To add a bit a flare new hybrid classes are also given for each of the main classes for this book, and are compatible with the fantasy setting hybrid classes for more customization. Also in this chapter are 6 new epic destinies that take full advantage of a modern setting and allow your imagination to take off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 3 includes a variety of new options for characters of every class. First are new skills that allow a character to fully interact with the modern world, and additions to older skills found in the Players Handbook. New feats provide additional opportunities for characters to specialize and customize their characters to fully obtain what they had envisioned for it. New backgrounds called occupations that better reflect a modern environment are also present and provide the players the ability to adjust their character in more subtle ways. New to the 4thedition setting but found in earlier settings, Leadership and Reputation make a comeback and allow players to fully realize the true power of a modern campaign. Leadership and reputation are also compatible with the fantasy version of 4thedition in order to bring something new to the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meat and bones of chapter 4 are  the weapons and equipment for all progress levels. New to the 4th edition system is the Gadget and Upgrade system  which  allows Players and Dungeon Masters the ability to fully customize a weapons and equipment from scratch or simply upgrade already designed items. Also new to the 4th edition system is updated vehicle operation rules and crafting rules to create your own equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter 5, the final chapter contains all the fluff that helps you fully immerse yourself in a modern or futuristic setting. Everything in this chapter is optional and should only be used to enhance an adventure. Within this chapter you will find rules for living and lifestyle, space travel, mutations, superpowers, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
