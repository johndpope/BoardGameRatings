			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is the beginning of the LIVING ARCANIS: NISHANPUR Year 2 story arc, which is entitled &amp;ldquo;Confessions and Consequences.&amp;rdquo; The PCs do not have to have played any of the previous Nishanpur modules, although it is helpful if they are at least somewhat familiar with the LIVING ARCANIS universe. Any standard LA character that falls within the legal range of levels for play is fine, but players should be encouraged to play native Canceri characters in this story arc if possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The civil war in Canceri has now entered its second year. The Sword of the Heavens led his armies across Milandir during the latter half of last year. This mighty army appeared to be on the brink of successfully conquering major portions of Milandir, when the Sword of the Heavens disappeared at the Citadel of Silence along with a substantial number of his troops. No word has since come from him, and in his absence, the remainder of the army was crushed at the Battle of Four Armies, which took place near the Milandisian city of Heliadaquae. As winter began to set in, the few surviving members of the Swords of Nier slogged home through the Cold Plains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, as the long winter finally begins to release its icy grip on the land, the Swords find themselves in jeopardy. They still have firm control over the city of Nishanpur, and most of the surrounding portions of Canceri, but despite repeated attacks and protracted sieges, not all the necropolii of the Nerothians have been conquered. The Swords&amp;rsquo; remaining forces are spread very thin, and as a result they have stopped pursuing active conquest and instead are mainly seeking to consolidate power and recruit new soldiers to bolster their depleted ranks. Meanwhile, the population of Canceri grows ever more restless under the iron rule of the Swords. Making matters worse, there are rumors of a plague beginning in the west of Canceri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
