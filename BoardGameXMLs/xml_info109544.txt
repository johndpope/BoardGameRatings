							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Princely Ransom</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Prince Feckless Kidnapped!&amp;quot; the headlines scream on the newsparchments.  You buy a copy and quickly read  the story, looking for an opportunity for adventure and employment.  Apparently Feckless was out riding in the  forest yesterday and was nabbed by a band of brigands who are holding him for, well, a princely ransom.  The  King is distressed and the peasantry is already boiling in anger at the prospect of another unpopular tax hike to pay  off the ransom for the prince.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was written for ideally four Player Characters. A well balanced party should include one Wizard,  a Rogue, and two Warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
