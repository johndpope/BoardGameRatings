							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lake of Pillars</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the gentle rolling hills this small valley acts as a natural basin, both for rain and ground water. Only from a distance does it become obvious that the valley with the small circular lake and the equally circular island at its center are part of a much larger crater. The origin of said crater remains unclear though. In the memory of the locals it has always been as it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the countless hills, covered by moss and grass, this landmark has been used as a meeting point by the local tribes for ages. On the small island surrounded by ice cold waters chiefs have traded and bartered, arranged marriages and lead councils of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Related to the latter are the countless stone pillars surrounding the lake's shores. Although the locals would consider them more of a memento to a large exodus necessary due to population growth and food shortages. Every stone carefully stacked upon another supposedly stands for one tribesman or woman who left the steppes behind forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
