							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Five Golden Rings</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Five Golden Rings&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;12 Days of Christmas&amp;quot;-themed game in which players select cards from a layout in sets (same rank, &amp;quot;marriages,&amp;quot; etc.) with an eye to score the most points.  Players must select cards carefully, however, as end-game bonuses are awarded for holding certain cards and each card selected opens up new plays for opposing players:  in some cases, marrying a Lord a-Leaping to a Maid a-Milking may be the best play; in others, capturing the Partridge in a Pear Tree may be best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artwork for this game comes from the &amp;quot;12 Days of Christmas&amp;quot; stamps issued by Christmas Island in 1977.  These lovely stamps have been a favorite of philatelists and graphic artists since their issue and add to the theme and flavor of this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
