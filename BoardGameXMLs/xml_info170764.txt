			<description>You awake with no recollection of who you are or where you are.&lt;br/&gt;A note from &amp;lsquo;Synthesis Futuristics&amp;rsquo; suggests that you are part of a scientific study, and the procedure may have left you feeling disorientated and with short term memory loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further investigation of your surroundings reveals the existence of a mysterious &amp;lsquo;Project Light&amp;rsquo; and leads you to the conclusion that all is not well. You must search for the answers that will help you piece together the fragmented memories of your past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring stylised graphics and a compelling soundtrack, Light is a minimalist stealth infiltration game with a strong narrative that drives the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use stealth skills to sneak past guards and avoid the gaze of on looking cameras, as you search the environment for the intel that will help you piece together the events of your past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opponents can be killed or stunned; and their bodies dragged out of the way to a safe hiding place. Bodies left in plain sight will attract attention and alert security, making your task even harder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself hacking computers and security systems in a bid to locate the vital intelligence that will reveal the motive behind the sinister &amp;lsquo;Project Light&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
