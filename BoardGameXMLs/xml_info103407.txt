							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Settlers: Rise of an Empire</name>
									
			<description>From the Manual of the Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the mighty Darion empire spanned the known world and brought peace and prosperity to its people and its kings. But alas, those days are long gone. The empire aged and crumbled, brought to its knees by hostile invasions, internal rebellions, and political intrigue. All that remains of this once-mighty empire is a multitude of warring provinces struggling for survival in a hostile world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a world of mystery and hidden danger. A world in which the settlers do not know what tomorrow may bring. A world in which the strong have oppressed the weak for far too long. A world of petty kings and rival kingdoms. A world threatened by the menace of the Narlindir Vikings from the frozen north, and the old Janub tribes from the south.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a king in this shattered land, but a king with great ambitions. For you have the will and the strength to unify the remnants of the old empire, to forge new alliances, and bring about the peace that has been lost for so many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the aid of your loyal knights, you can restore honour and justice to the world. The time has come for new rulers, for new challenges, and for new and glorious deeds. The time has come for the RISE OF AN EMPIRE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
