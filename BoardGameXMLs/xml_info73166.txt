							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Thing: Who Goes There?</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An American scientific expedition to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic is suddenly disrupted by the arrival of a husky, pursued by two Norwegians in a helicopter. The Norwegians fire indiscriminately at the dog. The team members defend themselves and shoot back, killing the Norwegians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It doesn't take long before the Thing (in dog form) attacks the team. One by one, they are picked off and replaced by Thing duplicates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the expedition explores the Norwegian camp, the history of the Thing comes together. Centuries ago - an alien spaceship had crash-landed in the Antarctic. The pilot was thrown clear and eventually froze in the ice. But the Norwegians uncovered it. And then they thawed it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thing is a cellular colony that imitates other beings. It has the ability to alter its own cell structure to that of a consumed organism, and can thus imitate a victim almost perfectly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Thing were to ever reach civilization, it could replicate so quickly that in a matter of days, it would duplicate every living being on Earth. It's up to the PCs to stop it...before the Thing stops them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thing: Who Goes There? is a supplement for D20 Modern that contains five advanced classes, lots of equipment, rules for fear and trust, hazards, and seven Thing variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
