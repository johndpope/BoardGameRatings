			<description>[User summary]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You pilot a mecha (giant robot) inspired by an Egyptian deity (Anubis, Horus or Sekhmet; each has its own pecualiarities and exclusive weapons) and fight against other mechas in various arenas (full of buildings, elevated passegeways, underground areas, etc.) with egyptian textures and names. &lt;br/&gt;In the single-player campaing, each arena offers 20 missions of progressive difficulty (more weapons become available in later missions, but you may have to face up 5 enemies at once).&lt;br/&gt;Some missions are fought by night. Sometimes you have one or two teammates (controlled by the computer).&lt;br/&gt;Each team (even if composed by a single mecha) has a single supply ship dropping equipment at request. Extra equipment can also be found scattered in the arena.&lt;br/&gt;The supply ship may also drop &amp;quot;towers&amp;quot;. They become active after 30 seconds and if there are enough of them around (no more than four can be placed in the same whereabouts) a countdown will begin: after five minutes the team will win (in the meantime, the opponents may destroy enough towers to nullify the countdown).&lt;br/&gt;Each team can win (or lose) either with towers or by destroying every mecha of the other team thrice.&lt;br/&gt;Destroyed mechas respawn, but the third time one is killed, it is out of the game; in multi-player games he lingers around as a &amp;quot;ghost&amp;quot; (unable to interact with anything, but may still be used as a scout by the team).&lt;br/&gt;Up to six mechas can enter the arena, but there are always two teams: Ra (yellow) and Osiris (blue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
