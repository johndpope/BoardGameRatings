			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a Wednesday afternoon some 5,300 years ago, a shepherd headed into the Alps to tend his flock of goats. He would never see his home again. His mummified corpse and violent death have been the subject of study and speculation since a retreating glacier released him from his makeshift grave in 1991, A.D. (or C.E.... whatever.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In observance of the 20th anniverary of the discovery of the victim now known as &amp;quot;Oetzi the Iceman,&amp;quot; and in support of NUELOW Games' goal of educating while entertaining, we proudly present Icing Oetzi: A ROLF! Historical Recreation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of all the research that can be expected for a $0.50 product from a company named NUELOW Games,  the three combat scenarios and four pre-generated characters presented gives insight into a mystery that's more than 5,000 years old. Who killed Oetzi? The religions fanatic? The angry cook? Or the Tyrolean Yeti? Play the Recreations with friends, and decide which one rings true.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included, as a special bonus, is a major rules expansion for ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters. The two pages of additional rules material present new Combat Maneuvers and Traits, as well as optional modifications to existing ones. Also featured are optional rules for Ranged Weapons and an optional modification to the character generation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
