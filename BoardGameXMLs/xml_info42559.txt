			<description>About The Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The policeman catches the robber. The thief is scared of the policeman. Old people are easily fooled by the con artist. Young children are disciplined by mom and dad; ...While the nice angel turns into a nice person to offer help, the devil can also transform into an evil person.  All these interesting things happen when you play this fun card game for the family! So, in the end, &amp;quot;Who's Afraid of Who?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the Game:   &lt;br/&gt;The player who first gets rid of all the cards in his/her hand is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
