			<description>&amp;quot;Dotty Dragon has gone too far now. So his Aunt Dragolina has cast a spell and lots of colored spots have appeared on his face. Poor Dotty! How is he going to get rid of these spots? Only with the help of two children who simply place Dotty Dragon in the middle, and off they go! If they throw the matching color on the colored dice they can make the dragon's spots disappear. Because Dotty's colorful spots can easily be pushed through to the other side of the vertical game display and Dotty is quickly rid of his spots.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
