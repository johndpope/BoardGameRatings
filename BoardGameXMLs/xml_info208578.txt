							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Road to Calemma Vol. 3: Split Road</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City Council of Calemma had given the PC&amp;rsquo;s a final task in the last module.  The council asked of them to find the K&amp;rsquo;Wathuan&amp;rsquo;s hidden village to the North, burn the buildings, slay the men, and enslave the women and children to be integrated into &amp;ldquo;City Life&amp;rdquo;.  The PC&amp;rsquo;s were left with an internal question after finding out the true history of Calemma through the books shelved in Calaith&amp;rsquo;s home.  This land was stolen, and its natural inhabitants displaced.  Sporadic attacks from the K&amp;rsquo;Wathuans, known to the City dwellers as the &amp;ldquo;savages&amp;rdquo;, have increased in nature and more violent with every strike.  The PC&amp;rsquo;s are left with the question; to destroy the remaining K&amp;rsquo;Wathuan people, or side with them and aid them in any way.  (If the PC&amp;rsquo;s just throw up their hands and remain Neutral, this book is no longer needed.  They will just be excused from the City permanently, and never allowed within the walls again.)  But I am sure your party has made its decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module is split into two parts.  The first part is if the PC&amp;rsquo;s decide to follow through with the request made by the City Council.  The Second half is tailored if they refuse.  This module somewhat overlaps the previous when it comes to travelling North to find the hidden village.  It is an extension of the last, and goes into greater detail.  Either way it is really up to you, the Game Master, how you wish to use the information within this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no true linear plot line here, and never has been.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, our group while playing this out, sided with the Calemmans, turned coat once the village was discovered, then acted as spies for the K&amp;rsquo;Wathuans.  So there are limitless options, as with the previous modules!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
