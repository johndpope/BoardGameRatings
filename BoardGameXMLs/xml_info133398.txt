			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dread, the players create their characters and their relationships, and sometimes influence the creation of the setting. You can read the character questionnaires in the other document. Print them and give one to each player. Review them before the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is a Paranormal investigative TV show. They are investigating a haunted house. Supposedly ten years back, a man known as the Faceless Killer lived here and was killed in a shootout with the police. Some of his victims were found, their faces missing. But many were not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is to be the pilot episode for the show. The cabin is in a remote location. Cell phones get no reception here. This is an isotlation scenario. Read below for what happens if the players try to leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
