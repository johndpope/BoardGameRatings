			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the journal of Grath the Buccaneer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;then we stumbled in a massive labyrinth of undersea caves. After a day or so of  wandering we emerged in a large cavern with a yellow-sand beach. To my wonder a whole shipwreck rose from this yellow sand. How the hell that thing came there? My crew started to explore the area and, man, you won&amp;rsquo;t believe what we found&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undersea Caves presents four color maps you can arrange as you wish to form a larger map. You can event print more than one copy of the same map in order to obtain a bigger map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains the following maps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temple of the Frog God&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in the depth of the Undersea Caves the forgotten Temple of the Frog God is an ancient mystery. It is believed the temple was built by a long disappeared race of frog-men...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shipwreck&lt;br/&gt;Nobody knows how that ship came there. Maybe it was something related to the magic of the ancient temple hidden somewhere near the ship. Anyway the ship itself hides many secrets, not to mention the treasure cave said to be very near to the shipwreck...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maelstrom&lt;br/&gt;In the middle of a giant cave the mighty maelstrom swirls at incredible speed eating anything dare to cross the cave. It is said that the vortex leads to a giant cave below where unimaginable treasures wait only to be discovered...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;A labyrinth of  twisted corridors and passages extends undersea. The labyrinth lacks any kind of landmark or feature, becoming this way a true nightmare  for those wanting to cross it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
