							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brit Quiz 2000</name>
									
			<description>An updated version of the original Brit Quiz game...  There are some new questions, and a slight modification to the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to roll a die and move their token that number of spaces round the board.  The player then tries to answer a question determined by both the colour of the space he or she lands on, and the actual number rolled on the die.  If the question is answered correctly the player moves forwards an additional three spaces as a reward.  There is no penalty for getting the answer wrong.  'Up The Creek' is a special category that asks the player to perform an activity as well as answering a question.  If the player answers an 'Up The Creek' question incorrectly he or she must move backwards three spaces.  If the player fails to carry out the activity to the satisfaction of the other players, or refuses to even try, he or she has to move backwards an additional three spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to complete a circuit of the track around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question categories are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yellow - People&lt;br/&gt;White  - This And That&lt;br/&gt;Green  - Showbiz&lt;br/&gt;Blue   - History&lt;br/&gt;Red    - Sport&lt;br/&gt;Orange - Up The Creek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
