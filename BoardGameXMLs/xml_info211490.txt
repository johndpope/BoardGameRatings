			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice Chucker is a roleplaying game. A roleplaying game is a game in which players, using their imaginations, take on the roles of fictional characters within a story. The story unfolds by way of a Game Master who acts as a storyteller. The players control how their characters react to the events of the story as described by the Game Master. Dice are used to add elements of chance so no one knows exactly what is going to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are not familiar with the concept of roleplaying, then this game may not be for you. Dice Chucker is aimed at experienced players who are looking for something new, fun, and different. I find that many players have become disillusioned with the modern gaming industry, and are seeking alternative gaming systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what makes Dice Chucker so unique? Dice Chucker is a rules-lite system that puts a new twist on rolling dice! A lot of players like rolling dice and Dice Chucker is here for them. You will find that Dice Chucker is chock full of dicey goodness!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
