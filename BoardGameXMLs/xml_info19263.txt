			<description>Dead &amp;amp; Breakfast - A Spooky Game for 3 - 6 Players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Your Goal: To Scare the Bejeezus Out of Tourists in a Haunted Bed and Breakfast&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in the October 2000 Issue of Dragon Magazine (#276). The pull-out board depicts a the 6 rooms of a Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast. Every card of a standard 52-card deck is represented by one of the spaces on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also needed: 8 D6 (including 6 of different colors for the guests of the B&amp;amp;B), plus 2 white dice for rolling; a score pad and pencil; about 30 chips in a unique color for each player; a standard deck of cards without jokers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 6 colored dice represent the guests, with the number showing representing their level of agitation (each starts at 2, mildly spooked). Each chip represents a ghost that can haunt a room on the board. Different ghosts belong to different players, which is why each player needs their own color of chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play: &lt;br/&gt;--Draw your hand up to 5 cards.&lt;br/&gt;--Play a card and 'haunt' the room containing the card you played. To haunt a room, place a chip of your color on the top of the stack of chips in that room (unless a chip of your color is on the top of the stack), or begin a stack if none exists. You also haunt adjacent rooms that are already haunted (have chips of any color in the room).&lt;br/&gt;--Move one guest according to the roll of 2 D6&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a guest lands in a haunted room, points are awarded to the ghosts in that room. Points (equal to the guest's spook level - number on the guest's die) are distributed among the ghosts in that room, with more points going to the top ghost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a guest stops in a room that is not yet haunted, the player (if any) holding the card for that room can play the card and 'surprise' the guest, scoring points for scaring that guest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time the a guest lands on a numbered room, their rank (number on die) is increased by 1. If the guest is a 6, they 'freak out'. Freaked-out guests are worth negative points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play ends when the last card is played. Player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few variants are also included in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
