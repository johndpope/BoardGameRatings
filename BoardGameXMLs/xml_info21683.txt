			<description>From the Cheatwell Games webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's a blast from the past; a game of fads, fashions and fun that will take you on a reminiscent ramble through some of the more memorable moments of the last few decades. Great entertainment for young and old alike!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, each player answers a set of questions from cards relating to nostalgia in the UK: 1960s; 1970s; 1980s; TV and Film; Fads and Fashions; and then a catch-all subject Nostalgia Grab-Bag (or something like that, anyway).  The answers for the cards are in the rules booklet and everyone checks their score at the end, like a pub quiz.  And, like a pub quiz, many of the questions are deeply obscure, unless you have a remarkable knowledge of (and any interest whatsoever in) football, soap operas and sitcoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This reminiscent ramble through the momentous events of the  Twentieth Century is a game of fads and fashions...... a timely document of the good, the bad, the funny and the frivolous!!!&lt;br/&gt;From Mods to Punk Rockers; Hammer Horrors to Block Busters; historical events to hysterical clothes, you'll face questions on the weird and the wonderful from those now distant decades of The Sixties, The Seventies and The Eighties.&lt;br/&gt;Bobbing ogs, feely-boppers and flares all make their claim in the &amp;quot;momentary Madness&amp;quot; Hall Of Fame......Whilst the prize for &amp;quot;Pointless Pets&amp;quot; is a close-run contest between Pet Logs, Pet Rocks, stick on Garfields and Cabbage Patch Dolls!!!&lt;br/&gt;It's time to pull up those plastic chairs, light the lava lamps, crack open a Party Seven, pull on your pumps and take a memory-jigging jog through the dusty depths of your collective memories!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Nostalgia Cards&lt;br/&gt;Game Boxes&lt;br/&gt;Rule and Answer Book&lt;br/&gt;Score Pads&lt;br/&gt;Pencils&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
