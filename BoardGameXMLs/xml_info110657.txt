							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goldnaire</name>
									
			<description>You are a renowned gold jeweler &amp;ndash; a master craftsman &amp;ndash; but are you proficient enough to claim the title Goldnaire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with a hand of six cards, with the cards showing various types of jewelry. On a turn, you lay down 1-2 types of jewelry on the table in front of you, then trade with other players for the cards in their hands while trading away what you hold. After trading, you may lay down additional cards from your hand if they match the two types on the table in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have enough points on the table, you can then trade them in for one or more gold bars from the stack. As the gold bars are claimed, the point value needed to claim more rises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can discard cards from your hand, but you receive a penalty point when doing so; alternatively, you can donate cards to other players. At the end of your turn, you refill your hand to six cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the last gold bar is claimed, the game ends. Who will be the Goldnaire?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
