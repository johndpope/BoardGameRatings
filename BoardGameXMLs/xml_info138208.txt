							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baby Doll&#039;s Game</name>
									
			<description>Baby Doll was a comic strip character in Playhour, a favourite comic for the 5's and under. It is a typical Goose-type game and is taken from the 1978 Playhour Annual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;You need a dice and counters to play this game with your friends. Baby Doll wants to get to the doll's house. But to get there, she has to go along a path of stepping stones. You and your friends can have a race to see who gets to the house first. Throw a six to start, then throw the dice again and move your counter along the numbered stepping stones the dice shows. On the grey stepping stones there are things you must do if your counter lands on them. The one who reaches the house first, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
