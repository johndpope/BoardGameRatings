			<description>According to the publisher, this educational card game is &amp;quot;designed to improve vocabularies, improve spelling and provide profitable entertainment&amp;quot;. The game consists of a pack of 72 cards, each of which bears a single letter of the alphabet in large print. The deck has between one and six cards of any given letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six cards are dealt to each player. The dealer begins by playing one of his cards and announcing a word starting with that letter. Subsequent players must play the next letter in a word on the board if they can, or start a new word if they cannot. They then draw a card from the deck to replace the one played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has had a chance to play on a word that has been announced, subsequent players may change the announced word to any other that word that includes in order the letters already played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players get points for completing words, ranging from 5 points for a 2-letter word to a maximum of 1,000 points for a 10-letter word. Each time a player takes a trick by completing a word, he may also &amp;quot;declare&amp;quot; another word for which he has all the necessary letters in his hand. He scores for that word as well, and then ends his turn as usual by drawing a card. Winner is first to 2,000 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
