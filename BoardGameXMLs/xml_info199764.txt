			<description>Supreme Gangster is a fast paced competitive game for 2-4 players, where each player assumes the role as leader of an organized crime gang in a small American town during 1920's prohibition.  You choose from 16 different Capos to manage a crew of street thugs to grow your criminal empire. All players play against one another competing for territory and control of the criminal market.  You will operate criminal establishments all while evading police and gunning your rivals into extinction.  You could even bribe police, judges, and city councilmen to work for you and leverage their positions of power to hinder your enemies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to be the first gang to satisfy one of four different winning conditions before prohibition is repealed.  Winning conditions are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Control the largest criminal empire&lt;br/&gt;2. Bankrupt all rival gangs&lt;br/&gt;3. Kill three rival Capos&lt;br/&gt;4. Bribe all City Officials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game round will consist of all players drawing an Event card which will consist of additional weapons or abilities.  Next, each player starting with the first player takes a turn moving their thugs and Capos to try to control as many illegal establishments as possible.  The more establishments you control the more money and more powerful your empire becomes.  If any rival gangsters work their way into your territory you could remove them by force.   This will consist of either a fight or a gun attack.  Both are resolved easily by rolling dice and adding the total.  At the end of each turn, the player will total up their income and make any purchases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each player has taken their turn, then the RAID phase will begin.  During the RAID phase, the first player will draw  a RAID card.  This could range from establishments being raided or having to accomplish a task to prevent something negative.  When the RAID phase is complete, then the Prohibition Chart moves down one level closer to repeal.  The player to the left becomes the new first player and the next round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So get dressed in your best suit, put on a pot of spaghetti sauce, and don&amp;rsquo;t forget your machine gun.  Will you be the next Supreme Gangster?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
