			<description>A space skill game from the American Toy Works, Brooklyn. The game requires players to use suction cup darts to knock down two rockets that are balanced on a vertical stand that is decorated with a Bulls eye and space scenes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two shots to score points either by hitting the Bulls eye target or knocking the rockets off the stand. Highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;A variation of the game requires players to knock down the left rocket first and hit specific space scenes on the stand before finally knocking the right rocket down to win. Players load the suction cup dart into a shooter that resembles a small wooden bat with a central hole. The shooter has a rubber band stretched over the dart end to fire the dart at the targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Games (A. Malloy) lists the game as being published in 1939.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
