							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jack and the Beanstalk Game</name>
									
			<description>One player is the Giant and the other player is Jack.  The game pieces are of two different colors. But, more appropriately, they are also two different sizes.  The large piece represents the Giant, and the small piece represents Jack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack is safe from the Giant if he rests on any red space. The Giant cannot land on these red spaces and must pass over them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may move in any direction around the paths.  They are not allowed to &amp;lsquo;pass&amp;rsquo; each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts on his home space/star.  They then take turns spinning the spinner and move accordingly.  Jack needs to reach the Red Star of the Giant&amp;rsquo;s castle, and return home, without being caught by the Giant, in order to win.  The Giant wins if he is able to land on the space Jack is on, by an exact spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
