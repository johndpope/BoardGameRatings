			<description>A trump and guessing game on 32 kinds of predators, the cards show a number range, the name of the animal, the size and weight of the animal, the kind of protection it is awarded and the feed of the animal. The cards are dealt, in his turn a player rolls the die and depending on the roll he chooses a very big or a very small number from the information on his cards, the next player answers with his biggest or smallest number in the same category. The player with the highest or lowest number respectively wins both cards. If one player has run out of cards, the player with the most cards wins. Packed in a belt bag, with a predator tooth on a cord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
