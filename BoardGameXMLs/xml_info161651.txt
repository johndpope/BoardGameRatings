							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ASAT: Orbital Combat</name>
									
			<description>ASAT is a board game of orbital combat in the foreseeable future.  Pilot your spacecraft against other spacecraft in Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbit, using simple but accurate orbital physics rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASAT is a PnP, low complexity war game game of space combat in Earth orbit.  As your ship orbits the Earth, use celestial mechanics, and your ship's thrust, sensors, and weapons to close in, target, and attack your opponent - before they do the same to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players control one or more ships orbiting the Earth in one of several discrete orbits.  Turns are meant to simulate simultaneous action.  On each turn, (a) the players (optionally) move using thrust, or let the ships continue in their present orbit, (b) attempt to locate and detect an enemy using sensors, (c) once a detection is successful, attack the opposing ship using weapons, and (d) defend against attacks and tally up inflicted damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until one player's ships are destroyed, or one player is able to retreat by de-orbiting and successfully re-entering the atmosphere to land on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
