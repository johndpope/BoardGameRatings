			<description>The story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Athena is known for being the goddess of war, but she was also the goddess of peace, the protector and the guardian of the city. She didn&amp;rsquo;t like battles, and on the contrary, she was delighted when she was able to stop a fight. This is why she asked to the gods of the four elements: Poseidon, god of seas and waters, Gaia, goddess of earth, Aether, god of air, and Hephaestus, god of fire ; to build a prestigious city-state: EPHYRAN! Each deity would be represented by its element and the aim would be to bring all the mythological creatures representative of the elements to live together! The deities got quickly down to work: a Blue Lagoon for the sea creatures, a Sacred Land for the earth creatures, a Forbidden Forest for the flying creatures and a Fire Mountain for the fire creatures&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems Athena couldn&amp;rsquo;t meet the challenge and today, the city-state has totally disappeared. Totally? It is heard that the present-day town of Corinth is a vestige of the city-state and that is was actually built on EPHYRAN ruins&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proof is that the city symbol is nothing but a winged stallion: Pegasus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes the role of one of the gods and has to build the city-state of Ephyran as prestigious as possible. The city-state must be composed of the 4 gods&amp;rsquo; territories (each territory being divided into 4 areas): Poseidon&amp;rsquo;s lagoon (blue), Hephaestus&amp;rsquo;s mountain (red), Aeolus&amp;rsquo;s forest (green) and Gaia&amp;rsquo;s lands (brown).&lt;br/&gt;To get the highest prestige, you will have to vary the mythological creatures that will live in your city, and add magical tokens offered by the gods. You can also try to get some of the areas which already come with these tokens...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each round, the players can choose between one of the following actions:&lt;br/&gt;Add a Territory to their city (if possible) displaying them according to the territory type next to its god (only one copy of each territory is allowed in a city!).&lt;br/&gt;Play a Support card. &lt;br/&gt;Change a (non-covered) territory of their city by discarding it and replacing it immediately by another one.&lt;br/&gt;Discard a card.&lt;br/&gt;To end their round, the players take a new card on the top of the pile or of the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the pile is empty (without taking into account the discard) or when a player puts the 16th card of his city-state.&lt;br/&gt;Then the turn ends so that the players play the same number of cards, then it&amp;rsquo;s time to count the prestige points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
