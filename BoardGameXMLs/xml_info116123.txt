			<description>A Sequal to Chameleon Twist. The game changed certain aspects of the original, such as the character designs and the switched colors of the main characters. New moves were added such as a parachute that could be deployed to make a slow descent and that could be used in conjunction with the tongue. Moreover, vertical pole swings were added, rather than having only horizontal.The worlds are much longer than those of the first. However, there is no longer a multiplayer mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Chameleon Twist 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
