							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Degenerate Seaside Town</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sonic Legends soundscapes are a blend of music and sound effects specially designed to enhance tabletop and live-action roleplaying games. The music provides an emotive backdrop that helps your players get into the right mood, and the sound effects give you a realistic sonic environment to set your scene in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depraved locals shuffle through the street. Choppy waves assail the docks. Strangely absent are the sounds of boats and the passage of sailors, though an abandoned, decaying rowboat is bumping lazily against the dock it was tied to. Starving seagulls caw their mournful woes as they search the fishless waters. Shops shutter their windows and bar their doors when outsiders approach. Locals whisper gutteral comments to eachother, threatening outsiders with harsh glares and perhaps more sinister threats. A mad drunk weaves through the cobbled streets. The wind off the ocean is mournful, carrying a corrosive sea spray that speeds the town's decay. Every now and then, just on the edge of hearing, something can be heard shuffling about in the upper floors and basements of the dilapidated tenements. Especially great for horror, mystery and pirate-themed games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music and sound design by Matthew Steckler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
