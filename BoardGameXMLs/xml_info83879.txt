							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fast Attack: World War II Coastal Warfare Rules</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In recent years, the war on the &amp;quot;Narrow Sea&amp;quot; has grown steadily in popularity, with several commercial rules sets being available, along with a wide variety of high quality models, mainly in 1:600 scale. However, being an awkward sort, I'm not happy with the rules currently available. The main  reason for this is the scale at which commercial rules operate. They're all designed for squadrons of boats with relatively little attention being paid to detail in terms of individual vessels. These rules are intended to fill in the gap left by commercial sets, and enable you to fight actions in which each vessel is an 'individual.' They're best suited to games with no more than one or three boats per player, as any more tends to result in the game being too slow, and measurements are given in inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set covers Movement, Gunfire, Damage, Fires, Sick-Berth Attendants, Depth-Charges, Torpedoes, Damage Cards, and the use of the Models/Miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Required for play: Ship Models (1:72 scale or similar), charts from the rules, a playing surface with a map or terrain, a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100), string, and a simple set of damage cards (instructions to create these are include in the rules).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #94 (July 1995)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
