			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the year 3535. You&amp;rsquo;re a hyperevolved intelligent whale. You and your cohorts have been selected out of hundreds of petitioners for a rare opportunity: Sufficient psychic energy has accumulated for one of you to Transcend, becoming a being of pure thought. To access this energy, your pod&amp;rsquo;s elders have transported you to Cetacean Ascension Moonbase 8 (CAM 8), a cluster of underground lakes at the polar ice cap of the moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To channel the pool of psychic power and successfully Transcend, you must expand your mental faculties by growing. This requires vast amounts of the lunar krill that live in the lakes. Unfortunately, the seed lakes at CAM 8 can not support enough krill for you grow and ascend. You are not capable of performing the excavation required to expand your lake. Fortunately, you have a small group of giant hamsters you&amp;rsquo;ve genetically engineered to perform specific tasks, such as digging tunnels and harvesting krill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the first to sufficiently expand and flood your network of tunnels, thereby harvesting enough krill to grow and successfully ascend?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
