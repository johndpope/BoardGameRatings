			<description>Adventuring on the World of Mper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party is standing in what a few minutes ago was a normal city street that had been turned into a charnel house. The dead and dying lay everywhere. Despite the minor victory the group understands that they need to move as soon as possible in order to avoid the Deseratan troops. No sooner had they decided on a direction than a couple of gates opened and two off worlders step out. They introduce themselves as a female named Ember and a male named Fin. After some explanations from the party the two decide to throw their lot in with the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set on the world of Mper, this item provides an adventure narrative (much like a session report), with game element presentation.  Some of the content is advertising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
