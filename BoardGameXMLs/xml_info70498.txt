							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Healing Blade: Infectious Disease Card Battle</name>
									
			<description>Note: This is a different game than Healing Blade: Defenders of Soma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;Which are you? - An Apothecary Healer or a Lord of Pestilence? Choose your destiny and determine the course of events in the ground-breaking new game from NerdcoreLearning. Developed by two physician/gamers, Francis Kong and Arun Mathews, The Healing Blade plunges the player into a world of sorcery and creatures, where real world knowledge of infectious diseases and therapeutics play a pivotal role in the winning strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose one of two sides: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Apothecaries, Champions of the Healing Blade whose namesakes hearken from real world antibiotics&lt;br/&gt;     The Lords of Pestilence, Creatures of Disease and manifestations of actual bacterial agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you and your opponent seek domination through corruption and conquest, you must vie not only with brute force, but also with planning, strategy, and most importantly, an astute understanding of microbiology and medical therapeutics. Healing Blade gives you the unparalleled opportunity to enter a fantasy realm where the rules of combat deeply and accurately reflect the real world's battles against infectious disease. Reshape the Battlefield Zone to your advantage. At every turn you control the forces and special conditions that can influence the outcome of each encounter. Each Champion has a unique set of gifts and abilities, and can be upgraded to powerful adversaries by way of real-world phenomena such as resistance and synergy. Summon forth living manifestations of diseases, or counter-attack with antibiotics in the form of powerful warriors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 Instruction Guide &lt;br/&gt;    2 Playmats &lt;br/&gt;    90 High-quality, Fully-detailed Playing Cards &lt;br/&gt;    20 ATP Markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Please see the updated rules at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/915465/new-v2-0-rules-for-the-physical-card-game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/915465/new-v2-0-rules-fo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALSO NOTE: As of May 2015, NerdcoreMedical has Kickstarted a re-worked stand alone sequel of this game called Healing Blade: Defenders of Soma &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nerdcoremedical/healing-blade-defenders-of-soma?ref=bggforums&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nerdcoremedical/healing...&lt;/a&gt; . The new game uses the same characters but the gameplay is now asymmetrical, attackers can gain resistance or unlock powerful mutants, and in general the game plays very differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
