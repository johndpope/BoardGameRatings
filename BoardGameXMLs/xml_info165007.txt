People lived happily and had a healthy and balanced life. The big NUTRILAND FACTORY, managed by MURDOCH and a team of good nutritionists, led by NEUS, made ​​the processing and distribution of food to the entire population.&lt;br/&gt;ALEX GRAND, the terrible villain, seized control of his father&amp;rsquo;s factory with the help of NOSE, a despicable bootlicker and his right arm, and subverted MURDOCH&amp;rsquo;s dream using the Factory to produce and distribute GENEX-100, a caloric compound of his making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before ALEX destroyed everything, NEUS instructed its seven most experienced nutritionists to flee, so that each one would preserve a food group. Thus they became Nutri-Masters and created the seven kingdoms of nutrition where even today they retain the foods that were entrusted to them and the secrets of their incredible NUTRI-POWERS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;30 years later NUTRILAND became gray and entirely dominated by ALEX GRAND, which gave it a new name - GRANDLAND. The population forgot food over time and ALEX became an businessman adored by all and the GENEX-100 the only food available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having realized ALEX&amp;rsquo;s scheme, and having discovered the existence of food, TEO, LENA, BEN and NINA take on the exciting mission to discover the seven kingdoms of nutrition and restore food diversity to GRANDLAND.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
