							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Welcome to Eberron, Powered by Fate</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in 2002, Wizards of the Coast ran their Fantasy Setting Search to allow fans of the game to introduce a new setting to the system. Keith Baker&amp;rsquo;s entry, Eberron burst through the competition and onto the pages of WotC&amp;rsquo;s newest book: the Origin award winning, Eberron Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking all the traditional elements of D&amp;amp;D and applying a pulpy tone and advancing the emulated time from medieval Europe to post-WW1 Europe, Eberron stood out from many other settings with its magi-tech, love of ambiguity and intrigue, and its defiance of genre conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Third and Fourth Edition have guides for playing in the setting and both do the job, many have felt that, due to its pulpy tone, the pulpy, generic system, Fate Core, is a good fit for this setting. That&amp;rsquo;s what this document hopes to facilitate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Eberron, Powered By Fate hopes to be a guide on how to use Fate Core to run the setting. FATE, after all, is a toolkit. Having your tools laid out beforehand is just easier. We will provide options for using alternative systems depending on how you want to emulate the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
