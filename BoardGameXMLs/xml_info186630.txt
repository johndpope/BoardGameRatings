							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombies: A Hunter&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>The dead have always stalked the dark corners of the earth. Since World War II, the number of zombie outbreaks has increased every year, while governments desperately try to cover up the facts. Zombies: A Hunter's Guide contains all of the information necessary to recognize and combat this growing threat. Beginning with an explanation of the historical origins of zombies, it follows their history straight through to the threat they pose to the world today. All varieties of zombie are catalogued and examined, giving their strengths and weakness, with a special emphasis on recognition and elimination. Finally, the book covers the tactics and equipment used in zombie fighting. Accompanied by numerous full-colour reconstructions to help with identification, this book is a must for anyone on the frontlines of the Zombie Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Publisher's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
