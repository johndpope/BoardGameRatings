			<description>From the cover -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How often have you, as a GM or as a player, encountered a description of a gemstone that goes something like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: &amp;ldquo;You have overcome the last trap in the ancient temple. Ahead of you stands the stone statue you have been seeking, a pair of red gems for eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: &amp;ldquo;What kind of gems?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Checks a small table in his book that isn&amp;rsquo;t detailed enough and tries to think on his feet. Remembering that rubies are usually red he says, &amp;ldquo;Uh, they&amp;rsquo;re rubies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: &amp;ldquo;How big are they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: With no clue how to figure out how big the two rubies are, he says &amp;ldquo;Uh, the statue is only 10 inches tall so the rubies aren&amp;rsquo;t that big.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: &amp;ldquo;Are the rubies cut? What shape are they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Slightly curses his players and wonders if he could just convince the party that the statue was never really there in the first place...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe this hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened to you, or maybe not to this degree but, at one time or another, most GM&amp;rsquo;s have encountered a situation like that. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the treasure just generated on the random treasure table in the rulebook that says that the monster the party just defeated has 1d8 gems. What kind of gems are they? How valuable are they? What do they look like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can answer all of these questions with the Gemerator!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Gemerator you can create gems of 75 different types, each with it's own elements of size, cut, color and value. This allows you to create millions of different gems quickly and easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are sample images of each gem type so that you can get an idea of what the gems look like and show them to your players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gemerator is designed to allow you to create detailed gems for use not only in your d20 system campaign, but in ANY setting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
