			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A kid-friendly multiplayer abstract game in which all players try to get rid of as many tiles on hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players get a random starting hand of triangular tiles. There are three types of tiles: racoon dog tiles (that point upwards), fox tiles (that point downwards) and triangle tiles (that can point either way). All tiles exist in four colours. Players take turns placing the tiles to form a mountain built by triangles, but there are placement restrictions, such as tiles must always face the same direction (raccoon dogs must always point upwards and fox tiles always downwards), fox tiles and inverted triangles can only be placed in between two other tiles and must share a colour with one of them, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player can't place any of the tiles he has in hand, he is out of the game and gets penalty points depending on what tiles he has left. Round ends when all players are out of the game, and the game is played as many rounds as there are players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
