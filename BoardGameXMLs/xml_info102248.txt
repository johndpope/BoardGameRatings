			<description>Legend tells of a square island where ancient tribes built 9 temples to 3 gods named Tiki, Taki and Troika. Every summer solstice the neighboring island clans send their finest warriors to the island to compete in a tournament. The first warrior to control three temples in a row will receive the Crown of Three. And his people will rule all of the island clans for the following year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Troika (aka Tiki, Taki, Troika) warriors secretly choose Temple cards and Challenge cards in an attempt to control temples on the legendary square island. Temple cards are simultaneously revealed and if there is a conflict at that location, Challenge cards are revealed and resolved. Since Challenge cards do not move back to a warrior's hand until all four have been played, it would be wise to remember what the other warriors have played in previous rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troika includes three versions of the game. &lt;br/&gt;Tiki - A simple and fast version of the game where the winner is the first player to get three in a row.&lt;br/&gt;Taki - Introduces Bonus Row cards that are randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. Plus the game continues until all nine temples are controlled.&lt;br/&gt;Troika - Introduces Temple Bonus cards. During the game players have the opportunity to take Temple Bonus cards that can increase, or possibly decrease their score at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
