			<description>You are a pizza delivery flunky for Za! Central, which (surprise, surprise) offers a 30 minute guarantee.  To become Employee of the Week and win the coveted Golden Anchovy statuette you have to deliver 10 pizzas on time.  Simple?  Maybe...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a desktop-published game with cards and counters you need to cut out, and a large paper game map.  Each turn you need to spend your 10 movement points to pickup pizzas and deliver them to the proper location.  When players deliver a pizza successfully, they receive Tip cards that can be used to mess with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
