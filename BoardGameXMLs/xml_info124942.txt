							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stories of: Tibet</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to World Building Library: Stories of Tibet. The following article is a collection of Tibetan folklore. Folklore is a socially created story with no single author, embodying the social structure, mores, and practices of a culture. They are orally transmitted, passed from generation to generation, used to teach and reinforce the values and practices of a given culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Tibetan folklore, there are reflections of many influences. There are the virtues upheld in Buddhism: kindness, faithfulness, appreciation, contentment, humbleness, and a giving heart. There are the virtues inherited through interaction with their neighbors and the harsh environment of Tibet: ingenuity, resourcefulness, and cleverness. And finally, there is a fatalism underlying it all, yet Tibetan folklore seems to say, &amp;ldquo;Be a happy, hopeful fatalist.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
