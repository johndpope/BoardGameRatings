These roles may swap each race.  The winner is the person who has accumulated the most money over a racing season as a driver/spectator.&lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 12 players.&lt;br/&gt;Contents include a game board with a generic racing track, instructions, a betting card, 4 plastic race cars (red, white, blue and yellow) and 60 plastic coins (15 each of red, white, blue and yellow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
