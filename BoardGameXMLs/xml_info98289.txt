			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you think you can win at the Big Casino? Step up to the table and deal yourself into Draw Poker for some fast action. Don't let the dealer bluff you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players and the dealer compete in a game of draw poker in which 5 cards are dealt to each player and the dealer. The dealer's cards and the computer robot cards are face down and the player's are face up when it is the player's turn to bet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Betting opens with the player to the dealer's left (right hand on the TV screen). Betting continues until all players, after the last bettor, have folded (withdrawn from the game) or passed. At that time each remaining player including the dealer draws up to three cards. Betting opens again with the player on the dealer's left and continues until all players, after the opening bettor, fold or pass. All the players' cards are then uncovered and the winning hand is indicated and the betting pot is transferred to the winning hand's bankroll. A new hand is then started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer robot players bluff, go for one card straights and flushes and keep kickers. Computer robot players do not &amp;quot;look&amp;quot; at your cards and computerized house dealer deals honestly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
