			<description>This print and play game lets the players compete through chip investments in the forms of plants and animals.  The eventual winner is the one with the most points in chips at the end of the twelfth round or the one who amasses 20 or more chips and has a human in play at the end of a round.  A player must be aware at all times of what his opponents are doing, what cards are in play, how many plants/prey are available and who will be first or last in the turns to come.  The gods are fickle and hunting is always uncertain at best, so to be smiled upon by the die of fate is a must.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
