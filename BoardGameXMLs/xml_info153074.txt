			<description>Produced mid-1980's as a fund raiser for Junior Achievement in the Portland, Maine area.  Instead of streets, local businesses were featured with the smallest being Mr. Potato (a baked potato and fixings fast food restaurant at the Maine Mall food court) and the largest being Unum (a large insurance company).  The game also substituted 'customers' and 'groups of customers' for the houses and hotels used in the normal version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
