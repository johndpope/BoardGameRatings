							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Babylon 5 Station Guide</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb: &amp;quot;It is a time of danger and of hope, a time of unhealed wounds and new opportunities. It is the dawn of the third age of mankind, a dawn whose light casts shadows of the past as indistinct portents of things to come. It is the year 2258, and the human race, still beaten and bloody 11 years after its second great interstellar war, has built what may be humanity's finest achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This achievement is not a ship, not a weapon, not a tool of death of any kind. It is something far grander. It is the galaxy's last, best hope for peace. It is Babylon 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Five miles of metal and polymer, Babylon 5 was born of cutting-edge science and knowledge. Upon this technological stage, however, are played out the oldest of stories - of prejudice and vengeance, of cruelty and charity, of good intentions betrayed by ambition and the price of forgotten history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This box set contains the ultimate guide to the Babylon 5 diplomatic station. Every location, from stem to stern, has been mapped out and detailed. Every sector has been populated and examined. Three books and multiple poster-sized maps combine to make Babylon 5 a living, breathing place that will form the perfect centrepiece of any campaign. From the command officers of C&amp;amp;C to the worst criminals of DownBelow, Babylon 5 has never been treated to such detail.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
