							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">13 Survivors</name>
									
			<description>Do you have what it takes to make it out alive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an elite group of people boards a spaceship and leaves a doomed earth. The deadly virus they escaped from tags along and threatens the last few of the human race. Your goal is to survive the infection and become the individual with the best prospect for humanity's second chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13 Survivors is a micro card game with a constant state of flux. Each card can flip the outcome of the game on its head at any moment. Playing the right card at the right time is crucial for your survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is finish each round with the best possible card (either high or lowest numbered card). A random card is removed every round, which varies the game-play and makes the outcome harder to predict. It is a game of tactics, mind-reading your opponents and a bit of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in either 3 rounds (short game) or 7 rounds (long game). On the very first round, the oldest player goes first. On subsequent rounds, the previous round&amp;rsquo;s winner goes first. On his turn, a player MUST play a card and do its action (unless it's his last and only card, in which case, he passes automatically), after a card&amp;rsquo;s action is complete, it's discarded to a face-down DISCARD pile. Then it&amp;rsquo;s the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn clockwise. The highest-numbered card is normally the best, unless this rule is reversed when the Mathematician card is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all players have only one card left each, they all reveal their cards simultaneously. All and any players with INFECTED cards gain NO points. SURVIVORS win points according to the numbers they end up with, and whether it&amp;rsquo;s the highest or lowest number that wins the current round (see Mathematician card). Best-result player wins 3 points. Second best-result (if any) wins 2 points. Third best-result (if any) wins 1 point. Fourth survivor (if applicable) wins nothing. After the final round, the player with the most total points wins the game! In case of a tie for the first place, play an additional round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
