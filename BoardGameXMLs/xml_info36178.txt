			<description>&amp;ldquo;When Atlantis sunk into the sea, the only survivors who could still occupy the city were the Mermen and the Tritons. Even then, the inhabitants of Atlantis were still plagued with numerous enemies. The evil and powerful Sea Witch has summoned all the enemies of Atlantis together to destroy the city. The Sea King and his faithful allies stand ready to repel the monstrous horde.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays the Sea King, the other player plays the Sea Witch. The object of the game is to kill the opposing commander. Each side has a different allocation of undersea forces, including Mermen, Whales, Giant Sea Turtles, Sharks, Eels, Rays, and Pirhana. Some units are able to use magic. Each unit is rated for Attack Dice, Defense, Movement, and a Hide Factor. The game is played on a hex map filled with deep and shallow water terrain types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
