							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mini Mall</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Mini Mall, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;We need to barricade the front door! Grab food, water, guns, and ammo. And if you see a zombie, put a bullet between its eyes!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mini-mall is a single large map of a mall with a lower and upper floor. The product includes image files for use with your virtual tabletop (VTT). This product includes a single 360-degree panoramic view from the middle of the mini-mall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is intended for use in modern games. Another idea is a Horror-themed game such as a post apocalyptic survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies walk amongst the living and consume their flesh. A group of survivors have banded together. They used a vehicle to drive to the local mini mall to gather food, water, guns, and ammunition. But the endless ranks of the dead amble after them wherever they go. They try to barricade the front door, but the hordes of undead thrash against the barricade. Zombies can also be hidden anywhere in the mall, pouring out from any of the many shops. Can the group gather enough supplies and find a way out of the mini-mall?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
