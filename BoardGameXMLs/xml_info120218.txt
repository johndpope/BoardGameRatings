							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squad Seven II: Le spectre d&#039;Imhotek</name>
									
			<description>Second game in the Squad Seven saga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time the adventure takes place in the great desert of northern Sudan. The Squads explore the mysterious ruins of a temple buried under the sands in order to find the fabulous treasures, but also something else ... may be evidence that we are not alone in the universe and it may already be among us. Clues are hidden on the game cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose their squad and enter the desert and take the turns to reveal cards, which may show treasure or various dangers. Many cards require the player to shoot a target or run round the table before a scream is heard on the soundtrack CD. If they fail, they lose a member of their squad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who recovers the most treasure wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
