			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was officially cancelled or abandoned and is no longer in development. An unfinished version(s) of it may or may not have been made available to the public at some point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breakaway is a multiplayer brawler game in which two teams of four attempt to move a ball (the relic) to their opponent's goal. Each team member (hero) has unique abilities towards these ends, similar to the heroes of the MOBA genre. Each hero can build two structures, such as turrets, healing shrines, and walls. The player can upgrade their structures mid-game with gold earned through the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakaway_%28upcoming_video_game%29 Breakaway (upcoming video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
