							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Admiral On Deck</name>
									
			<description>Admiral On Deck is the first of several planned free expansions for Queen Victoria's Navy. It is being freely distributed, so ownership of Queen Victoria's Navy is not needed to download and view the file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Admiral On Deck introduces several advanced rules to Queen Victoria's Navy. Rules for crew and admiral quality, shore batteries, mines, and smaller ship classes such as torpedo boats are included. Admiral On Deck will allow players to play historical scenarios from the 1894-95 Sino-Japanese war and the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are 6 pages of advanced rules and 1 additional set of game charts. Scenarios are included for the opening engagement between the Chinese and Japanese cruisers that started the Sino-Japanese war of 1895, the Battle of the Yalu (1894-Sep-17, Sino-Japanese war), the Battle of the Yellow Sea (1904-Aug-10, Russo-Japanese war), and the Battle of Tushima (27..28-May-1905, Russo-Japanese war). The appropriate ship and utility counters are also included, in both full color and non-colored versions (but players will have to mount the counters themselves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
