			<description>Dorado in the line SPIEL-O-THEK contains the hits ELDORADO and NUMERI by Rudi Hoffmann.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELDORADO:&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to reach the Isle of Dreams ELDORADO. Each player receives four markers, which are one color (red, yellow, blue or white) on top. All markers are green on the bottom. Players roll a single D6 and move any one of their markers the total count on their turn. Markers can land on top of one another, and, in so doing, trap opponents' markers, or their own until the top one is voluntarily moved off the stack. If a player's marker lands on the white spaces (in the water), that marker is turned into an island (green side up) and is stuck there, able to be used as a stepping stone for other players, for the duration of the game. The marker(s) that reach ELDORADO are stacked in the order that they reach there. Final score is highest for the top marker (last to arrive) and decreases for those lower in the stack. The winner is decided by the player whose marker(s) score the highest total points in the final stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NUMERI:&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives six figures of the same color, numbered from 1 to six. The number on the dice signifies the figures to be played. A player must move figures totaling to the amount shown. If he rolls a six he can move as an example pawn number 2 and pawn number 4. They always move to the next free space that is available on the board.&lt;br/&gt;If the player succeeds in making a chain - that means 3 or more pawns in a row he rolls the dice again.&lt;br/&gt;The game is finished when the last three, specially marked squares are occupied. Each player receives the number of points achieved by multiplying the number of the square by the number of the occupying pawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
