			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A web enhancement for Ruins of Intrigue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruins of Intrigue provides a sprawling venue for adventure. From the deadly environs of the Forest of Towers to the political maneuvering of the Safe Quarter, the characters face a wide array of threats. When running an adventure in the ruins of Serathis, you can never exactly predict where the characters might end up next. This NPC creation kit, a six-page free web enhancement, is designed to make it faster and easier to create the various folk the PCs meet. It covers the following portions of an NPC's background and abilities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name and Background: If you need an NPC in an instant, the tables here allow you to quickly create a character to portray. Unless the PCs plan on fighting an NPC, this is likely all the information you need.&lt;br/&gt;Basic Abilities: Generate an NPC's level and class.&lt;br/&gt;Personality: The NPC's defining characteristics and traits.&lt;br/&gt;When using the kit you still need to take care of generating and assigning ability scores, selecting spells and combat rituals (if any), and picking out feats and skills. Of course, for many NPCs, such a level of detail is not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the tables below are designed for use in Serathis. They don't necessarily reflect the normal distribution of races, classes, and so forth elsewhere in the Lands of the Diamond Throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free web enhancement is designed to work with Ruins of Intrigue from Malhavoc Press, usable in any Arcana Evolved or d20 System fantasy campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
