							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Goblin Pitch</name>
									
			<description>A double-sided card Blood Bowl pitch, complete with matching dug-outs, this is the perfect place for your Goblin teams to play. One side features a slightly worse for wear grass (and mud) pitch, covered in craters and debris &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s even sprouting mushrooms. The other side is the same pitch after an extremely heavy rainfall &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s completely waterlogged, and some unfortunate Goblins have drowned in the craters. The dug-outs are themed to match, and feature score trackers, reserves, Knocked Out and Serious Injury boxes, Down trackers for both halves, and a re-roll tracker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pitch is made to the same specifications as the board included with the Blood Bowl boxed game, and includes rules for play on a waterlogged pitch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
