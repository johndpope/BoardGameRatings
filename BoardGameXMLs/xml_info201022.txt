							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sippa Fish</name>
									
			<description>This 1936 party game consists of four sparkly blue straws and a box full of tissue-paper fish in two shapes (fish and sharks) and six colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet). There are rules for three versions on the inside of the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Shark! Shark! game, a mix of 20 fish and two sharks go in a bowl, and everyone tries to use the straws to suck fish out of the bowl and into one in front of them. Anyone caught with a shark on their straw is penalized three fish, and the accuser gets three extra in his bowl. If falsely accused, the penalty and bonus goes the other way. The player with the most fish wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Relay Race, teams of two run a course across a room or porch, and the first player has to hand off the fish to the second player straw-to-straw. In Rainbow Sippa, players compete for the most points from a mixed bowl with each color counting a different number of points from 1-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game included only four straws, there is a health note at the bottom of the rules: &amp;quot;For sanitary reasons, see that each Sippa is used by only one person and then destroyed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
