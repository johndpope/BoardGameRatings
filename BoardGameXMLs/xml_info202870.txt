			<description>Arma virumque cano&lt;br/&gt;(I sing of arms)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the great golden giants, the gigas, had left, the servant race was left on the planet.&lt;br/&gt;The former servants of the giants fought over the super weapons, the relics that the gigas had left behind, and a horrible war began. It was the start of the &amp;quot;kleeronomos makhia&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What race will win the relic and become the new rules of the planets?&lt;br/&gt;This is the clash of heroes from all races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arma is a hardcore card effect management game.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a deck of ten cards 1&amp;ndash;10, and will need to choose 4 of which to use the special effect, and use these skills and the remaining numbers to gain the relics. Some skills are available to all races, some are unique. It's your choice how to use them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a mix of numbers, hand management, timing of card effects and outsmarting the opponents. Only the winner can be the one who sings of arms!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
