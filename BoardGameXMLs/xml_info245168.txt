			<description>The distinctive Baldwin RF-16 with Sharknose design comes to Train Simulator, from Digital Train Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1948, Baldwin Locomotive Works began to apply a new Sharknose body style to its cab unit diesel locomotives, partly to differentiate Baldwin locomotives from its competitors, but also to distance the new locomotives from early Baldwin diesels that were plagued with mechanical problems. The Sharknose style was inspired by the Pennsylvania Railroads T1 class duplex steam locomotive, some of which were built by Baldwin. The first locomotives to receive the new styling were the Baldwin DR-6-4-20, which was carried through subsequent Baldwin locomotives, including the RF-16. The RF-16 quickly gained a reputation as a reliable and rugged locomotive with heavy pulling power. Many of the units saw service hauling coal drags, where these characteristics were put to best use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 109 cab-equipped A units were built between November 1950 and May 1953, along with 51 cabless booster B units, for three main railroads - the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Withdrawals of the Class began in the early 1960s and by 1971, all but two of the units had been sold for scrap units 1205 and 1216 were to be scrapped in 1974, but were saved by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad for freight services until 1981. The two units have since reportedly been stored on the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad, inside a warehouse that is inaccessible to the public. The Baldwin RF-16 Sharknose for Train Simulator, from Digital Train Model, is available in Pennsylvania Railroad livery and features position lights, number board lights, cab and instrument lighting, engine room lights, opening cab doors and windows, and cab heater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are a number of freight cars, including a 40ft Boxcar, 50ft Boxcar, 53ft Flatcar, Tank Car and Caboose. The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the PRR RF-16 Sharknose on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Horseshoe Curve route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three scenarios for the Horseshoe Curve route:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Night Switching&lt;br/&gt;    Preparing a Train in Altoona&lt;br/&gt;    Working with Sharks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Baldwin RF-16 Sharknose in Pennsylvania Railroad livery&lt;br/&gt;    Features including position lights, number board lights, cab and instrument lighting, engine room lights, opening cab doors and windows, and cab heater&lt;br/&gt;    Freight cars, including a 40ft Boxcar, 50ft Boxcar, 53ft *Flatcar, Tank Car and Caboose&lt;br/&gt;    Quick Drive compatible&lt;br/&gt;    Scenarios for the Horseshoe Curve route&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
