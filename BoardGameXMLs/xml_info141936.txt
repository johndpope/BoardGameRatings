			<description>Snake Clash is a simple and fast Print &amp;amp; Play board game inspired by the game in the Tron movie (1982). The rules of this game are very simple, it can be learned in 1-2 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snake Clash is a line-drawing game. The goal is to create the longest snakes. The winner is who has the highest total length of his/her 4 snakes at the end of the game. Each player can start one snake from each side of the play-field (from one of the four larger circles). One snake from left, one snake from above, one snake from right and one snake from below (4 snakes in total.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player's turn comes after each other. Player rolls a die, that determines the allowed direction(s) of his/her next line-segment. (There is a compass on the play-field that shows the directions associated to die-roll.) He/she can extend one of their snakes by a new line-segment. (Or start a new one, if he/she doesn't started 4 snakes yet.)&lt;br/&gt;Snakes can't cross each other and can't touch the same point on the play-field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When each player have least one finished snake (When the further lengthening is impossible.), the game changes. No more die-rolls, players can freely draw a 1-segment line to any adjacent point from the end of any of their snakes.&lt;br/&gt; When nobody can draw lines anymore, the game is ended. The player wins, who has the largest total line-segment number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
