							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cults of Dagon</name>
									
			<description>Cults of Dagon is a print and play game of set collection and insanity for 2 to 4 players. The game is a work of fan fiction based on H. P. Lovecraft's story Dagon. The game is distributed for free, and anyone who is interested in playing it is allowed to make a copy for themselves and their friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cults of Dagon players control groups groups of 5 cultists traveling around the world to seek the knowledge and tools to summon the sea god Dagon. The tricky part is that too much knowledge may lead them to insanity, reducing their effectiveness for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn 6 cards are drawn from a deck of artifact cards. Each card represents a type of artifact (book, map, dagger, etc) and has a numerical value between 1 and 6. Players alternate placing their cultists on the cards. They cannot place cultists where they already have a presence, and must outbid by at least one the player with majority on an occupied card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all cultists have been assigned, each card goes to the player with majority. The cards are arranged in sets (books with books, etc), and if the numerical value of a set reaches or exceeds the Insanity Value for that game, a cultist of that player goes insane and is removed from the game. The set that went bust is turned face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until the deck runs out of cards or a player loses 3 cultists. Players score the value of their face up cards. Each face down set is worth the Insanity Value of the game, regardless of card values.&lt;br/&gt;Highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains two mini expansions: Dark Visions, and Devious Plots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
