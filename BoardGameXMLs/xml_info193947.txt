							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eye for an Eye</name>
									
			<description>An innovative, realtime, dice driven game of arena combat. As an Occulite Chief it's up to&amp;nbsp;YOU&amp;nbsp;to defend your tribe's honour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No turns. No downtime. No mercy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eye for an Eye is an gladiator-like skirmish game played in an arena with spaces marked by hexes. Players control one character (usually an Occulite Tribal Chief) trying to settle a dispute with another tribe or tribes (the other players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other skirmish games, Eye for an Eye is played in real time with a soundtrack timing the action. So there are no turns and players can call out and resolve actions whenever they want to trigger them.&amp;nbsp;â€‹&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions are powered by allocating dice to different spaces on the player&amp;rsquo;s board and cards. Each character has its own set of skills and restrictions on dice placement. It is likely that you will quickly form a bond with your favourite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play a single round in five minutes, or an entire tournament in one hour!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
