			<description>This is Bomberman's first appearance on the PlayStation.  This version maintains the style of play of the 2D Bomberman games, but tips the familiar overhead perspective in a more 3D, isometric angle.  While Single Player Mode and Multiplayer Modes are similar to past Bomberman games, this version of Bomberman features a Special Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mode allows the player to play a special level with a pre-determined amount of time to complete (only options are two-minutes and five-minutes), as well picking a selection of items to start with. There are three selections, each containing three different items, or amounts of a certain item. The object of the Special Mode is to rack up as many points as you can, done best by defeating numerous enemies within the same blast of a bomb, and picking up letters. Defeating the Boss at the end of the level yields a large amount of bonus points. The game is over once the player dies, or defeats the boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a game ends, the player is ranked on the amount of points he or she acquired before they lost or won. Higher points will result in a positive ranking (like Good Bomber) and low points will result in a negative ranking (like Worst Bomber). It is unclear whether or not the rankings have anything to do with the game (due to the face that there is no High-Score board) other than being a self-accomplishment for the player to achieve the best ranking possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Bomberman World , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
