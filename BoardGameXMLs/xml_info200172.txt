			<description>This two-player game says on the board that it was &amp;quot;approved by United Airlines&amp;quot; and appears to have been developed as marketing tool. The back of the board features a large picture of a United Airlines two-engine &amp;quot;Mainliner&amp;quot;. The front of the board features a UAL logo. And the playing surface - a map of the United States overlaid with a grid of squares 13 wide and 9 deep, seems to include UAL's entire route map in red lines - even though these lines have nothing to do with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has five planes and starts from either New York or San Francisco. Each player must also pick up 10 pieces of baggage en route to the opposite base city. At the start of the game, each player puts the other player's baggage in the most inconvenient pattern possible, since the goal is to be the first player to reach the destination city with all five planes having picked up all 10 bags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player may move each plane only one square, either directly or diagonally ahead. Moves North and South are only allowed in the home airport bands on either coast, and planes may never move backward toward their starting airport. If a plane of either player is adjacent in a legal direction, the moving player may jump over the other plane as in checkers but without removing it. Jumps are free moves, and multiple jumps are allowed, followed by a final square forward as usual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success depends on artful placing of the opponent's bags, careful planning of a five-plane route that will both reach all bags and enable as many jumps as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
