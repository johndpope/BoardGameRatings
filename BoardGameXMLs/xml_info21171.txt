			<description>From Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Kaleidomaze is a simple to play board game in a new dimension, which offers you the most unique experience of zigzagging through a maze - AN EVER CHANGING MAZE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to score from your opponents by taking over their BASEs and trapping their SUBJECT tokens in the maze with your STRESSOR peg. It sounds easy! But remember that your opponents are also trying their best to do the same - taking over your base and trapping you in the maze. Under these competitive conditions, the players manipulate the existing maze into a dynamic ever changing maze, that is KALEIDOMAZE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in life, very often you than CHANCEs (cards) for better or worse; and occasionally save one or two CREDITs (cards) to be used under certain adverse situations. Sometimes you may encounter such a dilemma of being trapped by your competitors; but fortunately many times you are able to develop intricate strategies and tactical moves to revert the embarrassment. Very often, your goal appears so close and yet it suddenly becomes so far. Many times, it appears so unlikely and yet it suddenly becomes so easy. This is KALEIDOMAZE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You need strategy, judgment and luck to win the game. The rules are simple, and the skillfully designed gameboard and playing pieces allow you a wide choice of moves. This puzzling maze, being manipulated by you and your opponents, many times is very rewarding, but can also become a frustrating and aggravating challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
