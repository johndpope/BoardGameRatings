							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Inhabitants of the Dark: Savage Drow (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the brutal world of the Savage Drow in this new supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The savage drow are a civilized race that favour strength above all else.  Those that are weak are not fit to live and are dealt with as shameful by their families.  Fighting is encouraged and games of subtly are seen as shameful.  This does not mean that these typical actions of the drow do not happen they are just less frequent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In side you will find the Savage Drow fully stated out with 15 new alternare racial traits and 9 new traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also are 15 new feats, 4 houses fully stated out with options and 6 factions also with options for membership. There are 6 new gods, 8 new demonic and devilish subdomains, new armour and weapons, 7 new spells, 4 typical Savage Drow cities and two new monsters with animal companions to put into your campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
