							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Delving Deeper: Bard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many ways, the bard can be seen as an ideal adventurer &amp;ndash; a little like a fighter, magic-user, historian and sage - but a master of none. Above all, bards are artists and entertainers. Some memorize and recite ancient tales of glory and defeat. Some are proficient thespians who act out folk tales and morality plays. Others become master musicians or singers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find an optional Bard class for Labyrinth Lord and other Basic Edition Fantasy games. It includes descriptions of abilities like Legend Lore, Charm Person/Monsters, Read Languages, Use Magic User/Elf Scrolls as well as tables for Bard Ability and Level Progression. This product has been formatted so that it can printed out and placed in a folder or a rule book for easy access during game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
