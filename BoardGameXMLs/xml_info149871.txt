							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Templates: Headless Horseman (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop &lt;br/&gt;He's out looking for a head to swap &lt;br/&gt;So don't try to figure out a plan &lt;br/&gt;You can't reason with a headless man!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn your NPC or favorite humanoid monstrosity into a decapitated rider who haunts the trails, paths, and roads that pass through the wilderness. Turn the quest for its lost head into your next adventure or make him the servant of your true villain though the possession of the horseman&amp;rsquo;s head.  Give him unique mounts or leave him with the traditional horse. Let him be the iconic mercenary or perhaps a female dragon rider.  Enjoy the classical terrors or throw something truly new at your players while still taking advantage of the emotional response players have to the headless horseman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brought to you by the same author who has brought you Book of Monster Templates, 101 Not So Simple Monster Templates (Pathfinder), 101 Monster Feats, 101 Variant Monsters and a new free monster template in the Pathways e-zine each and every month for over 30 issues. Bring dread and terror back into your game with the Headless Horseman!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
