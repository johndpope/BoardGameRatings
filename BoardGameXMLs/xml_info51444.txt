			<description>A printed cloth, three unique dice, six normal d6 and some tiddly-wink style counters with the rules enable you to play five dice-games popular amongst sailors and other travelling folk.&lt;br/&gt;Extra components are for Crown &amp;amp; Anchor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing cloth denotes 6 symbols (Heart, Spade, Diamond, Club and of course, a Crown and an Anchor). These 6 symbols are displayed on the faces of the unique dice included.&lt;br/&gt;One person is elected as the banker. Players use their counters to 'place bets' on the symbols on the cloth. The banker then rolls the 3 dice and pays out pro-rata where players have correctly bet on the symbols rolled.&lt;br/&gt;If one symbol has been guessed pay evens for each token;&lt;br/&gt;two symbols pay twice;&lt;br/&gt;three symbols matched, and the baker pays triple.&lt;br/&gt;The rules state that the banker should rotate as the odds are in their favour(?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules also given for four other dice games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drop Dead: Use 5 dice and a scorecard. A game for any number of players.&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn throws the five dice. The score is noted but a 2 or a 5 score zero points and the offending die is removed. The player throws again with the number of dice that didn't score 2 or 5. This score is added to his first throw. This process continues until finally the player throws 2 or 5 with his remaining di(c)e, thus losing them and ending his throw. His final tally is recorded and the 5 dice are given to the next player to construct his score. The winner is the person who scored the highest total in a set number of turns or predetermined time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yankee Grab: A game for 3 or 4 players using 3 dice.&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn throws the three dice. The highest of these is set aside, and the player rolls the two remaining dice. The highest of these is set aside again. These two numbers are totalled and then multiplied by the last dice after it has been thrown again. The score is noted and the next player has his three throws.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score wins the round. It is traditional to play 10 rounds with the winner having won the majority of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5000: A game for any number of players using 6 dice.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to accumulate 5000 points. The dice score as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Any 5 scores 50 points&lt;br/&gt;Any 1 scores 100 points&lt;br/&gt;Three 2's score 200&lt;br/&gt;Straight 1 to 6 scores 1500&lt;br/&gt;6 of a kind = instant win 5000 points&lt;br/&gt;Three 5's score 500 points&lt;br/&gt;Three 6's score 600 points&lt;br/&gt;Three 1's score 1000 points&lt;br/&gt;3 pairs score 500 points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play: The 1st player throws the 6 dice. The dice which score are set to one side and the remaining dice can be thrown again. Scoring dice are again put to one side. This can be repeated as many times as necessary. A player does not have to put aside all scoring dice if he does not wish. In each turn a player must score at least 350. This is called the BASE SCORE. After the base score is reached the player has the option to STICK or continue throwing. If he sticks the points scored in that turn are noted and play passes to the next player. With each throw of the dice at least one die must score and increase the point count of that turn or the whole score for that turn is lost, and play passes to the next player. If all 6 dice score and have been placed to one side, all six may be thrown again. One can continue as long as the score is improved with each throw.&lt;br/&gt;When a player has stuck or lost his turn, the dice pass to the next player, who must either score 'base' ot at least 50 points more than the previous player's score for that turn, whichever is greatest. Failure to do so means that the score for that round is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotation: A game for any number of players using 2 dice.&lt;br/&gt;The possible totals that two dice can make are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.&lt;br/&gt;There are 11 rounds to this game - one for each total. In teh first round the players each try and score a total of 2. If he suceeds 2 is added to his score. In the second round players try to score a total of 3 etc. E,g. in round 7 when players are trying to achieve a total of 8, a player throws a 5 and a 3. 8 points are therefore added to his score. The person with the highest total after 11 rounds is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
