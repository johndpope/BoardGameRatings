			<description>Pic Pic, known in Japan as PikuPiku: Toku to E Ninaru Mitsu no Puzzle (ピクピク ～解くと絵になる３つのパズル～?), is a puzzle video game by Success for the Nintendo DS. The game is divided into 3 different logic-based picture puzzle games: Maze Paint, Drawing and Magipic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pic Pic contains three modes of play, the first and simplest is Maze Paint, in which players must connect an entrance to an exit using lines, which later reveal a complete picture on the top screen. In Magipic, the second mode of play, the players must turn gray tiles into a black tile according to numbers on the tiles. The last and most critically acclaimed mode of Pic Pic is Drawing[3] in which users play on a grid with numbered white and black tiles. The players must draw lines between identical numbers without intersecting other lines, the line being as long as the number of tiles as the number on that particular tile. As in the other modes, completing the puzzle will create a picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Pic Pic&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
