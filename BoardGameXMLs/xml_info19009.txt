			<description>Task Force Games released this supplement to ease new players into the complex game system of the Star Fleet Battles series. The first four scenarios are solo and each gives the player newly learned rules to put into play. After the first four, it's one-against-one. There are a total of 12 scenarios; after that you graduate up to the Basic Set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what the back of the book says, &amp;quot;Out-think, out-shoot, and out-maneuver your opponent in warp speed dogfights throughout the galaxy. Cadet Training Manual places you in the command chair of the Fedration starship Constellation, where you will learn the skills of a starship commander in easy-to-grasp steps. As you continue through the manual, the mysteries of the Romulan cloaking device, Klingon disruptors, and elements which make every race unique will be revealed to you. You will have the opportunity to command ships of every race as you enter the universe of Star Fleet Battles.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product re-implemented a earlier product known as Introduction to Star Fleet Battles, which was released in 1986 for the Star Fleet Battles Commander's Edition. Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition replaced the Star Fleet Battles Commander's Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Fleet Battles Cadet Training Manual was released as a replacement for Introduction to Star Fleet Battles for the Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1996, Star Fleet Battles Cadet Training Manual was redone, and renamed Star Fleet Battles Cadet Training Handbook and it is now free to download at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.starfleetgames.com/CadetTraining.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.starfleetgames.com/CadetTraining.shtml&lt;/a&gt;. The 3 key files are those with &amp;quot;Cadet Training Manual&amp;quot; in the link title though the PDFs are the revised (&amp;amp; expanded) &amp;quot;Cadet Training Handbook&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
