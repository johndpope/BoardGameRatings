							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Abandoned Riad</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 24 x 20 inch,battlemap of an Abandoned Riad, with Square, Hex and No Overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes includes the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;That riad has been abandoned for a long time for a reason. The old hotel is haunted by the ghosts of past guests. Rumors say that there are untold treasures in the riad that the ghosts continue to protect long after their death. I will drive you there only at three times the normal price and only during the day. I will drive only as close as I dare then you will need to walk the rest of the way.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Riad Valet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A riad is a traditional Moroccan palace or house with an interior courtyard garden typically with a swimming pool or bath in the center of the courtyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandoned Riad is a single level map of the exterior of an old riad. The trees outside have become wilted from a lack of water and care. The riad itself has been covered by moss, ivy, and bird droppings from years of not being cleaned. The map depicts the second story balcony with a small atrium built on the first floor with a swimming pool or bath built into the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandoned Riad is intended for use in fantasy, horror, pulp, and modern games. It could also be used in a post-apocalyptic game as a ruined hotel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Haunted Riad:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This old riad was built in Morocco and dates back twelve centuries. However, it was attacked and all of its inhabitants killed by Portuguese in 1510 as they established the Kingdom of Fez.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since that time, the riad has been haunted by ghosts that remain angry about their unfortunate death. Rumors remain rampant that gold was the reason for the attack and despite the efforts of the Portuguese to find the gold; these rumors insist that they never found the treasure as it was too well hidden in a secret compartment in the riad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group plays as treasure hunters who have come to Morocco in the 1939. Not only must they contend with the supposed ghosts in the riad, Nazis are also after the gold perhaps accompanied by Spanish troops loyal to Francisco Franco from Spanish Morocco. Can the group get the gold and keep it out of Nazi hands?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
