							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mystic Towers</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Mystic Towers is a computer game created by Australian  developer Animation F/X and published by Manaccom  domestically and Apogee Software internationally. It stars Baron Baldric, a geriatric wizard with a magic walking stick and an array of amusing mannerisms, who must quest through twelve towers and rid them of monsters. Mystic Towers is a sequel to Baron Baldric: A Grave Overture, a platform game in which Baron Baldric battled an evil sorcerous ancestor. The earlier game, originally written for the Amiga and later ported  to the PC, was published by Manaccom and not released outside of Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each tower consists of 45 rooms (5 floors with 9 rooms), 15 monsters, and 1 monster generator. Upon entering the tower, the door slams shut. To exit, Baldric must defeat all the monsters, destroy the monster generator, and obtain the Large Red Tower Key that opens the main door at the start of the level.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Mystic Towers , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
