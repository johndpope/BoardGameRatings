							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Las Vegas Poker &amp; Blackjack</name>
									
			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hit! Stick! Raise! Discard? Drop! You win! One or two players can play against the dealer in Las Vegas POKER &amp;amp; BLACKJACK. Rules are identical to Las Vegas table rules. You have a choice of BLACKJACK or three different POKER games, and if you &amp;quot;win,&amp;quot; you can carry your pretend winnings from one game to another. Keep in mind you'll need to be sharp to outplay the computerized dealer -- he knows what he's doing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackjack * 5 &amp;amp; 7 Card Stud * 5 Card Draw Poker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole idea is fun! You'll place your pretend bets and watch your simulated &amp;quot;WALLET&amp;quot; grow. Or watch it shrink as Lady Luck and your own card playing skill dictate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring on the Dealer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you press View Disc on either hand controller, animated Dealer will appear on your TV screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember: he's computerized. He &amp;quot;talks&amp;quot; to you by means of cartoon balloons. Sometimes he only deals and acts as banker (Blackjack). Sometimes he participates (Poker)! Keep watching his eyes. He's shifty!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
