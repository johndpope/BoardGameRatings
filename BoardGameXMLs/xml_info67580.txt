			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for ALBEDO The Role-playing Game, Second Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago a bitter battle was fought.  Now the debris from that battle and bits of wreckage, floats in space, abandoned and alone.  The player characters are wrecked near The Drift.  They must improvise repairs to their wrecked ship from other ruined ships as their air and food grow dangerously low.  Hungry, with interpersonal problems complicating their efforts, and air leaking from their ship, will they succeed in time to survive?  Is The Drift is even more dangerous than it seems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
