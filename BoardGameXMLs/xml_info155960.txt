							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golden Age of Racing</name>
									
			<description>The mid 1960's was a time of racing legends. A time when race car drivers were the real heroes. Golden Age Of Racing gives you the chance to relive the best years of Grand Prix racing. These cars are high horse-power, no downforce, rear-wheel drive works of automotive art. Take to ten of the most challenging tracks on the international circuit against incredibly intelligent opposition that knows how to hold a grudge. So strap yourself in to the seat and start your engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only your reflexes can save you now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The incredible power of these legendary vehicles feels like nothing you've played before.&lt;br/&gt;     Exhibition, Time Challenge, Championship Season and competitive two-player split-screen modes.&lt;br/&gt;     The Trophy Room maps out your race to victory, listing your race wins and revealing a wealth of unlockable content.&lt;br/&gt;     Seen a great pile-up mid race? Instantly view it at a variety of speeds and angles, then carry on racing when you're done!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
