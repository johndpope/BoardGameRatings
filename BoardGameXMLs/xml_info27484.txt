			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s a Weird, Weird Galaxy! is a space race and resource management game. Each player, starting from their home world, flies their starship about the galaxy engaging in interstellar trade in order to earn enough Space Bucks to build a string of space stations stretching from their home world to the center of the galaxy. The first player to complete their seventh space station wins. However, nothing is that easy! Each space station cost more than the last one to build. Each space station also impedes the path of opposing starships. Finally, there is this weird space alien, affectionately known as &amp;ldquo;Phredd&amp;rdquo;, and looking vaguely like a camel the size of a small moon that randomly flies around spitting on stuff and generally balling up the works. But, hey! It&amp;rsquo;s a weird, weird galaxy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was an entry to the Mesomorph 1 Piecepack Contest, designed for a standard piecepack and one expansion (plus 12 counters for each player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
