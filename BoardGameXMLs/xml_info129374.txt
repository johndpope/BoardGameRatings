							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Elemental Clash: Unicum</name>
									
			<description>The Tribal Wars are over and the land is now divided into many kingdoms, reigned by iconic, mighty Lords, Kings and Queens who have emerged from the realm of myth and lore. Deep inside of the cold, snowy Northern Mountains, Isengrimm resides in his Golden Halls to rule over the Dwarfs, who delve deep into the rock to fill their lord's treasuries with gold, silver and precious gems. In Darkwood Forest, Xilvox reigns supreme over his countless Alben minions. Known as the King of the Clouds, Goldfeather is the lord of all Griffins and ruler of the Skies. On the southern islands Lord Zephiros, the Master-Mage, has his domain and guards many arcane secrets which are the key to his enormous magical powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth expansion to Elemental Clash &amp;ndash; Unicum &amp;ndash; brings you 72 exciting, all-new cards. Command mighty &amp;quot;Unique&amp;quot; Creatures or cast powerful &amp;quot;Unique&amp;quot; Spells (cards which are so powerful your Spellbook can only have one copy of them). Also, a new ability &amp;ndash; Immunity &amp;ndash; is introduced and four new, exciting races make their debut: Albs, Griffins, Fish and Dwarfs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&amp;rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). If a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
