			<description>In Patron&amp;rsquo;s Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute;, you are a lord or lady in the Middle Ages and the time has come for your wards to receive higher education.  You will attempt to give them the best education possible by sending them to classes where they will eventually gain proficiency and use their knowledge to teach their own classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patron's Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; is a two to four player worker placement micro-game.  The game consists of 12 cards, which are: 7 class cards, 4 player credentials cards, and one Core classes card.  Additionally, there are three punch cards that contain various markers for tracking resources and player pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
