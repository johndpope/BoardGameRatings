			<description>Are you in the market for some revolutionary diet pills? A hair-growth treatment centre? How about a nice, old fashioned Russian dating website? Well, you will be soon! Flip over a product card, roll those dice and use the letters to write an advert for some of the strangest products that the internet has to offer. When you&amp;rsquo;re satisfied, hand them over to the judge. Once they&amp;rsquo;ve picked their favourite, a new product gets revealed and the dice are rolled again. The first player to write three pieces of award-winning Clickbait is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
