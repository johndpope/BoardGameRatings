							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Goodfellas</name>
									
			<description>Goodfellas is a party game for 4-6 players. A remake and retheme of the basic game and mechanics for Advanced Civilization, Goodfellas pits 1920's era mob bosses against each other. Each player starts with a plan to build their empire, focusing on Italian restaurants, speakeasies, barber shops and other familiar tropes. Starting back in their respective neighbourhoods, players assign their thugs to different locations where they can gather weapons, recruit more thugs, or otherwise build up their organization. In order to complete their empire they will need to go &amp;quot;downtown&amp;quot; where the real goodies are. The problem is downtown is small and everybody is trying to control the same bit of turf in order to get the materials they need. Get ready for the blood to flow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using beloved conventions of the mafia genre, Goodfellas will have players picking between tommy guns and piano wire, telling each other to &amp;quot;fuggetaboutit&amp;quot;, and ALWAYS taking the cannoli in this fun game intended to make you laugh and strategize at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
