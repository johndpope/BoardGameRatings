							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baby Hunt</name>
									
			<description>Find your baby, play as 1 of 4 animals. For children of all ages but aimed at children of about 2 to about 6. The Fun Factor is high for that age group, unless you are playing with your child and teaching them how to play Baby Hunt. This game teaches children how to use color recognition, take turns, keep secrets, use strategy, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player places their Animal of choice at the animals home base, each animal has its own home base. The babies are placed in their places, each also has its own place. The game is then ready to play with players rolling the die and moving to the space that they rolled, each player gets a turn. No one knows whose baby is whose until a player has reached one of the four babies and takes a peek, that player and only that player knows if the baby is theirs or if it belongs to someone else. Once a player find their baby the player then races for the home position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
