							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Takeover: The Stock Market Game</name>
									
			<description>Takeover is a stock game with simulations of standard market mechanics and an additional twist of &amp;quot;hostile takeovers&amp;quot;. Players must build up their financial portfolio by risking money on long or short selling, playing the variations in the market, using margins and generally speculating. Players roll and move around a Monopoly-type board, with landing spaces and card draws giving various options. The board features an outer track where stocks can generally be purchased, and an inner criss-cross track where gambles and takeovers predominate. Purchasing of stock is unlike standard Monopoly exclusivity: when landing on a square, the active player may purchase up to 40% of available stock, and then all other players may also purchase stock. Disclosure rules generally limit ownership levels except for takeover situations. Typical brokerage mechanisms such as longs, shorts, margin calls, warrants, Futures, dividends, etc. are incorporated into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with three difficulty levels, with the goal of the full-difficulty-version involving acquisition of shares in every company in one of the four &amp;quot;market groups&amp;quot; and absolute majority of one of the companies in that group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was endorsed by the Toronto Stock Exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
