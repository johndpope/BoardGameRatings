							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duckies in Lofoten</name>
									
			<description>A merchant ship carrying thousands of small plastic duckies has shipwreck in the middle of the ocean. Duckies have fallen into the water and have swept away by the current to Lofoten islands (Norway). Duckies are cute and funny, but they endanger the ecosystem of the islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fishermen, seeing them go to sea to fish with their nets. But it will not be easy at all: a strong storm, heavy seas, ice sheets, and several orcas  will complicate the task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game inspired by a true story that occurred in 1992. A merchant ship lost in the middle of the ocean 29,000 plastic duckies. The little duckies are still adrift on the seas of the world. The oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer follows their trail since. Thanks to him, nowadays we know more about ocean currents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;br/&gt;in Duckies in Lofoten players are sailors and have to cooperate tile by tile, chosing the correct action dices, in order to build the best strategy. They are not alone, an Icebreaker will help them to fish all the duckies before to be catched by ice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
