			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nemesis NPCs &amp;ndash; Daylen Darkwalker introduces a nefarious ifrit antipaladin into your campaign.  Her destructive nature and flaming hammer are ready to become the next thorn in your players&amp;rsquo; sides.  Bolster the church of your favorite dark deity with this sadistic fiery fiend.  She&amp;rsquo;s ready no matter what level your players are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is Pathfinder&amp;reg; Roleplaying Game compatible and gives you twenty ready-to-play stat blocks for a fearsome foe at all levels, 1 thru 20!  This allows you to easily introduce an enemy into your campaign and reintroduce the same enemy at any time with no prior preparation.  Simply find the appropriate challenge rating and go.  The NPC advances along with your players with no work on your part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find the character&amp;rsquo;s history and other story elements not to your liking, you still have twenty NPC stat blocks you can use as standalone characters of your own naming and developing or as minions and other rabble.  Increase your available NPC stat blocks at every character level (Challenge Rating 1/2 thru 19).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nemesis NPCs series is designed to make the GM&amp;rsquo;s life easier.  Each release provides numerous stat blocks that can be used immediately along a specific theme.  Locate a specific kind of foe to introduce into your campaign or collect them all to build a toolbox of NPCs to unleash at any time.  Give your players a new nemesis today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
