			<description>Battlecruiser is a simple game of the Naval Combat developed from the Battleship games we all enjoyed as Children. This has been done before by professional and amateur outfits, but for the first time, modern Conflict Simulation Techniques have been employed to provide more &amp;quot;realism&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for two players, but if desired can be played by up to four. Various techniques are included for shortening or lengthening the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn , the various players will attempt to determine the location of their opponents ships, and to direct fire into those hexes in an attempt to sink enemy ships. The player in each game who has the last vessel afloat will be declared the winner. It is possible that in a particular game the players may be unable to damage each other further. This can only happen when one  has a submarine with no torpedoes left, and the other has a ship with no ASW capability. In this case, the game is a tie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
