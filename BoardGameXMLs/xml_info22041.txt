							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disney&#039;s Gummi Bears Giant Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The 40 cards are placed face down.  Players take turn revealing four cards.  If two cards match, the two matching cards are placed next to the player; if three cards match, two of the matching cards are placed next to the player; and if four cards match, the player automatically wins the game.  If a player uncovers two Duke Igthorn cards, that player may steal a pair for any player and add them to his or her pile with the two Duke cards.  The winner is the player with the most pairs when all the cards have been revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
