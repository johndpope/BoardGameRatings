			<description>The hunter becomes the hunted in The Island of Doctor Lucky. In this tropical spin on Kill Doctor Lucky, you're still competing to kill the old man, but this time you picked a dangerous place to do it: Isla Fortuna, his mysterious tropical island. You can still attempt murder the old fashioned way, using a weapon when no one can see you, or you can take advantage of the new hazard cards to hit him from anywhere else on the map! While hazards aren't usually as strong as a murder attempt, they give you faster movement for the rest of the game. What's more, you can also throw hazards at players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dodge hazards like the fire pit, the hunting snare, and the hammerhead crabs as you navigate the perilous regions of Isla Fortuna. Find the old man alone, and kill him with whatever you can find: the shark tooth, the elephant gun, the bad dates, or (if you must) your bare hands. Every murder attempt makes you stronger, and if you play your cards right, you can kill Doctor Lucky!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
