							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Better Me: The Game of Growth and Friendship</name>
									
			<description>Better Me is a new approach to relationships and personal development. It challenges people to take action to improve themselves and their life, and strengthens relationships by helping people understand each other in a deeper and more meaningful way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game brings up interesting topics that don't normally come up in daily conversation, allowing players to quickly learn about themselves and their fellow players. And all in an encouraging and fun atmosphere, with no pressure or judgment permitted. When was the last time you told a group of people about a past accomplishment that you're proud of, or had a game challenge you to write a thank you letter to a loved one?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better Me also harnesses the power of accountability. Any player committing to an action must find an accountability partner to help make sure they follow they follow through on their commitment. Both players write down the action to be taken, and the target completion date on their game sheet. This accountability strategy is key to insuring that players take action and grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the game board and draw cards which prompt all sorts of positive action and discussion. Players race to fulfill each of their five life areas, heart, mind, body, people and tangibles.  The game is won by the first player to &amp;quot;fulfill&amp;quot; (3 points) each of the five categories; heart, mind, body, people, and tangibles.  Alternatively, the game may be played to a time limit, and if no player has fulfilled all categories by the end of the time limit, the player with the most total points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being played by groups of friends and family, Better Me is also popular with counselors, schools/universities, youth mentoring programs, recovery programs, hospitals, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a new and engaging way to improve yourself and your relationships with friends, family, and coworkers, all while having fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
