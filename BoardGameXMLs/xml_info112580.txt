			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;Robert's a great businessman, familiar characters take part in a duck Scrooge, organized by the thrill of competition, a businessman, to win a job Scrooge's group - the winner is the one who deserves the first million.&lt;br/&gt;This game is monopoly/go for broke/payday/cashflow like game! The game goes around the board where players need to make decisions and some weird things, like to make a sound of money or what is the most expensive thing you know. Everytime when you get it right or other player think that you got it, then yu get the amount of money written on the card or on the spcae you are standing on!&lt;br/&gt;Win, by getting a million!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In travel edition instead of the game board you have a small notebook for writing up the scores. Cards have modified accordingly. Travel version can be played up to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
