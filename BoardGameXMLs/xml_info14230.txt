			<description>This is the second game in the 4-4 series (the 1st being Tamega).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard consists of 25 squares (5 rows of 5 squares), the 25 playing pieces have 5 different colors and 5 different shapes and are numbered from 1 up to 25 (this number represents the value of the piece).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to force your opponent to be the first to place a playing piece in a row,column or diagonal where there already is placed a playing piece with similar shape or color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player in turn chooses a playing piece until both have 12 pieces. The remaining piece is placed in the center of the board. Each player then places one of his pieces on the board. The first to put a piece with a the same color or shape as another piece already on the same diagonal, row or column, loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The loser gets point equal to the value of all his remaining pieces. After the predetermined number of games have been played, the players with the least point wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proceedings of this game go integrally to a good cause (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.spullenhulp.be&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.spullenhulp.be&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
