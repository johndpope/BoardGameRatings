			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Adventure Rockman is an interactive anime mini-series combined with a first person shooter. Dr. Wily finds an ancient supercomputer that he uses to revive many of his former Robot Masters and disable all the robots in the world, including Rockman&amp;rsquo;s sister Roll. Dr. Light manages to create a shield for Rockman and his allies, Rush and Beat, and Rockman sets out to stop Dr. Wily and save Roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays similarly to a &amp;ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&amp;rdquo; book &amp;ndash; players watch the video, and are periodically prompted to choose a response or action by Rockman. There are a number of quicktime events that force the player to dodge out of the way by moving to one side of the screen, and each boss fight plays light a first person stationary shooter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rockman will acquire a special weapon each time he defeats a Robot Master, and these weapons can be used alongside his Mega Buster in later boss battles. Pickups such as Energy and Weapon tanks can also be found as the game progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
