			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Age of Tyrants' is a game of mass combat using 6mm scale miniatures in the Draconis Alba Galaxy, a futuristic alternative universe that has been in development for over fifteen years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is slick, with an intuitive command and control system inspired by combined arms warfare that allows you to pull together different parts of your army to focus on a particular target or objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players face each other with one or more company on each side - each company is led by a company commander leading 4 platoons with 4 bases each that also have their own platoon leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate using leaders to give commands. Accruing suppression points makes it harder for units to actually follow orders. The army size is bounded by a total points value that players agree on before the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
