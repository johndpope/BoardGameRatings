							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Becoming One</name>
									
			<description>A Christian based game for married and unmarried couples to encourage communication and strengthen relationships.&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a board, dice, pawns, and question cards. The cards are in five categories; God, Self, Each Other, Others, and Becoming One. The questions explore a wide range of subjects including jobs, friends, entertainment, God, church, and more intimate themes. Some of the questions are dated to the seventies but most are still relevant today. It can be played with two couples but can get quite personal so you don't want to play with just anyone. There is a defined end to the game but there are no losers.&lt;br/&gt;This is a great game for engaged couples and newlyweds to learn more about their partners, and build a strong relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
