							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Waddle&quot; The Duck Shooting Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a shooting game with a moving target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructions for setting the game up:&lt;br/&gt;Fit the round uprights into the wood bases, highest to the right, shortest to the left, and ensure the slots run inline down the board. Fit the printed housings or &amp;quot;pens&amp;quot; to the uprights. Target to the highest. &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot; to the shortest. The slope or ramp is made in two halves; join these together and fit into the slots in the uprights, but before securing to the highest upright, thread the Duck on the ramp. Move the Duck to its starting pen and the game is then ready for playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After that, if you still have energy to play;&lt;br/&gt;Load the repeater gun with an agreed number of rubber bands and take aim at the target to start the duck in motion. When this has been accomplished fire the remaining bands on the gun to knock over the Duck before it reaches the &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot; pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is calculated according to the number of points indicated by the duck's head on the base board when it is pointing downwards,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player has some remaining bands on his gun after scoring, the Duck is returned to the starting pen for further play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
