			<description>&amp;quot;A fun and exciting card game for kids and adults.  Over 100 cards that will keep memories of the 20th Century alive forever.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique deck has one card for each year from 1900 to 1998, with 5 events that happened that year, of all types: politics, sports, arts, inventions, etc.  There are also two 1999 cards, which act like wild cards, and four 2000 &amp;quot;Millenium Bug&amp;quot; cards, that are penalty cards.  The events each have an icon next to them to show a specific type: e.g. car, tennis player, Olympic rings, airplane, dollar sign, national flag, anchor, skull, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are rules to three games included.  In all of them, 10 cards are dealt to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Century Classic is rummy-like: during their turn players draw, lay down melds, and discard.  Acceptable melds are: chains, 3 or more consecutive years; and matches: 3 or more that have the same event icon.  Players can also add to their previous melds, but not to others'.  When a player goes out, the others receive penalty points for what's left in their hand.  1999 cards are wild, and each player may use their birth year as a personal wild.  If you have a 2000 card may play it to the table and draw a replacement, taking up your whole turn; 2000's in your hand at the end add to your penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Century Chain is Uno-like.  Players may play a card to the discard pile if it matches one of its icons, or is adjacent in year.  You may continue playing until you have nothing left.  If you have nothing to start, you may draw one card instead.  (1999s and 2000s are not included in this game.)  First player out of cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Century Face Off is a quasi-trick-taking game.  Players take turns playing a card to the center, and the one who played highest year takes the trick and leads to the next.  After the  10 cards are out, another 10 each (or however many are left) are dealt out.  Winner is the one who takes the most tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
