			<description>The object of this game is to make the longest snakes possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player places a screen in front of themselves.  Mix up the snake cards in the game lid with their snake basket showing.  The players each take five snake cards and place them behind their screens, so that the other players cannot see them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take their turns in clockwise order.  The person to play chooses a snake which they would like extend.  Usually this will be the longest snake.  This player can then add to this snake as many matching cards of one color as they like.  The start squares for the snakes are the snake ends in the middle and at the edges of the board.  No card may be placed on the four snake baskets.  The joker cards can be used for any snake colour.  After playing their cards the players draw the required number of cards to restore their hand to five cards.  If a player has no cards that can be played they may return their cards and take five new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snake tunnel&lt;br/&gt;The beige bars in the center of the board and on cards on the board are tunnels.  Players may use these to lengthen a snake and gain more points.  Cards may not be played over tunnels.&lt;br/&gt; When all the snakes are complete or no more cards can be played the game is over and the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
