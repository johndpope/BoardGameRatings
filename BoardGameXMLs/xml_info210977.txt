			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This larp takes 4-7 people, including the director. Players should be made aware of the nature of the larp ahead of time before opting in. Have a square section of the floor that is boxed-in/marked by masking tape just big enough for two people to walk around in. Everything inside this space represents the physical world in which Tony Johnson and Officer Wilson physically inhabit. Everything outside of this area exists in the mind of Tony Johnson, where the various aspects of his mind can exist, walk around, and interact. Set up a chair in the middle of this space, for the driver seat Tony is sitting in. At the game start, &amp;ldquo;Self-Preservation&amp;rdquo; is sitting in the chair as the dominant aspect, as he is normally in charge while operating a motor vehicle. Have each player choose an aspect of Tony&amp;rsquo;s mind to portray from the list on the next page, and explain the techniques they can use in-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
