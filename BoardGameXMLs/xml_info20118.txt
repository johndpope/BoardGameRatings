			<description>From Back of Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go Wacky! is a super speedy dice-rolling match-to-win card game.  Different cards have different rules, but your goal is to collect as many of them as you can.  You may have to roll your dice at the bull's-eye cards, roll your dice as fast as you can while the others count, or race your opponents to roll for a card the quickest.  You may not be wacky now, but you'll get wacky when you play Go Wacky!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
