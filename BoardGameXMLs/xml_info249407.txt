							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mother Earth&#039;s Produce Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a &amp;quot;Authors&amp;quot;-style set collection card game, but featuring vegetable and mineral (but not animal) products from countries around the world. The deck consists of 58 cards: 13 sets of four, one set of five (&amp;quot;the Prize Book&amp;quot;) and a &amp;quot;Double Prize Card&amp;quot; with a map of the United States showing all the locations in the country where featured goods are produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This prize card is placed face up on the table. Each of the players is then dealt a hand of four cards. In turn, a player asks for a particular card from one other player; if that player holds it, it must be handed over, and the caller plays again. As soon as a call fails, the calling player draws one card from the deck, and the turn passes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winning is based on points. Each &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; of four cards completes counts one. The five-card Prize Book counts two. And whichever player has completed the largest number of books claims the Double Prize Card for two extra points. Note that this makes the Prize Book the key to winning if the holder is tied for the most books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 14 commodities are: Coffee (the Prize Book); Tea; Cotton; Rice; Wheat; Flax; Sugar; Silver; Gold; Iron; Coal; Silk; Copper; and Corn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
