			<description>This game with a billiards theme is not a dexterity game as you could expect, but it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting tactical dice game. Object of the game is to reach as many points as possible by moving the 3 billiard balls across the board with the use of 4 6-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving the balls is quite unusual, since you don&amp;rsquo;t move the numbers of the dice rolls, but you must land on fields which show the numbers of these rolls! For that reason, each field of the 7 x 11 gameboard shows a number between 0-6, where the zeros are regarded as jokers. There are several bonus points to achieve - most of them when you manage to hit one ball after the other (like in real billiards). To give you enough strategical possibilities, you are free to choose the billiard ball with which you want to start the moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the number of players is given from 2-6, it works perfectly as solitaire game, where you can think about your next turn as long as you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
