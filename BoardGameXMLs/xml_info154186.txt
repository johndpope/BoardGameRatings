							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Date of Doom</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is coming to an end... and if Dr. Demon has his way, it'll end today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angry at a world who doesn't respect him and is full of excessive ATM fees, a villianous mystic decides to unleash the Demonlord of Destruction upon North America. Can the pure-hearted Dr. Incorruptus save us?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, probably not. But, unfortunately for Dr. Demon, he picked 12/12/12 and Mount Blackheart to perform his ritual, the time and place where a young angel and young demon had picked for their first date. And they did not appreciate having their time together interrupted....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLF!: The Date of Doom continues NUELOW Games's countdown to the prophesized end of the world. This release is a sequel to Angels, Demons &amp; Death. It features the return of Millie the Angel and Myron the Demon, as well as four new pre-generated characters. Also featured are four new Spellings to bring demons and other supernatural chaos to your ROLF! battles, and a number of other Combat Maneuvers and Traits not featured in the core rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you like superheroes or the supernatural, this is the ROLF! supplement for you! (And it's a better love story than Twilight.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
