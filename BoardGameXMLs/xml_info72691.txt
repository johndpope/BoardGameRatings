							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Superman Returns</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Superman Returns is a video game loosely based on the movie of the same name, developed by Electronic Arts-Tiburon  in Orlando, Fla., in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It features a story arc from the movie, which was released on June 28, 2006, and more than 60 years of comic book content. EA Tiburon, known for its Madden NFL game series, has claimed that the game combines strong creative vision and compelling new technology to deliver a powerful and emotional gaming experience to their consumers, and they will experience a real sense of flying while mastering Superman's superhero  powers to save Metropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, Superman combats Metallo, who does not appear in the movie, as well as other classic villains as well as being able to play as Bizarro for a short period of time in one of the many minigames inserted into the game. The game was produced for the next-generation Xbox 360 as well as current generation platforms and handhelds although it was canceled for the PSP due to it not having enough power to support the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment secured an all-star cast for the voices in Superman Returns: The Videogame. The game features the voice and likeness of Brandon Routh (Superman/Clark Kent) as well as the voices of Kevin Spacey (Lex Luthor), Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane), Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), all reprising their roles from the Warner Bros. Pictures film directed by Bryan Singer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released on Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The Nintendo DS also featured games based on the film, but they are fundamentally different from the console title. The games were delayed from their original release date (set to coincide with the theatrical release of the film) due to design complications and issues with polish on the console game.[citation needed] The handheld games were delayed in order to preserve a simultaneous release with non-handheld SKUs. The games were ultimately released on November 22, 2006 in the United States and November 30 in Australia, to coincide with the DVD release of Superman Returns.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Superman_Returns_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
