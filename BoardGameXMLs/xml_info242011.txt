							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wheel of Fortune (1981 / OSI)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hidden word is displayed behind boxes and you must try to guess the word.  Each letter has a point value determined by spinning the Wheel of Fortune.  If the letter you guess is in the word, you get the points.  More than just a fun and challenging game, this program comes in two versions of the same tape!  One side is a vocabulary builder for grade school students with words selected from the educator approved &amp;quot;Dolch Basic Sight Vocabulary&amp;quot;, and found in books on all school subjects.  The other side has stumpers for the adults in the family, with instructions for adding your own words too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
