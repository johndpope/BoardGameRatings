			<description>Two children have lost control of their pet Monsters. Help them collect these Monsters-on-the-loose. Find My Monsters is 2 fun and fast card games in 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Game 1, the deck is shuffled, then spread out face down. Players decide who goes first. They each then take turns turning over two cards in order to match the Alfi card (Green Background) with one of his pet Monsters (Green Background), or the Penny card (Orange Background) with one of her pet Monsters (Orange Background). (Or vice versa &amp;ndash; matching Monster to matching Alfi/Penny) The cards that match are then placed in front of you to form your Point pile. At the end of the game, players will add up the total Monsters in their Point pile, and the player with the most Monsters wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Game 2, the deck is shuffled and placed between both players. Each player draws four cards, and then one person takes the top four cards of the deck and places them face up in a row next to it. Decide who goes first. During each of their turns, players will look at the cards in their hands and the cards face up next to the deck in order to pair up two cards, Penny to one of her Monsters or Alfi to one of his Monsters(or vice versa). Your goal is to put together the cards that add up to the highest value (using the numbers on the bottom right of each card). These cards are then placed in front of you to form your Point pile. At the end of the game, each player adds up all the numbers on all of the cards in their respective Point piles, and the player with the higher total wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
