			<description>An entry in the 2015 18 Card PNP design contest by J. Ram&amp;oacute;n Palacios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shuffle and deal 8 cards to each player. Place the remaining card face up in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;     The play area will be a 3x3 card grid, with that card at the center.&lt;br/&gt;     The player who has been most recently sick chooses virus or leukocytes. The other player starts playing. The one with virus keeps the rules card as a reminder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In turns, each player play 1 card face up on the play area, on a free space or completely overlapping another card. To overlap a card, the new card number must be higher than the overlapped card.&lt;br/&gt;     At the end of the game 9 cards must be exposed. None of the 9 spaces must be left uncovered. So, for instance, if there are 3 free spaces in the play area and players have 3 cards in their hands (one player with 2 cards; the other, 1 card), no more cards can&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;be overlapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If there are no free spaces and you have a card whose number is lower than the numbers of the cards in the play area, that card is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;     The game ends when all the cards are played and the winner is the one with most virus or leukocytes on the board. In case of a tie, play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
