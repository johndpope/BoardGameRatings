			<description>&amp;quot;In the near future players compete in a strategic boardgame called Cubotrix, a holographic table where a board is displayed and challenge peoples mind to overcame their oponent for the control of board&amp;acute;s areas&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two player abstract game where players compete in a board made by dices in five different colors. The objective is to control moust of the board dices and create line patterns to score. The board chances every round, with new numbers coming up and others disapearing as the dice change position and faces.  Each player needs to combine it&amp;acute;s own dices, hidden from the other player, and pair two numbers that match the same numbers on the board that are adjacent in order to ocupy both dices with one of it&amp;acute;s own control markers. Also players have a set of special actions they can perform once per game that bend the general rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game plays for 45 to 60 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
