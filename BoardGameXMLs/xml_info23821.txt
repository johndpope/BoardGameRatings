			<description>From back of box:&lt;br/&gt;Players race around the alphabet game board, as they flip over category cards and place their chips on letters. You can only put down a chip if you can name something that begins with the letter that matches the category card in play. You get 1 point for each chip you can place.  Whoever has the most points after 5 rounds wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three different games to play, including an advanced game where players can bluff their way around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents include: pencil, score pad, game rules, 6 chip holder boxes, Show Off game board, 100 Show Off category cards, and 180 colored chips in 6 different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
