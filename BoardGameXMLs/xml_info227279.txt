							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Hakflem Skuttlespike</name>
									
			<description>Hakflem Skuttlespike, the result of decades of unpleasant Skaven experiments, a player upon whose shoulders Clan Rigens immediately placed the future of the Skaven game of Blood Bowl. A petty, jealous and vicious example of Skaven cunning, he ensured that no other player would be created to rival him by killing any Clan Rigens experiment or creation that looked like a potential equal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, given the sheer amount of time spent ensuring the demise of any Skaven who look able to rival him, you might think that Hakflem Skuttlespike neglects his duties on the hallowed Blood Bowl pitch. Not so! With this bizarre, two-headed resin kit, you can field him as a Star Player in any Skaven team you choose. Furious, muscular and bedecked with spiky bits, he is posed in an appropriately aggressive manner, both of his sharply toothed maws likely shrieking unintelligible threats at whichever poor opponent is in the way. Each of his four (count &amp;lsquo;em!) hands is ready to kill, with metal gloves and a spiked ball among the turmoil. There&amp;rsquo;s even space for some Skaven symbols on his armour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This resin kit comprises 10 components, and includes two 32mm round bases, one featuring a hole to slot a ball into, indicating possession of the ball in your games of Blood Bowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
