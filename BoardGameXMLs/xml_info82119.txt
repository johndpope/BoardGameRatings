							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caesar&#039;s Palace</name>
									
			<description>Caesar's Palace is a 1992 Virgin Interactive gambling video game developed by Realtime Associates for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Magnin and Associates for the Game Boy. It is named after the famous Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip near Las Vegas, Nevada. In this game, the player has $1000 in chips and he must try to become rich (or become broke trying to). This game gives underaged people an experience previously limited to people 21 years of age or older. Because the game was marketed directly towards minor children, a disclaimer was added before the title screen that the game is intended for entertainment use only and not for actual gambling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games included&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slot machine&lt;br/&gt;Video poker (Pair of Jacks or better only)&lt;br/&gt;Roulette&lt;br/&gt;Blackjack&lt;br/&gt;Big Six wheel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Caesar's Palace (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
