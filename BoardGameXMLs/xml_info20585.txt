			<description>Inwest is yet another Monopoly copy which introduces trivia questions and treasure hunting to the standard setting. This time the game takes place in the surroundings of Pietarsaari (or Jakobstad in Swedish) which is a small town on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia in Finland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very typical roll and move economy game. Two dices are thrown and doubles give another throw. Players should collect sets of stocks with the same color to make corresponding squares on the board more expensive. This time there are no buildings to be built, you just need to get the stocks. Trading of stocks may be done freely between players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, random event cards exist in this game too. Some cards take the player to treasure hunting, which means a lot of money. Some other cards may contain trivia question which can be very tricky - especially if Pietarsaari region is unknown. By answering a correctly to the question the player earns some money, and with a wrong answer the money must be paid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide together how much initial money is given and when does the game end. Therefore the game can be played as long - or short - as the players want to. The winner is the player whose fortune is the most valuable at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
