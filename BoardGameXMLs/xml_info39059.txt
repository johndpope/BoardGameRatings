			<description>&amp;ldquo;Two Player Board &amp;amp; Card Game of Modern Infantry Combat.&amp;rdquo; One player controls the Rebel Troops and the other player controls the Government Troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a chessboard or any other 8x8 grid. Squares are marked for terrain type and three squares are marked as Objectives. Each player starts with six Squads which are represented by miniatures or counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A custom deck of cards is central to the play of the game. The players draw hands of cards from the common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, or use defensive fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to destroy or rout all enemy squads or to take and hold three Objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
