			<description>This is a card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are covered with 8 yin-yangs which can be red or black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the last player with cards in his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn tries to lay a card on the cards already laid out. The correspondence of yin-yangs between the card played and the card it covers defines if the move is possible and how many points are obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, each symbol of a colour must be laid out on a symbol of the other colour. A player gets 8 points if his card completely covers the previous one or 4 points if it only covers half.&lt;br/&gt; For each point marked, the player can take a new card from the remaining stack. A player without any card left is excluded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
