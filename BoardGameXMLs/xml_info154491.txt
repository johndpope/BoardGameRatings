							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conniving Bastards</name>
									
			<description>The King has passed and foreign invaders are knocking at your door. With no true heirs the rival bastard children must plot and scheme to gather enough influence to unite the realm against these invaders. Their advance scouts, spies, and sorcerers have already been dispatched to slow you down. Are you enough of a bastard to take the throne and rule the realm?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of you will get to choose a plot card from a hand of six on your turn. These plots allow you to place buildings or units or utilize buildings and units you control to gain influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each building has a different way of gathering influence.&lt;br/&gt;Forts allow you to create military units to seize buildings.&lt;br/&gt;Temples allow you to call for prayers and all players who control temples pray for or against the prayer you have called for.&lt;br/&gt;Libraries allow you to cast spells which drain the land to power them.&lt;br/&gt;Guildhouses allow you to hatch schemes, steal from others or corrupt their units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must gain enough influence to win the game while being stymied at every turn by the Foreign invaders who can only win through your failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You cannot share the throne, but if one of you cannot gather the required influence in 12 turns or less, the Invaders will claim the realm and ruin will fall on you all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
