							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride</name>
									
			<description>The wind lashes against the cliff side trees, which clutch the stones like grasping fingers. Overhead a storm rages, scattering the long pillows of mist that haunt the land like ghost ships. Against this backdrop a girl is silhouetted. She is running, clutching her shawl to keep the rain out of her hair. A flash of lighting illuminates her face. She is beautiful, but she`s crying. Raindrops are mixing with the tears streaming over her cheeks. She starts to scream, but her words go lost in the wind. She trips on a root, falls to her knees. In a moment of rage and despair she pulls the small golden wedding band from her finger and tosses it off the edge of the cliff. The ring flashes and disappears into the abyss. As she walks away, she cannot see the red glow that pierces the fog and the demonic, gnarled hand that appears as if out of thin air to catch the ring as it falls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;25 years later&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the shadow of an ancient forest, on the bottom of the foggy valley, stands the lonely village of Ravenbrook. There lives the folk - cheerful and diligent, yet warily superstitious. They surround the Village with countless charms to keep the evil spirits at bay. For on the other side of the forest, there lies a seemingly bottomless pit, known as the Abyss. It is this place the villagers of Ravenbrook fear most...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this night, a young woman returns home for her twin sister&amp;rsquo;s wedding. They haven&amp;rsquo;t seen each other in years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the ceremony is interrupted by the intrusion of a gigantic bear &amp;ndash; a dark hero of local legend, who kidnaps the bride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wasting no time, and accompanied by Edward &amp;ndash; the would-be husband of her sister - the Heroine follows the beast&amp;rsquo;s trail deep into a world of legends and magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quest to find Lilly will lead her sister through a dangerous, mystical forest full of fairies and magical beings, as well as places that put an unspeakable terror into the hearts of simple folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each clue leading to her kidnapped sister will bring the heroine closer to the truth about her and her sister. The main protagonist will learn that words spoken in a world where ancient magic is part of the reality have a tremendous power. The events that she will witness will make her realise, that grim legends can sometimes come into life&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can she save her sister and discover what connects the legendary bear and a mysterious witch with the Haugwitz family curse?
