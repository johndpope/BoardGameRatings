			<description>Taken from the 3D Paper Co. website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotten City is a Zombie Game. It can be controlled with one finger and the screen isn't covered with control buttons so that you can have a wide screen and use the items easily. As an action arcade game of attractive and neat 2D graphics, this game has RPG elements of accomplishing quests using various items, raising skills of weapons, and so forth. Because defeating different types of zombies requires different weapons, you have to manage your resources diligently. This kind of strategic management adds more fun to the game. Your weapon&amp;rsquo;s targeting skill improves as you use it more often, which in turn enables you to incur more damage on the zombies. So even if you fight the same zombie again, it would be like playing a new game due to your weapon&amp;rsquo;s improved skill.  There are many kinds of items in this game. The vaccine cures the infection caused by zombie virus. Food and potions help you recover your strength, and there are also special potions with specific functions. Various weapons are useful in defeating zombies according to their individual characteristics. Armor protects you from zombies&amp;rsquo; attacks but it can't protect you from getting infections. An item collector helps you to collect items. Finally, there are an inventory for storing all of your items and places of safety where you can get some rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
