							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jaws of Death</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jaws of Death is a micro-adventure that can be played out an an hour or less. It can be used as a filler for those times when a player is unavailable to game or running late and the party doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to continue the main storyline without him or her. It can also serve as a side adventure for your party to give them a break from the main story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This micro-adventure is designed for an adventuring party of 6th to 10th level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jaws of Death can be used at any time the party visits a coastal community. The NPC quest givers can be replaced with your own NPCs if you have an established community already prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement references information found in Shark!, and as such the shark presented in this micro-adventure differs from the normal shark found in the 3.5 System Reference Document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
