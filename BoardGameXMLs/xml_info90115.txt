			<description>Fight it out with your friends with a character that fits on a business card (or smaller)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BCF is a small game that requires the use of 2 dice, a deck of standard playing cards (with jokers), and 2 or more friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has 5 stats, 25 life, a Nature, and a Vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns playing attack cards and defense cards in an attempt to reduce the other player's life total to 0. This is done with a communal deck of cards and a character sheet. The character's stats add to the cards and based on the character's Nature, a bonus or penalty is applied to the card!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game in early development which has been modified from a previous, far more complicated, set of rules. I am looking for feedback and play-testing in order to strengthen the game, reduce/simplify the rules, and make the game fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
