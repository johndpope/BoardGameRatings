			<description>Enter the world of high finance and higher risk with the High Roller dice game. Players roll the dice in an effort to increase their fortunes and build their &amp;quot;budding&amp;quot; business. But in this game, danger awaits you at every turn and getting busted is just a roll of the dice away. Each player rolls two numbered dice (1-6) and one event dice with the event die determining what the numbers stand for, where even numbers equal good results and odd numbers equal bad results. The game contains two numbered dice, one event die, 100 chips and a rules card. Each player starts with 10 chips (their stash) with the remaining chips forming the pot, and the one with the biggest stash when the pot runs out wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
