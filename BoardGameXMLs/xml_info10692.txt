			<description>This game consists of a scoring basket suspended over a motorized blower that is surrounded by a circular fence with four catapults situated on its perimeter.  Each player uses their catapult to launch small foam balls into the air stream above the blower in an attempt to get their balls into the scoring basket above the air stream.  The round ends when one person gets 3 of their balls into the scoring basket.  Each ball scores 1 point, and the first person to score 10 points wins the game.  Ages 6 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
