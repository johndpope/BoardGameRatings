			<description>Kettou (which means duel in Japanese) is a samurai-themed reflex tabletop game inspired by the ancient Japanese game Karuta. Take on the role of a samurai warrior and go head-to-head against other players in an epic tabletop samurai duel. Use your quickness and bushido to defeat all adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kettou uses real reflex mechanisms to simulate the quickness and sharpness a samurai needs. Hit location cards are placed between dueling players and randomly called out. Be the first to touch the correct card and deal damage to your opponent. Players also call upon seven &amp;quot;Virtues of Bushido&amp;quot; to aid them in combat. Defeat your opponents using quick reflexes and a sharp mind!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
