							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Overlords Issue 4</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Overlords Issue 4 - Operation: Clean Slate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all criminals are bad ... and it's CASTLE's job to determine which can be rehabilitated. Most of these criminals formerly belonged to the Overlords, and, as such, were already used to working in a team with others. In their first mission, the team found themselves pitted against their former allies. The Overlords referred to their former partners as &amp;ldquo;Defectors,&amp;rdquo; and the team has decided to wear the title as a badge of pride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Mummer (PL 9): Sonic-based energy projector. Ex-wrestler.&lt;br/&gt;    Scarab (PL 8): Cyborg with microwave technology. Thrill-seeker.&lt;br/&gt;    Shooting Star (PL 10): Light controller. Manipulative and greedy.&lt;br/&gt;    Technomancer (PL 10): Techno - well - 'mancer. Bored know-it-all.&lt;br/&gt;    Titan (PL 10): N-Ray giant. Naive and vengeful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
