			<description>Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many, many centuries ago, the people of Earth co-existed with the people of the Moon in peace and harmony. This might surprise you, as the Moon queendom was a place rich with beauty and full of wonders, not the least of which were its people, who were blessed with magic and long life. It might seem natural that the people of Earth would look upon their neighbors with jealousy, but the people of the Moon shared freely of their gifts and kept to themselves. It was thought that this golden age would last forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such is the complacency that peace brings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Comes To This&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It may be that the golden age of humanity will crumble. It may be that Elysium will fall into civil war or declare war on the Moon queendom. The future is not yours to read. All you know is that you have been called to fulfill a sacred duty and you will uphold that duty even at the cost of your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Starlit Kingdom is a game in which you tell tragic stories about the fall of a magical kingdom. It is based on Thou Art But A Warrior, which is powered by the Polaris system, by Ben Lehman of TAO Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
