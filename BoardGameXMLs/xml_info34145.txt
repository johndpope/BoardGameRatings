							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Luftikus</name>
									
			<description>Each player gets 6 tiles in different colors.&lt;br/&gt;6 tiles with a star are placed on the table in a circle.&lt;br/&gt;The Luftikus, a single pawn, is placed on one of the tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assembly-Phase:&lt;br/&gt;The players are taking turns in throwing the die and moving the Luftikus in the circle by the number of the die. The color where the Luftikus landed can be taken away out of his 6 tiles. If it reaches &amp;quot;green&amp;quot;, the green tile of the active player is placed aside. Then the active player rolls the die again and hits &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;. His blue tile is set upon his green tile from the turn before to start a tower of tiles. He can play so long until a color is hit that is already in the tower. When all player have finished their turn, that player with the first finished tower gets the left over tiles of the other players as points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disassembly-Phase:&lt;br/&gt;Then the tower is build down, accordingly to the first phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
