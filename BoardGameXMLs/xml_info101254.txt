			<description>This is game #12 the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, players have the simple goal of being the first player to get all their pieces on the board. Players try to prevent their opponents from accomplishing this, by either performing custodial captures or jumps over pieces, with either of these moves causes pieces of their opponent to go back into their reserve.  The preventing of the placement of pieces along the outside of the board, unless the pieces are involved in capture, leads both to an ongoing exchange of captures and also driving the game to its conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
