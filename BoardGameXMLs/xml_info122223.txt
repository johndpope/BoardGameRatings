			<description>Tenshi no Present: Marl Ōkoku Monogatari (天使のプレゼント マール王国物語) is a Japanese 2000 role-playing video game from Nippon Ichi. This is the first Marl Kingdom game for the PlayStation 2. Unlike the previous games in the series, this game was only released once, although a special limited edition version of the game was released concurrently. Instead of the 2D graphics of the other Marl games, Tenshi no Present uses 3D backgrounds. However, the character sprites themselves are kept 2D, much like many other Nippon Ichi games released afterwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenshi no Present, unlike the earlier games in the series, consists of six separate chapters, each of which features different characters from the Marl Kingdom series. The chapters take place in various times before or after the stories of Rhapsody and Little Princess. These chapters often address unanswered questions from the earlier games, or provide additional insight into the characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tenshi no Present is a typical RPG, complete with experience points, parties of characters, and spell casting. In each chapter, the player guides different characters through their adventure, engaging in several battles along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle system is completely different from earlier Marl games. The player's party consists of up to 12 characters divided into rows of 4. The player can only have direct control of the row leaders. The other characters in each row, called &amp;quot;partners,&amp;quot; cannot normally be controlled and attack randomly. The only characters that can be controlled even when they are not in the front row are puppets, and they can only be controlled by Cornet, Cello, Kururu or Cherie.  The party consists of humans, puppet users, puppets and monsters. Each character, when acting as a partner, will raise or lower the statistics of the row leader. Depending on party organization, special attacks can be unlocked for the row leader.  Instead of paying for spells like in Little Princess, the characters use SP for spell casting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tenshi no Present - Marl Ōkoku Monogatari&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
