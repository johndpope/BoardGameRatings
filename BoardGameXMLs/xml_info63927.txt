							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cityscape: City on the Nexus of the Omniverse</name>
									
			<description>From the opening paragraph listed on the Battlefield Press website -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the City. I am Initis, your guide and street entrepreneur. I will show you the sites and sounds of the City. Hum....... why do I call it the City, you ask? You've been to other cities, you say? We call it the City because all others are but a shadow of this one. This is the greatest in the Omniverse. It is built at the point where all the aspects of all the realities, or dimensions if you will, come in contact with each other.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is built on commerce with all the worlds and consequently you can purchase anything here. We do business with everyone and money is everything. I, for one, accept all forms of metal coinage, but the only paper I accept is that printed by the City itself and of course, credit numbers with any reputable citybank.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Because of the confluence of dimensions, natural laws can vary from neighborhood to neighborhood, magic, science, and psionics all exist, side by side in an uneasy truce. Everyone comes to the city eventually and anything can happen.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
