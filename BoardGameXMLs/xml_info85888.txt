			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brutal battles scar the land in a way that even time cannot fully heal. Every map has them - locations where large, usually pivotal, battles occurred. Sometimes these areas are marked by the presence of a memorial but more often they are places that have been abandoned, avoided by men and home only to the scars and artifacts of battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what do these places look like, what can be found there and what kind of beasts call them home? Wonder no more &amp;ndash; your friends hear at Healing Fireball Publications have the answer with our latest product, Two Bit Tables: Ancient Battlefield Encounters. This collection of tables is designed to allow a game master to generate a collection of random encounters and landmarks that will give these places a feel of their own. As an added bonus, rules are given to use these tables to generate the aftermath and horrors of a recently-fought battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
