			<description>Pricey Dice is a dice game in which players try to collect as many golden dice with the highest values as possible, for as little silver as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes Pricey Dice different from other dice games is the way in which golden dice can be payed for with silver dice. The silver dice have to be used to make each of the digits of the amount that the golden dice are worth. Players can add, subtract, divide and multiply the number of pips shown on the silver D6 dice. An example: 4 divided by 4 equals 1, whereas 4 minus 4 equals zero, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick is to try and get the gold using as few silver dice as possible. But beware players that try to use even less silver dice as they get the opportunity to do free rerolls!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Running out of silver? Sell off some gold at a loss to get some back... But don't sell too much because the player with the most gold wins in the end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
