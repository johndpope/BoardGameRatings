			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Esse e-book foi baseado no MMORPG Ragnarok Online, criado pelo sul coreano Lee Myung-Jin e distribuido pela empresa Gravity. Ragnarok Online foi o primeiro MMORPG totalmente traduzido para o portugu&amp;ecirc;s e &amp;eacute; distribuido no Brasil pela Level Up Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nesse e-book iremos descrever apenas a Schwarzwald, Arunafelz n&amp;atilde;o ser&amp;aacute; descrita nesse momento.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lembrando que essa adapta&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o abranger&amp;aacute; o per&amp;iacute;odo que jogamos no BrO, que foi de 2000 a 2006/2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nesse livro vamos seguir as regras do sistema brasileiro Old Dragon, e mesmo Ragnarok n&amp;atilde;o sendo um cen&amp;aacute;rio tipicamente old school, decidimos arriscar e esperamos que essa adapta&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o atenda as expectativas de voc&amp;ecirc;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translation courtesy of Google:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; The sun descended on the horizon and , as Tenebra took control , people looked mystified for us . They saw us take on a ghostly form , and slowly disappear from the sight of all . We are used to this situation. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago a large caravan ran Arton , they were known as Ak - Lanmas , or , in the language of the desert , Sand Gold . The Ak - Lanmas belonged to SarAllan , it was as if they were such a division . The way of life of Ak - Lanmas was basically this : walk , arrive in a town , sell goods , buy goods and walk away , towards another city , where everything is repeated again. Even with this &amp;quot; routine &amp;quot; life, Al - Lamnas were a happy people . The parties were common among them , especially in the summer , where they celebrated, almost every day the strength and supremacy of Azgher . In their festivals food was plentiful , beautiful women dancing for all men spoke of business and told jokes , finally , a quiet and happy life . All rulers of AkLanmas Sallam came from family that was respected and obeyed by all . This , said the Ak - Lanmas , the family would have been the mother of all desert peoples , and therefore should be respected . In fact , even among the Sar - Allan existed ( and exist) , many Sallam , but they do not have this distinctive respect for them .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
