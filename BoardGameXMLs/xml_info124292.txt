			<description>From publisher burb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMELIA EARHART DISAPPEARS:&lt;br/&gt;July 2nd, 1937 Amelia Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan disappeared somewhere over or in the Pacific Ocean and reemerged as one of America&amp;rsquo;s greatest mysteries. During this adventure your players will learn the fate of America&amp;rsquo;s favorite female aviator, encounter beasts unlike anything that walks this Earth, foil a Nazi plot to take over the Pacific theater, and save the world from utter destruction brought upon by the return of a Great Lost God.&lt;br/&gt; A group of Thule psychics determined that an area in the Pacific Ocean is generating a strange psychic feedback. This area is giving off strange vibrations that have been affecting the psychic&amp;rsquo;s dreams for months. Three months ago several psychics fell into a coma and have begun muttering a strange language that no one has been able to decipher. One of these psychics awoke from the dream state and began drawing an island over and over until his hospital room was covered in the same drawing from the floor to the ceiling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
