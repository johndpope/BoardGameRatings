							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adder Attack</name>
									
			<description>From the instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go treasure hunting on the ancient site which, according to legend, was the home of the goddess, Adderonia. Collect the gold nuggets, but watch the lethal blue snake who is also trying to collect and if given the chance will eliminate you.&lt;br/&gt;Watch the other snakes, there are four in all trapped in various places on the site, the number increases to eight as the game proceeds, if they are released by you or the blue snake, they will attack, although they will not collect treasure. Adjacent to each trapped snake is a large sparkling&lt;br/&gt;gemstone, worth initially 150 points (decreasing as game proceeds). Blue snake has valuable opals. Occasionally he drops one and should you collect it you pick up an extra 100 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
