							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warlike: Two Kings</name>
									
			<description>A strategic war against 2 kings. Similar to a game of chess except using cards instead of playing pieces for the units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with the same types and number of troops in their army and over the course of 5 days the winner will be decided by the number and value of the enemy forces they are able to capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main mechanic uses knights, archers and mages in a way that is similar to rock, paper, scissors. There are also 3 special units and 4 tactic tokens that are also usable by players to try and achieve the upper hand, but after the dust settles only the most cunning king will prevail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
