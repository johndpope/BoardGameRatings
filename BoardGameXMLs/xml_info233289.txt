							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">St. Clair&#039;s Folly: The Battle of the Wabash River, 1791</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determined to wrest control of the Northwest Territory from the Native American nations and tribes inhabiting the area, and concerned by the British Government&amp;rsquo;s lack of withdrawal of troops and fortifications in the northern and eastern sections of the territory (particularly in present-day Michigan and Indiana), the US Government authorized military takeover of the region. In 1790 a small force of militia and US Regulars under General Harmer were soundly defeated by the Miami at the Maumee River near their main settlement of Kekionga. Alarmed, the US Congress and President Washington authorized the mobilization of an even larger force, this time to be led by the Territory&amp;rsquo;s first Governor and General of the Army, Arthur St. Clair. This would be the first full scale conflict waged by the new nation, and President Washington was very much concerned about the risks such an undertaking involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you do as well, or better?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
