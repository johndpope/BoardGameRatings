							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tall Towers</name>
									
			<description>In Tall Towers each player represents a carpenter during the Medieval Age who has been tasked with building a city tower for the Prince. Each player must build a tower taller and more efficiently than the other players. Everyone grabs one of the 6 foundation boards, each with a unique build queue that you are trying to complete during the frantic trading sessions.&lt;br/&gt;After everyone has chosen a foundation board, the game can begin. There are 2 phases repeated throughout the game. The first phase is the Trading/Resource Gathering Phase. Everyone starts with the same deck of 40 Cards, but you will not be using your own cards to build your Tall Tower. Instead the trading/resource gathering is done through an interesting real-time blind trading mechanic. It is a quick thinking and chaotic trading session quite similar to games such as Pit, or Set. Everyone is trading simultaneously, so act fast to get the cards you need, and bluff your opponents into taking the bad cards from your hand.  &lt;br/&gt;The second phase is the Build Phase, where you use the cards you received in the previous phase to build your Tall Tower. Of course it is not as easy as it sounds. You must play the cards in the order you received them, you cannot rearrange your hand. Some cards are good and will help you finish up the next floor of your Tower, or they could be bad and send cracks through a few of the stones you gathered during the Resource Phase.&lt;br/&gt;The Players go through 8 Rounds (of 5 cards each) alternating between these 2 phases, and the one with the Tallest Tower wins. There is lots of chaos during trading, lots of speculation between players as they try to talk each other into taking their cards, and lots of fun as you flip over your resources and see how good you did or how bad you crumbled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
