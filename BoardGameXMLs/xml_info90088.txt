			<description>Get your winter clothes together: Hat, scarf, gloves, bag, socks, right and left boot, but make sure that you get them in your color, and even more that you don't get the broken ones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wooden disks depicting these items in one of six colors each, one color for each player plus one brown, broken version of each, lie face down on the table, and each player must try to collect all items of his color. The first player to find all his items wins, but if he finds a broken item, he has to return his item of the same type to taple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
