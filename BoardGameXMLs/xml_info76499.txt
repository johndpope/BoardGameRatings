			<description>Subtitle: A guide to creating believable campaign settings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based off of the syllabus I used for my World-Building seminar at Suny College, this short e-book details a process through which to create a functional fantasy setting. Instead of offering a step-by-step blueprint, this product provides writers with a way of thinking in order to insure that your fantasy setting is realistic, consistent, and playable. With this product, you will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Learn how to avoid the &amp;quot;kewl&amp;quot; factor that can cripple the functionality of your setting.&lt;br/&gt;     Develop a clearly defined logic that will help shape your setting in a natural manner.&lt;br/&gt;     Define the important aspects of your setting that will shape your game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes practical examples of how the process was used to create the Neiyar: Land of Heaven and the Abyss campaign setting. Each chapter includes a section called &amp;quot;The process in practice,&amp;quot; in which we discuss how the seminar class used the process to develop their own setting. There are also blank pages between sections that can be used for your own notes and comments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
