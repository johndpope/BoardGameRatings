							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Escape from the Black Hole</name>
									
			<description>Game in The Black Hole Annual 1981, a Disney Corporation film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple race game. The track has 100 spaces. Most spaces are fine. However, if you land on a white space, you find that the gravity force has cut your engine power. You must stay on that space every turn until you throw a 6 which boosts your engine power and allows you to carry on with your journey. If you land on a black space, this represents extra power by the Black Hole and you must return to the Start space and start again on your next turn. The rules say &amp;quot;Care should be taken to avoid the white and black hazard squares&amp;quot;. Well, that would be great but seeing you have to move with just a die roll, it is imp0ossible to &amp;quot;take care&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to reach the Clear space at the end of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
