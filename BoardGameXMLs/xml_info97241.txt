			<description>website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;This is a home-brew game that&amp;rsquo;s seen about 3 years worth of play-testing (on and off). It&amp;rsquo;s a generic &amp;lsquo;vanilla&amp;rsquo; fantasy game; I know there are a lot of these around but please bear with me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design is loosely based on a game by Paul Elliott (Mithras in the RPG.net forums) called Dragons (and used with his permission).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s class based in that your starting point in the game is defined by the character&amp;rsquo;s class and certain tasks are easier or more appropriate for certain classes but it isn&amp;rsquo;t a black and white distinction, your warrior character can cast spells if you insist but that will &amp;lsquo;dilute&amp;rsquo; his ability to kick butt in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a standard 2-dice &amp;lsquo;roll-equal-or-over&amp;rsquo; mechanic but keeps the modifiers to a minimum so there are very few numbers to juggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is &amp;lsquo;pass or fail&amp;rsquo; with a slight difference in that if the PC&amp;rsquo;s roll fails, the opponent necessarily succeeds. So one dice roll determines the outcome of each combat round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upshot of this is that the referee never has to roll any dice. The game plays out on the strength of the players&amp;rsquo; rolls. Not only does this give the ref. time to focus his or her attention elsewhere but makes the game quite convenient for play-by-board outings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The magic system is quite strategic with magic-users having access to &amp;lsquo;magic points&amp;rsquo; of differing colours. A spell can be countered if you can match it point-for-point and colour-for-colour so throwing an extra point into your spell makes it more difficult to counter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures are defined with a single attribute (like the Tunnels &amp;amp; Trolls Monster Rating) but special abilities are activated on specific dice roll results to keep the players guessing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sample dungeon adventure is included and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t guessed already the game is a tribute to old-school games in general and T&amp;amp;T in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This game is available as a free download from 1km1kt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
