							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Struggle For Troy</name>
									
			<description>A two-player strategy board game based on the Trojan War. In the designer's words, &amp;quot;It takes the best of Memoir 44 and other such Hex based war games and changes things that were kind of pet peeves to me, such as the card based movement and the in-ability to fire back at an opponent while he if firing at you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows the land between the Aegean sea and the city of Troy. There is a Greek player whose goal is to put &amp;quot;undetermined&amp;quot; amount of units into the city of Troy. While the Trojan player defends his city by trying to burn all of the Greek player's ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a certain amount of archers, footmen, chariots equipped with horse and charioteer, and heroes with strength in offense or defense. Each different type of unit has a different movement, attack, defense, critical hit score, and range stat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a players turn, they can move as many of their units as they like as long as it complies with the unit's stats. They can also attack other units. To attack, they add the attacking units attack stat with the defending units defense stat. This creates the probability of rolling a hit on the 12-sided die. After the player attacks the defending player, the defending player has the option of retaliating with that same unit or retreating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
