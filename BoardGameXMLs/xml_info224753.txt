							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alternity Science Fiction Roleplaying Game Quickstart Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the new Alternity Science Fiction Roleplaying Game, the game where you get to create your own future! The game shares a name and heritage with a popular RPG from the 1990s, and is a game that embraces all genres of science fiction, from low-tech post-apocalyptic wastelands to ultra-tech space opera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Beta Test Edition contains the latest snapshot of the Alternity game rules still in development. In it, you'll find an overview of the Alternity rules, an adventure scenario, and 6 pregenerated characters so you can get straight to the action. We've included a full color version and one that's a bit more printer-friendly, if that's your thing. We've also included an initiative tracker you can print out to keep your game running smoothly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial release includes The Magellan, the sample adventure used in our first playtest, appropriate to run for groups of seasoned RPG players. The release also now includes Escape from the Institute, an introductory adventure that walks the players and GM through the process of character creation and running the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This packet does not yet contain the full rules for character generation, as we want to focus on how well the system plays, and we'll include those rules in a later update. Also, please note that nothing in this document is final, and any element may be changed at a later date as we continue to iterate and incorporate feedback. As we make updates to the system, we'll also update the files in this title, so you can always get the latest playtest document.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
