When landing on a square bearing your own brand - Take 1 steer from the pool and place it in your corral. Players can lose steers by landing on certain squares.&lt;br/&gt;A Stampede can be an unpleasant place to land. It means you must spin for every steer in your corral - You must spin a 6 to keep them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to be the first player to round up 6 steers and get them safely corralled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;1 Game Board.&lt;br/&gt;1 Spinner.&lt;br/&gt;4 Playing Pieces.&lt;br/&gt;24 Steer Discs.&lt;br/&gt;Rules Are Printed on Inner Box Base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
