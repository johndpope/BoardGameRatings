			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between) but IS already available for sale / early access, so CAN BE PLAYED.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover the mystery through journal entries. No haunting is ever the same thanks to the complex action-reaction and randomization system in the game. The game has first-person camera, much like in Paranormal Activity or Blair Witch Project. You will be taking a role of an artist who has a haunted house and decides to start filming the hauntings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been developed and published by Matthew C Cohen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
