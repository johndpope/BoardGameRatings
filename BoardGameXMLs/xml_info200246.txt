			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbon atoms like you rarely recreate, at least not here in reality. While your mind keeps your attention focused in the shifting distractions of the Design, your atomic body takes well-deserved holiday gliding in the troposhpere. You managed to shack up with two sexy oyxgen molecules, digging their vibrations for the last few days. But now, one of them is getting annoying and the other is losing interest. Fortunately, there is a storm coming. That should shake things up...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans may think that atoms drift aimlessly, one random interaction at a time, but you know better. The atoms call the dream-like realm of imagination where they really spend their time the Design, not that there is much order to it. Still, any time atoms hook up in the real world, its only because something happened in the Design to make it so. But even the fluctuating chaos of the Design develops something of a status quo. At least until the lightning hits...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play requires three packs of standard playing cards and a molecular modeling kit (e.g., Molymod Kit, etc.) - extemporized objects can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two versions of the game were published nearly simultaneously - one for the Game Chef submission and one for general use.  The sole difference involves an additional page noting licensing information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
