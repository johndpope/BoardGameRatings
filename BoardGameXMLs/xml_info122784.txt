			<description>from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distopia (2008) is an indie role-playing game written by Jos&amp;eacute; Carlos de Diego Guerrero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distopia is a role playing game engine which is used as a mechanism to solve the conflicts inherited from the card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPG Deck Building is a system card game where each player builds his own deck of cards from&lt;br/&gt;of cards over the course of the game. That deck steal cards to tackle on you face conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game we will be adding new cards to this deck as players to get forward, with success (Accomplishments) or failure (Complications), in the same. So the players will be in the position of having to optimize each of their decks, on the fly, thereby increasing the chances of stealing a letter beneficial in a conflict, or to phase the obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use these cards played to try to resolve conflict successfully (each has a value) and / or use special skills or provide extra narrative moments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
