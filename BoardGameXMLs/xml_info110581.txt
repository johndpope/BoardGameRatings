							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Esoterica: Grafted</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grafted are not born. They are created. But few come into being willingly. Whether an innocent lifted off the streets, a criminal condemned to torture, or an insane mage that took his experiments a half-step too far, the grafted are forever marked as outsiders. Their mortal flash fused with metal, the grafted must find their way in a world where a grafted's blades signify all that is pariah. This six-page booklet includes rules for playing a grafted in the 4th Edition Dungeons and Dragons Roleplaying Game. Herein, you will find;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     How to become a Grafted, a being who has had metal fused with their mortal flesh.&lt;br/&gt;     Information regarding roleplaying a Grafted.&lt;br/&gt;     Feats and paragon paths for Grafted Characters.&lt;br/&gt;     Emblems, a new form of magic item that bestow enchantments on natural weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
