			<description>HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING is a two-player game with a playing time of about 30 minutes a bout. You are a manager controlling the ring strategy of your fighter, balancing his punching power and offensive and defensive boxing abilities against those of his opponent. You can play two contemporary (1979) or all-time-great fighters creating many &amp;quot;what-if?&amp;quot; situations.&lt;br/&gt;This is not a long-winded, overly complex game but was in the vanguard of beer and pretzels games before the German games invasion. You should be able to read the rules and play your 1st bout within an hour. Advanced optional rules can be added later for more realistic flavor.&lt;br/&gt;Components are meager but complete. Included is a simulated boxing ring with 2 corners divided into sections for each fighter's stance of Aggressive/Counter/Defense. Also included are 2 realistic metal fighters (look great if you paint them), 2 Game charts, and a pad of score sheets, rulebook, 1D6, 20 Contemporary and 20 All-time-great fighter cards.&lt;br/&gt;A turn consists of simultaneously: 1) Secretly choosing your stance, 2) rolling on the &amp;quot;Boxing ability vs. stance&amp;quot; chart for any punches landed, 3) rolling for each landed punch on the &amp;quot;Punching power vs. defense&amp;quot; chart for results, 4) recording points and stats on the score sheet, 5) roll recovery if needed and repeat sequence 3x for each round.&lt;br/&gt;Advanced optional rules include Endurance, TKO, Injuries, Solitaire, Rope-a-dope, Haymakers, Clinching, Stuns, Head Butts, Tiring and everyone's favorite; &amp;quot;add your own&amp;quot; rule.&lt;br/&gt;This game has a real nice boxing feel to it and is remarkably easy to play, especially if you're not the bookkeeper statistician. If you are creative you can come up with modern fighter cards based on their stats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
