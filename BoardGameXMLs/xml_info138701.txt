			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Heroes of Lore, a fan supplement for the Blood &amp;amp; Treasure Fantasy Roleplaying Game, written by John Stater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though classes in any class‐based RPG are very general in nature, sometimes these classes can be further refined and filled with flavor by simply changing around some mechanics and background information. These &amp;lsquo;variants&amp;rsquo; allow for further customization of classes with a minimum risk of powergaming or min‐maxing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Lore provides 52 of these class variants in order to enhance play for any d20 based game. Though Heroes of Lore is designed for use with Blood &amp;amp; Treasure, it can easily be adapted to any gaming system of your choice with minimal hassle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These variants range from a simple idea like a Spy, to more complex roles like a Totem Warrior or a Psionicist. Furthermore, the design idea behind these variants was to keep each class relatively &amp;lsquo;pure&amp;rsquo;. Non‐magic users generally would not have access to spells, and magic users do not have a lot of access to physical means of injury. These variants are refinements of classes, sometimes based on other RPGs, or other times just based on popular archetypes like an investigator or explorer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
