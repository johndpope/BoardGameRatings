							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fandango</name>
									
			<description>Fandango is a 4X style boardgame set in a classic fantasy universe, with some elements permanently changing from game to game (sort of like a legacy game, but with less story telling)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will play as gods that have made a bet between each other, to see who is the best at leading ANY faction to victory.&lt;br/&gt;The winner of a campaign is the player that have accumulated most Victory Points throughout the entire campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All factions have their own special powers, and have different core stats, offering a unique feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn players in turnorder will move some of their troops, then after all players have moved, a round of combat will begin.&lt;br/&gt;Once all combats have been resolved players will then gather ressources based on the regions they control.&lt;br/&gt;And lastly players will if they have enough ressources be able to upgrade their units and recruit reinforcements.&lt;br/&gt;Upgrades will remain in effect for the remainder of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
