							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bailout! The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Like its counterpart, in Bailout! The Card Game; debt is king. You will get caught up in this non stop gotcha action experience.  Just when you think you have the upper hand; the Bailout cards will be flying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game creates fierce competition and there are no guarantees that any of your actions will save your bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete as their favorite bank (Bankruptcy O&amp;rsquo; America, Worth Farless, No Cashvia, Liquidation Brothers, Greedy Investors of America, or Washed Up Mutual)  to compile Bailout Bundles and get a Bailout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better your chances of getting Bailout Bundles you engage in hostile takeovers, risky sales and acquisitions with rival banks to get Bailout Bundles to obtain the bailout. Your conduct causes other banks to focus on your bank as a target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to be the first player to get the set number of Bailout bundles required for the number of people playing the game. A Bailout Bundle is a grouping of cards that equal a set amount of debt.&lt;br/&gt;When you lose, you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
