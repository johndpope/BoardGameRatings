			<description>The last of eight &amp;quot;Nations of Th&amp;eacute;ah&amp;quot; sourcebooks for the 7th Sea roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes detailed descriptions of the geography and political factions of the nation of Vendel and the traditions of the Vestenmannavnjar, as well as extra rules for character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hundred years ago, the islands of Vestenmannavnjar were home to fierce warrior tribes. Wielding powerful rune sorcery and deadly steel, their warriors struck terror into the hearts of Theans everywhere. All that has changed. Vendel, as it now calls itself, has broken from its past and forged a new future. Today, bankers and merchants rule the country, and swords and longboats have been replaced by guilders and trading ships. The streets are clean and modern, the people stand at the forefront of Th&amp;eacute;an achievement. From what was once a savage, wild land now stands the most powerful economic power in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all is not well in this brave new nation. Traditional Vestenmannavnjar still adhere to the old ways, wielding fierce magic in defense of their homes. They call upon the Vendel to abandon their modern advances, while the Vendel sneer as their &amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; cousins edge closer to extinction. The tensions between them threaten to tear the nation apart and unleash an apocalypse that will consume them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether axes or guilders, their weapons are the strongest in Th&amp;eacute;ah. But will they destroy each other before they realize such power?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vendel Vesten sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A lengthy history of the country, including the legendary heroes of its past. &lt;br/&gt;     Complete descriptions of both Vendel and Vestenmannavnjar culture, plus a thorough discussion of the nine islands which comprise their home. &lt;br/&gt;     New details on the Living Runes and the L&amp;aelig;rdom sorcery school which they engendered, as well as extended information on the powerful Vendel Merchant Guilds. &lt;br/&gt;     New rules for Vendel and Vestenmannavnjar Heroes: unique skills and abilities, expanded merchant rules, four new fighting schools, and a new type of Destiny Spread utilizing both Vestenmannavnjar rule casting and Vendel astrology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
