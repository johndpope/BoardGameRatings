			<description>Bingo meets Memory!&lt;br/&gt;Everyone gets a Bingo game board and markers.  Then, the animal cards are placed face-down as in a standard Memory Game.  When a match is turned up, the cards are not taken; instead, a marker is placed on the appropriate animal on the player's Bingo board.  Then, the twist: the two cards are turned face-down again, and a monkey figure ('Pongo') is placed on one of the cards, so it is blocked for the next player(s).  &lt;br/&gt;As usual, three-in-a-row on a Bingo board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;There are four 'Pongos' included, and the difficulty of the game can be varied by using from one to four of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
