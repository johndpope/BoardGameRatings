			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powers-Brawl, a Miniatures Combat RPG, primarily focuses on tactical miniatures combat but also provides a campaign mode for roleplaying.  The core functions work best during tactical combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters can be hand-crafted, or, optionally, randomly generated.  Characters have four Values--two Action Values (Attack and Survive) and two Opposition Values (Evade and Damage).  Values range from -1 to 7+, with an average adult human running 2-3 and an average Super Hero running 3-4.  During combat, the attacker rolls 2d6 + Attack Value against the Defenders Evade +7.  Exceeding the defense results in a hit that yield damage.  Damage is calculated by a similar roll based on other Values.  When damage is suffered a character's Value is reduced by one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also have one or more Powers that are arranged in five groups.  These include stand &amp;quot;super hero&amp;quot; powers and abilities and, obviously, many powers influence combat and damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters can gain Experience Points and Levels during campaign play.  Levels in turn yield improved Powers.  The rules also provide basic mechanisms to be used only in role-play mode, including storytelling, origins, and secret identities.  The primary role-playing concession, however, involves four additional Skills granted to characters to reflect abilities beyond combat:  Dexterity, Perception, Strength, and Willpower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
