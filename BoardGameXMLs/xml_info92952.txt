							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cat With Gold Eyes</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herbert Twelvetrees, a successful forester merchant, is hiring adventurers to perform a seemingly simple task. His aunt, Serene, recently died. In order to gain his inheritance, Herbert must go into her mansion and get the cat with the gold eyes. Herbert&amp;rsquo;s problem is that he has a strong fear of cats, and try as he might, he simply can&amp;rsquo;t bring himself to search the old lady&amp;rsquo;s house. Serena loved cats, and filled her house with strays. Herbert will gladly hire any number of adventurers to search his aunt&amp;rsquo;s house and bring him the cat with the gold eyes before midnight. In exchange, Herbert will offer each character a promissory note good for $100 in trade at any of his fine stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters must bring the cat to the High Judge&amp;rsquo;s mansion, where Herbert will be waiting with &amp;lsquo;the box.&amp;rsquo; And they must hurry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
