What the hell are you supposed to do now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a SPACE BASTARD! , a galactic warrior whose only claim to fame is being good at reducing other Bastards to their base molecular structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than face the unspeakable horrors of a desk job you can cruise the galaxy meeting interesting aliens and kill them for nothing more than the glory of battle... and the skyrocketing ratings of the Galactic Network that televise their epic struggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPACE BASTARDS! From outer space! Coming soon to a planet near you... perhaps you should move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPACE BASTARDS! is a miniatures game that pits you against your fellow players.
