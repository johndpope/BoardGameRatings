							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Trail 2D10</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the new 2D10 RPG, the Trail is a free fantasy adventure centered in a frontier village called Jegyr's Creek, following upon events presented in the first part of the trilogy, the Truce. After maintaing a valued truce between centaurs and local settlers, the heroes must respond to the disturbing assault on one of their community's peacekeepers. Who ambushed her in the woods? Can they exact revenge? What other evil awaits them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of all, it's one page. And free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Trail is the second part in a trilogy of adventures which can be inserted into a fantasy setting of choice or used to form the backdrop of a larger story. Look for the final chapter soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background Notes: This adventure was actually written many years ago, rediscoverd in a backup archive, and edited for use with 2D10. You can easily use it with another game system of choice. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
