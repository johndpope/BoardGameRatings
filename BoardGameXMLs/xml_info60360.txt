			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mighty Fleet&lt;br/&gt;War is a great beast that bears no respect for anything or anyone. Wherever there is ambition or a desire for power, there will be war. The sea is not an exception; ever since the first sentient race used anything that floated to bring harm to enemies, the ocean became one of many battlefields, and its watery depths are the final resting place for those who fell in battle, sunken ships as their only grave and monument. Warships are as common a sight as merchants and explorers, and captains of any type of vessel must learn to recognise the outline of a ship, for telling friend from foe is a skill that can save many lives on the open seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You Will Find:&lt;br/&gt;War at Sea: A detailed look at just how the different races fight at sea and what influences their crews and warships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crews: Hire greatly specialised crews and captains, all designed to get the very best out of the largest vessels to ever set sail on the high seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weaponry: New shipboard weapons employed by many races, from the innocuous Snaring Anchor to the devastating beam of the Sun Mirror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of War: A multitude of new ships, covering a huge range of warships and complete with detailed deckplans. Confound an enemy with the Fireship, search the depths of the ocean with the gigantic Razorback submersible, or fight an entire war from the deck of the mighty ironclad Thunderchild dreadnought, the greatest ship ever to have set sail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
