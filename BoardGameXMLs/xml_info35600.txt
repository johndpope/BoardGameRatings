			<description>Simple roll-and-move game for younger children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the spinner and move the indicated number of spaces. If the space landed on has a black arrow, the player must obey the instructions the arrow points to. If a player lands on a square with a numbered fish, that number of fish are caught by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player reaches the finish square by exact count,&lt;br/&gt;the game ends. The player with the most fish at that time is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
