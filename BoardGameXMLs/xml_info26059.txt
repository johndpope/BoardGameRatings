			<description>Ancient Greeks invent the board games (petties) and the most famous was &amp;quot;Pessoi&amp;quot; in many eras and with many differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pythagoras of Samos is often described as the first pure mathematician. He is an extremely important figure in the development of mathematics yet we know relatively little about his mathematical achievements. Unlike many later Greek mathematicians, where at least we have some of the books which they wrote, we have nothing of Pythagoras's writings. The society which he led, half religious and half scientific, followed a code of secrecy which certainly means that today Pythagoras is a mysterious figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pythagoras is the recreation of the Pythagorian &amp;quot;Pessoi&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;This is a real ancient boardgame from ancient Hellas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is one board. &lt;br/&gt;There are 2-6 players. &lt;br/&gt;Each player has pawns. &lt;br/&gt;Pawns must have the signs of ancient Greek letters. &lt;br/&gt;Also there are three dice with ancient Greek shapes on them.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest die roll plays first. &lt;br/&gt;All pawns must enter the board make a word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board game Pythagoras has the following items:&lt;br/&gt;1. A Colorful Board.&lt;br/&gt;2. Pawns/letters different in color and shape for each of the players.&lt;br/&gt;3. One to Three dice  with different shapes on each one.&lt;br/&gt;4. Many other items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
