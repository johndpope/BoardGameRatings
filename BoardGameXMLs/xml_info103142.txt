			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In CJ's Elephant Antics, you play the role of Columbus Jumbo, and you are on a plane, on your way to a zoo. Your captors plan to make a very nice exhibit of you. But... you don't want to live in captivity! You want to be home, in Africa! You need to escape!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, turbulence hits the plane! Your cage opens! You grab the opportunity, and a nearby umbrella and you leap off the plane!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you land, you realize that you are... oh no... in France? That's far away from home! Your adventure begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CJ's Elephant Antics encompasses four levels - France, Switzerland, Egypt and Africa. Throughout these levels you need to jump, outsmart, or fight your way through obstacles who try to stop you from getting home. Each level ends in a boss fight whom you have to beat to continue. On the bright side, you have an unlimited amount of peanuts you can fire as projectiles. You also have some bombs you can use in really tough spots. Will you manage to make it home?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
