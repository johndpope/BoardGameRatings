			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurers Beware! - A night of fright and scare are upon you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the town of Marstein with an added creepy map to deliver a unique atmospheric experience. Dive deep into the lore and townsfolk that live and breath, as the Zomquatch breathes down their necks. Find strange fellows and search the haunted woods of the Yagruu for a resurrected beast that's been savagely killing the townsfolk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're wondering what Otherworlds has to offer, then check out the game's features and benefits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     D6 System: A simple d6 system that allows you to handle any situation with a simple roll of a d6, that doesn't get in the way of the story, but rather lends towards it. &lt;br/&gt;     Dynamic Combat: Combat utilizes opposed rolls, so you always feel more involved in the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;action! Combat Maneuvers, are special feats you can perform and keep the combat experience fresh and ever-changing to prevent stale combat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     No Two Are The Same: Imagine and play the character you want to play as. Acquire new abilities in an open way, where your character's progression isn't picked for you by a chart allowing you to have the ultimate freedom for character building!&lt;br/&gt;     Enhanced Story: Choose your character's Destiny, which will guide their evolving story throughout your adventures. Character connections, personality traits, convictions, and secrets will add many layers to the story that's being created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
