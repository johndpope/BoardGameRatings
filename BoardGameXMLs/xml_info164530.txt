							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rising Sun Form 10s</name>
									
			<description>This product supports the Command at Sea (CaS) supplement Rising Sun, which provides scenarios covering the first half of WW II in the Pacific (December 1941 - November 1943). A Form 10 lists all the statistics for the ship, along with weapon ranges and hit chances, sensor ranges, maneuvering data, and a damage tracking form - all the information needed to use that ship in a CaS game.&lt;br/&gt;Consisting of over 360 separate Form 10s, it provides the ships needed for all the surface battles in the Rising Sun scenario booklet. And the ships are listed in their exact configuration for each scenario. If a ship was refitted between one battle and the next, it has a form for before and after.&lt;br/&gt;There are no carriers or submarines, only the surface ships, and only in the configurations needed for the scenarios in Rising Sun. There are no rules included. Players will need the CaS 4th edition rules to use these Forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
