							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Good King Banana</name>
									
			<description>A children's game modelled on pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey, only in this case, the object is to pin bananas in the proper place on a linen-like cloth with bright lithographed cartoon-like characters and the image of a boy holding a banana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bananas with green tips go into the fruit bowl, bananas that are all yellow and ripe go into the boy's hand. &lt;br/&gt;The players are blindfolded, and the one who pins his/her banana nearest to its correct position wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game promoted the banana as the healthy &amp;quot;friend of little folks&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
