							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Regents of the Roads: Gnomish Archetypes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Time to Go Roaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gnomes are an unusual race, who don&amp;rsquo;t quite seem to belong anywhere. Some are great illusionists with a close connection to the fey, others are mad tinkerers and alchemists, prone to explosions and mishaps, and still others are slaves to an intense wanderlust and known for the vibrant colors of their skin and hair. Though they never quite fit in, gnomes can be found just about everywhere, and they have a knack for always doing things their own way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, when you choose to make your player character a gnomes, all that you really care about is the +2 bonus to your Constitution and Charisma scores (and who needs Strength, anyway?), so why bother playing a gnome alchemist or druid? Even if a +2 bonus doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make that much of a difference, it just feels so wrong to knowingly combine a race and class that don&amp;rsquo;t go well together, and, as a result, many players never bother to consider it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book aims to give players who want the fact that their character is a gnome to matter more a way to make that happen, while also providing support for gnome characters of a variety of classes that don&amp;rsquo;t typically make much mechanical sense for gnomes. Included are the gnomish alchemist, a mad scientist who can create extracts that produce powerful illusions, and can even craft their own clockwork familiars, the gnomish illusionist, a wizard archetype for gnomes devoted heavily to illusion, the gnomish sensationalist, an investigator archetype for gnomes who want to live life to the fullest by experiencing every sensation possible, the gnomish wanderer, a ranger archetype devoted to travelling to new and exotic lands, and the gnomish wildspeaker, a druid archetype for gnomes that want to get in touch with their fey heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
