			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My name is Ted. It's been almost ten years since the genesis of my people. The &amp;lsquo;Great Dawning' it was called by the more academic members of our society. We arose from an eternal slumber that none of us ever expected to wake from, with our supposed masters missing and no answers as to why, most of us with powers we cannot explain or even attempt to understand. But here we are simple children's toys, sentient, cognizant, and potent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was from these strange origins we began life. Each of us emerging from our former masters' homes and toy boxes into the light of awareness. No bodies to be found, just a vibrant world abandoned. The automated processes held the world together for a while, but soon food began to rot and reactors began to melt down. It mattered little to us. The supply of batteries, patches, and other supplies seemed endless. After all who was there to stop us from walking into the local store and taking them off the shelf? My own feet have been patched numerous times. But the shelves didn't restock themselves and greedy toys took more than their fair share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life is damn hard on the street nowadays. At first everything was hunky dory, but life fell apart quickly. At first we thought we had risen into a utopia where no hatred or prejudices existed. We were wrong. It did not take long for the more powerful toys to seize power and subjugate the lesser toys to gathering and maintenance duties. Soon the tyrants of our world had amassed glue, batteries, screws, and thread, the staples of our measly lives. Now they ration it off to those that follow their orders and are good little slaves. Well this is one bear who isn't going to effin' put up with it anymore! These sons of bitches are going to pay for the suffering and pain they have set upon us. The enslaved must rise up and overthrow this oppressive tyranny in a hail of fists and destruction. I think a great human once said &amp;quot;The time is near at hand which must determine whether we are to be free toys or slaves.&amp;quot; That time is now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
