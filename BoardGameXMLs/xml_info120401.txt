			<description>This is a game of women's collegiate volleyball (Division I).  Players are rated for their ability to kill, set, block, serve, and dig.  Three, ten-sided dice are used to resolve Actions from the Action Chart.  All Actions require the comparison of two ratings.  Depending on the outcome of the ratings checked, teams can score big, score small, or get scored against.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 329 Division I teams are rated in 32 separate conferences.  The game includes all charts and tables, a rule book, and the Final 32 from the 2011 NCAA Division I tournament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
