			<description>Take a card and remember what you took. Easy, no?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, because in Memento each card has both a color and shape on it, and each color and shape has a different scoring method with different priorities. On top of that, you'll want to remember the order in which you took various cards because their sequence matters, too. If this game proves too simple for a memory mastermind like yourself, then step up to the professional version of gameplay and see whether you can still keep things in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
