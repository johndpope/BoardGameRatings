			<description>Have you ever wanted a sleeping bag that promotes spine alignment, or a baby stroller, that comes with a turbo boost?  In But Wait, There's Even More!, players pitch wacky products to each other for fun and profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Wait, There's, Even More, is the follow-on game to But Wait, There's More. But Wait, There's, Even More, can be combined with the original game, or it can be played on its own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player receives three &amp;quot;Feature&amp;quot; cards. Each round starts with one Product card being revealed from the deck, e.g., Fork. Each player, in turn, has thirty seconds to play one of their Feature cards &amp;ndash; say, &amp;quot;Voice Activated&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; and pitch their own version of a fork. At some point during these thirty seconds, this player must say, &amp;quot;But wait, there's more!&amp;quot;, then reveal the top Feature card from the deck &amp;ndash; say, &amp;quot;inflates in under 6 Minutes&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; and incorporate that Feature into their Product. Once all players have pitched their unique version of a fork, everyone votes simultaneously for which pitches they liked the best. The top vote-getter after three rounds wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With six or more people, play in teams, with the first player on a team starting the pitch with one of their Feature cards and the second player finishing the pitch with a Feature card of their own, but neither player knows what the other Feature is until they are revealed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
