			<description>Two teams consisting of six tribe members each land on a desert island. They try to survive by exploring the island and collecting provisions, with each team doing their best to outsmart their rivals. The teams face off in exciting elimination challenges. After the tribes have merged it&amp;rsquo;s every player for himself. Players individually vote for those tribe members with whom they&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep going as long as possible. Will you survive this bloodcurdling knock-out race? Who among you is the true Survivor?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The player who, after the Merge, has cast the most votes for the last standing tribe member wins Expeditie Robinson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play:&lt;br/&gt;Expeditie Robinson is played in 2 phases:&lt;br/&gt;1. The Team Phase (2 islands)&lt;br/&gt;2. The Merge (1 island, every man for himself)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Team Phase (2 islands)&lt;br/&gt;Each team tries to accomplish 3 different missions before the Team Phase ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With each of the three missions the teams can earn an extra voting card to be used in the next phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3 missions&lt;br/&gt;&amp;deg; Have more tribe members (pawns) than the opposing team.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;deg; Have &amp;ldquo;explored&amp;rdquo; (turned over) more island tiles than the opposing team. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;deg; Have more provisions left than the opposing team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teams take turns. A turn consists of two action points. There are two different actions, each costing one action point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;deg; Choosing an island tile&lt;br/&gt;Choose one tile from the four stacks in the middle of the table and join it to the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;deg; Moving a tribe member&lt;br/&gt;Move a team member by one tile. It doesn't matter if the tile has been explored already. by doing this you can explore the tiles you've added and find provisions. With these provisions you can feed your tribe members and build tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a turn a team can perform every possible combination of these two actions. As well as actions, you are always allowed to make a campfire and tools without the cost of action points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elimination challenge&lt;br/&gt;Whenever the 'Elimination challenge' tile has been revealed the challenge is played. The teams each take their own sets of dice and take turns. They must try to build a tower of six dice, with &amp;ldquo;6&amp;rdquo; at the bottom, followed by &amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;, and finally &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; on top. The first player to succeed wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Merge (1 island, every man for himself)&lt;br/&gt;Players now play on individually; teams no longer exist. Each player receive voting cards for 4 votes, 2 votes. Players that belonging to the team that won a mission during the Team Phase gets 1 extra vote for every mission they won.&lt;br/&gt; Voting&lt;br/&gt;Players cast their votes in secret. Putting every voting card they possess into a slot in the voting tray. &lt;br/&gt;On the voting tray each slot has its own color. These colors represent tribe members. Casting a vote into the red slot means voting for the red tribe member. Of course you will do what you can for your chosen tribe member to be the last one standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knock-out race begins&lt;br/&gt;Just as in the Team Phase, a player playing his turn has the two same action points and actions that can be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players try to find food for the tribe member they voted for so they stay in the game. But not to obvious, otherwise they might get discovered and thrown out by other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One by one the tribe members will get eliminated. The game will continue this way until there&amp;rsquo;s only one tribe member left. This is the last standing tribe member, in other words, the true Survivor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the time has come for an exciting moment &amp;minus; who voted for this tribe member and how many votes did he cast? The player to have cast the most votes for the Survivor, is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
