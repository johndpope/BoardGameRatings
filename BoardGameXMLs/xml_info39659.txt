			<description>A Leader of Men is a miniature wargame capturing Company-level combat in WW2 and more recent wars.

Players will get intensely involved in the game as the battles developed and are shaped by the Leaders the player represents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules include all you need to start playing except for the equipment listed in the rules, miniatures, and scenery.  The book is 118 pages in an A4 format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Rules covering combat during WW2 with many helpful examples of play, guides, and thoughts on the application.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Six generic scenarios for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; A solo play scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; A guide to major armies in Europe during WW2.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; A selection of Army lists for the major combatants with individual Army Quick Reference Sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; A Quick Reference page for the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Army List note pages to record the important details of your army in an easy to use format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
