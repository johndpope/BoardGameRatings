			<description>Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Starlight Vega&amp;rdquo; is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game, with GirlxGirl romances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as Aria, a girl who moves into her grandfather&amp;rsquo;s old house. While exploring the upstairs study one night, she and her friend Melody accidentally unleash a flirtatious demon named Lyria, who spent the past 50 years in a stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After freeing her from her prison, the two become attached by a &amp;lsquo;Lifelink Stone&amp;rsquo;, which means Lyria can&amp;rsquo;t go far from Aria without feeling repercussions, and vice versa. This gets quite awkward when Aria tries to go about (what&amp;rsquo;s left of) her normal life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available on PC, Mac, and Linux. Different endings and romance routes are obtainable through your choices made throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feature&lt;br/&gt; - 3 Yuri romance routes (including harem!)&lt;br/&gt; - Many Potential endings based off your choices&lt;br/&gt; - Professional Soundtrack&lt;br/&gt; - Full color CGs&lt;br/&gt; - A multitude of expressions and poses for each sprite&lt;br/&gt; - DRM free&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
