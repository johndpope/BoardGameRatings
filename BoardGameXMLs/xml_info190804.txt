			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Courage is about using the Net to explore ideas and options. The game invites you to step outside the boundaries of social networks to find out what else is on offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You choose where to go and how to act in an open ended journey. The game has Courage as its central theme - and wraps this in a personal take on Scotland that visits a country in terms of characters, cultures and connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can act as a list of handy links, as a source of ideas for activities - or as a production game where players start to create their own content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like similar games Courage includes a badging system to make it easy for players to track and recognise their progress. This works much along the lines of collecting football or band stickers, but the badges are for doing things you choose to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who might be interested in trying out Courage, whether as a list of ideas and activities, or as a full on production game, are likely to include the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone interested in exploring the Net and/ or Scotland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those prepared to explore their own understandings of identity and courage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adults and young adults concerned about employability and developing portfolios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parents and carers looking to get more involved in their kids&amp;rsquo; learning and pastimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teachers and librarians involved in developing learning opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the topics explored, (particularly in the S&amp;igrave;th section), look at sensitive issues. As with the rest of the game a measure of adult oversight is recommended. Even if only in terms of checking the disclaimer and the S&amp;igrave;th links to allow a young adult to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
