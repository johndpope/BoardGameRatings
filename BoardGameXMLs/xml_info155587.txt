							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tree Frog</name>
									
			<description>Tree frog brothers are going home. However, they want to eat flies rather than to go home where the mother is waiting at. She will get angry and not give yummy supper if the brothers are too late. Therefore, go home before she puts away food! Of course, the frogs have to eat flies enough on the load. Eating is our instinct. ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Goal]&lt;br/&gt;Despite of mom's call, it's more important to eat flies than go home. Because we are tree frogs! But if you are too late, you'll get a scolding from mom. So be careful. Eat flies as many as possible and escape penalty points, and then win this game between brothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Play - Brief Rules]&lt;br/&gt;This is a dexterity game by flipping the paper(origami) frog.&lt;br/&gt;On the game board, there are circle target and moving track. Each round the players flip own frog to the target, and move his tokens on the track according to the result of the target. Players should compete with each other to get more stone tiles which have points on the track. For this, flipping the frog to proper target area is very important. But it won&amp;rsquo;t be easy because the terrible event cards are opened frequently. Flip and go, and eat flies(points)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Game Ends &amp;amp; Scoring]&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when one of the following situations is happened.&lt;br/&gt;1. When any player's game token arrives at a home(Mom) space on the track. &lt;br/&gt;2. When 'Mom card' is opened from Event Card deck.&lt;br/&gt;In these cases, immediately game is over without the next round.&lt;br/&gt;Scores are as follow: Fly points + 1.Home bonus points - 2.Penalty points for late (Depend on the above end situations.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
