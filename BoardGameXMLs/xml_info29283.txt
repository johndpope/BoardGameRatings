							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Bash: Bloods and Lupines</name>
									
			<description>The vampire screamed in agony as the werewolf ripped at his chest, dead blood flying everywhere. The vampire though, was a tough foe and with a puff of smoke, turned into mist and floated away, only to return to its true form several steps beyond. With a sly grin the blood drinker raised its clawed hand and out of the sewer drain swarmed a vast carpet of rats. The moving rug of vermin swarmed the savage were-creature and soon it fell to the ground, howls of agony rising from the mound of filthy rats as they devoured the were-beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Monster Bash, the newest game from Bad Baby Productions. Take on the role of a savage monster from classic horror tales, build gangs of these monsters and battle your foes as each tries to take control of the city&amp;rsquo;s dark, horror filled underworld. Gangs of monsters confront each other in deadly brawls as each tries to devour the fear filled humans that flee through the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster Bash is a fully expandable system, with each set offering two new types of monstrous gang, new Battle Tiles to fight upon and new, exciting special abilities and rules. So gather a few friends, sit down and have a ghoulish night filled with monstrous fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first set covers the monstrous gangs of the vampires and werewolves. Everything you need to play is included and when combined with other sets, you can create a horror filled game of nightmarish fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrates with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Monster Bash 2: Franks and Ghouls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
