			<description>This is a free &amp;quot;indoor soccer&amp;quot; board game for two players. The game may be downloaded from &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.krimsu.de&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.krimsu.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game components consist of a player board ( two identical jpeg files ) English rules ( or German )and a sheet of counters.&lt;br/&gt;You play a coach in charge of directing five players and a keeper on a board consisting of  9x14 (126) squares. Each turn you roll three dice and may use them to dribble, pass, or run. Generally you may only use one die per soccer player and move in one direction as is the case in dribbling. If you are running a player without the ball, or if you are passing or shooting, you may use the pips on another die to change directions ( curve )  and move in that new direction. Movement points are flexible, in that you do not have to use the maximum amount shown on the die if you don't want to, but direction of travel is usually linear unless you use the second die as mentioned above. The components ( especially the field which you have to print twice ) are beautiful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
