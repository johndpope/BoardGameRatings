			<description>A First Level Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure begins with the party entering the Blackwood, an expanse of forest north of Thandiel. While in Thandiel, the party consigned to a quest directly from the city's ruler, Lord Greggor Thanus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city has recently fallen victim to string of disappearances, the latest of which being a 6 year old girl named Alli. The missing townfolk had disappeared without a trace, until now. On the edge of the Blackwood, a scrap of Alli's nightgown was found clinging to a tree branch. In a public call for heroes, the player characters accepted the quest to find the missing townfolk, alive or otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the party may not know is that nearly a century prior, the city was besieged by a demonic invasion. At the start of the invasion, the demon army constructed a fortress within the nearby forest. At the time of the invasion the fortress held an active portal crossing planes to the Abyss, the demonic homeworld. In a heroic push, the city's bravest heroes journeyed into the forest, assaulted the fortress and destroyed the portal. Without reinforcements, the demon invasion soon failed and the city of Thandiel was safe once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
