			<description>The racing game Poomp! uses simultaneous speed card play to represent the time aspect of racing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing a card exactly within the window for moving ahead may mean waiting a split second for the right opportunity. Pushing ahead with a card too high or too low will require that you burn certain additional cards in a different window, causing you to waste seconds a different way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a speed game with modeless play, Poomp! is inherently not friendly to new players who are playing with experienced players. Practiced players should ease new players into the game by (1) taking things easy on new players until they internalize the (few, but essential) rules for card play, and by (2) gradually introducing the full ruleset (powerups, additional numbered cards, character abilities) to new players in a manner similar to that described in the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Poomp! plays up to 8 players, fewer players can race together: The game AI simulates missing players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Poomp! requires the following components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Track cards depicting straight, curved, or tightly curved track&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Terrain cards depicting shouldered or unshouldered, railed or unrailed terrain&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Powerup cards of varying types&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Powerup markers in three colors&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Car markers in different colors&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Several decks, numbered 1 to 10, in different colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poomp! is set in the post-apocalyptic setting of New Amarillo, a setting shared with South Quarter Independent&amp;rsquo;s upcoming games Radio Cloud (SQI012, a roletaking game), Bragging Rights (SQI016, a storytelling game), and Dustbowl (SQI027, a wheeled combat game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
