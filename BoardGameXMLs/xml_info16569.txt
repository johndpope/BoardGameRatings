							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triton II</name>
									
			<description>Set in an imaginary galaxy, the game pits the Triton Empire against the Megan Confederation.  The basis for the conflict revolves around the shortage of a mineral called &amp;quot;galactium&amp;quot; used to power the propulsion systems of starships and vehicles.  The Triton empire has invaded the mining planet Abarathascan (renamed Triton II after the invasion by the Tritons) to gain control of the galactium supply.  The Megan Confederation will have none of that and hence the invasion of Triton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on 3 separate 8-1/2&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; hex maps depicting the main mining centers of Triton II.  Basic wargame mechanics such as Zones of control, Combat results tables, Terrain Effects Tables, describe the basic gameplay.  Both sides use transport ships to move ground units between maps.  Production points are alloted at the beginning of gameplay, used by each side to purchase their forces.  All space craft movement over the planet surface is conducted in a simultaneous plot mechanism.  Bases on the planet surface can be used to repair damaged craft or vehicles.  Victory conditions are determined by the scenario and involve accumulating victory points obtained by occupying the planets resource centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
