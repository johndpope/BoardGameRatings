			<description>Cardio Alarm is a card game, a frenzy race on hospital corridors.&lt;br/&gt;Block all the entrances before the agents escape with a &amp;quot;secret project&amp;quot;. For your disposal you have the hospital staff, as well as your reflexes and cunning. Who will be the fastest, wins. The box contains the elements needed to play the game, plus DVD &amp;quot;Blisko serca&amp;quot; and educational inserts. The game was created to support the &amp;quot;Tik Tak. Jestem na tak!&amp;quot; action. Purpose of the program is to raise funds for the creation of the first family of prosthetic heart for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a rules of the domino - with the difference that on the cards, instead of the dots are colors. In the game there are two decks of cards. One of the players is a &amp;quot;Hospital Ordinator&amp;quot; and draw three cards from the first deck. The rest of the players are &amp;quot;Agents&amp;quot; and each of them draw five cards from the second deck. Before start of the game, players put &amp;quot;start marker&amp;quot; in front of them - the task for Agents is to put as much card to it as possible. These are hospital corridors - the escape route.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Agents&amp;rdquo; put their cards in sequence, according to the rules, trying to create the longest escape route. &amp;ldquo;Hospital Ordinator&amp;rdquo; - playing in real time - with staff and special cards will try to block all the exits. The game ends at the moment in which the agents can no longer put any card, or the &amp;quot;Ordinator&amp;quot; isn't be able to draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;At the end, players count how many cards is put as an escape route and nominate another player to become an &amp;quot;Hospital Ordinator&amp;quot;. Which player ends with the least number of corridors - win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
