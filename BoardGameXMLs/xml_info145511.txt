							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Basilisks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the dangerous and deadly basilisk. A popular figure in medieval mythology, there are numerous different versions of basilisks to be found throughout the ages, and the version associated with most roleplaying games (the kind that turns victims to stone) is actually one of the newest. The basilisk snake (CR 2), found in this book, is a smaller, serpentine version of a basilisk, which has a more gradual petrification gaze, but also exudes a deadly toxin from its skin. The miasmic basilisk (CR 7), on the other hand, is more lizard-like, and can breathe a cloud of thick venomous gases, which weaken foes and obscure vision. Its terror-inducing gaze is enhanced with glowing eyes, that allow it to affect creatures even through this dense fog. The most powerful basilisk in the book, however, is the mountain basilisk (CR 10), whose gaze can outright kill, and whose poisonous blood infects those who wound it, among other potent and deadly abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
