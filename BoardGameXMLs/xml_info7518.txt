			<description>Each player has to simultaneously make up words from the same set of letter cards which are dealt randomly. On each turn, all players are given one minute to select their best word, the longest of which wins the round and is written onto the playing board in a vertical or horizontal fashion. All subsequent words placed must connect, in crossword fashion, to those words already on the board. Points are scored for each letter written on the board to make up a word (as indicated on the letter card) plus bonus points whenever a bonus square is covered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
