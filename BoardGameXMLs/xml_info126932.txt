							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mickey Mouse Electric Treasure Hunt Game</name>
									
			<description>The game is made by Tudor, the company who brought you the vibrating Electric Football game. Teamed up with Disney, this much simpler (and as a result, more fun for kids) game uses that same clever technology. Happily, all you have to do to play is put your ship in one of the tracks and let it go. You can adjust the knob on the board to control the speed (amount of vibration), but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to fiddle with anything else to play! Just flip the switch and you&amp;rsquo;re off to search for treasure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose from one of 4 - '1.5&amp;quot; long' ships made of tin and plastic, which are piloted by either Mickey, Donald, Goofy or Pluto. Each character has a differently colored background on their game piece. There are four Ports to choose from as a starting point for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to sail for the Treasure Chests at the top, worth from $200 to $500! Many sailors will be side tracked along the way into one of the many Coves where lesser treasure of $100 can still be found. But watch out! Captain Hook is on the prowl as his ship starts out from Pirate&amp;rsquo;s Cove from the top of the board and if you are intercepted by his ship, you&amp;rsquo;re sunk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the lesser treasure coves along the routes include names like Smugger's Cove, Doubloon Cove, Neverland Cove, Skeleton Cove, Shark Cove and several others. The Treasure Chests at the top include Captain Kidd's Treasure, Captain Morgan's Treasure, Captain Hook's Treasure and Long John Silver's Treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO PLAY PROVIDED BY Jason Monroe&lt;br/&gt;(belial1134) after a short visit to the Unidentified Games Area&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
