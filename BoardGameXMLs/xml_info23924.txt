			<description>Stock market game where players try to amass money in a specified time limit or play to a set monetary goal. Players move around the board buying and selling shares of, primarily, commodities. The price is determined by &amp;quot;price index cards,&amp;quot; that periodically change when players land on certain squares. There is also an auction mechanic and events cards that increase or decrease demand for certain products. The game has a heavy lucky factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
