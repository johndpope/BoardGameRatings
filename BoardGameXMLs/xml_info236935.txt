			<description>...and the Hunter will Become the Hunted&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main gates into the city of Greyhawk were generally taken for granted by the gate guards and populace at large. True, each half of the portal must have weighed many tons judging from the thickness and height of the gate halves, which appeared to be carved granite. It was also true that being able to shut the gates at night was a matter of turning a very small crank in each gate half and that did seem odd to some, but the matter was never given a second through, the gates just were. It was also true that the gates radiated magic when anyone thought to test them, but half the city radiated some type of magic so why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t the gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
