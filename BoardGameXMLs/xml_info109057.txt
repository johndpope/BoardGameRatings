							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bournville Cocoa</name>
									
			<description>Cadbury placed this game into a children's Christmas annual, called Chick's Own, in 1952, as an advertisement for their hot cocoa drink.&lt;br/&gt;Any number can play. Give each player a piece of paper and get them to write down Cadburys Bournville Cocoa on it.&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the game is to collect all the letters that spell Cadburys Bournville Cocoa. Almost every square on the board has a letter, so if you arrive on a square you can tick off that letter from the name on your paper.&lt;br/&gt;You need a 6 to start (of course!).&lt;br/&gt;If you land on a square with special instructions, you must obey them.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to tick off all their letters, wins. And the rules say you should get a steaming cup of lovely chocolately Bournville Cocoa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
