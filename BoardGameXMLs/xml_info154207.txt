							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Revenge of the Martians</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Twas the Night Before Christmas... and Martians were storming the North Pole!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time, Santa Claus, Billy, and Betty were kidnapped by aliens and brought to Mars. The Christmas Spirit prevailed and Santa won the day. Now, five decades later, the Martians have returned, and Billy, Betty, Santa's daughter Sugar Plum, and Santa's loyal Elf Commados must battle the Martians again--and Santa's life hangs in the balance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROLF!: Revenge of the Martians is a sequel to the classic Christmas movie (Christmas turkey some might say) Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Authorized by Saint Nick himself, this supplement features half a dozen pre-generated characters together with the combat maneuvers and traits needed to fill your ROLF! game with cheerful Christmas chaos, and six linked battle scenarios that tell the epic tale of the night the Martians struck back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also introduced in this set are some simple vehicle design and combat rules that can add a new level of play (and mindless mayhem) to your ROLF! games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Merry Christmas to All, and to All a Good Fight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
