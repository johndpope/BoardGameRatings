			<description>Hanna Barbera's Turbo Toons is a Europe-exclusive video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that was released in 1994. The entire game is in the English language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player has to race Hanna-Barbera characters like Yogi Bear, Top Cat, Snagglepuss, along with other classic characters around a simple race track while trying to finish in first place. Levels range from a forest level to an arctic-type level. Even though the game was never released in North America despite being finished for such a release and being rated by the ESRB (K-A), there was still a preview of this game on issue 74 of the American video gaming magazine Nintendo Power. A Japanese release was never planned for this video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hanna Barbera's Turbo Toons&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
