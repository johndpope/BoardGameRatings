							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yago Pool Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The world's first see-through card game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elements of Yago finger billiards pool combined in a clever card game for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card game includes 90 game cards, 10 wild cards, a game board, cardboard, 2 special dice, 5 red and 5 yellow chips and a rules in four languages (German, English, French and Italian).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game idea is based on the same game system as Yago pool finger billiards. First, players gain cards.  Each card has a 3x3 grid (like the holes on a Yago Pool board) of which 8 of the points are punched.  The cards are stacked in the hand held (that is not fanned, like a traditional card game) so that the solid point on each card can be seen through the cards.  Once a player has the right combination of cards and can create a row, players can then place a chip (red or yellow) on one of the corresponding points on the game board. If a player can cover all five points on the wild card, he may place his chip on any point on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring is via making rows on the main board.  1 point for a line of three chips or placing 5 chips on the board.  Three points if the 5 chips makes 2 lines simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
