			<description>Gauntlet - From the Klix Pocket Travel Games from Tiger Electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board folds out, the magnetic pieces (which function as both player pieces and tokens for the potion track) are stored in a built-in compartment and the dice are self-contained in a see-through compartment. The dice are 'rolled' by pushing and releasing the 'dice snapper'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board itself is broken into four sections: &amp;quot;Room 1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Room 2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Room 1-3 Treasure Room&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Room 4&amp;quot;. The players take turns moving through the rooms in order, landing on one of four kinds of space: a blank space, a space with food on it (which adds to the players food/HP), a space with a ghost on it (which subtracts from the same), and a space with a bomb (which advances the players 'potion track' by one). The final space on the Room 4 board contains the 'Sacred Orb'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
