			<description>Have you ever wanted to see piggies fight? In Elemental Piggies you get to do just that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;This game is about beating your opponent's pigs with pigs that counter the ones in place without being able to look at the opponents card, you will have to just trust them or call them out on their lie. However if you falsely accuse someone of lying you are the one that takes the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets 10 cards. On each card are a number of piggies with an elemental affiliation: water, fire, wind, void and earth. One element beats another or you can overpower a card with the number of pigs in the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players place their cards in the middle of the table and try to beat the value of the card that was previously placed. If they can't beat the value, they must take the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO WIN&lt;br/&gt;Play cards with pigs and elements and the first to get rid of all of their cards wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
