							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reise nach Moskau</name>
									
			<description>Reise nach Moskau is the game of Misha the Bear's travels across the USSR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a hand of 8 city cards, representing cities in the USSR and 4 action cards which let them take special moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to play all your cards by moving from city to city and then return to Moscow when you have no cards in hand.  The player that does this first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City cards are played just by moving to the corresponding city on the map (players familiar with Wildlife Adventure will see a similarity but this game does not use routes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards are played instead of moving and allow the player to do things such as fly to any city, force another player to draw an additional city card, or &amp;quot;invite&amp;quot; other players to join you in your city (quite annoying when you are heading to your final destination).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
