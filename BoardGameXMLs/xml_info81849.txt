			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;25 Tons of Flying Mass Destruction&lt;br/&gt;Experience the A-10 Thunderbolt II&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In A-10 Tank Killer you take command of the ugliest, most indestructable and devastating plane ever built, the A-10 Thunderbolt II, affectionately known as &amp;quot;the Warthog.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly low and dirty through smoke-filled battlefields, ripping apart enemy tanks with your 30mm &amp;quot;tank killing&amp;quot; cannon. The battle comes up fast and furious as you skim the ground to support friendly troops. Take hits that would cripple any other aircraft and laugh when a wing or engine gets blown off during battle. Intercept redio messages, get strategy tips from Jake, your co-pilot, and take your stomach on a 3-Dimensional roller-coaster ride it'll never forget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How much can you handle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Seven different missions, each one in tank-blowing solid-filled 3-D&lt;br/&gt;     One of the most complex character intelligence systems ever developed. In this game, the battle starts with or without you!&lt;br/&gt;     Incredible explosions! Big tanks make big boom.&lt;br/&gt;     Unique character interaction system. Radio messages, crew talk and animated briefing/debriefing with your CO all bring the reality and depth of game play to a new level. &lt;br/&gt;     Campaign continuity. In Campaign mode, the goals of each mission are connected. So... screw up early on and you're gonna pay for it later!&lt;br/&gt;     Easy-to-use control systems including on-line help in the form of your co-pilot, Jake.&lt;br/&gt;     10 camera viewpoints: 3 internal and 7 external including Victim and Engagement views that take you outside to watch the devastation from a distance.&lt;br/&gt;     VCR Interfac(TM). With the push of a button, at any time during play, you have complete control over World Detail Levels, Viewscreen Size and other game play references.&lt;br/&gt;     Full musical score adds a new dimension to simulation combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
