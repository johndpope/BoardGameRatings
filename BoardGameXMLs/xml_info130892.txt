			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Street-Level Adventure for BASH! Ultimate Edition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Destitution There is no Justice...  There is Only Vengeance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last night, Kirby Row was the scene of several grisly murders.  All of the victims were part of rival gangs.  URGENT, Megapolis' Super-Police believe that the culprit is the rogue vigilante called Vengeance.  His movements are mysterious, his motive unknown, and his methods are savage.  He is known for brutal crippling attacks on gangsters and dealers in the past in the slum called &amp;quot;Destitution Drive&amp;quot;.  But has he crossed the line to homicide?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vengeance is a hard man to find... Locals see him as a protector, criminals fear him.  Can the Heroes find him... or will Vengeance find them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The adventure itself, meant to be played over 1-3 issues of play.&lt;br/&gt;     The Secret Origin of Vengeance.&lt;br/&gt;     Background material on some of Megapolis' areas and organizations.&lt;br/&gt;     10 Characters for your roster, including six playable Heroes (The Defenders of Megapolis), Vengeance, and a few others (sorry, no spoilers here).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
