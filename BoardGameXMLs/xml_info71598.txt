			<description>&amp;quot;Super Punch-Out!! (スーパーパンチアウト!!?)  is a boxing  video game developed and published by Nintendo  for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES). It was released on February 28, 1994 in North America and again in the same region in 1996. It was released in Europe on January 26, 1995 for the same console, and in Japan in 1996 for the Nintendo Power flash RAM cartridge series and the Super Famicom. The game was later released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on March 20, 2009, in North America on March 30, 2009 and in Japan on July 7, 2009. It is the fourth game in the Punch-Out!! series, taking place after the Punch-Out!! game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Super Punch-Out!! the player controls Little Mac, as he fights his way to become the World Video Boxing Association champion. Players, fighting from a &amp;quot;behind the back&amp;quot; perspective, must knockout their opponent in three minutes to win. Players can launch jabs, hooks, and uppercuts against their opponents as well as block, dodge, and duck opponents' attacks. Nintendo Integrated Research and Development, led by Genyo Takeda, Minoru Arakawa and Makoto Wada, developed the game. It also featured voice acting by Charles Martinet.[not in citation given]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game received praise from reviewers for its cartoon-like style, its colorful, outlandish opponents, simple gameplay controls, and replay value. The game also featured colorful, detailed graphics, which included the usage of transparency that facilitates the game's &amp;quot;behind the back&amp;quot; perspective. Other reviewers had said that this game lacked the overall appeal, gameplay, or audience of its NES predecessor.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super_punch_out,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
