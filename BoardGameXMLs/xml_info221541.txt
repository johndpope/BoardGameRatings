			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; set expansion that is designed to primarily alter the turn order of the game.  Tired of going around in circles?!  This expansion features Premium Role cards that change the turn order.  How it works?  At the beginning of each round, players secretly choose a Premium Role card.  That will be the role they are using on their next turn.  Players then simultaneously reveal their role and the order is determined from Highest to Lowest ensuring that the game rounds are always different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the Premium Role cards, also included are two (2) expansion Scenarios:  Rise of the Monarch and Battle Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As per the original one (1) Player Game Sets, the Rise of the Monarch scenario is back!  This scenario brings back the days of early Renaissance and exploration of the Galaxy.  In this scenario, players race to be the first player to earn the right to be the Monarch Supreme of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newer addition to the expansion is the Battle Front scenario.  This scenario's goal is to accelerate and shorten the time spent playing the Spacewars scenario.  It can be played as a scenario itself OR as another expansion played together with any of the current multiplayer scenarios (Tradewars, Spacewars or Days of Glory).  In this scenario, players race to obtain &amp;quot;retrofits&amp;quot; for their starships which will give them bonus effects to alter the way space skirmishes are resolved.  There are a total of six (6) different &amp;quot;retrofits&amp;quot; available to each player.  Much like the Days of Glory scenario, the retrofits are unlocked as a player earns more credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also as one of the game's Stretch Goals, we've added a Co-op scenario called United Garrison in which up to four (4) players can combat a Derelict starship that is hell bent on destroying all the player's Homeworlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is comprised of 96 cards for 1 to 4 Players.  It can add from 15-30 minutes of additional game time to the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
