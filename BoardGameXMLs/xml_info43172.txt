			<description>The game, which follows a &amp;ldquo;roll and move&amp;rdquo; format, can be played by two-four players. Legal game: Lawyer Pravin Anand plays Anaryst with his family. Anand expects the board game to sell for around Rs500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are simple. Players start by choosing one industry, represented by a pictographic card, out of four options&amp;mdash;automobile, pharmaceutical, food and beverages, and information technology&amp;mdash;depicted by a car, a drug, a drink and a computer system. Each product has a portfolio of 15 unique intellectual properties associated with it marked on the cards. For instance, in the auto industry there are 15 properties associated with a car such as a patent in the &amp;ldquo;improved axle&amp;rdquo;, copyright in the light controlling software and trademark in the brand name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is given 5,000 Anas, the currency of the game and acronym for Anand and Anand. The goal is to complete acquiring all the 15 intellectual properties of the chosen industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tresspassers on other players&amp;rsquo; squares, that represent factories, have to pay a fine or go to court and pay damages or go to jail. Players can also acquire IP of other players&amp;rsquo; industries, become &amp;ldquo;trolls&amp;rdquo; and trade them later. The goal is to complete the industry portfolio without going bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
