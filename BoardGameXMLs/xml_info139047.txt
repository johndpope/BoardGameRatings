			<description>&amp;quot;Two sitting down round games for everyone&amp;quot; as the box says. But I have a mint box and contents, all the cards are still joined at the perforations, but the rules only relate to Musi-Winks. So Musi-Matics will not be described here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MUSI-WINKS&lt;br/&gt;A Round Game for Everyone&lt;br/&gt;In each packet are,&lt;br/&gt;TEN HAPPY SAM FACES, TEN MOURNFUL MICK FACES and THREE WINKER WILLY left and right EYES. They are perforated so as to be torn into a total of 86 small cards.&lt;br/&gt;As the name implies the game is best played to music and a piano, gramophone or other music should be available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTRUCTIONS TO THE M.C.&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the 86 small cards and put the pack into an elastic band. Ask the players to sit or stand in a circle and when the music starts the pack is passed round. At intervals the music is stopped and on each occasion 3 (more or less according to the time available) players commencing with the one holding the pack take the top card. When the music recommences the pack is passed on by the last player to draw a card and play continues until all the cards are used up. Twelve players would each have on the average about 7 cards.&lt;br/&gt;Each player then proceeds to make up complete faces, observing the following rules:&lt;br/&gt;1. A Winker Willy Eye (left or right, but only the appropriate one) can be used to make a complete face with Happy Sam and Mournful Mick Cards, mixed if necessary although it is advantageous not to do so.&lt;br/&gt;2. If a Winker Willy. Eye is not used then Happy Sam faces must be made up entirely of Happy Sam Cards; likewise for Mournful Mick faces.&lt;br/&gt;3. Any player holding a Winker Willy Eye may exchange it with any other player for three other cards.&lt;br/&gt;4. Only ONE Winker Willy Eye can be used in making up a face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCORING&amp;mdash;&lt;br/&gt;Complete Faces&amp;mdash;&lt;br/&gt;A face made up of 1 WINKER WILLY EYE and 3 HAPPY SAM CARDS or 3 MOURNFUL MICK CARDS ... 10 points&lt;br/&gt;A face made up of 1 WINKER WILLY EYE and mixed HAPPY SAM and MOURNFUL MICK CARDS ... ... 8 points&lt;br/&gt;A complete HAPPY SAM FACE ... . 5 points&lt;br/&gt;A complete MOURNFUL MICK FACE . 5 points&lt;br/&gt;Features&amp;mdash;&lt;br/&gt;Odd cards are valued as follows&amp;mdash;&lt;br/&gt;A complete MOUTH made up of HAPPY SAM OR MOURNFUL MICK CARDS or both .... 2 points&lt;br/&gt;AN EYE ... 1 point&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player scoring the highest number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
