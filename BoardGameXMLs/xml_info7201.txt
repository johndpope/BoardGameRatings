			<description>This game of ship to ship combat takes place on a mapsheet depicting the surface of a large space station dotted with gun towers. There is a trench down the middle of the map with a target at the end. The good-guys are called the Rebels. Their ships are Red Leader, accompanied by Red Two through Red Eleven, and Gold Leader, accompanied by Gold Two through Gold Five. There's also a Pirate Freighter. The bad-guys are called the Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you haven't gotten the picture yet, the cover art is a drawing of an X-Wing shooting at a Tie Fighter, straight out of Star Wars. This independently produced (and unauthorized?) game depicts the climactic attack on the Death Star . . . I mean, on the &amp;quot;Imperial space station&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of the Star Wars Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
