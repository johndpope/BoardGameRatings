			<description>2 players (or 2 teams of 2) turn up a card with a word on, and the first to announce a synonym for the word takes the card, and then a new card is turned over.  This continues for 3 minutes, using a sand timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the &amp;quot;brain freeze&amp;quot; round begins, where a single card is turned up.  The first player to name a synonym for the word gives the brain freeze card to the opponent.  That player then has to try and name another, different synonym for the same word, and if so, passes the brain freeze card back.  This continues until the current holder of the brain freeze card is unable to name a synonym.  The last player to name a synonym then takes the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then the whole process is repeated with players having to name antonyms instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then have 1 point per card, with a penalty of -10 points for the holder of the brain freeze card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructions are also included for classroom play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
