			<description>&amp;ldquo;The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) began when the King of Spain died without an heir. King Louis XIV of France and Emperor Leopold I of Austrian both claimed the throne, and Spain's territory. England and the Netherlands sided with Austria, while Bavaria joined the French.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;At the start of the war the French army had a reputation as the best in Europe. At the battle of Ramillies (1706) the Duke of Marlborough soundly defeated the French. The French defeat had the effect of driving the French out of the Spanish Netherlands (which included Flanders).&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order of battle for each army (Confederate and French) is broken down according to the position of the units on the battlefield: the left wing, right wing, or center. Each wing has one or more commanders, and each army has an overall commander. A number of terrain features must be marked on the game table &amp;ndash; namely four fortified towns and a stream which extends into the battlefield between the two armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
