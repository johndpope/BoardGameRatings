			<description>DecaDeck is a 54 card deck that can be used to play variations of traditional card games as well as new, unique games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck contains 45 cards with 10 suits. Each suit has 9 cards numbered from 1 to 9. Each of these 45 cards has a unique pair of the 10 suits. There are also 9 special cards with no suit that can be used for a variety of different game functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This combination of suits and numbers allows for some unique variants of traditional card games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance:&lt;br/&gt;In a poker game, the chances of a pair are higher than with a traditional deck since there are 6 copies of each number, but the chances of a flush are lower with only 9 cards in each suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a trick taking game, the lead card could have 2 suits that could be followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a rummy game, each suited card could fit into a number meld or 2 different suit melds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
