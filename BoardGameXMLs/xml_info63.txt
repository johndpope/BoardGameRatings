The rules manual contains historical background and designer's notes that offer the player the full flavor and authenticity of what medieval conflict was all about in the age of the &amp;quot;Shogun&amp;quot; struggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(BGG description:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samurai is a game about warfare and politics in feudal Japan.
