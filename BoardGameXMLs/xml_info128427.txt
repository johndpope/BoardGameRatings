			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the year 2013. Tears in the space time continuum have been ripping open across the world as Morgan Le Fey has made a bid at world domination. Terminators, Dark Wizards, Alexander and his Greats, and Lawyers have been pouring through to answer her call, flooding the streets with her evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the Great Merlini has the wherewithal to stand against her.  Once simply a mediocre stage magician, he has recently come into his own as the last living descendant of Merlin himself.  From his ancestor&amp;rsquo;s ancient text, the Bionomipro, the newly-awakened wizard has started summoning troops of his own: Quick-to-action (but not to thinking) barbarians from days of yore, erstwhile plumbers hoping to fight the good fight (and eat cannoli), and space janitors from the distant future, wielding only their quick wits and laser mops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has the Great Merlini come to the table too late, or can his group of warriors save the world from a fate worse than boredom? The future is limitless, the options infinite, and the fate of the world is dependent upon you, brave Time Heroes&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
