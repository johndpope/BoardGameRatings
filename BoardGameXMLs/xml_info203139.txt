			<description>Dinomania is a strategic card game, which gets more and more intense with each card you play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If playing 2-3 players, start with 7 cards, and if playing 4-6 players you start with 6 cards. The goal is to get rid of all your cards as fast as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has discarded all cards, the remaining players count the points in their hand. When a player reaches the maximum score (recommended max score: 73), the player with the lowest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the youngest start, or choose yourself (perhaps the one who needs the most help?) If you can&amp;rsquo;t, or don&amp;rsquo;t want to, play a card, you have to draw a card from the deck, and let the turn pass over to the next player. Beware of the T-rex! When the deck has no more cards, simply shuffle all the played cards and keep on going!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the draw-deck is completely out of cards, no more cards are drawn! The T-rex card is worth 36 points! That can only happen with event cards, or by sabotaging a rival with for example the card &amp;ldquo;Give away 2 cards from your hand to another player&amp;rdquo;, or hope that someone else will draw the T-rex from your hand when they are playing the card &amp;ldquo;draw a card from another player&amp;rdquo;, and try to keep a poker face!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you only have three cards left on your hand you have to scream out &amp;rdquo;Dinomania&amp;rdquo;, your greatest Dino-roar, or just any sound to indicate your amount of cards. If you don&amp;rsquo;t - you get 10 points even if you win that gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
