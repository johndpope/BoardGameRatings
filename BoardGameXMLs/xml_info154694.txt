			<description>ISS Pro Evolution 2 (known as World Soccer Jikkyou Winning Eleven 2000: U-23 Medal Heno Chousen in Japan) is the fourth video game in the ISS Pro series and the second installment of the ISS Pro Evolution series, developed exclusively for the PlayStation by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, a division of Konami.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the first ISS Pro game with proper licenses, although partial, some players having real names &amp;mdash; e.g. Beckham instead of Bekham (ISS Pro Evolution). The game has an extended Master League, with 2 divisions and eight more clubs, resulting in a total of twenty four club teams, such as Leeds United and Boca Juniors. More international teams have been added as well. Next to these additions, the gameplay has changed, as it is smoother and more realistic. The Japanese version of the game contains Under-23 National Teams as well, such as Australia's Under-23 National Football Team, which are not present in the overseas versions of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ISS Pro Evolution 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
