			<description>&amp;quot;All my Diamonds&amp;quot; was published in A Gamut of Games, words from Sid Sackson:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;All my Diamonds&amp;quot; is a game I conceive as a change of pace from Poker. Although there is no similarity in the play, it satisfies the same urge for speculation. It is, basically an auction game where players must decide whether they can earn more by buying or by selling&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All my Diamonds is played with a regular deck of cards with the &amp;quot;10&amp;quot; out, making 48 cards. Cards are divided in sets, with each card belonging a &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; set and also to a &amp;quot;suit&amp;quot; set, each set has 12 cards and players must set collections of 10 cards in any set to win a hand. Players exchange cards by auctioning all cards in a set in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with most points win in the end, this can be achieved by completing the sets, that once completed are exchanged for points, or by selling his cards on the auction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
