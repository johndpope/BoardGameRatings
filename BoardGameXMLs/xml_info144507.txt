			<description>Warrior is About to Die! is a simple convention style dungeon crawl game that supports 4 players plus a game master at a time.  Though players can drop in and out of the game constantly.  It is designed to replicate the arcade classic Gauntlet in a way that is fast and easy.  &lt;br/&gt;This game functions as a sort of toolkit allowing the game master to set the game up in a way they choose, the rulebook and character sheets are a free download here and you can use whatever miniatures and terrain you choose to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
