			<description>An idea of doing a horse race around Stonehenge came to my mind. This then lead into the concept of BETTING on the race. From here, the basic rules flowed. Then, it occurred to me that Mike Selinker already did a race game around Stonehenge, so I felt it appropriate to connect this game to his chariot racing game. Due to the odd play nature of the betting, it is a natural that it would be alien in nature. The name is Mike Selinker's name spelled backwards, in honor of his Chariot racing game. Spelling it backwards also gives it an alien sounding name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 2&amp;ndash;5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: To score the LEAST amount of points. This represents the player, as an alien bidder, being able to best predict the future.&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: Deck of 60 cards without the five trilithon cards.&lt;br/&gt;Five trilithon cards in a separate pile&lt;br/&gt;Ten disks of each color (50 total)&lt;br/&gt;Five figures (neutral is not used). These figures represent chariot drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the least amount of points shows themselves the best predictor of the worst racer, and wins the game. If players are tied, the player who has the most disks amongst all the tied players wins. If still a tie, then the player with the least amount of first place disks wins. If still a tie, the player with the least amount of second place disks wins. If still a tie, then least in third, fourth or fifth. If still a tie, player closest to the starting player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more conventional wagering, use the variant where the object is to score the MOST points, not LEAST.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
