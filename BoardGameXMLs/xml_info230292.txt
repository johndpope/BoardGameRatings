			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Year is 2090. The Tendril Access Processor&amp;mdash;or TAP&amp;mdash;connects humanity to the Global DataNet, allowing interaction with Hyper Reality and all the Global DataNet has to offer, for better or worse. Malware, viruses, and hackers are as much of a threat as they ever were, and now your personal computer is woven into your cerebrum. The human genome is an open book to science, one that can be rewritten to order if you can afford it. If transgenics aren't to your liking, then chrome yourself with the latest cyberware and let technology improve upon the original model. The geopolitical landscape has been fractured and reformed by revolutions, nuclear exchanges, and economic collapse engineered by a rogue AI. This world is filled with new, wondrous people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bioroids are on their second (or third, perhaps fourth) body, their dubbed consciousness uploaded into new flesh fresh from the vat. Cyborgs have done away with the flesh, and are more machine than human. Then there are hybrids, whose genes are enhanced with animal DNA. Choose from these or four other featured races. Then pick a class and be the most desired freelancer in the sprawl. Cybermonks combine martial training with cybernetic augmentation, pushing their chrome beyond the limits. Gunners bring the muscle as bounty hunters, mercenaries, or sector cops. Hackers are masters of manipulating computers and data, even the ones in people's heads. The medic keeps the team patched up and provides stims to boost performance. Pick from these or five other featured classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equip your character with a variety of modern arms, armor, high tech gear, and cybernetic upgrades. The book features modern vehicles, drones, and robots. New and modified combat rules, skills, feats and drawbacks, and character traits facilitate play. The world chapter details the history and current state of the planet, providing a rich selection of areas for play. The threats section offers twenty technological and biological horrors, as well as a gallery of dozens of NPCs for the GM to use to challenge the players and flesh out the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interface Zero: providing comprehensive rules and an evolved setting for full metal cyberpunk adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
