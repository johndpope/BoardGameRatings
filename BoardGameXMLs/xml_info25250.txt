							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Air Attack</name>
									
			<description>Designed by Steve Alexander and published by Millennium Games, AIR ATTACK! is a game &amp;ldquo;where you are the squadron commander of a tactical fighter squadron. Your mission - to bomb your opponent&amp;rsquo;s military targets while protecting your own. Other forces include surface-to-air missiles and an electronic warfare bomber at your disposal.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;This game contains rules for Basic Game and Advanced Version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIR ATTACK! comes in a 8.25&amp;quot;x11.5&amp;quot;x1&amp;quot; game box with one 4-color 16&amp;quot;x21.5&amp;quot; map sheet; one counter sheet with 40 single sided die cut cardboard counters; a 16 page rulebook; and two six-sided dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played by two to four players, has moderate solitaire capability, low complexity, and playing time for a game is &amp;ldquo;coffee break&amp;rdquo; short for the Basic Game, but Advanced game will run longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very simple game, with fairly nice production quality. It has some chrome elements that may contribute to repeat plays. It would serve as a fairly quick and easy introduction to air wargaming for kids and adults new to wargaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
