							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Free the Flame God</name>
									
			<description>from the adventure introduction:&lt;br/&gt;A volcano controlled by a renegade Imperial sorcerer?&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, this must be stopped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The residents of Tuloanga need help! Their volcano god, He-Who-Lives-Beneath, is a prisoner of a powerful renegade Imperial sorcerer named Chow Siu-Wai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tuloanga lies far from any trading routes, but the great volcano there is visible far off, and has long been the source of occasional ash clouds and firey explosions. Recently, however, the clouds and eruptions have become near-constant. Even far from Tuloanga, the fury of the volcano is interfering in daily life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rain falls thick with mud and evil-smelling gases. The island shakes and great waves come thundering into neighboring shores &amp;ndash; or even distant shores, washing away villages and seaside towns. Other volcanoes are beginning to grow restless as well &amp;ndash; as if other flame gods resent this interference with their brethren.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever this sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s plans may be, he cannot be allowed to control this massive volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
