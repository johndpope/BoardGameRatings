			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;You are Gwynne, and you are training to be initiated into the ancient arts of a Druid priestess. But you must test your skills sooner than you expected when the monstrous forces of the evil Lytir threaten your peaceful kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is Neil, a handsome, enigmatic bard whose lilting melodies on the lute have the power to enchant. So, too, do his emerald eyes, as you learn as you begin to question whose cause he actually serves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your fantasy adventure lead you to your first romance, or will the decisions you make carry you into realms in which there is no future? In a HEARTQUEST book, you, the reader, are challenged to PICK A PATH TO ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
