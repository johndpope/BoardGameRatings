							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ambush Alley: Art of War</name>
									
			<description>Return to the fictional city of Dawala and the neighboring town of Fadiz, a hot-bed of criminal as well as insurgent activity! Join 2nd Platoon in a mission to thwart the plans of a criminal cartel to plunder a nation&amp;rsquo;s cultural treasures and use the proceeds to fund insurgent operations!&lt;br/&gt;Gangsters, insurgents, and a statue of a winged lion-man with five legs! What more could you ask for from a mission?&lt;br/&gt;Art of War is an Ambush Alley mini-campaign pack. It contains three interlocking scenarios that can be played separately or as part of a narrative campaign in which the outcome of each scenario affects those that follow it.&lt;br/&gt;Art of War returns to Dawala, a fictional city introduced in The Three Block War, and the stalwart men of Lt. Meuse&amp;rsquo;s 2nd Platoon.&lt;br/&gt;Dawala might be a trouble spot anywhere in Iraq, Afghanistan or, with a little tweaking, nearly any other trouble-spot in the world. Likewise, the details of &amp;ldquo;2nd Platoon&amp;rdquo; have been left purposefully vague &amp;ndash; it might be a platoon of US Rangers, British Marines, or soldiers of any of the many nations currently involved in hot, distant places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ambush Alley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
