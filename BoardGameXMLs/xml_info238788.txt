			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harvesters of Ymandragore have always taken those they wish, and few can stand in their way. Now, someone has been taken and a foolhardy rescue is being mounted. Are you able to go through hell on Onara and back again to rescue a friend? Are you willing to sacrifice life, limb, sanity, and soul to free a friend? How far do the bonds of friendship go? What if the person to be rescued is but the friend of a friend? What if the person to be rescued is but a stranger, does courage go so far?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This adventure may be of particular interest to members of the Hawk and Shield, the Order of the White Veil, and any other character who is very strongly opposed to the predations of the Sorcerer-King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This LIVING ARCANIS STANDARD adventure is designed for 6th to 16th level characters (APL 7 through 15).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
