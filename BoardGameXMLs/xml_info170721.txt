							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Perth-class Frigate</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gypsy Knights Games is proud to present the seventh entry in our line of products dedicated to the starships of Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Perth-class Frigate is a 1000 ton vessel operated by the Republic of Australia Navy starting in 2283.  Built to be an escort, the ship is designed to provide point defense and fire support to the larger ships of the RAN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time of the Conduit Collapse in 2331, twelve Perth-class Frigates had been built.  Three of these twelve were caught on the Clement Sector side of the Conduit.  These vessels are now part of the New Perth Defence Force, an Australian colony located in the Peel Subsector of Ariel Sector (coreward of Clement Sector).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Perth-class ship is ideal for use in a naval campaign where the characters are called upon for multiple roles.  The Perth can also provide a worthy adversary for pirate and smuggler characters as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships of Clement Sector 7: Perth-class Frigate comes complete with beautiful views of the ship.  The Perth-class is presented with full deckplans and statistics to make your use of our product simple, easy and fun. In addition, the Perth comes with a set of adventure hooks to get your characters right into the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though designed specifically with our Clement Sector setting in mind, the Perth-class could easily be used in any Traveller setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get on board!  Adventure awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
