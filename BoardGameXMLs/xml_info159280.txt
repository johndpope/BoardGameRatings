			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The humanoids of the north are preparing to attack! Reports of large gatherings of evil creatures are coming in near the Holdfist Mountains. With more and more verified reports coming in something needs to be done quickly. With your fame firmly intact the people have asked your group to once again save the day....are you ready for your next challenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ya know....wasn't there an old castle around here somewhere?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was designed for use in the Filbar North campaign based on Ad&amp;amp;d 1st/2nd edition but is easily adaptable to any version of RPG in any campaign. This adventure is best used for PCs of 4th - 6th levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
