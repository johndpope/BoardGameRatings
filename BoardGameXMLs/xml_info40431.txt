			<description>Every player starts with one dishes pawn and three scoring pawns (respectively one for pears, green and red apples).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows 36 dishes with apples and pears. At the borders are scoring tracks for red and green apples coming - from the left side of the board - and for pears - coming from the right side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On ones turn all players play one subsurfaced card. The highest card goes to the start player, the second highest to his left neighbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now all players play the cards in front of them in sequence. First a player moves his dishes pawn according to his card. After this he can move one of his three scoring pawns in order to get more points for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play ends when one player moves his pear scoring pawn on the same field of one of his apple pawns. The players now count all points for their three scoring pawns together. The player with the highest number of points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;Auml;pfel und Birnen is Number 74 of Edition Spielbox published in issue 2/2006.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
