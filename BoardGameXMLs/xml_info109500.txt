			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Got a Pathfinder game to run this weekend but are too busy to get something together for your players? Looking for a way to challenge your power gamers? If so, then you're ready for a One Night Stand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all One Night Stand adventures, The Ice Cave of the Frost Giant Slavers contains everything you&amp;rsquo;ll need for an evening of fun using the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It is designed for characters between 8th and 11th levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure: The following pages detail the background and action that will constitute the adventure itself. We've provided all of the NPC details needed in a new stat block format that makes it easy to print and use at the table. Let us know what you think by emailing hyrum@supergeniusgames.com with your comments.&lt;br/&gt;    Map Tiles: Following the adventure write-up are 16 map tiles that, when cut out and assembled, create a battlemat with a one-inch square grid. There are also alternative tiles to use in order to keep the secret parts of the map hidden until the heroes make the appropriate discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;    Tactical Maps: After the map tiles are a series of tactical maps and notes to make running the adventure easier for the Game Master. Also, we include stat block cards that can be printed out and used at the table, speeding up play by having all game-related information at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;    Standees: With the tactical maps are a collection of cut-and-tape standees representing all the creatures and monsters encountered in this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
