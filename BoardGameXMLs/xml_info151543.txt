			<description>The goal of this football game is to score Goals (what else?). Who scores the most in an ageed upon time is the winner. There are 11 playing pieces for each Player, one ball and no dice. The different playing pieces move in different ways. Each player can move 1 playing piece and the ball (if the playing piece can reach it) per turn. If the ball reaches another playing piece of the same team, it can be shot again. If not, the other player gets his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
