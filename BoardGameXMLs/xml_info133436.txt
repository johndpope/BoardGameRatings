			<description>From the document:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Shot is a game of murder and vengeance. What if you were given a chance to right a grievous wrong? What if you could take all of the anger, all of the sadness, all of the hate, and funnel them in a single moment of retribution? Would you take that chance? Moreover, what would you sacrifice to get your revenge?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Shot is a game that asks you to explore these questions. Two players work together to tell a story of vengeance, exploring the dark corners of the human soul. What does revenge look like, and what is it going to demand from you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
