			<description>Starzone is a print-and-play game for 2 players set in outer space. Each player battles with a fleet of spacecraft by flicking coins into the Starzone target. The Starzone target is made up of different zones, and asteroids which litter space.  Which zone you hit determines which action you take: you can repair your spacecraft, activate your shields, add or destroy asteroids on the target, or damage your opponent's spacecraft. A special Zone Shift zone on the target allows you to change which actions can be activated by hitting each zone, adding a tactical element to the game. Your spacecraft has different sectors, and the health of each sector is given by hit points. When one sector is destroyed then your spacecraft is destroyed. The first player to destroy three of their enemy's fleet wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starzone is a fun and furious game of dexterity and strategy. Outwit your opponent using asteroids and zone-shifts. Find your enemy's weak spot and flick it into outer space!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
