			<description>Flowering Snail is a refreshing abstract game that challenges players to plan ahead over the two stages of the game! Players compete against each other by increasing their snail population. You need to place your snail cards and flower cards wisely to claim the delicious flowers (for the snails, of course), and maintain your snail population to score the most points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two phases: Multiplication and Die Out phases. In the Multiplication phase, players alternates to place their Snail cards (with values 1 to 3) onto the game board adjacent to other snails already there. As an additional action, they may also place one Flower card onto the game board. After all Snail and Flower cards are placed, players check who controls each Flower cards by adding the values on their Snail cards. The higher sum may take the adjacent Flower card as scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Die Out phase, players alternate to remove Snails cards from the game board if the chosen Snail card has a lower value than all the other adjacent Snail cards, until no more Snail cards can be removed. Each remaining Snail card scores the printed value for its owner, and each Flower cards worths 2 VP. The player with higher VP wins the games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
