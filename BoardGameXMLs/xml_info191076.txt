			<description>DONK! - the Samurai Duck, the computer game, was created by THE HIDDEN and released in 1993 on the Amiga / Amiga CD32 games console.  In this 20th anniversary commemorative card game, Donk has to tackle 7 Zones in his arch enemy Eider Down's world (Con-Struct, Electro Moss, Hab, Hanic, Plasma, Rock, and Subaqua), seeking the Gems that unlock the Zones, destroy Eider Down's Fortress, and defeat Eider Down himself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Zone is represented by a separate deck of cards.  To complete a Zone, Donk must work his way through the deck, turning over cards which could be Enemies to defeat (by spending Spin Power or using Power Ups), Hazards to avoid (by using Power Ups), various Devices such as the Map (to reveal the next few cards and jump ahead), Teleport (to jump to another Zone), Blocks and Switches that can hinder or help progress.  Ultimately, Donk needs to find the Gem card within the Zone deck that unlocks the Zone, and then get to the Exit card to complete the Zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a Zone is completed, Donk will get a chance to attack the Fortress / Eider Down by spending what Spin Power they have left if it is enough. If all Zones are completed, and Donk has enough Spin Power left, they could get the chance to defeat Eider Down in the Final Battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donk! can be played in 1 player mode, as a solitaire card game, or in 2 player mode where Donk and his fighting partner Judo Juggs team up (sharing Power Ups) / or go head to head to complete Zones and defeat Eider Down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
