			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, a monster repeatedly menaces a city! Through improv and  physicality, players will tell the story of this very stompy catastrophe. To get in the mood, I strongly recommend listening to &amp;ldquo;Godzilla&amp;rdquo; by Blue Oyster Cult. Maybe while stomping around? You decide. Then, please come up with names for your city and names for your monster and write them in the margins! Make sure to use these names as you play, to get a sense of place. Think about important landmarks as well... what would look good being crushed by a giant monster?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
