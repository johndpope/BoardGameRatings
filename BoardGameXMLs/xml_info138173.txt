							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">AirFrame</name>
									
			<description>A standalone miniatures wargame of future air superiority from One Pound Wargames, AirFrame allows players to assemble and customize their formation using existing air combat models from their collection.  The game focuses on tactical manoeuvre and resource management in the 3-dimensional battlespace.  AirFrame can also be combined with MechaWar for combined arms battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each airframe comes with a variable number of stat points depending upon their value.  These are allocated by the player across four stats covering speed, firepower, armour and defence.  Each airframe performs two manoeuvres a turn, with enemy airframes able to react with responsive manoeuvres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage will degrades your ability to stay in the air, but a critical hit may blow your opponent out of the sky in a single, devastating strike!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Miniatures wargame of future aerial combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Integrated turn sequence.&lt;br/&gt;     Action-based turns.&lt;br/&gt;     d12s for shooting.&lt;br/&gt;     Customizable statlines.&lt;br/&gt;     Fully compatible with MechaWar from One Pound Wargames.&lt;br/&gt;     Designed for use with any range of modern or science fiction aircraft, and compatible with scales from 1/805 (2mm) to 1/161 (10mm)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
