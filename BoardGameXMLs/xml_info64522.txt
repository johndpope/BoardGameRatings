			<description>6 blue, red and yellow balls are supplied. The game has a big spinning wheel in the center. Each of the four corners, outside the circle, is called a Bank and each Bank contains five holes in which the balls won in play are placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player selects a corner Bank. The balls are placed in the corresponding color holes inside the game center. The first player spins the arrow and the others follow in turn clockwise. Each turn consists of 1 spin. If a colored ball is pointed at, and their is room, it is moved to the players Bank. The winner is the first player to win balls in this order 1=red, 2=blue, 3=yellow, 4=red or blue, 5=red or blue (whichever was not won in the 4th position.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game also plays another version called Merry-Go-Round. This game plays the same, but does not require the balls to be won in any specific sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
