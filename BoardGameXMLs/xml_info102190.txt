							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ultima: Escape from Mt. Drash</name>
									
			<description>In the game, creatures called &amp;quot;garrintrots&amp;quot; have imprisoned the player in Mt. Drash, and the player's task is to escape the dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game itself is a very simple series of three-dimensional randomly generated dungeons, and the idea is to destroy all monsters that stand in way and exit to the next level. There is a time limit as well. The game doesn't employ custom graphics, but rather uses the VIC-20's standard set of graphical characters to draw the game scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was also notable for its soundtrack; using the 3-voice sound chip in the VIC-20 to provide background music. Very few games written for the VIC-20 featured such a background soundtrack that would become commonplace in games for the Commodore 64, Nintendo NES, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, the game has been extremely sought after by collectors. First copies of the game were discovered and announced in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima&lt;/a&gt;:_Escape_from_Mt._Drash,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
