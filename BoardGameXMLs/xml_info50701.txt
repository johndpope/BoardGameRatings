			<description>Dual system sourcebook for Legend of the Five Rings and Oriental Adventures examining the Scorpion Clan in Rokugan. Something of a sequel to the Way of the Scorpion, it brings the description up to date with the metaplot timeline of L5R 2e. While these volumes contain player options and information, they're primarily a GM resource as spoiler information and secrets are interspersed throughout the text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Secrets?
