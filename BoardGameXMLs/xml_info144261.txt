			<description>In ancient times long gone by, when the veil between the world of the humans and the realm of magic was thinner, almighty wizards battled each other in epic duels to determine who was the master of sorcery and arcane wisdom. Armed with a Spellbook and with the aid of the enchanted Element-Stones, the sorcerers summoned fantastic Creatures and magical Spells. A wizard who had no more pages left in his Spellbook would eventually have lost the magical battle of wits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent's card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he puts the top card of his or her deck on his Discard Pile (or Archive). If a player is unable to draw a card, he loses immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elemental Clash: Legendary Legacy will be the first of hopefully many Expansion to Elemental Clash: The Master Set, featuring state-of-the-art illustrations done by professional artists (as opposed to the pre-Master Set versions of the game). This exciting new expansion will contain over 90 different Creatures, Spells and Element Stones as well as 10 brand-new, powerful Spellcaster cards and introduce Neutral cards (cards that belong to no particular Element) and a new sub-type of Spells: Equip-Spells as well as the Familiar Spirit Creature Subtype among other things. Furthermore, the set will feature lots of powerful &amp;quot;Unique&amp;quot; cards, Dragon Lords and might Kings and Queens, making it literally a &amp;quot;royal&amp;quot; expansion to Elemental Clash: The Master Set!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion will not contain Basic Element Stones which are included in the base game and needed to build decks and play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
