			<description>In this game children try to place their raindrops, consisting of three parts, on the board. The die decides which action a player has to take. The first player to have no raindrop pieces left wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player gets three wooden raindrop pieces - one small disk and two rings. The larger ring fits around the smaller one, which in turn fits around the small disk. Players take turns rolling the die. The die determines whether the player is allowed to put a piece of his/her raindrop on the board (rain symbol), loses a turn (cloud symbol), has to take back a drop (sun symbol) or is allowed to place the rainbow, thus locking a field on the board. The game ends when one player has placed all his/her raindrop parts on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
