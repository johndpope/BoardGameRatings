			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sixteen corpses, blood everywhere, and I still got a couple bullets left. Fuck yes. Let's go. If we get a move on, I bet we could kill something else before the sun comes up.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demons tend to get fluids all over the place when you exorcise them from the bodies of their victims. And that&amp;rsquo;s a hassle. But your job is always the same: find the victim of possession, perform the ritual, and kill whatever slithers out of the victim's orifices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not long ago, you were an ordinary person. You were on your way down, circling the drain, sliding into oblivion. You were out on bail, or staring at that bottle of pills, or running out of money and luck. But then you got recruited. Now you're a Disciple, a weapons-grade exorcist on the front lines of a very strange war. Using black magic and sawed-off shotguns, you wage war against demons. These supernatural predators lurk in old barns, in lightless sewers, in the mansions of CEOs, in the souls of serial killers, in the shadows of nuns. Your job is to find them and kill them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your crew have just picked up a new job. A demon has taken control of someone; could be an innocent, could be a total reprobrate. Either way, you&amp;rsquo;ll do whatever you have to in order to finish the job. Maybe you can save the victim. But that&amp;rsquo;s not really a priority. Players will assume the roles of Disciples, victims of demonic possession, demons, cops, ghosts, corpses, terrorists, cannibals, sociopaths, and/or pregnant people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandemoniacsis a total ripoff of my own game, Pandemonio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
