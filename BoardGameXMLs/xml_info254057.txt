			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I got a questing crew and their pay is due &lt;br/&gt;Scoundrels out there wanna run me through &lt;br/&gt;My critics claim that it's all about gold &lt;br/&gt;I'm a dungeoneer; my school is old &lt;br/&gt;If you grew up like me, raised playin' the game &lt;br/&gt;You'd know there's more to it than loot and fame &lt;br/&gt;I slay monsters, fool, I ain't dumb &lt;br/&gt;I got ninety nine problems but a quest ain't one &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        - Jahay Zedwick, Spoken Word Bard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This packet used to be called 100 Problems, but it appears someone took care of the irate hellhound matron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;99 Problems is a collection of notice board messages found in villages, towns, and hamlets across the realms, each one written by a person in need of assistance with a peculiar situation. It's an amalgamation of side quests, adventure seeds, and fun one-shots provided to keep things at the table moving &amp;ndash; or maybe even throw your players a little off track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
