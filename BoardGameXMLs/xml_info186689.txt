			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neo-Combat is a card game using print-and-play materials.  Players hold &amp;quot;Varan&amp;quot; cards, which represent a combatant reptilian humanoid controlled by the player.  Players also draw, hold, and play &amp;quot;Action&amp;quot; cards that drive the game.  Varan cards are always played on the table but begin play in the &amp;quot;Cloaked&amp;quot; (face down) position.  Varans remain &amp;quot;Cloaked&amp;quot; until play dictates otherwise, when they are turned face up and thus become much more vulnerable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing surface is divided into Sectors which join in a central &amp;quot;Battlefield&amp;quot; Sector.  Play involves moving Varan cards between Sectors and playing Action cards to evolve maneuvers.  The goal of the game is to eliminate all of the other players' Varan cards.  Played Action cards and defeated Varan cards go into Discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
