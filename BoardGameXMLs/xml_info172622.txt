							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raging Thunder</name>
									
			<description>Not a realistic racing simulator, Raging Thunder is a game based on tried and true arcade values. Speed, accessibility and fun, in other words, trump the limitations imposed by so called &amp;lsquo;real world physics&amp;rsquo;. In the world of Raging Thunder there are no such things as &amp;lsquo;too narrow turns&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;impossible overtakes&amp;rsquo; (and luckily, definitely no such things as &amp;lsquo;traffic control officers&amp;rsquo;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary strengths of Raging Thunder, and the aspects we ourselves are most proud of, is its immersive gameplay mechanics, its responsive, precise controls and its rich, beautiful graphics. It is a game for everyone to &amp;lsquo;pick up and play&amp;rsquo;, for ten minutes or for two hours, but one that evolves as players progress. We want Raging Thunder to create an itch in players that only &amp;lsquo;finishing that next race&amp;rsquo; can scratch. Increasing difficulty, unlockable features and a dynamic game world offers replayability and guarantees that the game stays fresh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
