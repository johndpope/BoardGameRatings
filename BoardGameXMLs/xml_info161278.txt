			<description>Spiritual Warfare is everything you want in a game! It is strategic, engaging, innovative and offers players the chance to use a different strategy EVERY TIME they play. Acquire Spirit Points to win! Defend yourself with the help of Angels! Demolish your opponents with twelve different Demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game with an equal number of Character Cards, 4 Orb Cards, 1 Angel and 1 Demon. The board is set with 5 Orb Cards to draw from, and the rest of the Orb Cards are placed to the left of the pool. There are Black, Red, Blue White, Green and WILD Orb Cards. Black &amp;amp; Red Orbs can be used to purchase Demons. Blue &amp;amp; White Orbs can be used to purchase Angels. Green Orbs are used to by Action Cards, and a combination of all 5 colors gets you a Gate Key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a players turn, they may choose to do one of the following actions: 1) pulling Orb Cards 2) spend Orb Cards 3) Attack a player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You obtain Spirit Points by: Purchasing Angels and Demons, going through Gates using Gate Keys and White Orbs, buying Action Cards (some of them are just Spirit Points), or Battling other players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a battle, the attacking player uses their Demon Cards and the defending player uses their Angel Cards. Each player starts with 10 hit points. Players take turns rolling dice to try and damage the other player. 5's and 6's are hits wile 1-4 miss. Angel and Demon Cards consist of either Battle Cards that last for the entire battle (i.e. Armored Angel - You cannot be hit by 5's) or Attack Cards that are played before a player rolls the dice (i.e. Fire Demon - On your next roll, 6'd hit for 2 damage). The first player to bring their opponent to zero Hit Points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the Character Cards in the game all give slight advantages and manipulate all of the mechanics listed above!&lt;br/&gt; Now...Bow your head, say your prayers, and prepare for Spiritual Warfare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
