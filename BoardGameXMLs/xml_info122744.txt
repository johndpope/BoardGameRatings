			<description>Toufruit, published in 1990, is the precursor of Halli Galli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards and the rules are identical but there is no bell in this game. Players try to shout &amp;quot;Toufruit&amp;quot; first instead of ringing the bell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player places one card face up in front of him from his face-down deck. And if there are total of five of one kind of fruit on the table the player who shouts &amp;quot;Toufruit&amp;quot; first gets all played cards. When you run out of cards, you're out.&lt;br/&gt;Game ends if there are 2 players left. Who has most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
