			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6-25, Low (1-3)&lt;br/&gt;26-41, Medium (4-8)&lt;br/&gt;42-46, High (9-12)&lt;br/&gt;47-51, Supreme (13-15)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Use This Resource&lt;br/&gt;The best way to use this book is to pre-read what we have included to see what will fit your needs. Some submissions have been edited for constancy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are divided by levels; Low (1-3), Medium (4-8), High (9-12) and Supreme (13-15). Any character with out an experience level is considered a low level. This offers a quick and dirty way to reference a large number of characters in a pinch. Since the Megaverse shares one game system characters are built on, these characters can easily be adapted for any setting from Palladium Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will notice some Characters have been left in groups such as the villagers even with a difference of levels to keep the context of improvements and maturation of these character groups.&lt;br/&gt;You will notice that the characters submitted are not all in level numerical order. This is a fan based project and not all submissions arrive on time. Though every effort is made to keep characters in proper grouping order. Any one who has submitted a character will have their characters displayed in the order they arrived in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll find more use for this resource than what it was initially intended for. I hope you do. All I know for certain is, the digital age has made a resource like this usable well into the future no matter what format our games end up taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
