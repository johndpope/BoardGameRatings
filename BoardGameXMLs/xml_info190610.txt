							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kalarsys: Core Rulebook (HTML Versions)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kalarsys: Core Rulebook was made freely available in three versions (0.6.2, 0.7.0, 0.7.1); the differences are minor refinements, though the organization of the 0.7.1 version is improved.  Character creation begins with biographical and background information.  Characters have &amp;quot;Stats&amp;quot; (Attributes), grouped into Body, Mind, and Skill categories.  Body is split into Strength and Vitality; Mind into Intelligence and Willpower; and Skill into Concentration and Dexterity.  Points are distributed into these Stats from pools associated with the groups.  Derived Stats are then calculated, and then a list of Abilities (special capabilities) are identified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A version 0.7.2 apparently was developed but not released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
