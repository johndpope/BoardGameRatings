			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This world is old, so very old. It has been old since before my father's father's time. Civilizations beyond count have fallen. Are dust now beneath us. We are their legacy. The last of our dust earth, ground from the weight of history. We live beneath a red sun, in a twilight where each day another star dims and sleeps never to waken again. We are the last races of men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The Sophont - genpure without the touch of the machine&lt;br/&gt;        The Eidolon - machinekind post singularity, autonomous&lt;br/&gt;        The Biomeka - the border between neither one nor the other&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last of our cities we live and work. We forage in the wilds, in the ruins for pasttech, for energy sources to power our tools and ourselves. We trade, we war, we love like those before us, though we know with each passing sullen day that our sun will extinguish itself soon. That the end will one day come to a world exhausted of resources, exhausted of history but still a world of men who strive for something more...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
