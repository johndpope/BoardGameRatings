							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Infinite Threats: Too-Nia</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oldest and most advanced species known to core world science, the Too-Nia have built a vast interstellar empire that spans hundreds, perhaps thousands of worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is known about this reclusive and secretive civilization, save that they have been exploring the stars since before the species of the core world had developed anything that could be called a civilization. Hailing from a stretch of the galaxy far beyond the frontier worlds of the Fringe, the Too-Nia have only been encountered in the deepest reaches of space. The exploratory craft and trading vessels of this race venture far out into the unexplored depths of the galaxy and sometimes make hesitant, intermittent contact with other worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the outer Fringe, an old space hand might see a Too-Nia ship once, maybe twice in a lifetime. Rare as it is to contact a Too-Nia vessel, it is even more unusual to lay eyes on one of the shelled aliens in the flesh. They are masters of robotics technology and prefer to use automatons as their intermediaries in diplomatic affairs. Only during conflict will the Too-Nia interact directly with members of other species, and even then the enemy is most likely to encounter automated war machines and warriors who are invisible underneath their stealth screens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a GM with an NPC species for use as allies, adversaries, and foils in a campaign set on the Fringes of settled space. Infinite Futures: Too-Nia contains a number of new creatures, complete with background information and plot hooks, for use with the Infinite Futures 2.0 and the Fringe main rulebooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
