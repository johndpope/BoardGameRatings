							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">V.Smile Cyber Pocket</name>
									
			<description>A third generation V.Smile Pocket was introduced in 2008. Called the V.Smile Cyber Pocket, the console was redesigned with a smaller flip-open screen (still Passive matrix-based) and an integrated graphics tablet, while retaining the microphone introduced in the second generation V.Smile Pocket. Also, a proprietary port was added to the console, which a flash drive like device with a matching proprietary connector on one end and a USB connector on another, could plug in to the Cyber Pocket. This device is used to transfer the data of games that support such function to a PC, which would in turn upload the data to a website. The data could then be used to chart the player's progress as well as be used to unlock bonus games on the said website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;V.Smile&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
