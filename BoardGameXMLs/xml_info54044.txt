							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cow Tipping</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;For generations human teens have crept into pastures at night and tipped over defenseless cows in their sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Last night they tipped the wrong cow... Elsa was the prettiest in the pasture, and Clyde the Bull was in love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Seeking revenge, this morning Clyde rushed onto a nearby highway, causing an auto accident and stopping traffic for miles. Now he's organizing gangs of cows from the pasture to tip cars off the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Watch out world, it's the cows doing the tipping now!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collect gangs of cows by drawing cards from the draw pile or your neighbors' discard piles. Use these gangs to tip over the 5 types of vehicle cards in 5 different colors. Your score is based on the set of vehicle cards you tip; Busses are worth more than Cars and Trucks, but they also require a bigger gang to tip over. Motorcycles aren't worth as much, but they're easier to tip (require a smaller gang).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You score for collecting types of vehicles as well as for collecting colors, so you can go for a bunch of Tractors, or you could try to collect all the Blue vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
