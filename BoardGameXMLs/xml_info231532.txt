			<description>Capsaicin is a push-your-luck card game where participants compete in a pepper eating contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round a pepper card will be drawn from the pepper deck.  If the pepper drawn pushes a player over their threshold for that pepper, they have burnt their mouth and are out of the current round.  &lt;br/&gt;Before a pepper card is drawn each participant has the opportunity  to &amp;quot;Take a Drink&amp;quot; and opt out of the round.  This allows the participant to collect what ever points they have collected this round.&lt;br/&gt;The participant who has the most points at the end of the 5th round is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capsaicin was first introduced as a free mini game to all attendees at Boarder City Game Convention 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
