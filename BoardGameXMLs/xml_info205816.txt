			<description>This is an action/dexterity game played with five small wooden cubes, a 15&amp;quot; wooden rod, a dart made of a wooden disk with three feathers attached to one side, and a board with various shapes and targets. Wooden pegs are used to keep score along ladders of holes punched into the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in five rounds, each of which requires a succession of physical moves. In the first round, for instance, cubes are placed on each of four stars on the board, and the player must toss the dart in the air, pick up a cube and catch the dart all with the same hand. This is then repeated for the second cube, then the remaining two cubes, and then all four cubes at once. Finally, the dart must be tossed up and hit the blue circle in the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player turn lasts until he fails to complete a required trick. When his turn comes again, he starts with the failed trick. First player to complete the requirements of all five rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
