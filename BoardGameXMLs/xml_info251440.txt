			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For obvious reasons, the best possible introduction to the world of Evangelion would be to simply watch the series itself. However, this takes times and many may simply not enjoy anime enough to watch it. But fear not! Everything you need to know to survive in the world of Evangelion has been provided for you in this booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook is an introduction to the setting and does not contain any game mechanics.  Although it was produced to introduce and support Version 1.0 of the game, it is generic enough to function with any version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
