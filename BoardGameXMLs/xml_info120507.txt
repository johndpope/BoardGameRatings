							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Olduvai&#039;s Test</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wise and mysterious sage requires that anyone who wishes to seek him out must undergo a test. Rumor has it that those who complete the test are granted an audience with Olduvai while those who fail wind up paying a higher price. Is it worth the struggle to meet the man known as Olduvai? This module is ideal to use as a mid-adventure change of pace or a jumping off point for a much longer campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Olduvai's Test is a short D20 adventure designed for four to six first or second level characters. The module is designed to be played over the course of one or two game sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Party members may be of any class or alignment; but the party will need to use the Search, Disable Device and Open Lock skills. The adventure introduces beginning players to traps and problems they might encounter in later dungeons and provides them an opportunity to use their skills. It can also lead into additional adventures by supplying the party with information or supplies that they may need. Completion of many aspects of the test requires teamwork and cooperation. Trap dangers - such as damage and the difficulty of detecting and disabling traps - can be increased according to party level. The real treasure provided at the end of the scenario is information and materials the adventurers will need in a continuing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
