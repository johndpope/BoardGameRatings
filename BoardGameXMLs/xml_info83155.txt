			<description>&amp;quot;Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Dororon! Yokai Daikessen!! (太鼓の達人ＤＳ ドロロン！ヨーカイ大決戦！！, Taiko Drum Master DS: Dororon! Big Yokai Decisive Battle!!), known as Taiko DS 3, is a Taiko no Tatsujin game for Nintendo DS and the third installment in the Taiko no Tatsujin DS series. It was released only in Japan on July 1, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay in Taiko DS is very similar to its predecessors. In arcade versions of the series, players are tasked to strike a drum controller to the accompanied music, ranging from J-pop, anime and video game music to commercial jingles and original songs produced by Namco, according to on-screen cues. Since there is not a drum peripheral available for the DS, the touch screen is used instead, displaying a drum on screen, where players use styli to simulate these actions; the DS' buttons can be used as well. A note bar is shown on the game screen, where red or blue, small or large notes approach a strike point, where the player hits the drum either on the center or the outer rims with either one or both drumsticks, respectively. (For instance, a note sequence of small red, small red, large blue would be played with two strikes to the center (drum) part, followed by striking the outer rim of the drum on both sides simultaneously.)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Dororon!
