							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mangrove</name>
									
			<description>Mangrove is a dexterity game for 2&amp;ndash;4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 29 wooden sticks of variable thicknesses, and an elastic plastic middle part. They have a colour at the top and at the bottom. The sticks are placed in a vase-like bowl, so the whole construction looks like a flower. The players pick a stick each, one at a time, but they have to pick a stick which top colour matches the bottom colour of the previous stick. If there is no sticks left of that colour, the player must pick a thick but valuable red stick. The player who causes the whole flower to fall apart loses automatically, and the remaining players count the points of their sticks; thin sticks being worth 1 and thick sticks 3 points. The player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
