							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mutant Race</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crawling out from the wreckage of nuclear, biological, and chemical warzones, created in the laboratories of misguided geniuses, and spawning in realms contaminated by wild magic, mutants are both a race unto themselves and no race at all. Viewed with a mixture of contempt and pity by members of more clearly defined species, mutants are united in desperation by the abnormalities which separate them from other humanoids. As diverse &amp;mdash; if not more so &amp;mdash; in form and outlook as other humanoids, mutants display the best and worst characteristics evolution has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title contains guidelines for playing the Mutant Race as characters and includes details on physical appearance, society, relations with other races, alignment and religion, and typical adventures; typical male and female names; and tables for randomly determining morphology/body type, deformities, and mutations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mini-sourcebook has been specifically designed for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game but can be used with any OGL-based game pretty much as-is and easily adapted to any related or successor systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
