			<description>What is Legend of Grimrock?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Old-school dungeon crawling game inspired by Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder and Ultima Underworld.&lt;br/&gt;- Explore a vast dungeon riddled with hidden switches, pressure plates, sliding walls, trapdoors and more.&lt;br/&gt;- Discover secrets, cast spells with runes and craft potions with herbs.&lt;br/&gt;- Fight murderous monsters and seek lost artifacts in ancient tombs.&lt;br/&gt;- Create a party of four characters and customize them with different races, classes, skills and traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling role playing game with an oldschool heart but a modern execution. A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captivators, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts an emphasis on puzzles and exploration and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools than even the sharpest of swords could be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode which disables the luxury of the automap! Are you ready to venture forth and unravel the mysteries of Mount Grimrock?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
