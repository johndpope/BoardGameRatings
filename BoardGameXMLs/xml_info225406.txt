			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tribute to one of my all time favorite cult classics &amp;quot;The Evil Dead&amp;quot; and as you had already guessed, this adventure follows the events that had taken place during the movie. This is perfect for fans of the flick or those looking for a little fun while taking a brake from the norm. This specific adventure uses a special set of rules that are to be used with the Cthulhu Live rule set. Also this adventure would work best with experienced role players because of the demands that each player will have to meet as the game goes on. It is important to read over this quite carefully to learn just how the game is meant to take place. There is plenty of room for give, being that you never quite know what to expect with live action role playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
