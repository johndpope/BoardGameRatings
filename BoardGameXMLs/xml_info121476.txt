			<description>This east German game simulates the cosmonaut's training that supposedly boys were always dreaming about. &lt;br/&gt;The first half of the game is a snakes and ladders part: Players roll dice and move ahead the strenuous training path. On some fields, they are allowed to move ahead fast because of &amp;quot;excellent performances&amp;quot;, other field lets them fall behind for &amp;quot;insufficient performances&amp;quot;. When a player reaches the 30th field of the track, his or her plastic cosmonaut is inserted into a plastic rocket and is ready for take-off. After rolling a six, the rocket is moved along a path to a distant planet, and the game turns into a basic roll and move game. After skipping a turn on the planet, players take off again and reach earth again on a different path. The first player to return home safely is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is free of political agitation and focusses on the hardships of the cosmonaut's training. It is remarkable that this ancient game (which has only two pages of rules anyway) contains a rule overview on the back side of the rule booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
