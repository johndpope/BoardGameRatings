			<description>PANZER WAR is a set of game rules simulating World War II armored warfare using 1/285th scale miniatures. Each player assumes command of an Allied or Axis platoon or company. &lt;br/&gt;PANZER WAR includes rules covering most weapons, troops and vehicles used during the period 1942 to 1945. Battle action is simulated in a detailed and realistic manner, but with an extraordinary ease of play once the basic rules are understood. Many things that will seem difficult in reading will become almost second nature after just a few games. Once the basics of play have been mastered players will want to include some of the more interesting and complex optional rules dealing with artillery and aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the rules booklet)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typical 1970-1980's game style with charts to depict the warfare of 1/285 scale armor vehicles on all fronts of World War II. Key application of these rules is the modular movement to simulate both player moving at the same time in leiu of ugoigo systems that prevailed at the time. Sandwiched between the infantry movement was 4 separate movement phases with six different firing phases taking place after movement. Very chart driven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PANZER WAR was designed for 1/285th miniatures in mind, but can be adjusted for other scales.&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale for 1/285th is 1mm = 2 meters.&lt;br/&gt;Each vehicle or piece of equipment represents one such unit.&lt;br/&gt;Each miniature soldier figure represents 3 actual men.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn represents from one to three minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Edition was published in 1979; the production run of 250 units was sold out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second Edition was produced in full color in 1981. A print run of about 1000 units was produced. This version came with:&lt;br/&gt;1x Rules Booklet.&lt;br/&gt;1x Chart Folder with common used tables printed in the two inside pages and back page.&lt;br/&gt;1x Sheet of Aspect Diagrams (Three diagrams).&lt;br/&gt;11x Vehicle Battle Charts.&lt;br/&gt; - 3x German&lt;br/&gt; - 2x British&lt;br/&gt; - 2x American&lt;br/&gt; - 1x French&lt;br/&gt; - 1x Italian&lt;br/&gt; - 2x Russian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Third Edition of the game is distributed for free on the author's website.&lt;br/&gt;The rules were later used as the basis for the Panzer Command PC game by Matrix Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
