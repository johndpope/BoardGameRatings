							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hideout</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 24 x 24 inch Floor Plan of a hideout, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hideout is a small multiple room map of a garage with two jeeps, a small armory, a bathroom, a living area, and a surveillance room. This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view from the center of the garage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hideout is intended for use in near or far future science fiction settings. It could also be used in modern settings as well just ignore the biometric hand scanner in front of the surveillance room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hideout isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the place that the group lives, but they spend enough time living there that it seems like it. The hideout makes a great place for the group to prepare for their missions or to lay low until the heat from the authorities dies down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hideout doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be owned by the group. It could be owned by a contact that one of the player characters knows. This contact could be a rather paranoid weapons dealer. His wares include jeeps with 50 caliber machine guns on them, guns, ammunition, and fuel. The surveillance room is the contact&amp;rsquo;s panic room complete with a biometric scanner to keep people out of the room in case of a double-cross or a deal gone wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one encounter with the hideout, the group arrives to strike a deal with their contact, only for the hideout to have it be suddenly surrounded by the authorities. The contact and the group suspect they have been double-crossed by the other party and likely are at odds during the rest of the encounter. They have to deal with a potentially backstabbing contact and the law, trying not to get caught or killed. The contact may head for his panic room or perhaps the ladder in the bathroom to try and escape to a different level. The authorities prepare to breech the hideout, giving the people inside a warning to surrender or else&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
