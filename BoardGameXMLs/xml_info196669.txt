							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Arcade</name>
									
			<description>The Arcade was a joystick produced by Suzo International on the European market. It distinguished itself from the competition because of its robust construction as the stick had a reinforced inside made of steel and used microswitches for the controls (but not the fire buttons, which used leaf springs). It was a home version of the joystick used by the professional gaming industry in many video arcade halls across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arcade appeared in several variations:&lt;br/&gt; - The Arcade Classic, without a fire button&lt;br/&gt; - The Arcade, with just one fire button&lt;br/&gt; - The Arcade Turbo, with two fire buttons (one on the base and one on the top of the stick, of which only one can be used at a time, selected with a switch underneath the base)&lt;br/&gt; - Prof Competition, with two fire buttons (two on the left and righthand side of the base)&lt;br/&gt; - Prof Competition 9000, with three fire buttons (two on the lefthand and righthand side of the base and one on top of the stick)&lt;br/&gt; - Prof Competition 9000 de luxe, with three fire buttons (two on the lefthand and righthand side of the base and one on top of the stick), and an adjustable rapid-fire switch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digital joystick was suitable for most 8 bit and 16-bit home computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arcade_%28joystick%29 The Arcade (joystick)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dimensions:&lt;br/&gt;120 x 90 x 130 mm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
