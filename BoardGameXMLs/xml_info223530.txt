							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dim Sum: Duel of the Dumplings</name>
									
			<description>Dim Sum Duel (or DSD for short) is a short strategy game for 2 players. In each 5-10 minute round, two players compete to see who can cook and keep the most dumplings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a separate deck and players are encouraged NOT to shuffle their decks but rather to arrange their cards in the order they wish to draw them - thus making the game one of pure strategy and no luck factor involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game incorporates elements of planning ahead, risk assessment and risk-taking, reacting to strategy shifts and figuring out what your opponent is up to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
