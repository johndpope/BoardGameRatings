			<description>The Ultimate Adventurer's Guide I&lt;br/&gt;Playtest Final Rev 1.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playtest version has not been edited for release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This manual is written as if the reader has never played these types of games. The information presented in this volume shall be supplemented in future editions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item widely was circulated between the publication of the 2nd Edition and the (planned) publication of the 3rd Edition.  The contents of the &amp;quot;INVICTA&amp;quot; version are more similar to the 2nd Ed. than the 3rd Ed. (though they were intended to become the 3rd Ed.) and were intended to be used as a Playtest.  Several sections of the rules are noted simply as &amp;quot;to be included&amp;quot; in the finished edition.  This playtest version was funded by a Kickstarter campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
