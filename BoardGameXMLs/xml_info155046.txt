							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">InEPTT (International Extraterrestrial Paranormal Tactical Teams)</name>
									
			<description>InEPTT is a skirmish game that runs from 1890 thru to 2020. It pits small elite teams of &amp;quot;Agents&amp;quot; against the evils and aliens of this world. The monsters are normally referred to as creatures and the Aliens as &amp;quot;XRAYs&amp;quot;. InEPTT is built with three basic Genres of play 1890 to 1930, 1930 to 1960 and 1960 to 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These genres have various weapons armouries with which you can build your teams to take on the Creatures and XRAY's that you will face. The game uses the term Mission for a single scenario and Operation for a series of linked Missions. You can build your team as you go as you collect credits with successful mission completion and &amp;quot;kills&amp;quot; of Creatures and XRAYs. The game is run by a Game Master (GM) who designs and runs the missions and or operations and the scope is massive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two &amp;quot;Missions&amp;quot; in the core rules but those missions lend themselves to quick development into literally hundreds of missions with minor tweaks to terrain, victory conditions and forces involved. Some of the key points for InEPTT from a mini/terrain view point is &amp;ndash; there are no specific miniatures that you &amp;quot;must&amp;quot; buy. You can use just about anything you want really, the one stipulation being that Allies and Henchmen should be a What You See is What You Get concept, but for your Agents (term for InEPTT Soldiers) you can use any figure you like. Also the teams range from 3 to 12 so you don't need hordes of figures although your XRAYs and Creatures will often need to out number Agents by as many as 3 to 1 and for zombies 5 to 1 or more &amp;ndash; but that is up to the GM. Also the games usually run from 30 minutes (small 4 x 4 table) to 4 hours for massive 10 x 6 table with 5 teams and over 40 bad guys, with all teams having separate Mission Orders to complicate the system even more. The game has huge amounts of growth still and there is depth in every category from which to develop more and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
