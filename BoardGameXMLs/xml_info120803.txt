							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Artifacts 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may think you know American history, but did you know that Thomas Edison designed a machine to communicate with the dead? Do you know what happened to Geronimo's skull, or to Ben Franklin's robot? Do you know why occultists are willing to pay top dollar for a shard of the plane Buddy Holly died in? Learn the answers to these questions and more, in the second volume of American Artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Artifacts 2 gives you 20 magical items uniquely suited to the New World. Some are objects from American history, like Crispus Attucks's musket ball, or from pop culture, like Zuzu's petals. Some were created by wizards who act like scientists, and some by scientists who act like wizards; Nikola Tesla's ray gun, William Faulkner's pocket watch, and Benjamin Franklin's automaton all blur the line between magic and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All 20 artifacts are suitable for use in a wide variety of games. Each entry includes a description of the artifact, background information, and game mechanics. The artifacts range from the charming, like Mark Twain's cigar box, to the cosmically powerful, like the Shard of the True Plane. A detailed timeline is also included, that offers a clear overview of the occult history of America. You don't need to have read the original American Artifacts to use this book, though if you like one, odds are you will enjoy the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
