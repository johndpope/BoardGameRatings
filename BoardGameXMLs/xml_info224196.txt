			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joanna Podlaska is a well-educated and ambitious thirty-something steelworks engineer. Since she was employed she was met with dismissive sexist attitudes and ostracism from colleagues. To remedy the situation the company manager in no uncertain terms requested Joanna's two closest coworkers to include her in their upcoming fishing trip, hoping to promote camaraderie. Joanna is determined to make an impression despite the challenge of being a woman in a traditionally exclusively masculine environment, both at work and during this trip. Her main source of strength is his confidence in rationality, technology and her problem-solving skills, but during the trip she might be a little intimidated by her seniors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
