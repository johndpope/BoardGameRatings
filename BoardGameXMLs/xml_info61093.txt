							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Coney Island Crawl</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for character levels 11-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a stand-alone adventure that can be played with only the core d20 books! Pregenerated characters are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Xcrawl, the players are superstar athletes taking their chances in a live-on-pay-per-view death sport. It's a modern-day world with a fantasy twist, and the game is simple. The Dungeon Judge, or DJ, creates an artificial dungeon under controlled - but lethal - conditions. The players go through the dungeon and try to fulfill whatever conditions the DJ puts forth in order to win. Xcrawl is a sport and the challenges are created, but the danger is no less real. If you die, you die!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This insane dungeon crawl is the work of the legendary DJ Faces, a judge famous for being sociopathic, vain, domineering, angry and just plain twisted. After being banned from Xcrawl due to a bizarre revenge plot, DJ Faces is back, determined to restore his status by wowing fans everywhere with a spectacular dungeon that presents an exciting but fair challenge to the players. This tough adventure will test even the bravest crawlers as they face the Roller Coaster of Doom and other legendary menaces!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
