			<description>Army Men Mobile Ops is a shooter video game and is based on the Army Men series. The game reastablishes the conflict between the Greens and the Tans. The game takes the gameplay back to its roots as a strategy game. The player can choose to play as 7 different soldiers, with 3 units per mission. These units include the Rifleman, Bazookaman, grenadier, mortarman, radioman, sniper and the minesweeper. The player navigates each soldier through each mission, having different goals and at the same time, having different routes to take to accomplish each mission. Also, there is a Sarge like non-playable character, who is giving task or missions instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Army Men: Mobile Ops&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
