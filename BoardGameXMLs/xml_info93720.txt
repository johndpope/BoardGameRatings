			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insurgent agent Adan, a spy in Alvedara, came across plans for an upcoming assault on Bodrun, the largest remaining dwarven clanhold in the South. Though the dwarves were unknown to him, this Sarcosan rebel decided that he must do his best to get word to these allies in the mountains. He stole the plans and abandoned his cover identity, fleeing east along the Eren and hoping to find succor in the Forest of the Sahi before his trek into the Kaladruns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He didn&amp;rsquo;t make it that far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A legate spyhunter was on his tail within hours of his  departure, and with his stronger mount and divinatory magic, was&lt;br/&gt;sure to run him to ground on the Horse Plains of Erenhead. Adan hoped to throw off the scent of his tracker in the town of Malima, where he had contacts and might be able to wait out the legate in a safehouse. Unfortunately, the situation in Malima had worsened since Adan had last been there, and it had become a place of exile for Alvedarans with the plague. It was a question of choosing the lesser of two evils: plague and possible death in Malima, or torture, betrayal, and certain death at the hands of the legate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adan chose to hide in Malima, but contracted the plague while hiding from his pursuers. Though unable to contact the outside world, Adan sent his familiar, a raven, eastward in the hopes that it would reach a dwarven settlement that could send agents to aid him. The raven made it to the Hagaran Observatory in the Forest of the Sahi, where the PCs have been assisting the sages of the observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is intended for three to six 3rd-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User note: A GenCon 2005 adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
