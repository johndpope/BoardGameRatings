			<description>The captain lowered his telescope. &amp;quot;Land ahoy!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ahead of him lay an island rich in rubies. Enough to make him and his men rich, to give them anything they wanted back on Tortuga. But would they have the booty to themselves or would one of the other pirate crews be digging for the treasure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landlubbers is a bluffing game aimed at children and families. Each pirate chooses which of the six islands to travel to - two are rich in rubies, two in sapphires and two are full of the greatest prize of all - hidden gold. If they're the only pirate to choose that island then they will take the treasure, but if two or more pirates had the same idea then the treasure will go unclaimed! The smartest pirates will know when to bluff, when to take the lesser sapphires and when the time is right to make for the all-important gold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Landlubbers is a great warm-up game, children's party game or a chance for kids to &amp;quot;get one over&amp;quot; their scurvy parents. YARRRRRRRRR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
