			<description>Bid, haggle, and trade your way to the top in this raucous trading game of set collection and player negotiation for 2 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquire spices, textiles, livestock and other exotic goods by bidding on caravans from foreign markets across the ancient world. Manipulate the market &amp;ndash; and each other &amp;ndash; using your shrewd bargaining skills to trade with your fellow merchants and collect resource sets to maximize profits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hafid's Grand Bazaar is played in a series of rounds based on the number of players. Each round consists of four phases during which players will take turns bidding on caravans, influence, and customers; collecting goods from caravans; trading and negotiating with each other to collect sets of goods; and selling their goods for maximum profit. Goods are divided into five categories, with five different items in each category. Players can see which categories of goods their opponents are holding by the symbols on the backs of the cards, but do not know the specific item the cards represent in those categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn't your typical trading game and player interaction can get raucous and intense as players get creative with their haggling! The player with the highest value of talent coins at the end of the game wins. The marketplace is dynamic and ever-changing. You will need to stay sharp and engaged to amass the most wealth and become the greatest merchant in Hafid&amp;rsquo;s Grand Bazaar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
