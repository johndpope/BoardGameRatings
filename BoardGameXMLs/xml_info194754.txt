			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in this rules-light game are all &amp;quot;Clan Warriors&amp;quot;, or champions of their small clan or tribe.  Characters have four Traits (Attributes), including Blood, Song, Sword, and Heart.  At creation, players distribute a points pool into Blood, Song, and Sword - Heart starts at 3.  The numbers indicate the size of the dice pool associated with the Trait.  Dice pool are d20, roll and keep the highest result.  Rolls of 10 and 20 &amp;quot;explode&amp;quot; into another additive roll, allowing for exceptionally high results in rare circumstances.  All rolls are compared to a similar opposed roll performed by the game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters also use Bloodsong, a type of magic invoked through singing or chanting.  Several specific effects are enumerated.  The game presumes that inter-clan violence will be common and bloody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the game was published in the online forum supporting the competition, and exists as text only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
