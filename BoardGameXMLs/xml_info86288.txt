			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dance Central is a rhythm game for the Xbox 360 that uses the Kinect peripheral. The game has players emulate a number of dance moves by moving their bodies, and the Kinect scans their movements to rate their skill level. Performing a number of successful moves in sequence will build up a multiplier that gives more points for continued successes. Dance Central has a 5 star scoring system similar to that of the Rock Band and Guitar Hero series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features three play modes: Break It Down, Perform It!, and Dance Battle. Each mode offers different gameplay options to the player. Furthermore, Dance Central includes a Workout mode that records calories burned each session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 32 songs included in the game broken down into 7 difficulty levels. Like Rock Band and Guitar Hero, additional songs will be available for download through a Music Store, but these songs will be priced higher than previous games&amp;rsquo; content due to the added effort required in choreographing the songs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
