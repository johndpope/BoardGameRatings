							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Locale: Personal Enhancement Center</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even galaxy-spanning adventurers like to spruce up from time to time &amp;mdash; to impress that charming new friend, to infiltrate that posh gathering, or just to look a little less like typical star-scruff. When a quick comb and shave just won&amp;rsquo;t do, the Personal Enhancement Centers, or PECs, are ready to assist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personal Enhancement Centers are establishments dedicated to enhancing personal beauty and attractiveness. While indeed true beauty comes from within, PECs (sometimes colloquially called &amp;ldquo;pecks&amp;rdquo;, from their acronyms) specialize in embellishing the cosmetic attractiveness of their clients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locale: Personal Enhancement Center is a short location or set-piece for Cepheus Engine and other tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game), designed to be inserted seamlessly into any campaign using these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
