							<name  sortindex="5">The American Civil War: The Battle of First Bull Run (1861)</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">There Stands Jackson</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;When the American Civil War began both sides were expecting the issue to be settled quickly, by one decisive battle. The Union was enlisting men for just three months! The first battle took place around Bull Run river (the battle is also known as First Manassas).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The battle was a chaotic affair. Neither army had been properly trained, and the bewildering assortment of uniforms led to confusion. The main battle centered around Henry Hill. General Jackson's brigade occupied the hill and held the position against a series of piecemeal Union attacks, leading to the comment 'There stands Jackson, like a stone wall.' Jackson had his nickname, and the Confederates had their first victory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This scenario focuses on the fight for Henry Hill from noon until about 4 PM, when Early's Brigade arrived to seal the Confederate victory.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x7 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The streamlined &amp;quot;fast and easy&amp;quot; rules encompass unit formations, dismounted cavalry, terrain, line of sight, charges, commanders, and morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
