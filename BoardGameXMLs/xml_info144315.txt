							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gladiators</name>
									
			<description>Gladiators is a thematic combat game set in the sand arenas of the classic roman sport. Players each control 2 (in 2 player, 1 in 3-4 player) gladiators and simultaneously plot their actions upon their gladiator cards. Once three moves have been decided they are revealed and gladiators move around the arena attacking each other, hurling nets and trying to out manoeuvre their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plays in 30-45 minutes, there is a mixture of luck and strategy in the outcome of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expert players are given further scenarios to try out which require adaptation of their existing tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is currently a print and play game that can be played with hex tiles and miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
