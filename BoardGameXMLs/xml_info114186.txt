			<description>Game is based on the format of a hugely successful gameshow in Britain. The show ran from 1978 to 1988. The host throughout was comedian Ted Rogers (1935 - 2001), pictured on the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the help of cryptic clues, players must solve them (and more routine quiz questions), and to thus eliminate other players from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TV show's star was Dusty Bin (also on the cover), a cartoon dustbin. If you failed to win a big prize all you got was a ceramic Dusty Bin figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
