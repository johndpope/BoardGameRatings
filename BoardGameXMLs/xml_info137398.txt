			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've been screwed...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least one person wants you dead...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only people you amost trust, don't necessariy trust you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you've got skills and talents that might just get you through...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...might just let you get some revenge...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and might let you achieve your destiny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FUBAR is a low preparation roleplaying game focusing on a group of talented individuals who have been betrayed by the people they trust. Using the cyberpunk ethos of &amp;quot;Style-over-Substance&amp;quot; it provides a rough framework to tell a tale of revenge, deliberatey leaving out certain information so that players can customise their game at the start of each play session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This director's cut is an expanded and revised edition of the rules. It has been increased from 30 to 50 pages, with some streamlining of certain play concepts, increased guide notes for the Oracle, and more examples of the rules in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Director's Cut of the FUBAR rolepaying game has been deliberatey released under a creative commons license so that anyone may take the concepts within the rules to develop their own games or settings as long as they attribute the work as a derivative of FUBAR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
