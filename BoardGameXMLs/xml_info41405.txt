							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pro Tennis Game by Rod Laver</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple singles tennis game. In the beginner's game, after rolling a single die for the serve, players alternate rolling a pair of dice to get one of 21 possibilities for their shot, continuing until one is missed. In the advanced game, court position is taken into account, and players each get a special weakness card, but all the action is still driven by the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was one of six in RGI's Play the Pros series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significantly modified version of this game was published as part of Sports Spectacular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
