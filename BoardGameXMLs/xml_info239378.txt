			<description>The King is throwing a surprise birthday brunch for the Queen and needs your help. As one of the kingdom's greatest chicken farmers it is up to you to supply the eggs. Unfortunately not all eggs are perfect for her favorite dish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is playable with two to five players. Play time is about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect sets of chicken cards in order to draw random egg tokens from the Coop bag, but beware; some of the eggs are rotten and can end your turn when drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
