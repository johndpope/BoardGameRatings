							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartoon Action Hour Season 2 Valentine&#039;s Day Special</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of humankind&amp;rsquo;s most profound emotions is love&amp;hellip; and what better time to talk about love than on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day? In the machismo-filed world of the retro-toons, love wasn&amp;rsquo;t something that was blatantly bandied about on a regular basis. The characters would rather duke it out or shoot at each other with lasers than engage in romantic situations. That having been said, romance wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely absent from the retro-toons. It was just muted and watered down a bit, making it more tolerable for the target audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mini-sourcebook was written with one goal in mind: to help players and GMs introduce romantic elements into Cartoon Action Hour: Season 2 without violating everything that the retro-toons stood for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fist section deals with advice for integrating romance into the game, while the second section presents a series that explores romantic themes more than most others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
