			<description>The player will be able to match plane figures and space figures by their figure illustration, word name, written description, and a photograph of an actual object with the related plane or space figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in his turn either picks up the top card from the deck or the face upcard next to the deck. She or he then discards one card and places it face up on the discard pile so there are always ten cards in hand or tray.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the first player who has Shape Shuffle goes out. To go out a player must have at least one 4 of a kind, either two more 3 of a kind, or another 4 of a kind and a 2 of a kind and scores for those.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until the first player reaches a score of 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;56 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
