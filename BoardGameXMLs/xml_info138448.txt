							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Malifaux: Ophelia Born on the Bayou</name>
									
			<description>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ophelia is a gunfighter, capable of dishing out good amounts of damage from a distance. She leads a crew of her most trusted kin on raids against human settlements, using her prowess with her pistolas to bring back loot. All of her kin are companioned to Ophelia, allowing them to activate together and get the first strike! She is also the only Henchman that Som'er may take, and she is key to his Crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, Ophelia is more than just a trigger finger. She also has a host of abilities to enhance the gremlins around her, making her a fun and useful tool to any gremlin list, whether it is led by Som'er or herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ophelia is an excellent leader to begin your Malifaux collection. She is versatile, intuitive, and just generally good and fun. Also, all of the models which you purchase for her are fantastic models for Som'er, and he is a good master to expand out to when you want a few more options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ophelia Boxed set comes with all of the LaCroix kin except the Young LaCroix:&lt;br/&gt;Ophelia LaCroix&lt;br/&gt;Francois LaCroix&lt;br/&gt;Pere Ravage&lt;br/&gt;Rami LaCroix&lt;br/&gt;Raphael LaCroix&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are all unique models, so the boxed set provides one of each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you have that, you will probably want the Young LaCroix (she can take 3) followed by a blister of Slop Haulers and a blister of Bayou Gremlins when you are ready to expand, since they are the two best options for her, besides her kin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
