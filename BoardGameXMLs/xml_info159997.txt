							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Think: Mindpack</name>
									
			<description>This is one of the Ravensburger &amp;quot;Think&amp;quot; games, a brainteaser/mental exercise game-series. These games are good for mental training, e.g. in creativity, concentration, imagination, logic and so on.&lt;br/&gt;the games expand your potential through brain-friendly training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think: Mindpack contains three games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Smile is trump (2 Players)&lt;br/&gt;    Resources (2 Players)&lt;br/&gt;    Six hats (2-6 Players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smile is trump is a Stratego-like game. Each player receives 12 pieces. Each piece has two different sides: 4x Smiling/Neutral, 4x Frowing/Neutral, 3x Smiling/Frowning, 1x Neutral/Neutral. The players move the pieces on the board; when a piece moves into another piece's space, the pieces are flipped and compared. The weakest piece is removed: Smiling defeats all others and Neutral defeats Frowning. Play continues until only three pieces remain. The player that has the most pieces left, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resources: Players have 24 two-color pieces, which they use to make combinations. The player that makes the most combinations, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six hats: Cards are drawn indicating a riddle. Players have to determine the correct hat color. The player that solves the riddle first gets to keep the card. After a pre-determined amount of cards, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
