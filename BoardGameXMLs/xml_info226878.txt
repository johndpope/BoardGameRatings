							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost: Siberia</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to Outpost 1, the first science observatory located in the isolated frozen tundra of Siberia! You and your team have been investigating anomalous activities the region, and recently things have shifted for the worse. The coming storm is said to be the &amp;quot;storm-of-the-century&amp;quot;; it may last a month or more. Strange howls and buzzing fill the long nights, and yesterday a crew-member went AWOL... or worse. The call for evacuation was made, but it came too late. The long winter storm has set in. There's no hope of getting help until it clears. Now your crew's only hope is to use what little resources you have to survive the long winter cold (and whatever's out there in it). Use your rations wisely, and you may see the sun again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost: Siberia is a fully cooperative, survival game that plays with a single deck of cards. Using an inventive dual-facing system, a single card in Outpost can be anything from life-saving supplies to cataclysmic catastrophes. By enduring relentless weather and defeating untamable beasts, players are rewarded with the much-needed tools and food to continually resupply their resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outpost: Siberia keeps the tension high, as players will need to collect their wits and ration their supplies in order to make through the perpetual perils that lie ahead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
