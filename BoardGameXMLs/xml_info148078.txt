							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Ruins 3</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a Modern Ruins, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This bomb shelter has run out of supplies. We have no choice but to get out of here, fix the rail line, and use a train to leave this city. Lock and load and be ready for anything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Ruins Volume Three is a Modern Ruins expansion compatible with Modern Ruins Volumes One and Two. The main features of the map are a rusted rail line along the northern map edge with a chunk missing in the middle, a bomb shelter or possibly sewer entrance in the northwest, a shattered brick and wood building in the center with a couple of walls still standing, possibly the remains of the rail station, a car with no windows and five stacked wheels are west of the center building, and a sunken building with fallen stone supports southwest. The stone supports once held up the structure immediately to the east, which could have been a water tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product is intended for use in modern or post apocalyptic settings. This could also be used as a modern ruin found in a near or far future science fiction setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After leaving the bomb shelter, the group needs to find and fix the train and the rail line to get transport out of the destroyed city. An idea for this post-apocalyptic scenario is mutated zombies. The area is clear at first, give the group some time to fix the train and rails, and then have the zombies attack as a first light wave as they near completion of the repairs. Half the group fixing the rail needs to fight them off and run to the train. The other half of the group fixing the train needs to get it running after the repairs are done. The first group leaps on the train as it starts up, as a second, heavier wave of zombies approach. The group uses the train to run over as many zombies as they can as they attempt to escape. Meanwhile, other zombies jump and climb onto the back train cars and lumber forward trying to reach the front train car. The group has to fight zombies off or uncouple train cars to get rid of the zombies. If the group makes it out of town alive, will they find salvation in the next town over or an even bigger wave of zombies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
