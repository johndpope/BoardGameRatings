			<description>Business is booming, your department store is full of merchandise and stock is flying off the shelves. Suddenly without warning the economy takes a downturn and you're in a tough spot. Do you have the TENACITY to make it through or are you going to give it all up?&lt;br/&gt;This is a pretty simple game consisting of a board representing four weeks, merchandise cards, and four decks of cards that control everything. The card categories are Sales, Fate, Economy, and Management. The spaces on the board direct what card to take. The cards have varying effects ranging from instantly losing the game to making a fortune in one turn. Players also have to manage employees and keep their inventory in order. The last one still in business wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;This is a game full of sudden twists and turns so that you can never know who's going to win until the very end. It's a fun way to experience what it's like to run a business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
