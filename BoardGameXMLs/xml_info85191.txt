			<description>Players compete to build the best society and struggle from the earliest technologies to the technology of today.  They attempt to claim great people and achievements before the others can, use their technology more effectively, and eek out more VP points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a small deck of cards that represents their society.  To improve their society they build new settlements and research new technology.  These cards get added to their own discard and their discard eventually becomes their new deck to draw from.  There are many paths to victory and ways to gain VP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in a limited # of rounds and attempts to give all players equal footing with a means to claim first player in the round order.  A timeline of cards changes the game priorities every time and indicates the # of rounds left in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players collect resources based on their cards throughout the game.  Resources stay from turn to turn to allow you to build up between turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will also come with a role selection variant to increase the player interaction and replay-ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
