							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lobos</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lobos is a d20 supplement that presents background and a racial template for a canine player character race for use in any d20 fantasy system.  Lobos are canines with characteristics derived from dogs, wolves, and coyotes.  Some Lobos are magically created as bodyguards; others are bred for battle; still others are &amp;quot;mass produced&amp;quot; by magical means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lobos may wear armor that is specially built for them, but generally they may not use weapons or other magic items inasmuch as they do not have hands.  Their racial adjustments are:  +2 Dex, +2 Con, +1 Wis, -2 Int.  They have bonuses to several skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
