			<description>The Zombies have come! Eat your fill of brains to become the fattest zombie. Only then will they call you King!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fat Zombie is a funny little dice game, a game that melded two of our favorite pastimes: rolling dice and eating. Combined, they form an easy, fun-to-play game about trying to eat as many people as possible to become the fattest zombie! For once you become the fattest zombie... then you shall be King! Why King? Zombies don't care about money, political power or fundraising; they only care about brains. Not even the quality of brain eaten, merely the quantity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you and your friends (2-4) set out upon the grandest adventure: to eat as many brains as possible from the hapless humans! But be wary, for the humans are not without the means to defend themselves, and the fattest zombie may soon become the dead undead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Fat Zombie only takes about twenty minutes, even if you have never played the game. You and your friends are Zombies that wander the streets, looking for delicious brains! On your turn, you draw the top card of the deck and play it for all to see. You will then roll the die to see if you eat the human, if he escapes or hides, or if he kills you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
