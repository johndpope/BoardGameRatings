			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of the light-cycle mini-game from TRON.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-speed action against the computer or a friend. Lay down your trail of Plasma on the Raster Grid, keep going at all costs and try to block your opponent's path. Only the meanest Plasma Bike rider gets to survive this split-screen, head-to-head contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raster Runner is based on the light-cycle game from the film and subsequent arcade game Tron. There are a few innovations - it is a two player game, with each player having visibility of a small area around their 'Plasma Bike'. An overview of the match is shown on a radar which shows the entire arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original light-cycle game had two speeds for the bikes, controlled by the fire button. This has been removed in this version. Instead the fire button activates an energy shield which allows the bike to pass through a plasma trail. Three energy shields are available per life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A match consists of 10 lives per player, but when one rider loses their last life, the match is awarded based on a points system, so it is possible (though unlikely) that the player who loses their last life first, could still win the match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original Game (C64 version) Designed by Hitech Studio Designs&lt;br/&gt;Conversions by The Big Red Software House&lt;br/&gt;Produced by Terry Haynes and Andrew Wright&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
