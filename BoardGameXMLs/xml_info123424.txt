			<description>Super Locomotive is a train arcade video game developed by Sega and released in 1982.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to guide a train from one station to next. Along the route, the player must avoid obstacles such as other trains, planes, red signals, trucks crossing intersections, and guide the train along multiple routes by changing tracks en-route. The player is armed with a steam fire bullet for destroying airborne targets, and a temporary force field which protects the train for a limited period of time. The use of the bullets and shields rapidly deplete an energy bar which must be maintained between levels by picking up oil items en-route. Upon completion of a level, a bonus stage is played which involves the train attempting to shoot as many airborne enemies within a finite time limited. The bonus awarded is dependent upon the number of enemies destroyed. The game then resumes on more challenging levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a rendition of &amp;quot;Rydeen&amp;quot; (1979) by Yellow Magic Orchestra playing throughout the main gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was reported to have a very limited production run with only 35 PCB boards printed. Of those, most remained in Japan, with the remainder exported to Sega Europe and all sold to UK customers. This means that the game was not natively present in either mainland Europe or the US.  This makes the game one of the most sought after boards, and prices reflect this scarcity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While no official conversions of the game exist, the game Loco is heavily influenced by the concepts introduced in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Locomotive&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loco is a 1984 computer game developed by Antony Crowther for release by Alligata for the Commodore 64. In 1986 it was converted for the ZX Spectrum and Atari 8-bit family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ZX Spectrum version was developed by Richard Stevenson, David Wright and Nigel Speight.  The music for the game is a C64 remake of Jean Michel Jarre's Equinoxe 5 by Ben Daglish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comparing screen shots and game descriptions, Loco appears to be a clone of the arcade game Super Locomotive, produced by Sega in 1982.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Loco (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
