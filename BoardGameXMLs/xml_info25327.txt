			<description>Object: Four different Popeye Adventures are illustrated on the board. The object of play is for the player to win each of the four adventures by &amp;quot;eating&amp;quot; enough cans of spinach (wooden green discs), which are won in the &amp;quot;Grand Spinach Lottery&amp;quot;. After winning an adventure the player receives an Adventure Card. The first player to win all four Adventure Cards and get to the finish is the winner of the game. The game has a typical spinner, cards, wooden &amp;quot;cans of spinach&amp;quot;, and a &amp;quot;Grand Spinach Lottery&amp;quot; which is a box that you shake tokens out of, the tokens state how many cans of spinach you will receive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
