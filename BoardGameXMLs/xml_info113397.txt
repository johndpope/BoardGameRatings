							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Grain Drain</name>
									
			<description>The Grain Drain is a game intended to improve understanding of world hunger.  At the beginning of the game, some players are randomly chosen to be rich countries, the rest are poor countries.  Depending on this choice, players roll and move around either the &amp;quot;rich&amp;quot; loop track or the &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; loop track for the rest of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to avoid starvation:  all players must be able to afford to feed their people once per lap of the gameboard, but because event squares on the &amp;quot;rich&amp;quot; track typically award greater amounts of money, &amp;quot;rich&amp;quot; players are less likely to suffer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the educational package &lt;i&gt;Food For Thought&lt;/i&gt; (1976), produced by Christian Aid jointly with Oxfam and the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
