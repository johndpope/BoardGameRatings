			<description>&amp;quot;Conflict: Denied Ops is the fifth game in the Conflict series. Originally, the game was to be called &amp;quot;Crossfire&amp;quot; but was later changed. It is the first game in the series to be released on the PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, but it was also released on PC and on GameTap as of March 20, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a first person perspective, instead of the third person viewpoint of the four preceding titles, and is also the first game in the Conflict series which does not feature four main characters. Denied Ops is based around two CIA operatives, each having his own weapon and style: a sniper named Lincoln Graves who uses an SR-25 with an undermounted M26 MASS, and a machine gun operator named Reggie Lang who uses an M249 PARA with an undermounted M320 grenade launcher.  The two characters have quite opposite personalities. Lang likes it loud and noisy while Graves likes it quiet and stealthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In single player mode, the player can switch between controlling each operative. In co-op, each player controls one operative. The operatives only use their weapon of choice, and cannot pick up enemy weapons. Ammunition  for firearms  is unlimited, but explosives are not and must be replenished at resupply boxes found throughout the levels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Conflict:_Denied_Ops,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
