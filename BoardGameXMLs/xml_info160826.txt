			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever created an amazing place for your campaign only to discover that you don't immediately have a collection of NPCs to fill it? Or have your PCs ever stumbled into a place you haven't had time to fully develop as a living, breathing part of the campaign?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, why not take out a handful of dice and roll up an instant NPC! Or in this case, an &amp;quot;Insta-NPC&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Insta-NPCs product line is designed to offer one or more tables to roll on to figure out a little something about the NPC you're pulling together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, let's say you need a tavern patron to spice things up. You roll a d8 to figure out how many descriptors you need and get a 5, which means you roll twice on the descriptor table. A couple of d100 rolls later you end up with &amp;quot;Overdressed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Flexible.&amp;quot; Hmmm. Perhaps this guy is an acrobat in a traveling troupe who just stopped into this tavern and needed an ale so badly he forgot to take off his costume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe you find yourself with a &amp;quot;Dismissive,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Reserved,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Starving&amp;quot; lady who simply sits down and demands to be served a meal like she owned the place. What's HER story?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get 100 different descriptors to play with in this one, along with four sample characters you can use right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
