			<description>A cartoon-like stock market game for players Ages 12 and up, Deception requires basic buy/sell principles.  Each player will buy and sell shares of stocks, hoping to make enough money to buy the luxuries required to win the game.  Included are secret cards (can raise havoc from your competitors) business cards (for last minute trades), and market cards (large cards that show the current prices for each stock).  The longer you hold on to a specific stock, the more money you can make on dividends.  However, the longer you have a stock, the more likely it will go bankrupt before you can sell it.  Deception is a fairly ruthless business game, but it provides for lots of laughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
