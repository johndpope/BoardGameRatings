			<description>RINKSIDE HOCKEY by FTP Sports Games is a full stats-based simulation of the fast-paced game of hockey.  The game engine is designed around a hockey player's ability to make the plays that will determine the outcome of each game.  Hockey players are rated individually on such traits as goal scoring, passing, defense, checking, and several others.  Goalies are also rated on their abilities to make saves, avoid giving up rebounds and more.  Game players will resolve action either by printing out fast action cards or using the Microsoft Excel Game Center, which is included in the game.  All player cards, the fast action deck and more are available as PDF downloads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game flows similar to an actual hockey game and is broken up into the three main zones of a rink:  Offensive Zone, Neutral Zone and Defensive Zone.  You can either pass or skate your way from one zone to the next and the fast action cards (or Game Center) will determine the result.  Once your player makes it to the offensive zone, then you decide to shoot or pass again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hockey players&amp;rsquo; ability to draw and dish out penalties is also very evident in the game.  There is even a momentum tracker which can help teams as you track big hits, goals, great saves, etc.  &lt;br/&gt;Several hockey seasons are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
