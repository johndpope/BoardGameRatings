			<description>KiBosh! is a classic 3-Card game with Explosive Action! Kibosh31 is a new card game based on a classic 3-card game of 31, also known as Scat or Ride The Bus. The object of the game is to build your 3-card hand to a total of 31, or as close as you can, before your opponents do by drawing and discarding from the deck or discard pile. KiBosh! includes Skip and Reverse cards similar to UNO, and a unique KiBosh card, that when played, forces the next player to dicard their entire hand and draw three new cards. Players are eliminated after losing all their chips in round play and the last player wins the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
