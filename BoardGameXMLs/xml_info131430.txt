			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a Witch Ward?&lt;br/&gt;A coven leader of 12th level or higher can brew a special potion for each member of the coven. The potion consists primarily of wolf&amp;rsquo;s blood, mandrake root, and several other secret ingredients. A witch of 3rd level or higher may use this potion and a special ritual to make someone their witch ward. This gives the imbiber special powers and creates a unique bond between the witch and the (now) ward. The ward candidate must accept this fate of his own free will and under no circumstances can it be forced. The ward is for all intensive purposes completely dedicated to the well being of the witch but is not exactly her servant. The ward has the will to make his own decisions. But, he will be compelled to do as the witch asks and to make certain no harm comes to her. The bond is a two-way street as well. The witch will suffer greatly if her ward were to meet an untimely death and she would never (since white witches are generally good) put her ward in the way of harm without good reason. However, ultimately, the ward must follow the code and quests of the witch that he/ she is warded to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
