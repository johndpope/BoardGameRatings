							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">La guerra Ir√°n-Irak</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Super Juegos&amp;quot; was a pioneer Spanish magazine about both, board and computer games, which was published between 1984-1985. Every issue included a board game inside, with rules and cut-out counters. As far as I know only eight numbers were published, at least in its first epoch (another publication with the same name would appear years later, this time focusing on computer games only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue 3 included &amp;quot;La guerra Ir&amp;aacute;n-Irak&amp;quot;, an easy to learn  wargame (two page rules) for two players about the conflict between these two Arabian countries which lasted from 1980 to 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was originally published first inside issue 4 of NUMERO UNO magazine in 1980&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
