							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Artemis</name>
									
			<description>Feel this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How odd is it that you&amp;rsquo;ve developed an intense sexual relationship with Artemis, the massive passenger spaceship that carries you across the vastness of space? Especially given that it&amp;rsquo;s nothing more than an automated hull moving through the inky black, regulating its internal processes on a predefined route. As the end of the line approaches and Artemis prepares to enter its final docking station, you have all left the safety of your private sexual entanglements and decided to include the ship itself, which you find undeniably attractive and sexually compelling, in your play. The lot of you want Artemis to be a dominant partner (sort of a spaceship dominatrix) for you as you reveal yourselves and follow its every command, hopefully leading up to an array of massive, kink-fueled orgasms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
