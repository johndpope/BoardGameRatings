							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battles of Norghan</name>
									
			<description>In Battles of Norghan, you manage a clan consisting of members and mercenaries of many different fantasy races and classes recruited by you from the mercenary camp on an auction basis by offering one of the five types of contracts with a better pay than what the competing clans have bid for the unit if they have.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;You buy them equipment, spells, train them and get prepared for the next battle while viewing various ranking tables and statistics. Those battles are between clans in the same division or cup. Battles are based on turn-based strategy and you and your enemy take turns to issue commands to the units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
