			<description>At the height of the cold war, KGB and CIA fight for controlling the world: In Berlin, Cairo, Rio, or Hong Kong, accomplish your missions, counter opposing agents and be wary of double agents...unless you are one yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agents Secrets is a party game for 6 to 12 players who play in opposing (CIA vs. KGB) to win missions all over the world. (The game is freely inspired by &amp;quot;Module 6&amp;quot;, a non-credited Russian game, recently discovered.) Each team member receives a secret identity (agent or double agent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each turn mission cards of various value are revealed, then each player receives secretly three action cards. The turn is resolved after two rounds. During each round, the players of each team can freely discuss their strategy, then secretly assign an action to a mission. Actions are revealed simultaneously. After the second round, all actions are resolved and each mission card is won by the team with the best cards combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After six turns, the team with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
