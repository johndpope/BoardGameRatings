			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On great ships, the Pioneers of mighty Capitol were the first to set forth to make landfall on the newly reshaped worlds, with peace, profit and prosperity as their proud aims. First to Luna and then to Mars, Capitol's people flowed outward - the deserts bloomed, the factories churned forth new chattels, for a brief moment, it looked like a new age of peace had dawned on the worlds.  It was not to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Corporations had risen, rivalry led to tension. Tension led to conflict. Conflict escalated to war.  Then, the great collapse came.  From the nothingness surrounding the solar system, the Dark Legion fell upon Humanity like a scythe in times of harvest.  For long ages, the survivors struggled merely to stay alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Humanity united and rose from the caves of ignorance and conflict to stand as one under the brilliant banner of the sacred Brotherhood and the President of Capitol .  Now is the time to stand strong, flex muscles, sharpen minds and load weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now is the time for heroes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience the fantastic world of Capitol, from the boiling intensity and splendid glamour of the San Dorado penthouses and film studios, to the barren deserts and rotting trenches of the McCraig Line surrounding Saladin's Citadel on Mars.  Adventure under the evil glow of Phobos and Deimos, eternally marked by the signs of the Dark Apostles, and seek new challenges in the shady alleys of the second largest city in the Solar System - San Dorado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this sourcebook, you will find everything you want to know about Capitol and its citizens - new backgrounds, more special forces, heavier weapons, unique armor, and equipment, more vehicles and new rules for vehicle combat, extensive descriptions and maps of locations on Mars and in San Dorado, a thrilling adventure: &amp;quot;Fear and Loathing in San Dorado&amp;quot;, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
