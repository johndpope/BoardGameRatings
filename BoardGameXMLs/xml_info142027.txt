			<description>&amp;quot;Project X Zone (プロジェクト クロスゾーン Purojekuto Kurosu Zōn, pronounced &amp;quot;Cross Zone&amp;quot;) is a crossover tactical role-playing game for the Nintendo 3DS co-developed by Banpresto and Monolith Soft and published by Namco Bandai Games. The game is a follow up to the 2005 video game Namco &amp;times; Capcom and features characters from Namco Bandai Games, Capcom, and Sega. The game was released on October 11, 2012 in Japan and will be released in North America on June 25, 2013 and in Europe on July 5, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stages in Project X Zone take place in grid-based locations from the game's many crossover titles. Each friendly unit is made up of two characters (thus referred to as a Pair Unit), though a third character (or &amp;quot;Solo Unit&amp;quot;) can be added for once-per-battle assistance. Unlike Namco &amp;times; Capcom, units can move freely within their range on the field map, with no penalty for accessing treasure chests or destructible objects prior to attacking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle system is called the Cross Active Battle System, wherein pressing the A button in combination with the Circle Pad performs up to five basic attack combos. Additional gameplay elements include Support Attack, which allows the player to call in a nearby ally for assistance, and Cross Hit, which freezes the target in place during simultaneous attacks from multiple units. Also, the player can trigger Critical Hits by connecting their next attack just before the target hits the ground after the first. As the player's units deal damage, the player's Cross Power (XP) gauge fills up and can be used for special attacks and defensive moves on the map. Damage done via Cross Hits can fill this gauge up to 150%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project X Zone has a total of 15 save game slots included in the game, which can be used for recording a save game file during intermissions with a quick save file and a soft reset command.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Project X Zone&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
