			<description>HELLO TAIWAN is a card game about  KUSO(funny) Taiwan's native affairs. There are so many dumbfounding things, complex issues of history and ethnic groups in Taiwan. &lt;br/&gt;We carefully designed for each character's appearance , skills and features in the game to transform serious social events into funny cardset ability. &lt;br/&gt;Let's play the game with smile and enjoy it !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Component]&lt;br/&gt;Game BoardX1&lt;br/&gt;CardsX200 (include Minions and Spells)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[How to play]&lt;br/&gt;1. Shuffle the cards and deal 30 cards to each players as their own deck.&lt;br/&gt;2. Decide which player will go first randomly. &lt;br/&gt;3. Each player draw 4 random cards from their own deck.&lt;br/&gt;4. Each players have their turns alternately. At the start of each playes's turn one card is drawn from their deck and added to their hand. At the first turn of each players, they have 1 Skill Point (SP) ,then at the second turn of each players, they have 2 Skill Point (SP) ,and so on.&lt;br/&gt;5.During your turn, you may play any of your cards, including summoning minions, casting spells. Playing a card will consume the amount of SP stated in the top-left corner of the card. You are also able to command your minions to attack opponent's minions or player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Minions] &lt;br/&gt;Minions remain on the board after entering play and only leave when destroyed. Minions may not attack on the turn they enter play, but may attack each turn afterward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Spells]&lt;br/&gt;Spells are cards which change the state of play, dealing damage, healing wounds, or buffing Minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Winning the game]&lt;br/&gt;A player wins the game when he reduces opponent's player to zero life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;哈囉臺灣是一款本土的KUSO時事卡牌遊戲。 臺灣有太多讓人哭笑不得的事情，有太多歷史與族群等複雜的問題，在遊戲中，我們針對每&amp;shy;一位角色精心設計外型、技能及特性，讓嚴肅社會事件，轉化成有趣的牌組功能，就讓我們&amp;shy;滿懷笑容的參與，並且享受其中吧。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
