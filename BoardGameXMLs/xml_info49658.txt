			<description>Publisher's Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fourth Nail?! Dios! What gypsy would not know of it? It was one of our number who stole it, was it not? The petty little thefts of all our people have been forgiven throughout the ages because of that one act . . . so say we, the gypsies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You seek it?! Oh, my friend, do not even hope for such a thing. The Phuri Dai would have me served to wild wolves to even speak of it! I fear that this will not stop you, Indy. Once you make up your mind, you follow it through to the end!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And speaking of the end, old friend . . . who are those huge men behind you, all dressed up in those terrible black robes? Oh, Indy, how their swordblades gleam!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fourth Nail - truth or legend? Indiana Jones will not stop until the facts are known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
