							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orders For The Major: The Battle Of Normandy 1944</name>
									
			<description>A game in the ASLComp series by Critical Hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subject: the Allied Operation Epsom (aka First Battle of the Odon), Normandy, France 1944. Centered around battles near the town of Gavrus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a remake of Scotland the Brave I. As such it contains the same original 9 scenarios, and 1 campaign game, with some minor alterations. The game features new map and counter art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game allows you to recreate firefights between British and German troops in Normandy 1944, on a tactical scale: individual vehicles, artillery pieces, support weapons, squads and leaders.&lt;br/&gt;The terrain lends itself for a mixture of close quarter battles around villages and bridges, coupled with long range tank duels, due to the relatively flat, open area with little or no hedges (bocage).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the designer's research and availability of detailed sources on the depicted actions, the scenarios have a highly historically informative value, backed by information and pictures of some of the landmarks in the designer's notes booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
