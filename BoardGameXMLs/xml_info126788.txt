							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Forgotten Shrine</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alone in the wilderness stands a mysterious obelisk. Its purpose and its creators are long forgotten. The local people avoid it, claiming that it is still guarded by a cruel and bloodthirsty beast. What secrets does this ancient shine hold, and who is brave enough to explore its depths?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounter Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forgotten shrine is a sidebar adventure that can be added to nearly any other adventure. The encounter is designed for characters between 4th and 6th level, although it can be adjusted to higher levels if necessary by adding additional guardians. The shrine itself is a tall, narrow stone obelisk. It can be located nearly anywhere in the campaign or adventure. The encounter doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any hyping, simply allow the party to pass by the shrine in the course of their adventuring. Describe the shrine and show the party the picture of it. Curiosity and greed should fuel the rest of the encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
