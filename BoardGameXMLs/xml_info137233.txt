							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wargaming Pioneers: Including Little Wars by H.G. Wells, The War Game for Boy Scouts and The War Game by Captain Sachs 1898-1940 Early Wargames Vol. 1</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&amp;quot;Prior to Donald Featherstone publishing his classic book War Games in 1962, there were numerous attempts, by other authors, to create realistic wargames. H.G. Wells's 1913 Little Wars, was the best known early wargaming book, although only one of a number of early wargaming rules. The many similarities in these rules indicate that H.G. Wells was clearly familiar with some of these when devising his own rules. This book contains selected key wargames all written between 1898 and 1940 including:: Notes on the Robert Louis Stevenson Game (1898) The Great Wargame (1908) War Games for Boy Scouts (1910) Little Wars (1913) by HG Wells Sham Battle 1929 (Extract) by Lt. Dowdall and Gleason Mechano Artillery Duel (1932) The Liddell Hart Wargame (1935) Captain Sachs War Game (1940) &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
