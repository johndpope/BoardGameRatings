							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Tale of Robyn Hood and Her Merry Band of Maids</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        She robs from the rich and she gives to the poor,&lt;br/&gt;        except for when she needs new shoes&lt;br/&gt;        and then she keeps the money!&lt;br/&gt;        Robyn Hood Robyn Hood,&lt;br/&gt;        hey nonny nonny nonny no!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robyn Hood is a scenario for Best Friends the indie game written by Gregor Hutton for six players. It is a re-imagining of the classic Robin Hood fable, with all the genders reversed. This is a game that is not to be taken seriously and overacting, silliness and anachronistic jokes are encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from The Setting &amp;amp; The Cast:&lt;br/&gt;Sherwood Forest and Medieval Nottinghamshire: The most stereotypical traditional, fifties movie realistic, clich&amp;eacute; version you can describe. Robyn and her merry maids live in the forest. The PCs make up the merry maids and Robyn herself. Each character should be familiar enough, but each has a secret motivation that will cause conflict in the course of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
