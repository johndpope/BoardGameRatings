							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quests of Doom 3 (5E)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With pride and fanfares of trumpets we introduce Quests of Doom 3, another volume of adventures worth winning, from the incomparable and brilliant minds behind Frog God Games. (That&amp;rsquo;s us! See what we did there?). With this trove of places and challenges, you can explore the perils of the Maighib Desert, or the druid Niavark&amp;rsquo;s forested demi-plane of vengeance, and many other locations where only brave-hearted adventurers would want to set foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each chapter of the book is a stand-alone module that can be placed anywhere in your own campaign world, wherever you need it. The adventures are not a series, and are not linked to each other. So pick and choose them in whatever order you want, switch them up, break them into parts and reassemble them &amp;mdash; this is a free-form resource for the resourceful game master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using the Lost Lands world setting by Frog God Games, each chapter contains information about where it is located in the world. Like we said, though, don&amp;rsquo;t feel constrained by the way we organize our campaign world, because we&amp;rsquo;re talking about your campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ll find in this book is a carefully crafted adaptation of adventures originally written for the Pathfinder system into the fifth edition rules, designed to take best advantage of fifth edition&amp;rsquo;s particular strengths. We didn&amp;rsquo;t just apply numerical formulas to the existing material, we took into account the different tactics, skills, and options available in fifth edition and re-crafted the adventures as if they had been written with the fifth edition rules from the beginning. We convert adventures for the system, not just by the numbers, and we&amp;rsquo;re very proud of the results here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
