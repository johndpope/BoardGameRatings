			<description>Haggle is a simple trading game involving ideas (represented by light bulbs), girls (actually women, but this is from 1970, after all), connections (represented by printed circuits), time pieces, and rhinoceroses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets five of each of these items, five value cards, and a rubber band.  By arranging the cards with the rubber band passing through the appropriate notches each item is given a secret personal value from one to fifty cents.  Then everyone trades - trading is completely free-form, with no turns and no restrictions on deals.  When no one wants to trade any longer, the game ends and players add up the value of the items they have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is no credit for a game designer, the graphic design is credited to Don Moyer, who since then appears to have become prominent in the world of graphic and industrial design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
