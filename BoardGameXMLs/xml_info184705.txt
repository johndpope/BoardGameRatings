							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Treasure of Socantri</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DragonQuest game module, The Treasure of Socantri, is meant to be played in about 12 hours by four to six characters of adventurer level. It is designed to be presented as a single adventure, but can be easily incorporated into an ongoing campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before beginning the adventure, the GM should read and thoroughly familiarize himself with the background, layout and details of the stronghold, and the possible situations which may arise. He should compare the details of the occurrences within the stronghold with the maps so the story becomes firmly fixed in his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure can prove particularly deadly if the characters are mentally and physically unprepared. If the GM feels the characters are not ready for this challenge, he may wish to vary the abilities of the monsters or reduce their Fatigue and Endurance Characteristics to balance the encounters. If more than six characters participate or their abilities are too strong, the GM should add an extra monster or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
