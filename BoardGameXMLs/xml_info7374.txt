			<description>Veptheca is an abstract strategy game for two or more players, which is played with pen and paper.&lt;br/&gt;The board of Veptheca is a arbitrary quad-board with dots. The minimal size is 3x3 points, but bigger is better, for more strategy. Of course, for more than two players, a bigger field must be used.&lt;br/&gt;Every player draws a vector on the field, with the following rules :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Orthogonal vector with length 1 (the distance between two neighbor dots in same line or column) with arbitrary direction, if the vector doesn't intersect any existing one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Vector, which is a sum of two existing connected vectors with joint vertex in case :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* is discreet (i.e. lies on two dots from the field);&lt;br/&gt;    * doesn't intersect existing vector;&lt;br/&gt;    * the joint vertex of the vectors, which sum is, is its vertex too;&lt;br/&gt;    * lies in the sub-plane defined by the non-obtuse angle defined by the two vectors, which sum is it;&lt;br/&gt;    * is not a result of two collinear vectors;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the player who makes the last possible move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The official game site (for rules and examples) is &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://veptheca.tuzsuzov.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://veptheca.tuzsuzov.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
