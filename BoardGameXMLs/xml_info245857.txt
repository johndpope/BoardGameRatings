			<description>An adventure game where you'll embody humanity's only hope: a superpowered drag queen. Your mission: to be more successful than any of them. But how can a poor drag queen succeed in a post-apocalyptic world? As usual... attracting some loyal fans, defeating your enemies, including other drag queens, and overcoming all kinds of challenges. Gather weapons, knick-knacks and any old stuff you come across to ​increase your already large arse-nal and move between stages to accomplish your goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Queen has different Dragabilities! There are no Hit Points... There is Dignity! Every time you lose dignity, it will transform intobizarre points. If you lose all your dignity, you will become unworthy and die. But being a little bit bizarre will help you use your superpowers. Gather success with Fans, challenges and beating enemies. The Queen with more success, win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
