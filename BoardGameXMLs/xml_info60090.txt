							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hotspots Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Hotspots is a, print and play card and dice game where the lone modern-day militant starts out with nothing but his worldview and sets out to eliminate opposing militants and control the small country. Hotspots is as much as a dice game as it is a cardgame, giving it the feel of a miniatures skirmish game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose a faction and win by taking out the enemy's firebase or completing 3 objectives before your opponent(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has a game mechanic that makes it suitable as a print-and-play game.  Instead of playing resource cards to bring a unit, or what would usually be represented by a rare card into play, a training die roll must be made according to the unit's value.  So there is no incentive to stock an unrealistic deck with all of the heavy stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, it is not good enough just to build the most powerful military force during the Hotspots Card Game, because you may yet be foiled if you don't protect yourself from your opponent's clandestine activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See the rules for instructions on you can produce this game at home on the cheap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that there is also a Hotspots Board Game, which was created by the same designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
