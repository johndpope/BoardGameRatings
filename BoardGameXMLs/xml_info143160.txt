							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GODS: Intervention</name>
									
			<description>GODS: Intervention is a fast strategic tile placement game set in the early years of human civilization. Players represent gods that influence the civilizations by granting them skills they may use to develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GODS does not use any board. It is played directly on any table. In each players turn they choose to pick and place one of the five different tiles available; a temple or one of the skills; Architecture, Conflict, Culture or Trade. Temples represent a headquarter for your devotees and may be placed anywhere on the table except in a civilization you already have a temple or next to another temple. Skills must be placed adjacent and orthogonal to another tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing a skill activates the surrounding and adjacent tiles. Choose between using their effects or to collect points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game uses a set amount of each tile and as soon as one of the different tiles are run out the game ends. At that time the player with most points of the skill they have least of wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GODS is a brain burner. Players needs to be strategic while it is extremely difficult to predict the other players moves. A conflict may arise to destroy en entire civilization or through trade a civilization may loose much of its competence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
