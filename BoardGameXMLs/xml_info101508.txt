			<description>Disgaea Infinite is a visual novel for the PlayStation Portable that was released on the 1st November of 2009 in Japan, the 8th June of 2010 in North America and the 17th November of 2010 in Europe. The game is part of the Disgaea series, using the same setting and characters as Disgaea: Hour of Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses interactive elements, including a magic clock called &amp;quot;Tick Tock&amp;quot; that allows the Prinny to possess other characters' bodies in order to solve the mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is tasked with altering history by averting the 'assassination' of Laharl by an unknown assailant, which also averts his and all other Prinny's from losing their salaries. By utilizing the 'tick-tock' device the player follows the complex interactions of various characters from the Disgaea series and can use 'mind control' to change specific choices they make, thus changing the way certain interactions take place, and eventually what endings are viewed. There are 14 endings total. The 14th is viewed after viewing all the other endings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 'Time Table' is provided to aid the player in tracking the complex paths of characters over time and place, and the changes that are available to be made to the time-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgaea_Infinite,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgaea_Infinite,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
