			<description>The game consists of 135 cards with 405 words on it, with corresponding movie, book and song titles as well as clues.&lt;br/&gt;During each turn, a player draw a card and read the first word. All other players immediately and simultaneously propose titles containing the given word. They gain 1 point for any existing titles and 2 points if the title is on the card.&lt;br/&gt;The reader can use the clues if other players got stuck. When all the titles has been found, he proceeds with the 2 other words on the card.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points wins the card and become the new reader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
