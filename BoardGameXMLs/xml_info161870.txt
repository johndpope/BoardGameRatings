							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flying Kung-Fu Frogs</name>
									
			<description>In the game Flying Kung-Fu Frogs, players try to launch their colored frogs onto the game base's spinning platforms to score points. Each platform is worth a different point value from 10 to 40 points. If you land on a gray base or get stuck on a branch, you score no points. If your frog lands on the table or anywhere besides the game base, pick it up and try again. To launch a frog, press down on its rear to fling it forward. As your finger slips off, the frog should jump toward the platforms. Once all frogs are somewhere on the game base, the game ends. Count up your points, and the player with the most points wins. This game is for two to four players. It comes with a Kung Fu Training Center game base, 20 frogs (five of each color), and a sticker sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
