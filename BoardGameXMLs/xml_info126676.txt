			<description>Did you know that Australia gave the world latex gloves, refrigerators and the world&amp;rsquo;s first feature film? Do you also know that this country is the only one to cover an entire continent? BrainBox has gone down under for this version of BrainBox Australia. 53 playing cards illustrate the history, sport, people, inventions and wildlife of one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most fascinating countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die.  If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple concept can be played by all ages and in large groups as well as a 1 person game. Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material and designed in the UK, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun.  Find out who the BrainBox is in your family &amp;ndash; it may not be who you think it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players 1 or more,&lt;br/&gt;Ages 8 to 88,&lt;br/&gt;Contains 53 illustrated cards, 1 rules card, 1 timer and 1 eight-sided die,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
