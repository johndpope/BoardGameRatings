			<description>WWF Betrayal is a beat 'em up on the Game Boy Color based on the World Wrestling Federation. It was the third and last WWF game released to the Game Boy Color and one of a few games based on the promotion that was of a different genre than the regular professional wrestling games usually produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's plot was roughly based on a storyline in 1999 where Stephanie McMahon gets kidnapped. Her father Vince McMahon promises to grant the player a shot at the WWF Championship if they manage to save her. The player must then fight through a series of side-scrolling levels to rescue Stephanie. The player can play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, or The Undertaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was criticized for its gameplay due to the fact each character had a limited moveset of punches, kicks and their finishing maneuvers. It was also panned for its lack of creative enemies consisting of referees, backstage staff and the three other main characters the player did not choose as bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WWF Betrayal&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
