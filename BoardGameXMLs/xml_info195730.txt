			<description>Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amazing Discoveries In Outer Space (ADIOS) is an odyssey through the galaxy where physics-based space-flight and platforming action blend seamlessly together. Explore a colorful universe filled with amazing discoveries, alien races, and fashionable hats. Unfortunately, your only company is ZING, a navigation computer with no memory of your whereabouts and a slightly faulty social circuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early prototypes of ADIOS started out as a-game-where-you-can-land-on-planets back when we hadn't really seen seamless transitions from space to planet surfaces since Elite: First Encounters. Determined that even 2D-games could treat space seriously, work began creating an engine and prototyping gameplay. In 2013 Cosmic Picnic was founded in order to make Amazing Discoveries In Outer Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay built around exploration and physics&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive physical simulation of entire solar systems including gravity, temperature and atmospheric air resistance&lt;br/&gt;Find new ships, astronauts, gadgets, powerups and amazing discoveries&lt;br/&gt;Hand-drawn art and handcrafted game engine&lt;br/&gt;Procedurally generated solar systems, each with a plethora of planets, asteroids, alien species and strange artifacts&lt;br/&gt;Roguelike elements&lt;br/&gt;No weapons or killing (horrible accidents may occur)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
