			<description>This bowling game comes with a bowling alley that measures 25&amp;rdquo; long by 6&amp;rdquo; wide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It works by having a bowling figure that can be moved from side to side to aim your shot.  The ten pins are set in the location holes and when they are all in place you push the locater into the down position. This lifts the locater set up and gets the lane ready for a frame.  You then push your bowling figures' arm back to lock him in position and place your ball in the groove. When you are ready press the button to release the bowlers arm and bowl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Afterwards the ball return dispenser will return the ball back to the bowler When the ball gets back to you, you press a button and the ball pops up ready to use again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes score sheets so you can keep score&lt;br/&gt;The bowling alley measures 25&amp;rdquo; long and 6&amp;rdquo; wide&lt;br/&gt;comes in a display box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
