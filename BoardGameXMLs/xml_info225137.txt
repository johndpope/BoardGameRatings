			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friendly Farmers was created as an entry in the 2016 Children's Game PnP Design competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friendly Farmers is a worker placement game. Each turn players assign the workers on their farm different tasks depending upon the weather and other factors influencing crop management. When crops are harvested they can be sold immediately or stockpiled for sale at a later stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game market prices are fixed and there is always a fully available labour pool.  In the advanced game the size of the labour pool and the value of each crop's market prices are subject to variation each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players race to grow and sell their crops and be the first to reach 50 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
