							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Cost of Caring</name>
									
			<description>The Cost of Caring Game for 2-6 players is played on a 23&amp;quot; x 23&amp;quot; quad-fold playing board with players advancing their own pawn by die roll along the 121 spaces (there is one short cut that saves 7 spaces) until all eligible pawns reach &amp;quot;the party.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player must draw a Care Card when landing on a Care Station.  There are 60 different Care Cards, each describing the player meeting with a hypothetical person in some type of need.  Each Care Card gives a player two choices: to hurry on to the party, or to go instead to a Cost Station, where the player randomly chooses one of two Cost Cards written specifically for the situation described on that Care Card.  The Cost Card describes the player's resulting caring response and whether it gains the player a Meaning Card and whether it costs the player a Time Token.  When all 6 of a player's Time Tokens are gone, the player is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 50 different Meaning Cards (plus 5 blank cards) each with a short meaningful statement, such as &amp;quot;care without cost would be worthless.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game ends when all players [who still have Time Tokens] reach the party&amp;hellip;.  The object is to arrive at the party with the most meaning cards and be declared 'SAINT'.&amp;quot;  There can be only one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
