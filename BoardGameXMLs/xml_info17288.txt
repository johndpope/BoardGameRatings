			<description>From the Rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game of Exploration is a realistic model of the daily events and excitement in an Oil &amp;amp; Gas Exploration Department&lt;br/&gt;Players will instantly find themselves making decisions regarding where to drill, where to run seismic surveys, and how much to bid for prospective land parcels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components include the Drilling Tool (a plastic oil rig with a long pin), the Seismic Tool (a plastic box with iron filings), money, player's score sheets, 4 different-colored Land Owner markers, colored pins to mark drilled wells (White= Dry, Yellow= Average, Red= Super Producers, Black= Wildcat), Crown Land Sale markers, Hazard cards, Windfall cards, and a gameboard with movable multi-stepped, multi-sized Oil Reservoirs placed inside (with magnets embedded in some of the 'super' producing regions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
