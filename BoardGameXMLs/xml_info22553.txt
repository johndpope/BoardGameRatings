			<description>This is one of the games in the Tiny Tins line of games by Patch Products.  Players take turns drawing a card from a central deck.  If this card is a butterfly, you take the matching butterfly and place it on your plower.  If the card is a caterpillar, you do nothing.  If you draw the moth card, you take the moth (even from another player) and place it on your flower.  The winner is the first player to have five butterflies on their flower and not have the moth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
