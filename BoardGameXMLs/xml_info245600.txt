			<description>Scientia is a tactical game for 2~4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will compete to develop in 4 different scientific field (physics, chemistry, biology and astronomy)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 different cards from each field and each card has two different side so that there are 24 effects for a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, player can choose one of two options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Take a card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a card and place it in front of his personal board as long as it does not exceed its slot limit. There are 2 slots at the beginning of the game and it can be added during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Rotate 2 times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player can do the rotating action. He can rotate one card twice (180 degree) or two cards once (90 degree each)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a card fully rotated (360 degree), that card is moved to completion area. As soon as a card moved to the completion area, do this process&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 : Advance the research marker of that card's field.&lt;br/&gt;2 : If research marker reached rightmost space of a track, take the score tile.&lt;br/&gt;3 : Apply the card's effect&lt;br/&gt;4 : Put the card back in the center's appropriate position. If that position is empty, flip it before placing it. (New effect available)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends if all flasks (cubes) run out or all score tiles run out. Then calculate various scoring factors (cube, research marker, fields, score markers etc) All cards are always visible to all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
