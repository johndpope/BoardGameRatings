			<description>The object of Hokie Football is to score more points than your opponents while getting rid of all cards in your hand.  Cards represent the yard lines on an American football field, and players can score points by playing touchdowns and getting rid of cards.  Each hand ends when one player is out of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start at mid field and move towards the end zones by playing one card per turn.  If a player cannot play a card from their hand, they put points in a pot, and the person who goes out of cards at the end of the round gets all of the points in the pot.  Playing touchdown cards scores for the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points after multiple hands wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
