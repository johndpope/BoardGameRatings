							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Mata Hari</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;The Mata Hari class is named after the infamous actress, courtesan, and secret operative who operated during World War I. The historical Mata Hari was a Frenchwoman who used her sex appeal to gain access to numerous diplomats, generals, and politicians across several nations, only to reveal their secrets to her German paymasters. The d20 Pulp Mata Hari is the evil counterpart to the Seductress class, an accomplished, amoral female spy, saboteur, and (when necessary) assassin who serves as beautiful but deadly nemesis for both male and female pulp heroes. Her most lethal assets are her charm, class, and beauty-closely followed by her expertise with knives and poisons. This 6 page PDF is an easy-to-integrate PC class and just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern Neo-Pulp setting and campaign world including Haven: City of Bronze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
