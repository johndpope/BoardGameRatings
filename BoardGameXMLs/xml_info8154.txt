			<description>A game where the object is to takes the best pictures of fish in 5 different locations before your air supply runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you deduct the air consumption for the turn (the lower you are, the more you lose), move the fish, move your guide piece, and your beginner piece. If you move your beginner piece onto one of the 5 fish pieces, you can take a photograph. There is a pile of cards for each of the 5 fish pieces. A good shot is worth more than a blurry shot. You can take more than one picture of the same fish over different turns, but only get to count the best shot for each of the 5 pieces for determining your score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is usually barely enough time to take pictures of all 5 pieces if you just take one shot of each, but sometimes there's not even that much time. It is usually easier to try to take a 2nd or 3rd picture of the same piece, but of course you then won't have time to get pictures of all 5 types of pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth in Grapac Japan's series of games under the label &amp;quot;Aeronaut&amp;quot;. They are meant to be very fast playing (around 15-30 minutes). They all come in a file-type holder, with the inside of the file being the game board, and all of the components attached to the ring-binder in bags and pouches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
