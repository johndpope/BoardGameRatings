			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clerics around the city have been losing their holy symbols for the last few weeks, and various relics and worship implements have gone missing from some temples. A group of rogues and clerics in service to the Trickster God have been pulling the majority of the heists. They have their systems and escape routes completely mapped out. Their next targets are the PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the jumble of small buildings on the western arm of Drac&amp;rsquo;s End near the merchant district, worshipers of the Trickster God steal the party&amp;rsquo;s cleric&amp;rsquo;s holy symbol. The worshipers are Resseka (a female human cleric/rogue), Harcourt (a male halfling rogue), Claret (a female gnome cleric), and Chemb (a male human cleric/fighter/rogue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the party has no cleric, then poor Brother Egil happens to be along with the party, and the Trickster clerics steal his symbol while he&amp;rsquo;s with the party. The thieves then lead the party on a merry, somewhat dangerous, chase across the rooftops. The chase leads into the temple district, where the thieves disappear down the belfry of an abandoned temple of the God of Retribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
