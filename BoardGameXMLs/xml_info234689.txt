			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;October 25th, 1415 Artois, France&lt;br/&gt;The woods were still and full of mist.  Silent hills stood watch.  A muddy field waited for the battle to begin.  Near the small village of Agincourt, two armies faced each other in the chill of the early morning.  Archers, Footmen, Scouts, and Cavalry ordered themselves for battle.  The land was the prize that was sought.  The cost must be paid in blood.  Welcome to the Fields of Agincourt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agincourt is a combative tile-placement game for 2-5 players.  The map will form as the game is played, with each player fighting for position for the final battle.  The goal of the game is to defeat your enemies and claim the most victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Fields of Agincourt consists of two game stages:  &lt;br/&gt;Marshalling the Troops:  Players take turns placing tiles, recruiting troops, and claiming Bastions.  Once all the tiles are placed, the Final Battle will begin.&lt;br/&gt;The Final Battle:  Players are vying for superior battle positions within Bastions.  Contested Bastions are resolved one at a time, with the winning player receiving victory points.  The player with the most victory points will win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
