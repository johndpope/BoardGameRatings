			<description>Zahlen-Mobile consists of a set of cards showing &amp;quot;dice mobiles&amp;quot;. These consist of a main bar with two additional bars attached. From each of those two bars, two dice hang down, with each of the four dice having a different color. The bars are either straight or slanted left or right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a set of dice (one in each color) and a dice cup. Players reveal one card, then simultaneously roll their dice, trying to roll results that would fit the current mobile card. (If all three bars are straight, that would be four of the same number; if the two lower bars are straight, but the top one is slanted to the right, then the two dice hanging from the right side must be higher than the two on the left.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to roll a &amp;quot;solution&amp;quot; that fits the card gets the card (in a two-player game). With more players, the first player gets two cards and the second one gets one card. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
