			<description>The object of this business game is to become the wealthiest player through buying and operating hotel properties. This unique title was published by the Holiday Inn corporation... the good hotels have the Holiday Inn logo but the bad inns are called The Heartbreak Hotel!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around a board similar to Monopoly by rolling dice and then use a spinner to determine if the hotel will be a good Holiday Inn or a stinker. Players can upgrade a hotel by adding recreational facilities or a convention center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board includes cities in the USA, Asia, and Europe. The players buy and sell hotels while paying rent on an opponent's property. The last player with any cash is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a colorful board, tokens, spinner, rules, play money, dice, hotel logo markers, and property cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
