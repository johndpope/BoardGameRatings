It is what all the boxes is a risk for places at the bottom of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rebuff&lt;br/&gt;There are additional elements of risk in the game on the board are a number rebuff-boxes; you'll go to such it is revealed that you studied for a bit. You will then get back as much as it is in the box and attempt to catch up from when it's your turn next time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will win?&lt;br/&gt;After all the risks and chances are you or any of the players until Mon / box.
