			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactic was originally released for the Acorn Archimedes by Eterna Software. It was converted to the BBC Micro series of computers in 1993 by Andrew Pepperell and released by Superior Software as part of its Play It Again Sam 17 compilation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to Tetris or Columns in that objects fall from the top of the screen. In this game these are either circles or squares of different colours. The player can move them left or right as they move down the screen before resting at the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the bottom of the screen are a series of target shapes. For example it could show three objects on top of each other, or five in a cross pattern, etc. The object of the game is to pile up shapes of the same type and colour in the patterns shown. To clear a level, the player must match the correct number of patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the BBC version, there is a simultaneous two player option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
