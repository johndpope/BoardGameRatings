			<description>Your guild of Sages will go to pilgrimage. You will travel through the windswept steppes. You will climb the rocky cliffs and wade through a thicket of dense forests. You will meet with mythical creatures and even the gods themselves. Your task is to collect Books of Wisdom before the cycle ends. At this time all the gods, who were guiding all living things for many centuries, will leave. The Guild with the most Books of Sun, the highest among these books, will take their place and become the ruler of the known world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the course of Fabled, players reveal new area cards &amp;ndash; Steppe, Mountains and Forests &amp;mdash; and place them in the Lands of Discovery, a continuous row of area cards. Then players put their sages on the paths of the newly discovered areas. Sages travel along the paths and visit fabled places. Those places grant them advantages and rewards, like Books of Wisdom, and many other. Areas form a continuous row, so sages are able to travel from one area to another, if the paths match. When there are no sages on an area card, it is discarded to the Mokosh Yarn. The game ends, when there is a certain number of areas in the Mokosh Yarn, depending on how many players are participating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highest among the books is Book of Sun. The player who has the most Books of Sun at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fabled is inspired by true Slavic mythology. Each of the Allies is based on a real historical character with a huge background. Veles and Gamayun, Perun and Semargl, Koschei the Deathless and Baba Yaga, Kikimora and Bayun-Cat, and many other come to life here... again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
