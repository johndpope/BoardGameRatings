			<description>Star Trek: Bridge Commander is a space combat simulation game for the PC, published by Activision  and Totally Games in 2002, based in the Star Trek universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot revolves around a newly promoted captain who is assigned to investigate an explosion of a star in the Maelstrom. Throughout the mystery, the player will often encounter characters from the Star Trek universe, including Captain Picard and Commander Data. The captain and his crew take command of the USS Dauntless (NCC-71879) as well as the USS Sovereign (NCC-73811) to combat a new threat to the Federation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game allows two different styles of gameplay: storyline mode and quick battle mode. Quick battle mode allows for customized scenarios within a &amp;quot;simulated&amp;quot; environment, allowing the player to pick their allies/enemies, system, etc. With the advent of modding for Star Trek: Bridge Commander, custom missions and even campaigns have been made possible through this engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star Trek: Bridge Commander,&amp;quot; available under the  CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
