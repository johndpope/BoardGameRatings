			<description>NCAA Football 2001, released only for the PlayStation, featured University of Alabama running back Shaun Alexander on the cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version included Create-a-player, Create-a-school, Custom League (up to eight teams, double round-robin, plus playoff), Custom Tournament (up to 16 teams, double elimination), and fully customizable Season/Dynasty schedules (which allowed players to violate conference obligations in rescheduling opponents). This was also the final installment which allowed a playoff at the end of the season in dynasty mode (24 teams).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NCAA Football series,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
