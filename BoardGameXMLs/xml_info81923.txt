			<description>Softcover book with rules for science fiction tabletop encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No dice are ever used with these rules. The approach is that each weapon or tested action has what's called &amp;quot;The Solution&amp;quot;. The Solution is a range of numbers from which each player chooses one of those numbers and writes it down on a piece of paper. In order to be successful, the attacking (or testing) player must match the defending player's choice for that Solution. So, for example, if a Solution is listed at 4, each player chooses either a 1, 2, 3, or 4 for that Solution. If player A chooses 2, player B must also choose 2 in order to succeed. If he instead chooses 1, 3, or 4 the test fails. Better characters will have lower solutions (1 or 2) and worse characters can have solutions ranging as high as 8 or 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
