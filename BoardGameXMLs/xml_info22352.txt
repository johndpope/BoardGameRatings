			<description>Ghetto (possibly also called &amp;quot;Smelina&amp;quot;) was a Monopoly variant set in the Terezin (Theresianstadt) Ghetto in what is now the Czech Republic. The game was designed in 1943 by Oswald P&amp;ouml;ck, an engineer who was confined in the Ghetto at that time. P&amp;ouml;ck produced the game for children who were confined in Terezin, and the game was passed from one child to another as they were taken from Terezin to the death camps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two copies of the game are known to exist: one at the Yad Vashem holocaust museum and another at the Beit Terezin museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
