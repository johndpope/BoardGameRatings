			<description>Be Legend: Ragnarok is a programing combat system based on legends, myths and other works of fiction and nonfiction. This  set is based on the Norse mythology and has some of the known favorites such as Odin, Loki and of course Thor.

With a total of 8 playable and customizable characters to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have a deck basic abilities, which will be identical to the others. Each player, depending on who they picked to be their legend, will add two unique cards to their deck. Out of this deck you will pick only six to use during the game. So chose wisely. All players will use these cards to move around the board, capturing emblems from each player, first to do so wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to move around the board each play will also have a deck of movement cards number 1-6 these are one time use. Also two direction cards that are reusable clockwise and counter clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During turns everyone at the same time will be playing one ability card, one movement card and a direction. Once all players have locked in their cards played them face down.Players will all reveal just the ability cards some cards are faster, some negate while some do really awesome things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the cards are revealed plays in turn order or priority will move and activate their abilities. You can land on a person's realm and take their emblem. You can also land on them knocking them out and take choice of emblem or use unique ability cards to extend your range of attack or manipulate emblems or decks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
