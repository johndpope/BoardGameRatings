			<description>Bring her home alive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bandits have kidnapped the eldest child of one of Timbertown&amp;rsquo;s prominent citizens, who is secretly being manipulated by shadowy forces. You are  tasked to get her back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there are questions. Is she his real daughter? Does she want to be found? Who is behind the kidnapping in the first place?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you bring Evi home alive, your rewards will be great, and your standing in the town will increase. But if you fail, or if the demon worshippers of the Fraternity of Tharos gain a further foothold for their secret society, Timbertown's future may be in jeopardy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An 4-6 hour adventure for 4-6 characters of level 3-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
