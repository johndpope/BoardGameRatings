			<description>This is a psychology-themed card game for 2 to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, each player is dealt two Need cards visible to everyone, a Motivation card visible only to the player, and a hand of six cards containing a mixture of Fulfilment and Action cards. The Need cards specify quantities of Fulfilment points you have to collect in order to satisfy your Needs. However, the Motivation card gives your objective for the game. You could be a Dominator, seeking to fulfil your own Needs whilst ensuring other players' Needs are not met. You could be an Idealist, trying to make sure everyone's Needs are fulfilled. You could be a Victim, making sure that everyone's needs are satisfied except yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 different Motivations, each with a game goal with different levels of difficulty and worth different scores. If you achieve your Motivation and you have an &amp;quot;End game&amp;quot; card, you can claim the points. But beware! It's possible that more than one Motivation can be achieved simultaneously, so another player may claim points too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fulfilment cards allow you to satisfy your Needs or the Needs of other players. The Action cards allow players to manipulate the distribution of Fulfilment cards, moving or discarding Fulfilment or even forcing players to change their Motivation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
