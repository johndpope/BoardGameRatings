			<description>D2 (Ｄの食卓2, Dī no Shokutaku Tsū?) is a 1999 survival horror video game developed by WARP and published by Sega in Japan and the United States for Dreamcast. D2 is a sequel to D and the final game starring Laura Harris. The game is written and directed by Kenji Eno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game opens with Laura Harris falling asleep on an airplane trip to an undisclosed location. Suddenly, a group of terrorists violently take control of the plane and seem to be guided by some kind of mysterious cultist who is chanting to himself. A policeman on board the plane attempts to stop the terrorists, but he is thwarted when a meteorite strikes the plane, sending it crashing into the Canadian wilderness. After lengthy bad dreams, Laura awakens in a small cabin being cared for by another woman who also survived the crash. She explains that Laura has been unconscious for two days and during that time, a handful of survivors of the plane crash have been exploring this region of the snowbound forest in an attempt to find a way to be rescued. Laura herself sets out into the wilderness in order to investigate the possibility of contacting the outside world only to discover that strange, hideous creatures are lurking in the forests. Something is having an effect on the crash survivors which is eventually turning them insane and into the very same monsters she must avoid and battle while travelling through the forests. Laura is driven deeper into the mystery when she must venture further into the isolated wilderness in order to locate a lost little girl, one of the plane's former passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;D2 (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
