			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awesome Powers is a supplement for the BASH! Ultimate Edition RPG. Inside, you will find new Powers, new Enhancements, new Limitations, and new ideas to incorporate into your BASH! campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiefly, this product is designed to allow you to create characters with themes, making use of pre-designed powers.  You can use these powers for inspiration, or you can even create your character by rolling for powers at random. As the Awesome Powers library grows, so will the list of available powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volume 3 of Awesome Powers deals with powers of a Spatial nature. There are dozens of powers for the Phasing and Teleport Suites here. Awesome Powers Vol. 3 also introduces the concept of &amp;quot;Facets&amp;quot; which are foci within a Suite.  The Teleportation Suite is contains a Teleport, Gateway, and Spatial powers Facet, each which allow their users to manipulate space in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find all new Limitations and Enhancements (like Tactical Shunt and Fluke), entirely new Advantages and Disadvantages (like Pocket Dimension and Cosmic Conscript), how to create your own Powers, and Random Character Creation!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the powers presented here explains how to replicate the power described as closely as possible using the existing BASH! Ultimate Edition rules.  In this third volume of Awesome Powers, we present to your two themes, or Power Suites, each based on a different spatial trope. The Phasing Power Suite allows you to move through objects while occupying the same space, while the Teleportation Suite allows you to move through space instantaneously, or possibly bend and warp space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
