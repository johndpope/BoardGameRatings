			<description>Ta(ble) Ku(bb) is a table version of the outdoor game Kubb also known as Viking Chess. Ta-Ku is played with dice and small wooden blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst in the traditional Kubb you score by knocking down the wooden blocks of your opponent and finally the &amp;quot;king&amp;quot;, in Ta-Ku you throw, roll or flip dice at small wooden blocks. You win the game by counting the values of the dice which successfully knocked down an opponent's block AND stayed within the borders of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over three matches, the team or player with the highest score in the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
