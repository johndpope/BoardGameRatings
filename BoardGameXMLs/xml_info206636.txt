			<description>user translation from back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fabulous wealth and strange customs, spices and jewels in abundance. Proud aristocrats indulge in luxury and let themself be spoiled by velvet eyed beauties. Scruffy ascetics enjoy great reputation like erudite priests, and both look snooty down on the common people. But Rawindra is also a land of merciless struggles between humans and scaly monsters, fought with powerful magic and ancient sorcery. Since generations the Rawindi stand against the lizardfolk of the Sritras with its strange magic and habits, which worships dark gods in the depths of the jungle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rawindian culture is the legacy of the Lions sons, horsemen who also founded the trading city of Ulwar on the way the beads. Without the shackles of the caste system and laws that allow anything that doesn't disturb the circles of the rich and powerful, most Rawindi consider the city as a haven of immorality and chaos. That Ulwar with its wealth, its sword slaves and its fleet of corsairs is a serious threat to rawindian princes, also contributes to this disgust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Sourcebook describes the south western part of Sirao from the Island of Serendib to the Kirita Mountains. Besides the presentation the people and their culture, the book contains local weapons, skills and spells, important personalities and typical adventurers, a detailed bestiary and a coloured map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
