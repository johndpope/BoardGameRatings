			<description>From the introductory text:&lt;br/&gt;This instruction document contains quick guidelines for creating an adventure out of the materials provided. Follow each step below to create a short adventure in a small amount of time. If you are participating in this activity as a team, you will most likely have a limited amount of time (probably 1 hour) to create the adventure. If you divide up responsibilities and coordinate, you should be able to create 2 encounters' worth of play in that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;This was released on September 15th, 2009 at a Game Day event to promote the release of the Dungeon Masters Guide 2. Unlike most previous Game Day releases, A Passage into Mystery is not a completed adventure, but rather a toolkit to build your own short adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the kit for A Passage into Mystery are:&lt;br/&gt; - A large double-sided poster map showing two underground locations.&lt;br/&gt; - Five glossy full-colour character cards (Glorinus, Holkarn, Naivara, Tower and Xandross). These are abbreviated character sheets, roughly half a page in size, printed on both sides.&lt;br/&gt; - Six pages of printed instructions/notes which are corner stapled. These pages include the instructions, half a page of adventure workspace, a one page worksheet for each of the two encounters, and two pages of monster cards which can be cut out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
