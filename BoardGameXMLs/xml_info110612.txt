							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Living Constructs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golems make excellent servants, tireless, tough and obedient, but they lack that spark of life and adaptability that free thinking people have. Some have tried to instil their creations with some imitation of the free though, the soul, that &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; people have with varying degrees of success and sometimes spectacular failure. When a slave has the ability to recognise that it is a slave it chafes against that control and seeks to free itself from it. Some of those constructs have managed to win their freedom through violence, labour, the death of their creator or their largesse and these constructs have gained true freedom, true self determination and true souls, becoming complete. Now these freed slaves form an ever growing community of liberated beings and they are learning to make more of themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living Constructs provides the opportunity to play self-determining devices, golems and constructs in D&amp;amp;D4E campaigns and game worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
