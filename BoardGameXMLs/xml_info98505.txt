			<description>From the rules: A deck of 72 cards plus 3 scoring cards and 1 title card. Each card has a letter printed on it (each letter of the alphabet on two cards). The game plays similar to rummy; draw a card from the deck or discarded cards, lay down cards to form a word and discard one card. Each round finishes when the first player plays his last card and then the scores are added up. Game ends when someone has 1000 points (or 100 in the children's variant).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
