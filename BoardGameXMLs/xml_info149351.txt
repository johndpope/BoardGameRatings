			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old man sits next to you on the rock outcropping, looking down at the odd three-legged villagers below. He takes a swig of his water and offers it to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;They were normal Yaz&amp;rsquo;s once. Two legs, wingy things, hair and all. Now look at &amp;lsquo;em.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You take a drink and consider your words carefully. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not their fault.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old man takes the waterskin back and puts it on his pack. He checks his bio-scanner again, looking down at the children playing a ball and stick game in the dirty village road. He snarls his disgust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;They chose to live here when they knew that sathar ship was leaking rads like a geyser. They&amp;rsquo;re stupid, got what they deserve if ya ask me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You hate that he said that, you really do. Despite all he&amp;rsquo;s done, you&amp;rsquo;ve known him a long time and you honestly like him. But you are not going to let him use that rifle he&amp;rsquo;s pulling off his shoulder. You&amp;rsquo;re not going to let him snipe those kids just because he hates mutants...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Especially when you&amp;rsquo;re one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You release that power you keep within, that force that eats life from those around you and feeds it to you. You can&amp;rsquo;t explain it, but you were born with it. You&amp;rsquo;ve kept it hidden from him for years, and today you use it to drain the few years he had left. He gurgles and gasps as he drops to the ground. Vegetation withers and dies in a large radius, blackened and dry. You feel vigorous but sad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry you had to say that, and I&amp;rsquo;ll miss you, old friend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamma Dawn is a supplement for the Alpha Dawn rules of the STAR FRONTIERS game. It melds mutant rules from various sources with radiation rules and equipment from [Zebulon&amp;rsquo;s Guide] to the Frontier. It is an optional sourcebook designed to add depth and detail to an already amazing Frontier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
