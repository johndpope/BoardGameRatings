			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lance has been deployed to the farming community of Sumner, the village is in the path of a Rephaim offensive and the Church has decided it would be in its best interest, and would be great PR, if the populace was evacuated and taken to a safe zone. As such, a well-armed convoy has been deployed to the town, along with a camera crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presence of the Church camera crew assures that the Knights have to treat the populace with kid gloves, since footage of the Knights dragging people out of their homes and forcing them onto transports isn&amp;rsquo;t likely to go over well (nor is it likely to hit the air waves, but don&amp;rsquo;t let the players know that. Let them sweat the news team&amp;rsquo;s presence and see what it does to them).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sumner&amp;rsquo;s village center consists of about two dozen buildings, including a church, general store and other amenities. It&amp;rsquo;s laid out in a simple square pattern with well-defined, but unpaved, streets. The major road through town cuts in from the west and continues eastward, the convoy is heading eastward further into church-controlled territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
