			<description>Subtitle: A Player's Guide to H&amp;acirc;rnWorld&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mechanics-free overview of the H&amp;acirc;rn setting, intended as a quick reference for players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction: &lt;br/&gt;H&amp;acirc;rnPlayer is comprised of three parts. The first part, H&amp;acirc;rnview, is an overview of the geography, politics, economics, law, religion, and history of H&amp;acirc;rn. The second part is a Book of Common Knowledge, which covers the H&amp;acirc;rnic legends and folklore known to most folk. the third part is a players' H&amp;acirc;rnic Dictionary,l a comprehensive alphabetical reference which players can use to look things up on an ongoing basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information provided is more than a typical player probably would know, but nothing that one should not know. No matter how much reading is done, players will still be ignorant of much that a medieval person would take for granted. A bit of extra knowledge of the world compensates in a small way and makes the game more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
