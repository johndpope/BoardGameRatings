			<description>In this brand new expansion by Dirk Henn players are given more choices to build the building they most desire through the construction sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game 8 construction site tiles are mixed in with the rest of the buildings. They only show a number and the construction symbol. If one of these tiles shows up at the building market, players can buy it with the corresponding money as normal. But instead of placing the construction site in their Alhambra they can choose a building from a display of buildings that is set-up at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The display has 4 columns each holding 3 randomly drawn buildings. From which column the player can choose, depends on the value shown on the construction site purchased. Each column is dedicated to one of the values. This gives the player more freedom and maybe give you that one building you need to win at a scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 8 building ground tiles, 12 construction tiles, and 4 number chips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
