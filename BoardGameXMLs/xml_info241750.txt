			<description>As a Roman Trader, it's your job to ensure you have the best and most prestigious collection of goods available for purchase...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roman Trader is a straight set-collecting card game with a couple of novel twists, not least of which is the fact that the goods you're trying to collect are 'open' to other players &amp;mdash; they may know what goods you appear to be collecting, but they won't know if you're putting together a specialist collection of varied goods from a particular country/principality!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to collect from the discard pile and effectively set the game going backwards is another twist, and there's also a selection of special cards available to buy that allow you to increase your Warehouse space (hand-size), Plunder goods from other players, Smuggle goods long thought lost into your warehouse, Increase your Market share of selected goods, or Invest in the collections of other players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
