			<description>Cards have a color word on it and a color on it, not generally the same. For example, the word &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; might be in red. Each person has a hand of such cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A card is revealed from a deck. A die is rolled and results in &amp;quot;WORD&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;COLOR&amp;quot;. The goal of the game is to be the first person to put down a correct card, where correct is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WORD: a card the color of the word of the revealed card. &lt;br/&gt;COLOR: a card with the word that is the color of the revealed card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if the card is a blue card with the word &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; and WORD is rolled, then you must play a red card from hand (not one that says red). If COLOR is rolled you must play a card with the word blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clear? Well, I suppose it isn't supposed to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things are spiced up by not being allowed to play if a card which describes itself is revealed (a red card saying &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; for example&amp;quot;), and by having a special &amp;quot;contra&amp;quot; call when you play the reverse card of the one shown (red card saying &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; is contra blue card saying red.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
