							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Campaign Module 1: Borderlands of Adventure</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years ago, the borderlands fell.  A horde of humanoids poured out of the wilderness and rampaged across the region, destroying fortifications, settlements and anyone that stood in its path.  The horde was eventually broken by armies from the settled lands, but the borderlands have remained unsettled.  Now, rumors have begun circulating of humanoids and bandits attacking travelers and merchants, raiding isolated farmsteads and small communities, and carrying captives and loot back to their lairs in the borderlands.  There are older tales, too, of ruins in the borderlands, mist-shrouded and monster-haunted, where treasure yet lies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your companions have gathered at a tavern in a nearby settlement, to plan an expedition into the borderlands.  The journey is sure to be fraught with peril.  Monsters and bands of marauders are said to roam the region.  And who knows what creatures and foul beings may have crept into the hills and dark forests since the area was overrun.  The dangers may be great, but wealth and glory await those brave enough to seek it out and bold enough to seize it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Borderlands of Adventure is a Campaign Module for Labyrinth Lord and similar classic fantasy adventure games.  Suitable for characters of 1st to 3rd level, the module includes Background, Rumors and Start sections, a wilderness adventure map, encounter tables, wilderness encounters, and ruins, caverns and dungeons, each mapped and keyed and waiting to come to life at your gaming table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
