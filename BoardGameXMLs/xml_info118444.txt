			<description>Wineology: The Extraordinary Wine Tasting Game&amp;quot; is a marketing/promotional board game released by E &amp;amp; J Gallo Winery, to promote their line of &amp;quot;Turning Leaf&amp;quot; wines. It is a wine-themed derivative of Trivial Pursuit and is similar to Trivial Pursuit in some respects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves tasting five varietals of &amp;quot;Turning Leaf&amp;quot; wines (Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Merlot, Zinfandel, and Cabernet Sauvignon) and answering specific questions about them. The players (or team of players) taste one wine at a time, in a specific order, and must correctly answer questions in four categories (Wine Senses, Food &amp;amp; Wine, Wine Making, &amp;amp; Wild Card) in order to move on to the next varietal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player (or team of players) to answer all four questions correctly in each of the five varietals is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
