			<description>Player 1: We've got a situation here, Colonel. Our embassy personnel in the Hyraxian capital city have been kidnapped by a rebel faction and are being held hostage. The local government can't do anything about it; the rebel influence on their ruling council is strong enough to veto any action. So you and your Rangers are going to take some action. You've got four C-130's and your ready-response battalion, and we can get you some flying air support if you think you need it. Load 'em up, move fast, rescue the hostages, and bring 'em home. If you can't fly them out, we'll set up a rendezvous in-country to get you out by choppers. Rangers, lead the way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player 2: Success! The American ambassador and his assistants will make excellent bargaining chips in our struggle. And the existing government can do nothing; our political operatives have seen to that. You, Major, must see to the safety of our &amp;quot;guests.&amp;quot; You can expect a rescue operation from the Americans -- they have a long history of meddling in our nation's affairs. Colonel LeMeow of our Intelligence section will take command of the prisoners tomorrow. Until then, guard them well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rangers! is a 2-player Expansion for the free wargame Gators! depicting a modern US Army Ranger airborne operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
