			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Laundry's Acquisition Section is responsible for storing physical artefacts that do not fit neatly into an envelope (such as the skull of a dragon or the weird non-Euclidean structures found in Madagascar or that weird ticking clock thing). It used to share space with the British Museum, but it got moved to its own warehouse in Hounslow years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as the items they do have, they also maintain a list of items they'd really quite like please. Items that probably shouldn't fall into the wrong hands. Think of it like an occult version of an Amazon wish list. These &amp;lsquo;Targets of Acquisition&amp;rsquo; are their current high priority list, made available to all active agents to keep an eye out for when in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targets of Acquisition is a PDF supplement for The Laundry RPG containing 9 in-world dossiers pertaining to an occult artefact that the Laundry has its eyes on &amp;ndash; perfect for handing to your players to start a session, or for providing inspiration for your own scenarios. The supplement is rounded off with Gamemaster&amp;rsquo;s notes, giving you ideas for how you might use the artefacts in your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
