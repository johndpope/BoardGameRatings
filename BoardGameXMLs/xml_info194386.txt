							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trivial Pursuit: Silver Anniversary Coffee Table Edition</name>
									
			<description>An update to the original Trivial Pursuit (1981).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the core of Trivial Pursuit is still found in the 25th Anniversary Edition, there are a few differences from the original board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original six categories are still used: Geography, Entertainment, History, Art &amp;amp; Literature, Science &amp;amp; Nature, Sport &amp;amp; Leisure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each category now has its own card, with six questions and three difficulty levels. &lt;br/&gt;What you roll determines the level of difficulty of the question. &lt;br/&gt;A roll of one or two results in an easy question, three or four a medium question, and five or six a hard question. &lt;br/&gt;Play in the middle of the board is just like the 1981 version where you roll the die move your scoring token that number of spaces and try to answer a question in an attempt to roll again or in a special case win a wedge of the corresponding color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 2500 new questions 3 Levels of play - now everyone can compete! Raised wood game-board with decorative feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is still to win all 6 wedges and answer one final question in the center of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biggest difference of this new version is the addition of an outside track which you move a 2nd playing piece of the same color around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get a question correct you get to move your pawn a certain number of spaces depending on the difficulty of the question answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your pawn lands in one of the four &amp;quot;specialty zones&amp;quot; you are granted a special power used either to help your chances to win the game or hurt your opponents.&lt;br/&gt; These zones are the Face-Off Zone, the Slow it Down Zone, The Easy Cheesy Zone, and Freebie Zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
