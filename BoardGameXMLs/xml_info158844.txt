							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Traps 2</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Deadly Dangers and Complex Contraptions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traps have long had room for improvement. What should be an exciting encounter that leaves players on the edge of their seats holding their breath and wondering if they&amp;rsquo;ll make it out alive instead winds up reduced to a few cursory rolls, and players either shrugging off the damage or feeling that they are being punished for not being paranoid about checking each and every hallway. There are ways to avoid this, of course, but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better to have some traps that are built specifically in order to be exciting and engaging encounters in and of themselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the mythic trap: these dastardly devices make use of mythic rules and mythic power to come alive in your game, in more ways than one. A mythic trap acts like a monster or NPC, taking turns in initiative order, and using (under the GM&amp;rsquo;s guidance) one or more of its devilish and hazardous components each round. They provide traps that are fun and engaging on several levels, and cannot be ignored in the same way that a simple pit trap or poison dart trap can be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes rules for mythic traps, which can be run easily in both mythic and non-mythic campaigns, and also provides three specific mythic traps to serve as examples. The chessboard trap is not only a maze of electrified tiles and hidden pit traps, but also pits players against magical statues representing chess pieces. Laugh as they try to fight their way past an army of pawns, dodge the sweeping rook juggernauts, and get blasted out of the air by beam-firing wizards. If chess isn&amp;rsquo;t your thing, the clockwork horrors trap features all number of means to die: whirling blades, gouts of flame, pits and pendulums, and crushing hammers. There is no safe place to hide, but clever players that learn the trap&amp;rsquo;s pattern may be able to avoid death long enough to find a way to disable it. Finally, the witch&amp;rsquo;s cauldron trap features a particularly dangerous cauldron, which not only serves as a summoning portal for hordes of imps and mephits, and produces a noxious fog, but can even animate and boil victims alive. The only way to stop it? Mixing in the right ingredients. But with numerous options to choose from, and each wrong guess making things worse, success is far from guaranteed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
