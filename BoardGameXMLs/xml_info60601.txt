							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Extension of Politics</name>
									
			<description>An Extension of Politics is as much about the political and social causes of a war as the war itself.  The game starts before fighting breaks out, and the players take the role of nations as they prepare for war (or fail to) and navigate the international and domestic events that lead to open hostilities.  Sets for different planned conflicts include World War I and the 1982 Falklands War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
