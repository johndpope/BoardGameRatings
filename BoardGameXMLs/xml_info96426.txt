			<description>Brouhaha is a chess variant played on on a slightly expanded 8X8 board with pairs of two additional pieces added to a standard array.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extra squares 'hang' off the edges of the board, with one on each corner and two in the middle files behind the king and queen. The extra squares which 'hang' off the corners of the standard 8x8 board are special; once the piece that occupies them moves off, they may never be entered again&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clerics, which should be very close in value to Rooks, start in the corner squares. The basic move is that of an ordinary Bishop, but with the additional ability to leap exactly two squares horizontally or vertically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two Scouts start behind the king and queen and are very close in value to Knights and Bishops. The scout may step one square horizontally or vertically, or leap exactly three squares horizontally or vertically. Also, a Scout that has not moved yet this game has the added ability to move (once) like a Knight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
