			<description>From the box front:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These wooden pieces are an early introduction to Dominoes. As players match roadways and vehicles their Thinking and Problem solving skills are stimulated with yet another dimension in discovery! The player who is able to properly place all of his or her pieces first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Domino Road is a wonderful addition to the discovery Toys Thinking and Problem solving Preschool line. Your child will first want to assemble his or her roadway like a puzzle. But DOMINO ROAD has a puzzling twist; preschoolers must match roadways and vehicles! This wonderful stimulating puzzle will capture their attention for hours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wooden tiles showing roads and 3-dimensional vehicles. most tile edges show 1/2 of a vehicle which matches up to other tiles' 1/2 vehicles when placed adjacent. Vehicles are in several colors and styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
