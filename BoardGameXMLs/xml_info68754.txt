			<description>&amp;quot;WET is an acrobatic shooter game, developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by Bethesda Softworks for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game stars a heroine named Rubi Malone voiced by actress Eliza Dushku.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WET is an action game that combines shooting and swordplay with stylish acrobatics and a mass of gore. The main character, Rubi, carries twin pistols (which appear to be revolvers, but hold a surprising amount of ammunition) and a sword (she can also carry dual shotguns, sub-machine guns, or crossbows), and can fire while jumping, sliding on her knees, seducing goons and running on walls. During these acrobatic actions, the game enters slow motion, and she will automatically aim at a second enemy, allowing the player to shoot at two enemies at once. She can also combine her attacks, such as wall running off a person or performing a sword uppercut while sliding. Racking up kills and collecting multiplier icons gains multipliers, which increase score and the rate at which Rubi regenerates health. Rubi can also regain health by finding bottles of whiskey. When activated, she takes a swig from the bottle, then throws the bottle into the air and shoots it. In some sections of the game, Rubi's face will get covered in blood and she will go into a murderous, berzerker-like rage. These sections are presented in noir style, with bold red, black and white visuals. Rubi's attacks become faster and stronger to fight against large numbers of enemies during these sections, and killing chains of enemies extends her psychotic fury. There are also motorway sections that feature shooting integrated with quick time events.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;WET_(video_game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
