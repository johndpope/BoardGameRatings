							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 1 – Fokker E.V</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fokker E.V was a German monoplane fighter aircraft designed by Reinhold Platz and built by Fokker-Flugzeugwerke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The E.V was the last Fokker design to become operational with the Luftstreitkr&amp;auml;fte, entering service in the last months of World War I. After several fatal accidents due to wing failures, the aircraft was modified and redesignated Fokker D.VIII, and it had the distinction of scoring the last aerial victory of the war. It was flown by famous aces such as Erich Lowenhardt, Theodor Osterkamp and Karl Sharon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory&amp;reg; Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
