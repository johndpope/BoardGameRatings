							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prisoners of Aphex</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prisoners of Aphex is a Dragonstar adventure for four characters of first level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is no secret that many drow despise the Empire and the subservience that many show toward it. A large group of these drow have established a base in the outlands, where they plot to destroy the credibility of the ISPD in an attempt to wean their people off their dependence on the Empire. This consortium is known as the Drak Syllan. They are building huge living spider ships called araknos to help them police their areas. In reality, this group is nothing but an organized crime unit utilizing their contacts, knowledge, and a ream of stolen equipment to cause trouble in the region. If they manage to breed the araknos, that may change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
