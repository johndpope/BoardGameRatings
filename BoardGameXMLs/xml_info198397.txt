			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Davae Breon Jaxon's Cinematic Environs begins a new series of supplements designed to help GMs paint vivid cinematic scenes for their players in a way that gives the environment its own unique character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These environs can take a mundane encounter or location and turn it into an epic scene that the players will be talking about for year to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This third in the series deals with Mountain Environs. It discusses the effects of altitude, falling, rock slides, cliffs and many other hazards that the characters will have to face if they are to reach the far side of the mountains in time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, instead of simply sending the party on an adventure to hunt down a villain, the GM can have their quarry flee into the mountains. Instead of bandits along the road, the party now has to be on the lookout for stone giants who will more than likely capture and enslave the party. Instead of guarding a caravan along a trade road, they end up leading them through the Venridge Pass to make up lost time. The stories of mountain trolls are probably not true anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a new character background, new equipment, new weapons and a new magic items related to this particular environ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
