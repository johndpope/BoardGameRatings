			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game covers a ten-year period in which the nations of Europe formulated and expanded the Long Range Transport Air Pollution Treaty (LRTAP). This treaty continues to be expanded and is a model for regional cooperation on environmental issues. However, the road to this treaty was not smooth. The game consists of three of the negotiating settings that represented critical junctures. The game begins in 1979 at the Geneva, Switzerland UNEC meeting. This meeting led to a treaty with no specific goals and no enforcement. It did provide money for research that showed the extent of the problem and provided the scientific data to support a stronger treaty. The second section of the game is the Helsinki, Finland meeting in 1984 at which binding limits were finally included in the treaty. The final session in Sophia, Bulgaria expanded the treaty beyond sulfur dioxide pollution and included nitrogen oxide pollution as well. The game is designed to include as many of the pressures and political forces at work in Europe at this time and will often lead to an outcome similar to the actual historical one. However, this is by no means guaranteed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
