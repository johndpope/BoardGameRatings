							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City of Demons</name>
									
			<description>A dark modern fantasy setting for use with the Game Engine Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modern world had forgotten about the old ways. Magic had slipped into the realm of myths and legend. Demons, devils, and other creatures of the night were just make-&lt;br/&gt;believe stories told to scare children into behaving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cities grew and the climate darkened. People became obsessed with things like their careers, their wallets, and other niceties in their lives.  They had forgotten so many&lt;br/&gt;of the simpler things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greed and power became dominant. The people became myopic. They became blinded to the very dangers they had been&lt;br/&gt;warned about as children. Then, it became suddenly and so frighteningly real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Had the world truly fallen into judgement? And was the world truly now unworthy to go on? City by city the world slips into the abyss. Only a brave and select few can stop&lt;br/&gt;the rising tide of darkness. Will it be enough?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
