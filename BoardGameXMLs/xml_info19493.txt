			<description>Expand your Federation &amp; Empire campaign with new ships, rules and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Raids strike into the heart of the enemy.  Battlegroups combine many small ships into powerful fleet elements.  Admirals increase command and control.  New Scouts give advanced warning of the threat.  Fast drones rip into the enemy.  Flagship escort groups protect the commanders.  Carrier groups expand to become impregnable squadrons.  Oversized fighter squadrons take attrition warfare to new levels of fury.&lt;br/&gt;     Bases can now be built at low cost without their fighters and patrol ships, which can be added later.  CVAs can 'cash in' fighters to become Space Control Ships.  new accounting for fighters, neutral zones, and dreadnoughts give increased flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;     X-ships can outfight anything on the map.  Casual PFs enhance combat power.  Fast warships, heavy war destroyers, penal ships, F111 carriers, and new dreadnoughts are just some of over a hundred new ship-types and special units.&lt;br/&gt;     Winds of Fire portrays the six deadly battles of the General War's turning point.&lt;br/&gt;     A complete 26-page Ship Information Table lists every ship in the game system!&lt;br/&gt;     864 counters portray the powerful new ships and devastating new units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
