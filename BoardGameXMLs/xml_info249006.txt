			<description>Game-of-6 is an abstract strategy game for two players that can be played on a grid paper sheet, using pens of two different colors. (it's an evolution of classic Connect6). Rules:&lt;br/&gt;1. The player that opens the game places one dot of his/her color in a cell. In all the following moves, each player places consecutevely two dots in any empty cell of the grid.&lt;br/&gt;2. A player that aligns (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) six (or more) of his/her dots wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;3. Each time a player completes a closed polygonal with his/her marks, all the internal cells take that color. A closed polygonal is any closed path connecting dots of the same color, each adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally to next one&lt;br/&gt;4. The grid cells, once colored, are blocked. They cannot change their color even when they are enclosed in a new polygonal of the opposite color and do not take part to any alignment of dots. If a move generates both a closed polygonal and a winning alignment, the latter is prevailing and the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;4.2. A player turn is made of two separate moves: if the first one closes a polygonal, the internal cells must be colored before the second move is performed.&lt;br/&gt;4.3. A player can always enlarge an existing polygonal by adding new dots &lt;br/&gt;5. A player that colors six (or more) cells wins the game. It's not necessary that the six cells are enclosed by the same polygonal: the winning number can be made adding up spatially separated colored cells.&lt;br/&gt;When the game is over, the winner gains six points and the loser one point for each cell he/she was able to color.&lt;br/&gt;A match is composed by six games, to be started alternately by the players. The winner of the match is the player with the most game victories, and in case of a tie, the one who scored the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
