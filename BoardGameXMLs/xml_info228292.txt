			<description>Based on Mochica culture history.&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a long path on which each player's pawn will move. The places on the path may contain a special card, that the player will draw.&lt;br/&gt;The pawns move along the path and may fight each other when they end up on the same square. The winner of the fight may steal a card at the other.&lt;br/&gt;The cards can be used to create shortcuts on the board for one self. Or to prevent others to go to the end of the path. They work in the same way as snakes &amp;amp; ladders work in the game of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;Some special cards allow removing opponent cards from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
