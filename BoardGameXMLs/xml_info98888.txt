			<description>Peter Pan and the Pirates is a video game for the NES published by THQ in 1991. It was based on the television animated series of the same name. The game is also known as, Fox's Peter Pan &amp;amp; The Pirates: The Revenge of Captain Hook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Hook has challenged Peter Pan to a duel, which will determine the fate of the enchanted world. In this single player side-scrolling game, you control Pan through several levels, each based on the television series of the same name, battling pirates and avoiding various traps until you reach the pirate ship for your battle with the evil Captain Hook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level has a certain number of pirates and other enemies that must be defeated before Pan can advance to the next level. Sometimes Wendy or others members of the Lost Boys will appear to offer you helpful bits of advice. Beyond that, Pan can collect fairy dust to fly, as well as treasure chests and Tinker Bell to restore lost health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes you can collect red balls to throw at enemies, but for the most part your primary weapon in the game is a short sword with a limited attack range.  The game has no continues or passwords, but you can earn extra lives during bonus levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Level 1: Forest&lt;br/&gt;    * Level 2: Green Cave&lt;br/&gt;    * Level 3: Forest&lt;br/&gt;    * Level 4: Blue Cave&lt;br/&gt;    * Level 5: Blue Forest&lt;br/&gt;    * Level 6: Red Cave&lt;br/&gt;    * Level 7: Pirate Ship&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the levels are actually repeats with slightly different colors being used, and at the end of each level you will see Captain Hook running back and forth, except in the final level where you have to get Hook to walk the plank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Peter Pan and the Pirates (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
