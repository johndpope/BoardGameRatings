			<description>Disney's Beauty and the Beast is a Super NES action game that is based on the 1991 Walt Disney film. The entire game is played through the perspective of the Beast. As the Beast, the player must get Belle to fall in love so that the curse cast upon him and his castle will be broken, she will marry him and become a princess. The final boss of the game is Gaston, a hunter who will try to steal Belle from the Beast. There is even a snowball fight scene in the middle of the game and cutscenes between stages that tells the story of Beauty and the Beast. In Japan, this game was referred to as Bijo to Yajuu (美女と野獣, &amp;quot;Beauty and the Beast&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Disney's Beauty and the Beast (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
