			<description>Publisher summary&lt;br/&gt;For five people, played inside a shopping mall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans died out a century ago &amp;ndash; all except one child put in cryosleep. Now that child has awoken and is in the care of androids programmed by the deceased parents to teach their child about the world in their absence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Judge Comments&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of LARPs that require you to go out into the real world and interact with things. The way you transform the environment of a real-world shopping mall into your play space to tell the story of a group of broken androids and the human child they are trying to teach is really fascinating. - Jason Cordova&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
