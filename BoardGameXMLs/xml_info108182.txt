							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">When Hot Chicks BLOW STUFF UP!</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOOM, BABY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, you need to blow stuff up.  Here we discuss the process in detail, from the history of explosive compounds (real and fictional) to the construction of explosive devices and what happens when you set them off.  When it's time to strike a decisive blow for the future and destiny of mankind, it might just be time to BLOW SOMETHING UP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not only are some of the most common (and less common) types of known explosives included, but we've thrown in a few alchemical, magical, alien, and High Tech explosives to keep things interesting.  You never know when you'll need explosives that generate psionic damage, or a bomb that will not only take out a building in bright green fire, but will make the resulting crater smell like pretty flowers (forever)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes rules for making and disarming bombs of all kinds, improvising explosives and including them (with caution and precision) in your Hot Chicks campaign.  Also includes new equipment, new Cyberware, new Magic Spells, and new Psionic Disciplines for making it easier to deal with explosives... or harder, depending on your point of view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are some NPCs to bring explosive nightmares into your game - the Demolition Thrall and the Plastique Golem.  Yes, it's a hundred pounds of Semtex that can walk up to you and ask for a hug!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a world where Aliens, Demons, and human greed are bearing down on you with the intent to turn you into food, product, or worse, sometimes you need to bring out a little somthing extra.... and that's When Hot Chicks BLOW STUFF UP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
