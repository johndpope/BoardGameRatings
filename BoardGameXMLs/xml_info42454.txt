			<description>Each player takes three pieces of the same colour and sits with an arm of the board in front of him or her, and in turn, spins the indicator and moves, starting from the end of one of the arms, as many spaces towards the end of the Opposite arm as he or she spin indicates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of each player is to get 3 pieces from their starting space to the similar space of his or hers opponent on the opposite side of the board.  There are three distinct rows of squares in each arm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who first gets three pieces across the board, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
