			<description>Where Men Become Myth - and Myths Become Men&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Gestalt&amp;quot; is Scott Bennie's unique world of superhuman archetypes. Superhero comic books contain worlds of Archetypes, individuals who represent important symbols. They are populated by characters who represent concepts such as Heroism, Strength, Speed, Cleverness, The Elements, Kindness, Cruelty, and Ambition. All fiction deals in archetypes or symbols, but comic books apply them more consciously than most fictional forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gestalt campaign takes the idea of &amp;quot;character as Archetype&amp;quot; one step further. In this campaign world, Gestalt-Earth, the characters are the symbols. A physically powerful superhero might not just be a strong guy - he could be an embodiment of Strength. A Gestalt martial arts master isn't just a superb fighter - he's also a human representation of his chosen art. The master lives its philosophy at all times, getting into situations where he demonstrates his art and its virtues, championing those who follow the art, and using the art to advance his or her personal fortunes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While characters in the Gestalt-Earth setting look and act like superheroes, in many ways they fulfill the role of mythological gods, becoming the champion of concepts and portfolios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
