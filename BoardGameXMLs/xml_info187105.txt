			<description>In the distant future, the biggest entertainment event on the planet is The Maze. The Maze is an ever changing labyrinth where up to 4 contestants compete for fame and riches. Each maze is made completely differently than the other. Contestants have to try and navigate to the finish and claim their victory. You are one of those contestants. Will you become the victor and claim your spoils or be lost and forgotten in the ever changing labyrinth of The Maze?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maze is a fun, fast paced game where you create a new maze each time you play. Once The Maze is created you and up to 3 other friends try to escape The Maze, but there can be only one victor. Everyone takes their turns together using a fun dice mechanic, so no one is waiting for their turn to come around again. Your roles on the dice determine how The Maze changes each turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game of The Maze uses a little bit of luck and a little bit of strategy. You can create a large maze using all of The Maze cards or just a few to create a smaller maze. The possibilities are endless. For even more unique maze creations consider purchasing The Maze: Teleportals, an expansion to The Maze, which adds the ability to play with up to six players and incorporates a new teleporting mechanic to the game, which allows you to make islands in The Maze as well for even more maze possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maze Contents:&lt;br/&gt;48 Maze Cards&lt;br/&gt;4 Player Pawns&lt;br/&gt;4 Six Sided Dice&lt;br/&gt;1 Set of Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
