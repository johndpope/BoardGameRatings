			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our free Quickstart Issue, designed to give you a feel for the game. We hope you like what you see, and hope you&amp;rsquo;ll give the game a spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although we went back and forth on this, we decided that the best way for you to get a feel of how P&amp;amp;P works and what the game&amp;rsquo;s all about (hint: rolling a bunch of dice, screaming, high-fiving) is to let you read the relevant chapters of the P&amp;amp;P core rules. As a rules-light game, there&amp;rsquo;s really not all that much to take in. Plus, every time we tried to take something out, we immediately thought of a situation where you might need what we deleted. So rather than trying to rewrite the game, we&amp;rsquo;ve just included the chapters you need to read in order to play &amp;quot;Monkey Business,&amp;quot; the story included in the last chapter of this Quickstart Issue. We had to make a few changes to the text so that things make sense, but for the most part, what you see is right out of the game. It&amp;rsquo;s not everything, but it should more than cover you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only other things you&amp;rsquo;ll need to play the story included in this Quickstart Issue are the [Quickstart Heroes], player character heroes that we&amp;rsquo;ve created for you. Each comes in a 4-page dossier format that includes all the information you need to play that character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
