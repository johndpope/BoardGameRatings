			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1972, Lord Ryar Lyakizan created the most famous of all table-top RPGs, &amp;ldquo;Castle and Caves&amp;rdquo;.  People use books, pen, paper, funny-looking dices, and their imagination to play this fantasy medieval role-playing game. One of the most famous players was Arthur Lionheart, who was a head of Merlin Magic Inc., a recent company trying to break into cartoon &amp;mdash; but mostly had been doing cereal commercials &amp;mdash; much to Lionheart&amp;rsquo;s dismay. Lionheart liked, &amp;ldquo;Castle and Cave&amp;rdquo;, but was worried that they won&amp;rsquo;t allow some to mess with the major world, &amp;lsquo;Greenskill&amp;rdquo; and its citizens. They talked to Lord Ryar&amp;rsquo;s company, BTG (Battle Time Games), about the table-top game. Ryar and Arthur got a long just fin, and Arthur was right &amp;mdash; but Lord Ryar stated &amp;ldquo;Sorry about that, but that&amp;rsquo;s life on terra firma.&amp;rdquo;  Terra firma means &amp;ldquo;dry land&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; but Arthur got an idea to use Terra has his setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
