			<description>Cyber Stadium Series: Base Wars (commonly called Base Wars) is a futuristic baseball game featuring various styles of robots as the players. The styles are Tank, Hover, Motorcycle, and Humanoid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can be outfitted with weapons to help the on the field. If a player were to be tagged out, the runner has a chance to battle the fielder in order to be declared safe. The further a player is from his destination base, the less HP he has for that battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players do have an overall HP which is lessened during a battle, or when they are hit by a pitch. If this is totally depleted, the robot will explode, meaning 1 less player for the team. After 3 robots are destroyed, the team forfeits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can only fully swing (no bunting), and the pitcher has total control over the thrown ball using the D-pad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a franchise mode which allows a player to customize their robot team and add in upgrades and weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
