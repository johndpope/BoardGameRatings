							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Banana Spit Card Game</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s spit and speed&amp;ndash;two fast-action card games for fast-thinking kids! In both games get rid of your cards as fast as you can and without going bananas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object:&lt;br/&gt;To be the first player to get rid of all of the cards in your stock piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Up&lt;br/&gt;Shuffle the cards and deal them equally. Each player should have 26 cards. Each of you lay out 10 cards in 4 stock piles in a single row in front of you as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stock Pile 1 &amp;ndash; 1 card face up&lt;br/&gt;Stock Pile 2 &amp;ndash; 1 card face down and 1 card face up on top&lt;br/&gt;Stock Pile 3 &amp;ndash; 2 cards face down and 1 card face up on top&lt;br/&gt;Stock Pile 4 &amp;ndash; 3 cards face down and 1 card face up on top&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the remaining 16 cards face down in a pile to the left of your stock piles. These are your Spit cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Play&lt;br/&gt;Together, count down 3, 2, 1, and shout &amp;ldquo;banana!&amp;rdquo; and take the top card from your banana pile and place it face up in the center between you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in Spit, play cards in sequence up or down onto the 2 center card piles. Only in this version, play cards from your hands. Play as many cards as possible from your hand and then &lt;br/&gt;draw cards from your stock pile so there are always 5 cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If both of you have 5 cards in your hand and neither of you can play a card, count down from 3, shout &amp;ldquo;banana!&amp;rdquo; and turn the next banana card face up on a center card. Continue &lt;br/&gt;playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your banana pile runs out take a center pile (leaving the top card in the center), shuffle it well, turn the cards face down and start a new banana pile. Continue playing. When your stock pile runs out continue playing cards from your hand without replenishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End&lt;br/&gt;The first player to play all of their stock pile cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
