			<description>Players are scientists trying to reach their trucks with the most dinosaurs to take back to their museums. The player who gathers the most dinosaurs wins the game. The amount of dinosaurs a scientist acquires depends on how many quiz cards he answers correctly and where he lands on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a gameboard, 36 quiz cards, and 16 dinosaur playing pieces with the name of the type of dinosaur printed on them (included in a clear plastic &amp;quot;spine&amp;quot; tube on the side of the package).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the game, a colorful Fact Book provides lots of fascinating information about dinosaurs, such as what they ate, how their bodies were constructed, fossils, when they lived, what happened to them, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one in the series of Groovy Tube Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
