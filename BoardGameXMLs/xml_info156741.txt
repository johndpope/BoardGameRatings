			<description>from the cover:&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for 4-6 Mutants Level 1-3&lt;br/&gt;Gary Con 2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;introductory blurb:&lt;br/&gt;VINES GONE WILD &lt;br/&gt;Centuries ago, the Ancient World ended in a swirling storm of nuclear fire, toxic bioweaponry, and global upheaval. But life survived, albeit changed and warped. Mutants and humans live side-by-side in the ruins of Ancient civilizations. Twisted creatures roam the radioactive wastes, and poisonous storms scorch the lands. This is the Mutant Future in which you live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You live in a small village (more like a permanent encampment) on the edge of the vast Sinatti Woodlands. Most of the survivors here scratch out a living through farming and raising spidergoat herds for meat, but you supplement your meager earnings through scavenging any ruins and structures you come across. You've sold a few good finds to traveling merchants and fortune hunters, keeping the best weapons and gadgets for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The villagers have become nervous as of late as the foliage and underbrush marking the edge of the village's border seems to have become thicker and taller in recent days. The plantlife grows fairly wild in the forests and thickets, but there's an almost perceptible encroachment of the flora regardless of the amount of threshing and cutting back the villagers do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equally mysterious is a weakening illness that seems to have overtaken the young and elderly. Several smaller herd animals seem to have perished from the illness as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
