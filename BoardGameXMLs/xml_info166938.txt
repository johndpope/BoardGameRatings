			<description>What a mess! All of the cats in the area went on an exciting mouse hunt together, but now they want to return home. Both the cat parents and kittens are having a difficult time finding each other amidst the chaos! Luckily the police cat is around to keep order and protect the cats that have already found each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Katzenpolizei, the players collect the cats! If the die lands on the relevant symbol, then the players take a card and lay it down in front of them on the table. However, sometimes a cheeky mouse or the naughty neighbor's dog throws a wrench in the works and their cats run away. The players' cats are safe only when the whole family is reunited OR when they enjoy the protection provided by the police cat. The aim of the game is to match up as many cats as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
