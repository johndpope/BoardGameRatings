			<description>A One-Round Living City Tournament for Player Characters of Any Level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few years ago, Jack Mooney, the proprietor of the fabulous Mooney and Sons Circus, hired a band of adventurers to obtain some carnivorous apes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The apes have been performing regularly under the big top--much to the delight of yourselves and the rest of the circus patrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And Mooney has been educating the public while entertaining them, demonstrating that carnivorous apes are not monsters. They are intelligent animals that can coexist with people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it seems that Mooney wants to return a pair of the apes to the wilderness, and he has contacted a handful of local adventurers to serve as escorts. You comprise that group, and you sit in Mooney&amp;rsquo;s tent waiting for the ringmaster and the apes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
