							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skip55</name>
									
			<description>Skip55 is played on a ceramic 4x4 board with ten positive tokens numbered 1-10 and six dark blue tokens numbered -1, -3, -5, -7, -9, and -10 on their hidden face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up a round of the game, place the tokens on the board at random or (for a more strategic game) take turns placing a token on the board. The first player of the round removes one dark blue token at random, looking at the value if desired. Players then take turns in clockwise order. On a turn, you must jump a token over an adjacent token or a line of two adjacent tokens onto an empty space. After jumping, the player claims the firstmost token that they jumped. If a player claims a dark blue token, they take another turn immediately. The round ends once no more jumps can be made, then players tally their score. Once all players have been first player once, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In solo play, you compete for the highest score possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skip55 also includes arithmetic cards &amp;mdash; four each of +, -, &amp;times;, and &amp;divide; &amp;mdash; that can be used as a variant. Shuffle these cards, then place them face down. After a player claims a token, they draw the top card from the deck, then place it to the right of their token. At game's end, you calculate your score by summing your score from left to right, using the mathematical symbols to combine your numbers. (Use the absolute value of a result following division, e.g., 11&amp;divide;3 = 3.666, which would be 3.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
