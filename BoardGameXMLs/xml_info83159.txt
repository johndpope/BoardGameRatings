			<description>The game is an association game. You have 100 different cards with pictures on them. You draw one card and have a short time to think of different things that you can relate to that picture. After this you draw three new cards and then you should make links between the first picture and one of your choices. An link between to pictures can be something like this: Drill-something the dentist have-chair at the dentist something you lie in-lie you do in bed-pillow you have in bed-head on pillow-hat on head--the other picture.&lt;br/&gt;As the trail of relations can be a bit vague, the other players have the choice to say that they don't agree with the thought-trail and if majority of players agree you lose this round, and the turn goes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;The first player with 5 wins, win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A good party game with a lot of laughter&amp;rsquo;s. Goes quite well with children as they catch the rules quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[The name in Swedish means I don't understand anything]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
