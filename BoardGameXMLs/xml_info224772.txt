							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spellfire: Booster Pack, Set 9 â€“ Birthright</name>
									
			<description>May 1996 - This booster gave us many new things.  First and most obvious is that we could now play adding the world of Birthright.  This brought the number of worlds to 7 or 8 (depending on how you count Underdark.  We also gained a champion characteristic of awnsheghlien.  These are creatures with the direct blood of the gods, I believe.  We also had two new card types added.  These were regents (another type of champion with god's blood in his distant lineage), and blood abilities, which were used by the new regent type.  Overall, these blood abilities still are hard to counter.  Landmark Cards: The Spiderfell (#3); Avanil (#5); Baruk-Azhik (#9); Imperial City of Anuire (#12); Espionage! (#18); Armor of the High King (#27); Touch of Decay (#41); Death Touch (#43); Blight (#51); Raze (#59); Drawmij's Instant Summons (#63); The Gorgon (#64); The Spider (#65); The Nobel Outlaw (#91); The Wizard (#94); Rhuobhe Manslayer (c#14); Taxation (c#18); and The Fates (c#23).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
