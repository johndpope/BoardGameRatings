							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Keitel</name>
									
			<description>A Lace &amp;amp; Steel adventure scenario. Includes four pages of character cards describing and illustrating the NPCs in the adventure. Includes details and maps of the Barony of Keitel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some eight days ago the Baron Keitel had a hunting accident. Suddenly frightened, the Baron's horse threw him into a thicket where he fell heavily. By the time his rescuers arrived, the Baron was unmoving and unconscious, and has remained that way ever since, weakening day by day as he loses the struggle against death. The family has gathered at the castle to grieve and wait, and tensions build as the question of succession preys on everyone's minds. The castle has become rife with faction and suspicion as the partizans (sp) of the two contenders for the Baronial title intrigue against each other. Even in the town, heated debate as to the outcome of the succession causes disturbances and fights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
