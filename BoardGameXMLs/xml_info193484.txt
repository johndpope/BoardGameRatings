			<description>Publisher Blurb: &lt;br/&gt;The Daring Comics Roleplaying Game is a complete super-hero rulebook, providing you with new rules for creating your own comic book adventures, along with the Fate system rules, all in one place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed around the Fate Core system from Evil Hat Productions, the Daring Comics RPG not only gives you an extensive set of core rules for creating your own comic book roleplaying series, but also maintains the toolkit nature of Fate by showing you how to turn many of the dials to customize the rules at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes battle villains through the streets and skies. Debris from stray energy beams and super-tough bodies covers city blocks. From megalomaniacs who dream of ruling the world, to dictators who wish to shape the future course of humanity, only the heroes stand in their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Daring Comics Role-Playing Game, you bring your own comic book stories to life. Inside these pages, you&amp;rsquo;ll find complete rules for constructing your own, ongoing comic book series, creating your heroes, and how to resolve all types of actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daring Comics also gives you the rules for creating your own stunts and powers. To help you get started easily, however, we&amp;rsquo;ve also provided dozens of example stunts, and over 100 powers, special effects, and limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
