							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fool and his Money</name>
									
			<description>Having saved the Land from the enchantments of The High Priestess and gained the Gift of Wisdom, the Fool set out to return the fourteen lost treasures to their rightful owners.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What a glorious sunset!&amp;quot; he exclaimed to no one in particular, &amp;quot;for this day, I shall receive my just reward for my selfless service to the Land.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;With the crown on his head and the other thirteen treasures dangling from the pole of his knapsack, the Fool hiked down hillsides and meadows, passing farmwives and fishermen, children and wild hares, and all the while, he daydreamed of grateful countryfolk and generous nobility, and how, for his great achievement, he might be hailed as The High Priest of all the Land.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;My friend,&amp;quot; the sun reflected. &amp;quot;If you stay to your current path, it will take you several days to reach the Kingdom of the Swords. I strongly recommend a more direct course through the woodland marshes.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Robber's Road?&amp;quot; the Fool considered. &amp;quot;Yes, I see the wisdom of it.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Heading north into the trees and mist, he heard the west wind groan, &amp;quot;Montes cut off his nose.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
