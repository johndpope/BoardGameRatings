			<description>Sets of three cards with pictures of rhyming items have to be collected. In his or her turn, a player asks another player for a certain card. On his own cards, only the beginnings of words are spelled out, and the player has to decide which of the two possibilities on each card rhymes with the item in the large picture on the respective card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
