			<description>Subbuteo Horse Racing (also simply called &amp;quot;Horse Racing&amp;quot;) was the third in the family of Subbuteo racing games, which also included &amp;quot;Table Speedway&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Table Motor Racing&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Cycle Speedway.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was a dexterity game. All games in the series used a very similar mechanic: a ball bearing was dropped down a tube and used to propel a playing piece around a racing track. This particular game simulated horse racing, and the pieces were horses and jockeys mounted on Subbuteo style bases. This used the same basic rules as other games in the series, with some variations to account for the sport being represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The variations were as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The race track may be regulation size, or possibly you may care to improvise its shape, but movement areas should not exceed 8&amp;quot; in length. This measurement should be taken on the inside of the track.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;When the horse has reached the distance post (two movement areas before the Winning Post) no horse is allowed to cross directly in front of another horse. If a horse crosses another in this fashion and within this area and subsequently finishes first, second, or third, the jockey on the crossed horse may lodge an objection, which will be automatically sustained. The offending horse is then placed last and the other horses naturally move up to fill the vacant place.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Once round the track will be a Five Furlong Sprint race. Twice round is regarded as the Derby course, and three times, the St. Leger course.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Each race may be regarded as complete in itself, or may become part of a series of races known as a Meeting. The winner of a Meeting will be the owner of the horse, or horses securing the largest amount of prize money. Prize money is allotted as follows: Winner &amp;pound;100, Second &amp;pound;60, Third &amp;pound;40.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were also advanced rules for steeple chasing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
