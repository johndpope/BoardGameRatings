							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anti-Hero</name>
									
			<description>Anti-hero is a solitaire Print &amp;amp; Play game which has RPG style character development elements.  The player takes on the role of a fledging superhero/villain created by a freak accident at a local nuclear facility. Your character is just getting to grips with his new skills and powers which he has acquired through the mutation of his genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accident is kept quiet and your character is the only survivor. The radiation has made you smarter and more dangerous than the humans in this city. The city officials must pay for what has happened to you and your colleagues, but no one wants to hear your story, not the Police Commissioner, the District Attorney or the Mayor, but you will make them pay for what they have done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a combination of dice to create your powers, skills gained through experience points and actions which will see the player, rob banks, hire goons, investigate and blackmail city officials. Can you take control of the city before you are stopped? You are the anti-hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
