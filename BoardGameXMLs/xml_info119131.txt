							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fuzzy Heroes (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuzzy Heroes uses stuffed animals and toys of all kinds as the characters and combatants in miniature and role-playing battles. These toys gain the energy to move and pursue their noble goals from the land of FrolicHaven, a mystic land which only toys can access through secret doorways that exist in the back of every closet (which is why kids are always hearing noises in the back of the closet).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuzzy Heroes is designed to be played by two or more people using actual toys, whether as a role-playing or a miniatures game, and so you&amp;rsquo;re going to need some space. The living room floor, the dining room table, or the top of a bed make ample playing surfaces; all are suitably large for good Fuzzy Heroes gaming. Each player should have and will need at least one toy, but what toys are used is unimportant, other than to the person that will have to play the part of that toy in the upcoming game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
