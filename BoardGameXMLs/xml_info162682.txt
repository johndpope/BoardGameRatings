			<description>From the designer website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve Twelves is a simple card game of prediction and bluff for two players. It is also a game that will fairly quickly and painlessly teach people their times-tables. The game consists of four hands and takes about 5 or 10 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each hand works as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. deal six cards to each player&lt;br/&gt;  2. the dealer then chooses a card from her hand and plays it face up on the table &lt;br/&gt;  3. the other player (the scorer) then plays a card on top of this&lt;br/&gt;  4. the scorer gains points equal to the value of the two cards multiplied together&lt;br/&gt;  5. repeat steps 2 to 4 for the other five cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now play the next three hands, alternating who is the dealer and who is the scorer. There will be 4 cards left over: these are simply discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value of each card is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Aces are worth 1&lt;br/&gt;  - Number cards are worth their face value&lt;br/&gt;  - Jacks are worth 11&lt;br/&gt;  - Queens are worth 12&lt;br/&gt;  - Kings are worth zero&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
