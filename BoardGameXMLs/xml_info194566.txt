			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DrinkMaster Says is the ultimate party in a pack. The game is an exciting mix of rules and challenges, loaded with non-stop action. Once you start playing you may never want to stop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. Along the way, you might have to drink with o hands, balance stuff on your head, or be part of a burping competition ,just to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So gather your friends, pop open your favorite beverage and deal out the cards - Find out who among you can truly be called DrinkMaster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 types cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue Cards - These cards are known as the Challenge Cards. Attempt to put your skills to the test. If the player is victorious, he/she does not drink and may distribute that amount of drinks to the other player(s). &lt;br/&gt;Green Cards - These are known as the Rule Cards. Follow the rules or drink. Rule Cards are in effect until replaced by the next rule card that is placed on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Boxes - The boxes on the bottom half of the Rules Cards are known as the Action Boxes. These are specific tasks that must be completed by the person that plays the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numbers on Cards - Located in the upper left corner of all cards. This is the number of drinks to be had if anyone breaks a rule or loses a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt four cards. Play begins to the left of the dealer. The first player can choose to play either color card to begin the game. The next player must play a card of the opposite color (or take a drink and skip their turn.) Discard the used card face up in the appropriate pile (during play you should have two piles - a Rules pile and a Challenge pile). Play continues to the left until directed differently by the Action Boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
