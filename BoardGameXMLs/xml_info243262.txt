							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fidelio Incident</name>
									
			<description>It started as another routine flight off the coast of Iceland, but then it happened. I never believed in miracles before the crash, but it wasn't grace, it was just luck. The real miracle was hearing her Irish voice on the broken mobile and knowing that somewhere on this God forsaken island, Leonore is still alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s trapped in the wreckage, and I'm afraid that if I can't reach her soon, she won't survive the cold.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got to keep moving. I&amp;rsquo;ll drag myself through the snow and ice if that&amp;rsquo;s what it takes. I can do it as long as I know she&amp;rsquo;s alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
