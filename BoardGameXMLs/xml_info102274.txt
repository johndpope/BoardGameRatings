			<description>Players take on the role of investors expandning their own business with new branches being established and opened continuously. They need to balance out all economic activity to be able to progress evenly and gain points in the best possible way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use pawns moving on a circular board each Round (in a typical roll-and-move fashion), cards from variuos piles according to the spaces they land on and their own judgement in managing their branches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
