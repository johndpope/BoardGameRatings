							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scrum Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The Scrum Card Game supports learners of agile framework SCRUM. Players act in a collaborative team environment during game play. Multiple teams are playing against each other. The objective of the game is that a team of players plan and work on a product's abstract working packages aiming to complete as many working packages as possible. The more functional the product gets the better the players perform in a team. Best team with most functional product wins. Teams with less functional product will lose. A team acts in collaboration while the teams have a competition against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck of the Scrum Card Game consists of four types of cards: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Story cards describing features the team wants to create for a product,&lt;br/&gt;     Event cards with positive, neutral, or negative impact on game play and progress,&lt;br/&gt;     Problem cards describing permanent obstacles on planned Stories, and&lt;br/&gt;     Solution cards helping players on occurred Problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By rolling two dice on each player's turn an amount of working hours per day spent on a working package is determined. This way if a full round (each player finishes an own turn) has finished a working day is simulated. Each three simulated days (which is called a Scrum Sprint) the players replan their work in a agile way. Game ends after three Scrum Sprints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card game is used so that players experience work in a simulated SCRUM sprint scenario. It allows reflection of many aspects and topics that happen in real life while working in&lt;br/&gt;a SCRUM team, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
