			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A persistent ghost has been spotted in Phlan, flitting from building to building. The residents say that it stands in front of the Laughing Goblin every night, eyes wide and full of terror. If approached, it screams and disappears. In the wake of the town&amp;rsquo;s re-opening and the retreat of the thick winter fogs, peace must be returned before people leave for good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A D&amp;amp;D Adventurer&amp;rsquo;s League adventure set in the town of Phlan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 4-hour Adventure for 5th &amp;ndash; 10th Level Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champion of the People explores Phlan after the events of DDEP4: Reclamation of Phlan and the election of Calypso. It sports some familiar faces, some new faces, and plenty of opportunity for characters to roleplay their way to crazy greatness - in fact, the adventure is deeply rooted in another piece of pop culture that should become apparent as the adventure unfolds!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure premiered at Links Con in Okemos, Michigan in June of 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
