			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The Game that turns your living room into a street corner .&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players of Monopoly (q.v.) will find themselves in very familiar territory, as players roll dice to move around the game board and purchase property.  The houses and hotels from Monopoly are replaced by fields and factories. Players determine the end game conditions by mutual agreement but the winner is the player with the most money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
