			<description>&amp;quot;In the future, a new high-tech sport will become popular. One-third football, one-third motocross, one-third fighting, it is so violent players often don't survive the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People love it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is played on a circular track with two goals located opposite of each other in the wall surrounding the track. Ten players from each team &amp;mdash; three motorcyclists, two catchers and five skaters &amp;mdash; move counterclockwise around the track and work together to field the steel game ball and put it in their team&amp;rsquo;s goal. The object seems simple enough: score more points than the opposing team.&amp;quot;...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- From the Rulebook introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A free board game based on the movie &amp;quot;Rollerball&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
