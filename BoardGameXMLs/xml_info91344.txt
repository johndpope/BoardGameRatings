			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In the world of Tarrak, history speaks of many Wizards of great power and might. One of the most famous was the Sorcerer R'nokks. 200 years ago, as the legends tell, R'nokks roamed freely through the lands of the inner sea, always seeking new spells and magiks. He was both loved and feared, and in one case, he was worshiped. Among his many accomplishments, he is credited to having created the lighthouse near Bakers Point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one knows for sure the fate of R'nokks or his ship the Red Dawn. Some whisper that he is still alive today, living in the immortal mountain retreat of Alzeer the Tinkerer. Others say that through his great magic, he became a Demigod who's spirit protects travelers on journeys through the inner seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of all of R'nokks' accomplishments, none are more famous than his Spell Books, which are rumored to have been lost&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now they can be found in your world. Each of the three books contained in this package contain progressivaly harder spells, pages full of magical scripts, strange ruins, and more! 36 pages in all! Complete with detailed instructions for the GameMasterwhich includes translations for the 3 different magical scripts found in the books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
