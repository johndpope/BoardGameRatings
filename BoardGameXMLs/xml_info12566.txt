			<description>Head to Head is a game of eliminating opponent's pieces by jumping, as in Checkers, and getting the number 10 piece to the opposite side of the board. Loss of the number 10 piece means losing the game. Jumping requires an EVEN result when adding (for example) the numbers on the two pieces involved. Only one arithmetic concept is used in each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
