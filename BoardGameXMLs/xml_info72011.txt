			<description>&amp;quot;Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator is a computer role-playing game (CRPG) developed by Valkyrie Studios and published by Monolith Productions. The game takes an unusual approach at the genre, by using elements most commonly associated with console video games, such as the Final Fantasy series. Septerra Core's art style draws most of its inspiration from the Japanese anime genre, making use of stylised characters and fantastic landscape, combining science fiction futuristic elements with, for example, medieval concepts. That is essentially made possible because the game is set on a fictional world composed by seven analogous layers - hence the title &amp;quot;Septerra&amp;quot;, from the Latin &amp;quot;sept&amp;quot;, seven, and &amp;quot;terra&amp;quot;, earth - each with unique characteristics, geography and political structure. Battles in Septerra Core implement a variant of Active Time Battle, with the only substantial difference being that the strength of the character's attacks are defined by how long the player allows the time gauge of said character to be charged. Other notable features include fully recorded dialogue, CGI cutscenes and a flexible magic system based on cards similar to those of Tarot. Professional voice actors supplied the voices for the main characters while Valkyrie employees and friends voiced the minor characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the center of Septerra lies the Core, a giant Biocomputer. Seven continents, each with its own unique population and cultures, turn around the core on different levels.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Septerra_Core,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
