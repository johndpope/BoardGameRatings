							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Thaumatology: Alchemical Baroque</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to a land that's as familiar as history and as fanciful as a fairy tale. GURPS Thaumatology: Alchemical Baroque presents the Known Lands, a place existing between the old history of magical tales and the new realities of exploration and enlightenment. It's a time of ghosts and giants, of spirits and spellcraft, of charm-slinging cunning-men and chubby sly cats. Yet even in these new times, the world needs heroes: haunted moors need exploring, wars need thwarting, and the fairies always need something &amp;ndash; even if they refuse to reveal it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Containing material originally appearing in GURPS All-Star Jam 2004, this supplement has been expanded and completely revised to GURPS (4th Edition) standards. It contains the history and character-creation information needed to adventure in this strange-but-familiar place. Taking advantage of the tools and techniques in GURPS Thaumatology to bring this world fully to life, GURPS Thaumatology: Alchemical Baroque contains information on alchemy and ritual magic in the Known Lands. It also offers stats for fairies, ogres, and sapient cats, plus information on ghosts, devils, and other threats. Take up your musket and quaff a brew of courage; fortune favors the bold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
