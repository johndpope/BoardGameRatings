							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dungeon Masters Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the Dungeon Master's Rulebook from Dungeons &amp; Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules, and along with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Players Manual makes up that boxed set. It has been separated out as a new item only because the two books from that set are sold separately in PDF format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the preface:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Read through this booklet from front to back, just as you did the PLAYERS' MANUAL. A vast wealth of information awaits you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In your adventures so far, you have met many fearsome monsters &amp;mdash; goblins, skeletons, and even a Rust Monster. There are dozens of other monsters described in this booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have found treasures &amp;mdash; coins of all types, gems, and a magical potion. There are dozens of other treasures here.&lt;br/&gt;You have visited a &amp;quot;dungeon&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; some caves near a town. There is a new dungeon in this booklet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also learn how to put all these things together, make your own dungeons, run games for other players, and probably have more fun than you ever imagined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
