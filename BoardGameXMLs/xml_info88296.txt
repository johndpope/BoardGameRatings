			<description>&amp;quot;BOLSA&amp;quot; simulates the functioning of the stock exchange in the perspective of small investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the year (each month = 1 round) players will have to invest or disinvest in stock in order to maximize their profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can choose between 6 companies, from all sectors of activity  and with 3 different profiles - high risk, medium risk and low risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in the real stock exchange, quotations of each company are driven by 3 factors:&lt;br/&gt;- the selling and buying orders from all players, which will bring quotation down or up&lt;br/&gt;- the market trends, simulated by dice casted at the beginning of each month but with effect only at quarter end&lt;br/&gt;- the always breakthrough company news from &amp;quot;Jornal Finan&amp;ccedil;as &amp;amp; Bolsa&amp;quot;, released at month end and that may impact one or more, or even all companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have 30 secs to plan it's moves in total secrecy and only then all players reveal their intentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the year you will receive yearend bonus only for the stock you have kept in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All stocks are then converted to cash and let's count the money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The richest player wins the game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
