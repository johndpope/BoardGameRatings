			<description>I have seen this game in 3 themes:&lt;br/&gt;Over The Hill&lt;br/&gt;Menopause Madness&lt;br/&gt;Mid-Life Crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game comes with:&lt;br/&gt;50 Problem cards&lt;br/&gt;200 Solution cards&lt;br/&gt;1 Counselor die&lt;br/&gt;1 One minute timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play:&lt;br/&gt;One person is the Caller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caller picks up a Problem card and reads it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caller then rolls the die, which determines who the call is made to, i.e. a friend, psychic, shrink, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caller then turns over the timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players (called Counselors) then have one minute to sort through the various solution cards.  The solution cards each have one word on them.  They take the cards and construct a reply in the theme rolled on the Counselor die.  This is all done simultaneously by all of the Counselors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caller acts as the time keeper and gives the Counselors a running record of the appox. time remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the time is up, each Counselor reads his reply.  The Caller names the one he likes best and the Counselor get to keep the Problem card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caller position then rotates to the left and that player is the Caller for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a 3-4 player game you play until one player has 5 Problem cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a 5-6 player game you play until 3 cards are won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
