							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kratas: City of Thieves (Classic Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CITY OF THIEVES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in the center of Barsaive, the city of Kratas serves as a crossroads of information and stolen goods. Despite its location near almost all major trade routes, few honest merchants pass through the city, for Kratas is ruled and run by thieves. Its people are the clever and desperate, the illegally wealthy and the horribly destitute of our province.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site of an ancient citadel that fell to the Horrors during the Scourge, Kratas was crammed with treasures both magical and mundane when adventurers rediscovered it, empty of survivors, soon after the end of the Scourge. Rumors of its treasures led countless expeditions of heroes and treasure-seekers to scour the ruins bare of wealth and monsters. Within a few years, the dark buildings became home to bandits seeking a home base between their raiding activities. Over time the bandits and thieves began to feel themselves a community, though a true government did not form in Kratas until the outbreak of the Theran War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legendary ork Thief, Garlthik One-Eye, controls the city through his gang, the Force of the Eye. Kratas is a veritable hub of information and stolen goods. Adventure and intrigue&amp;mdash;both can be found here, in the dirty streets of the City of Thieves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kratas: City of Thieves offers gamemasters and players an in-depth look at Barsaive&amp;rsquo;s most disreputable city. This book provides detailed descriptions of Kratas, its gangs, and the characters who call this city home, along with new and original content for adventures in the world of Earthdawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
