							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Score Five</name>
									
			<description>Score Five is played on a 6x6 square grid in which someone has randomly placed the numbers 1-9, four times each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player starts by circling the number in one of the four corners and starting a running total with that number. The second player circles an adjacent number and adds it to the running total. This continues until the running total reaches 170, at which point the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player makes the running total a multiple of five, they add that running total to their score. Whoever has the higher score when the game ends, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the January 1983 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
