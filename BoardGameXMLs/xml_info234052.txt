			<description>In the card game Doomseeker, players take on the role of a mighty dwarf slayer. Each player's character is sworn by the slayer's oath to seek a glorious death in battle for a crime committed or stain on that dwarf's honor. The slayers eschew worldly pursuits, dye their beards and hair in fierce and fiery reds and oranges, tattoo their ruddy flesh, take up their weapons, and wander the old world seeking their doom battling monsters and enemies of their race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doomseeker card game pits players against one another to see who can die the most glorious death! Press your luck and challenge the denizens and monsters of the Old World, with each victory bringing you more glory, and ultimately your death can be met at the hands of a truly worthy foe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
