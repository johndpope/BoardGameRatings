			<description>Offered as rewards for backers of the Kickstarter, Lazer Ryderz: Captain Cosmic and Visionary offer different powers for two of the four player characters:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Captain Cosmic blasts through space as a Lazer Ryder, seeking to unlock the power of the ancient Prizms. Other Ryderz beware as Captain Cosmic's powers allow him to create golden constructs in space that can block travel or even cause a crash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Vanessa Long has traveled through time and space as The Visionary! Now, she takes to the cosmos in search of prizms of power to aid her and her allies on earth. Her mental powers allow her to neutralize prizms, making her a psychic force to be reckoned with. Through a combination of psychic befuddlement and raw telekinetic force, The Visionary can move a power prizm she controls out of the grasp of her enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
