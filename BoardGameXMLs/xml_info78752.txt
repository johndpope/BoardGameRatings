			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exteel was a free-to-play third-person shooter developed and published by NCsoft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players use tall, several story high, Gundam-like Mechanaughts to fight CPU-controlled Mechanaughts and other players in neon-lit city-scapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mechanaughts themselves were customizable for-free to a small degree. Additional color palettes, body parts, skills or weapons could be purchased via NCsofts micro-payment system and NCcoins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the low financial viability, NCsoft announced on July 27, 2010 that the online server would be closed down permanently on September 1, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
