							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">5 Quadrat</name>
									
			<description>5 Quadrat is a collection of 25 puzzles for one person and games for two or three players, all played on a 5x5 grid with various pieces (wooden discs in several colors, matches, and dice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the games are traditional games played on such a board or traditional games adapted to the board; credit is given in the rulebook to the books that they got the games from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four of the games are original. One other, Harlekin, is by Hajo Bücken; the rules say it was originally published in his Arbeitsstelle f&amp;uuml;r neues Spielen but it is not clear what it was called there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
