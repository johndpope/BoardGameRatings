							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eliminate: The Waste Minimisation Training Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a light-hearted way to show the benefits of waste minimization in saving a company money, and also encouraging team building and communication. It is played as a team, not individually, against targets given in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to maximize savings through reducing, reusing and recycling in a fictional setting: Whittaker's Widget Factory. Game-play includes moving round a board using a die, answering questions on waste issues to get in-game benefits, and choosing how to try to reduce waste and costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are quite a bit of basic calculations involved, so not for the fainthearted, and the game is a training tool aimed squarely at people working in the industrial sector. However, the game itself is quite fun. The game rules include information about how to take the lessons learned into real life and where to find further information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is also notable for being a partnership project between a UK government department (the Environment Agency) and two non-governmental organizations (The Groundwork Trust and the WWF).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
