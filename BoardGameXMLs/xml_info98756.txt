							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Broken: The Oldest Goblin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meander is dying. He is the oldest living goblin in the Pipedream, the massive hot water and sewage system that survived being ejected from Solaris when that world was destroyed. Capped off and made air tight, it has become a floating space station inhabited by gnomes, goblins and glomes. Meander might last a few more years with Frigga&amp;rsquo;s blessing but it seems she hasn&amp;rsquo;t given it. Three quarters of the Pipedream&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants are doomed by a disaster on board the Pipedream. Those who are not critical to the survival of their society must leave, a death sentence in the cold void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document contains Meander&amp;rsquo;s last thoughts recorded before his death. It contains a history of the Pipedream, Meanders stats, afflictions associated with old age, 15 new feats and wonderful new artwork for the Broken setting. The document concludes with a tribute to the late Gary Gygax, may he rest in peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken: The Oldest Goblin is the forth publication for Broken series, d20 fantasy in a realistic void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
