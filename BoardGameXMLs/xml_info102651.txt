			<description>A streamlined system of fantasy miniature combat designed to be open, fun and flexible and to eliminate the need for thick books, dice and rulers. The game is aimed at players who are more interested in enjoying the experience of the battle rather than keeping track of minute rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the basic game is to eliminate your opponent's force, but scenarios can be created with practically any objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay involves players taking turns activating their troops in each of 5 phases: Decision (planning), Displacement (movement), Shooting (ranged combat), Brawl (melee) and Deceit (magic, sapping, burning, etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
