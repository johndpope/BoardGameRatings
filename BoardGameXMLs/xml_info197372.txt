			<description>From the publishers webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New, kinda weird Mission brings Shadowrun design into bold, emoji-based space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes we like to come out with Missions that are not part of the regular Missions schedule, and sometimes we like to do things with those Missions that are a little experimental. In that vein, we bring you the new Mission, UnCONventional Warfare, wherein the type of Shadowrun adventure often played in a convention setting is an adventure with a convention setting, because we hope reality will fold back in on itself enough times to usher in the Singularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with its bold setting, the Mission features a whole new look that in many ways may seem primitive but in other, more important ways is totally futuristic, because it has emojis all over the place, and nothing says hip, hot, and futuristic like emojis. Shadowrun line developer Jason Hardy said about this design choice: &amp;ldquo;I love almost everything about Shadowrun&amp;lsquo;s art and design, but there is one glaring flaw: an almost total lack of emojis. We need more emojis. More emojis! Emojis everywhere!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shadowrun art director Brent Evans took the whole thing in stride. While the decision was made a little late to allow Mr. Evans to actually participate in the design, he noted his enthusiasm thusly: &amp;ldquo;My head is swimming with the visual possibilities.  We could run amok with this.&amp;rdquo; And run amok we shall!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legendary design and layout guy Matt &amp;ldquo;Wrath&amp;rdquo; Heerdt was somewhat less sanguine, saying &amp;ldquo;Oh nice, you drop an emoji project on me with no warning? And let me guess, production will have to develop those? Do you have any idea how swamped I am and how much time a smiling-winking-troll emoji would take to design? I&amp;rsquo;ll shuffle some projects around, just don&amp;rsquo;t expect the troll emojis to be twice as big as the elf emojis &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; At that point he shuffled off to hide under a warm blanket with his laptop and a huge carafe of coffee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
