			<description>Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation is a 2011 first-person shooter developed and published by Gameloft Montreal for iOS, Android, Bada 2.0 and BlackBerry PlayBook devices. It is the third game in the Modern Combat series, and is a sequel to 2009's Modern Combat: Sandstorm and 2010's Modern Combat 2: Black Pegasus. The fourth part of the series, Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour, was released in 2012, and the fifth, Modern Combat 5: Blackout, in 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay in Fallen Nation is similar to the previous Modern Combat games, and also similar to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The game's single player mode takes place over thirteen levels, in locales such as Hollywood, Alaska, and the Middle East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is controlled using virtual buttons on-screen; a virtual control stick on the left of the screen is used for movement, while aiming is achieved by swiping on the touchscreen. Gyroscopic controls are featured on the iPhone 4, fourth generation iPod Touch and certain Android devices. The player can also crouch, throw grenades, use their weapon's iron sights, reload, change weapon, pick up different weapons, knife enemies, mantle obstacles, and shoot using buttons and prompts on the touchscreen. All controls can be customized from the main menu. The single-player campaign also includes Quick time events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
