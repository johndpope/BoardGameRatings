			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynasty Warriors is a PSP game in Koei&amp;rsquo;s Dynasty Warriors series. The player can choose any of a number of characters from the ancient Chinese story &amp;ldquo;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&amp;rdquo; and must fight their way through legions of enemy soldiers to complete objectives and defeat enemy officers. Unlike other games in the series, in Dynasty Warriors the battlefield is broken up into a number of small quadrants with varying numbers of enemies for the player to defeat. These quadrants have different levels of strategic importance and can turn the tide of battle. Also new is the ability to bring up to four allied officers into battle and switch control between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
