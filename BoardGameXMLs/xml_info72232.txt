							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">CEO: Cheat Every One</name>
									
			<description>You are a &amp;quot;CEO&amp;quot; of a multinational company. Your objective is to &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot; money from the company account to your private &amp;quot;retirement&amp;quot; account on the Cayman Islands. You fly around the game board in your company jet, carrying a well-stuffed moneybag - but the money isn&amp;rsquo;t yours.. yet. &lt;br/&gt;As a serious and highly paid &amp;quot;CEO&amp;quot; you have a lot of chores; hiring a new secretary, whose business qualifications spring from her weeklong experience as a Hooters waitress, convincing the SEC that a couple of late night phone calls do not qualify as insider trading, but are simply a question of friendly talk between collegues, and maintaining your expensive friendship with the local politicians. Of course you also have to be on top of the latest news from the various business' you are involved in, which means chatting up other &amp;quot;CEO's&amp;quot; on luxury cruises. On your way, you encounter the chance to do alittle trading, spend the Company's money on luxury items and maybe have a run-in with the IRS or the SEC. So before you get to fly to Cayman, your moneybag may have inflated or deflated &amp;ndash; or you may even be forced to exchange your moneybag with another &amp;quot;CEO&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are ready to retire (have won the game) when you have put away 150 Million on your private Cayman Islands account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
