			<description>User Note: For characters level 4-6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having just finished your business in Desburg, you charter a ship, heading for Galishor. The ship, Nora's Grace, is leaving today and you have just enough coin to buy passage. Captain Daniels tips his cap and welcomes you aboard, as porters show you to your rooms. The accommodations are more than fair and you settle in for a long journey ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;White Squall! Captain Daniels!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A startled cry is cut short as massive waves hammer the ship. The sound of wood splintering fills your ears as the ship is buffeted by another wave. Lightning explodes in the air as the gutted sky spills the contents of its belly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A storm is rising and the ship is a victim of the sea's whim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you rush onto the main deck, a horrific sight welcomes you. A monstrous wave towers above the ship. You scramble for purchase as it peaks and plummets toward you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sea engulfs Nora's Grace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last thing you remember is the taste of salt water in your mouth and the shock of icy water swirling around you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
