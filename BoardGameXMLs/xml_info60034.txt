			<description>The Hungarian title translates as Great monarchs of Transylvania (Erd&amp;eacute;ly). The board is a map of Erd&amp;eacute;ly. There are ten or eleven tiles belonging to each of eight monarchs of Erd&amp;eacute;ly. These tiles are put on the board at the beginning of the game, next to cities which played important role in the life of the monarch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pawns are moved in any direction, but according to dice rolls. Whenever a pawn is put an a place with one or more tiles, the player gets one of those tiles of his/her choice. Players can trade the tiles any time. The goal is to collest all the tiles belonging to one, two or three monarch, depending on the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
