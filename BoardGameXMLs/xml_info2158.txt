			<description>Play baseball by flicking a soft disk around a baseball diamond.  The offensive player places the disk at home plate and flicks it into the field of play.  Specific targets represent singles, doubles, triples, home runs, and outs; if the disk lands anywhere else, the defensive player can flick the disk at other targets to try to put the batter out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
