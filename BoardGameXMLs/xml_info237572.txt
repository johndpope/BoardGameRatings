							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Butts in Space: The Card Game</name>
									
			<description>Butts in Space: The Card Game is a simple but strategic card game of set collection, hand management, and take that mechanics. The theme revolves around butts and space with whimsical cartoon artwork. It features four butt characters that the players can play as, and plenty of uniquely drawn toilet papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the player with the most sets of toilet paper when the game ends. This is done by gathering toilet paper cards and laying them down when you have a full set that matches your butt character. There are plenty of action cards to steal, draw, or otherwise shift the game in your favor, and some that can be used to change the butt characters. The game ends as soon as the last space ship part is drawn from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
