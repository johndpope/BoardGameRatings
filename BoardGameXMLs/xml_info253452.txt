Featuring fluid gameplay, immersive movie-style story, detailed character animation, ultra-smooth multi-directional scrolling, a huge science complex to explore, multiple enemies to defeat and guns ... lots of guns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the role of Kim, a low-level security guard at a Throne Group science complex, during the worst night shift of her life!&lt;br/&gt; This involves the Group's inventions spiraling out of control thanks to the megalomaniacal visions of the head scientist Norman Throne, ad-hoc life-saving nanomechanical surgical procedures that grant Kim superior strength and recovery capability, but also the constant dependence on battery power, relentless combat against enemies both robotic and human, and an impending apocalypse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual credits&lt;br/&gt;Lasse &amp;ouml;rni: Design, code, graphics, sound effects, music&lt;br/&gt;P&amp;eacute;ter Nagy-Mikl&amp;oacute;s: Music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
