			<description>In all four variants (Triangel Solo, Triangel Mini/Maxi and Triangel Tempo) triangular tiles with coloured arcs around the corners must be placed (according to the rules of the variant) in order to create full circles of a single color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solo variant is the puzzle to create as many full circles as possible from a random subset of all tiles, but the multi player games have no predefined best outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Triangel Mini and Maxi have a slight resemblence to Domino, since players take turns to add tiles from their personal &amp;ldquo;hand&amp;rdquo; to a growing structure in the middle so that sides fit, in the Triangel Tempo version, the triangular tiles are dealt equally to the players and the players try to place all of their tiles in one structure, with sides of the triangles matching each other. Once a player manages to fit all his tiles in one structure, the assembly stops and points are scored, with one point for each full circle in a player's structure and negative points for unused tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
