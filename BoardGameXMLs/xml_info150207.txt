			<description>from the kickstarter&lt;br/&gt;Streamline RPG preparation, spend more time focusing on the game, and increase the engagement of your players with Realm Works!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many times have you struggled to keep your tabletop RPG campaigns completely organized? Have you ever lost track of what your players have and haven't learned? Is &amp;ldquo;real-life&amp;rdquo; limiting the time you have to prepare for games? Do you waste precious time during games searching for details from previous sessions, some of which occurred months or even years ago? These challenges, and others, are what we set out to solve with Realm Works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realm Works takes campaign management for tabletop RPGs to the next level, making it faster and easier to prepare for games, and greatly enhancing the actual game experience. You can use Realm Works with any RPGs you play &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;game system neutral&amp;rdquo; and can be used no matter what type of campaign you run.  GMs can create, manage, and share their world using a single tool, rather than trying to cobble things together with multiple, disconnected applications.  Realm Works was built by GMs and players for GMs and players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
