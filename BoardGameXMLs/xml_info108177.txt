			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What Could Go Wrong?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An invitation to a charity Lingerie party at a night club out in the middle of nowhere seemed like a great chance to get in some social networking, have some free drinks and food, and spend some time around lovely ladies in lacy things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When terrorists attack the party with the intent to rob the place blind, it seems like the night might just turn into an adventurer's perfect trifecta - a party, a fight, and a victory celebration all at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not going to go that smoothly, though... not only are these terrorists good at what they do, there is also a problem in the basement... a lot of problems in the basement. A lot of problems with sharp teeth, massive claws, and a desire to kill and breed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the night club locks down tighter than any night club should, and the mixture of player characters, gun-toting terrorists, and monsters kicks into full swing, it's time to see just how bad a situation can get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
