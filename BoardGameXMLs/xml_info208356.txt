							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Phineas and Ferb: Mission Achterbahn</name>
									
			<description>Phineas and Ferb have a mission: They want to build the coolest rollercoaster in the world. With tactival thinking and luck, you can make it together. But beware: taddle-tale Candace and the mean Dr. Doofenschrmirtz will do everything to destroy the build!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player flips a few coins. If they land with the right side up, they get to move their token. This way they can collect pieces of their own puzzle, which shows a picture of the Rollercoaster! The first one to collect all the different pieces, AND makes it to the House, wins!&lt;br/&gt;There is a risk, though. Candace can also move, and when she gets home before one of the players, she will tell mom and the plan is foiled!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
