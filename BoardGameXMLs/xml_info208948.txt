							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jan de Wolf: The Unlucky Constable</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first glance, Jan ought not to have become one more unfortunate soul in this city. At first glance, Jan ought to have had it all. And that is because at first glance, Jan is a member of one of the Fresian Merchant League&amp;rsquo;s prominent Trade Families. What&amp;rsquo;s more, he had the chance to be its Patriarch and could right now have been sipping expensive Valion brandy instead of skulking around the dark alleyways of Middelburg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This character pack presents a single pre-generated character for use with The Ruined City: A Runed Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
