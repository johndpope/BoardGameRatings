							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vacuation</name>
									
			<description>A Pepys Card Game released after the beginning of World War 2 with a related theme. Subject of the game is the evacuation (hence the name of the game)of children from the large British cities to the calm and safe sites of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to get rid of all his cards first.&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 44 cards with different letter codes and some extra cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to UNO with the winner the person who empties their hand first.  Players in turn discard Girl, Boy, Householder and Teacher cards, following suit until a Master card is played.  Two packs are used to allow more than 5 to take part.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player lays out a card which the next one in line must follow suit. If he can't, he picks up a card or changes suit with one of the master cards. Extremely tricky are the two extra cards: ALARM and EXTRA GAS MASK allow to take some special action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
