							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Time: A Game of Chance for Many Players</name>
									
			<description>The time theme is very loosely pasted onto this game. The clocks used on the board and the cards could have just as easily been card denominations. This is a simple game of match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dealer/banker is assigned. Each player is dealt five cards face up. The dealer then deals one card face down on each of the 12 clocks on the board. In the first round of play the dealer turns up one of the twelve cards at a time. If a player has a matching card in one of his/her upturned five, then the player has to pay in the amount of chips/points indicated at that point on the board in large red letters. If the player has two matching cards, the player must pay double and so on. If the overturned card matches the time on the board at that spot, TIME is called and all payments are doubled. In this round all payments are made to the pot. After all twelve cards are overturned they are returned to the deck, reshuffled, and a fresh twelve are distributed to the twelve clock positions face down. The players keep their original five cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second round, as each of the twelve cards are overturned, payments are made to the players following the same rules as in round one. The rules do not explain the end of the game scenario. Nor do they explain if the rounds continue to alternate put/take. It is also unclear how many chips the players start with. It is suggested that the white chips equal 1, the yellow chips 2, the red chips 5 and the blue chips 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
