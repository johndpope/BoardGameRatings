							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Score College Basketball Game</name>
									
			<description>You will need one of the Final Score College Basketball Year Books to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name implies, this quick play game provides you with a final score for a College Basketball game. Allowing you to rapidly play games and watch standings unfold before your eyes. However, there is more to the game than just generating scores. There is plenty of excitement and drama along the way, keeping the game play exciting and compelling. You will have nail biters, blow outs, and even a big upset or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each team is rated individually for Offense, Defense, and Home Court Advantage. And while there will surely be some surprises along the way, since this is a game, after all, the accuracy of the game will astound you. We also have a normalization system for every team and season we rate, so you can play across seasons to determine the best team of all-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
