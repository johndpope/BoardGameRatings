							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tortoise and Hare</name>
									
			<description>Will the tortoise beat the hares to the finish line?  Players race their rabbit movers along a twisting, colored path.  A wind-up turtle races along its own circular path, trying to beat the rabbits to the finish line.  As the tortoise moves, a colored ball randomly appears on its back, indicating the current player's next move.  The winner of the race is the first one who crosses the finish line, whether it is a player's hare or the wind-up tortoise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
