			<description>Based on the hit ABC TV series that ran from 1975 until 1979 starring Paul Michael Glaser (David Starsky) and David Soul (Kenneth &amp;quot;Hutch&amp;quot; Hutchinson)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin the game with a randomly distributed 'criminal' card.  By moving around the board by the roll of a die, players obtain other cards that either match their criminal or one of their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards that match are placed face up.  Cards that do not match are discarded into a single discard pile for each player.  If a player lands on an opponent by exact count, he may steal one card from the opponent's discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get four cards that match their criminal wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
