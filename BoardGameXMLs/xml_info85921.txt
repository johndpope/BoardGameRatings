			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most gods are honored by a formal church and clerical order, Talus, the god of travel and safe voyages, prefers the service of his Wayfinders. The organization was founded over 200 years ago by a group of caravan guards who were saved from bandits and other perils on their journey by a priest of Talus. Upon arrival at their destination the priest disappeared, though not before he had imparted much of the wisdom of Talus to the guards. Today, Wayfinders are found everywhere, aiding travelers as cartographers, guides, protectors, and explorers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wayfinders of Talus is an 8-page ebook detailing a drop-in organization for your 3rd Fantasy (3.5 Fantasy) game, complete with history, tenets, organizational structures, ways of joining, and ready-to-use NPCs. It also includes the pathfinder prestige class, two new spells and two new feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product was initially titled The Pathfinders of Talus and was changed with the advent of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
