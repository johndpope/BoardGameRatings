							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">UK Cynical Edition (fan expansion for Ticket to Ride)</name>
									
			<description>from Dave Millard&amp;rsquo;s website:&lt;br/&gt;This expansion was created by a small group of game playing friends namely Jay, Alex &amp;amp; Ubbie. It is meant as a bit of fun and is in no way endorsed by Days Of Wonder, any Railway Company or the UK Government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After playing Dave Millard&amp;rsquo;s great UK expansion we collectively decided that it played very well but lacked a certain modern Britishness. The Ticket To Ride games exemplify an idealised 19th century railway system, not the crud we have today. In the UK news a week can barely pass without some train problem or transport minister making an arse of himself. So we decided to put our not so serious heads on and invent an expansion to Dave&amp;rsquo;s unofficial map to bring back those elements we miss from our modern railway system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning, if you have no sense of humour and have no idea of the calamities we have on our railway network you may just not get it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some example card:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Incompetent Contractors: Tunnel built where not needed. Treat route as having 1 tunnel (can be used to counter &amp;quot;Competenc Contractors&amp;quot; instead)&lt;br/&gt;     Pending General Election: Suddenly money can be found to counter any problem. Cancel any other card played on you.&lt;br/&gt;     Government Meddling: Remove a route placed by an opponent and replace route with your own (you must have the cards to build the route)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
