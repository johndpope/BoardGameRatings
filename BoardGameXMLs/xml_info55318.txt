			<description>French cycling game from the '60s about the Tour de France. The game board measure 41 x 32.5 cm, goal is to reach Paris first&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From : &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://users.telenet.be/wielerbordspellen/spellen/spel131/spel131%20-%20engels.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://users.telenet.be/wielerbordspellen/spellen/spel131/sp...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Replica of the old game &amp;ldquo;Jeu de Touristes et Jeu de V&amp;eacute;lodrome that was originally published around 1910 by Saussine in Paris. This replica has appeared in the French cycling magazine Miroir de Cyclisme number 112 of April 1969. The magazine has the dimensions 34 x 26.5 cm, the game board measure 41 x 32.5 cm. Mirroir the Cyclisme have appealed to the collection of Rene Geslin to bring out this reprint. In the course of years, several versions of this game have been published. For example one with the name &amp;ldquo;Tour the France Cycliste &amp;ldquo; in the Fifties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a simple game of goose where a cycling game is played along the outer track of the game board and on the other hand a (initially) tourist car game on the track with the map of France. In the original game cyclists, small cars and bonus cards were provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whit this version comes only the game board and the game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the version of the years ' 50 the layout of the game board has been preserved, but the characters and symbolism has been adapted to the era. Also the rules have been strongly simplified. In the original game bonus points could be deserved at stage wins, this has been completely deleted from the rules and everything has been reduced to a simple game of goose.&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
