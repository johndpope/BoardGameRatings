			<description>From instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Magnetic Game of Toggle Pins&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of skill and action wherein the player tries to pull his own color Toggle Pins into his &amp;quot;fenced-in&amp;quot; area by skillful manipulation of a magnet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bottom portion of the box is used as the playing platform and is first assembled into a raised platform by attaching 4 plastic legs.  Each player sits at one side of the platform next to his or her &amp;quot;GOAL&amp;quot;.  Each player selects 20 Toggle Pins of the same color has their &amp;quot;GOAL&amp;quot; and places them in the center of the board.  Each player then takes a magnet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnets are rubbed under the playing surface to break up the pile of pins and guide them into their home goal.  Each time a player draws a wrong colored pin into their own Goal, they must pick up that pin and one of their own and return both to the center enclosure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
