			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of Lords and King of Kings and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They have emerged not as the hell fury of Revelation but as the bane of humanity. What will you be? A pawn to be played with? Or can you hear than inner voice calling you? Are you one of the chosen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chosen - The Keepers of the Faith is an RPG that takes you into the Light, that strengthens the Faith of the believer and has the faithless wishing they had some Faith. Can your adversities be overcome without Faith? Well, that's the question of life, isn't it? This game is for everyone, a post-apocalyptic tale and Faith-based RPG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chosen - Keepers of the Faith comes complete with an easy to understand game engine (fueled by the d6), three character Profiles to chose from, a unique faith based system that will have you reaching for your bibles, a full description of the post-apocalyptic world of tomorrow, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
