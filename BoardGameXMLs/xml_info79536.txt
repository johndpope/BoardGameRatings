			<description>&amp;quot;Metal Slug 5 (メタルスラッグ 5) is a run and gun video game for the Neo-Geo console/arcade platform created by SNK Playmore. It was released in 2003 for the MVS arcade platform and is the fifth game in the Metal Slug series. The game was developed by Noise Factory/SNK Playmore, after Korean company Mega Enterprise had directed Metal Slug 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biggest difference from previous titles is the addition of the slide move, which allows the player to evade and maneuver in a new fashion. Unlike its predecessor Metal Slug 4, which reused many of the backgrounds from the previous games, Metal Slug 5 incorporates a wealth of new environments and backgrounds and features a more Heavy metal influenced soundtrack. It was later ported to Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation 2 as a separate game in Japan and Europe, and along with Metal Slug 4 as a compilation in North America. It was also ported to PC specifically for a Korean release.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Metal Slug 5 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
