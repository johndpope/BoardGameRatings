			<description>From the publishers web site:&lt;br/&gt;Here comes the adult game from the pipe (game box is cylinder), which includes seven adult dating games favored by the rules. Throwing dice, card games and beautiful components combine in this hilarious package, which is enough fun for the whole bunch! The game needed a stimulant substances are not included in the package.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a lot of cards, including regular deck (two) and special card decks. Game has 7 different adult games from drinking games (2) to actual serious adult fun with scoring and also a trivia game for couples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trivia game:&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with a special trivia cards and dice. Players play in couples and roll a dice. Dice shows the category from which the roller needs to answer. The weird thing is that couple needs to choose another couple from which to give the answer for. For each correct answer you keep the cards. First couple that knows other couples best and collect 6 cards are the winner couple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card game:&lt;br/&gt;Uses 2 classic game decks. Can be played with 2 or with 4 couples. Each couple gets a deck of cards or 2 suits in one color. Hearts and spades in this game act as trumps.&lt;br/&gt;Hearts are a life together and spades are the separation. Game is played in one full circle. With 2 couples the idea is to get rid of all the spades and collect all the hearts. Problem is that they both act as trumps, so getting rid of spades is hard, but there are special rules for Jacks and Queens in other suits that help to make that easier. When all cards are played, couples read their hearts and spades. Each heart is 2 points, each spade is -2 points, each Jack and Queen is extra 2 points (whatever suit) and each Ace is a free drink card (still a party game). Winner is the couple with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;In 4 couple game, game is played the same, but the winning conditions are different. Couples now only score how many cards they have - each red 2 points, each black -2 points. Rest is the same with the exception that 0 is the worst result. That means the further you are from the 0 the higher your score is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Couples game:&lt;br/&gt;Uses the special trivia game cards. This is played in circles, couples sitting against each other. When the times comes to a player, he/she pulls a cards and ask one question from his partner about herself/himself. Partner then writes down an answer along side with the question asker. When the answer are more or less the same, they score one point (a kiss or a hug). Game lasts 10 rounds. Couple with more points (kisses) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other 4 are drinking games (one seems to be a sex game) where there is no actual winners or scoring of any kind. Like they say in the rules - all players are winners with these games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
