							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chasing Eden (fan expansion for T.I.M.E Stories)</name>
									
			<description>Chasing Eden is a custom scenario for the Time Stories boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Times were very different before The Great Peace and the founding of The Time Agency. A powerful government hierarchy wrestled with outlaws and criminal gangs that refused to be quashed. The law was unrelenting and the streets were heavily policed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your team survive this cyberpunk adventure? Chasing Eden is driven by its simple storytelling and evocative artwork. Good luck solving this mystery, and please send through any feedback you might have!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
