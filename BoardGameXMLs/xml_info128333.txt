							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">StarCluster 2 Guide to Cluster Religions</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What the heck? A Science Fiction guide to religion? Everybody in SF is an atheist or agnostic, right? Nobody in the future will have any religions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OK, so we're crazy. We did it anyway.&lt;br/&gt;In the StarCluster, many of the old religions of earth have been warped and twisted, shattered and combined in the face of the Diaspora and destruction of Earth, and the separation of cultures during the long centuries without Jump travel. The StarCluster Guide to Cluster Religions offers a comprehensive view of the major and influential religions of the Cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are such faiths as Grand Catholicism, Cyberlegal Islam (Ahl al-Fiq), Taiping Mormonism, Transhuman Theonarcissism, Old Order Atheism, and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included is a separate section on the Cluster's Humanoid religions, those of the Sastra, Vantor, and Tagris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding a culture without understanding its belief system is a hollow excercise. With the Guide to Cluster Religion, these cultures will become vastly richer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
