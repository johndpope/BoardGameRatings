			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot; Of all the armies of the Inner Sphere, none is as universally feared and respected as that of House Kurita's Draconis Combine. With fighting skills learned in the finest academies and tempered by the ancient code of bushido, the MechWarriors of the DCMS know no equals. Their loyalty and skill are legendary, and their tenacity has won them hundreds of battles across known space. This classified field manual, seized from the Combine's Internal Security Force, reveals the inner workings of the Draconis Combine military, from district regular units to the elite Sword of Light regiments. This document is an invaluable resource for both allies and enemies of the Combine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battletech Field Manual: Draconis Combine contains extensive information about all aspects of House Kurita's military. Every BattleMech regiment of the DCMS is described in detail, including their history, officers and tactics, special rules reflecting the unique abilities of each regiment are included as an optional expansion to BattleTech play. Among the many other features of the book are new weapons, equipment, and BattleMechs unique to the Draconis Combine.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
