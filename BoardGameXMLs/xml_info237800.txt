			<description>In the old west, players have the difficult task of leading large herds of beef through prairies and highlands to the livestock markets. In the course of the journey, players will try to guide the long caravan according to the most favorable route. Once they finally get to the destination, there will be the splitting of the proceeds from the sale. The division, however, will not happen fairly, but according to the rules of the far west: the best armed (or the smartest) takes most of the booty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player turn takes place in this way:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- you MAY change your caravan cards&lt;br/&gt;- you MUST play 1 caravan card on a destination&lt;br/&gt;- you MAY play a character card if you didn't before on this destination&lt;br/&gt;- you MAY apply the effect of the caravan card&lt;br/&gt;- you MAY buy 1 weapon&lt;br/&gt;- you MAY assign weapons to 1 character&lt;br/&gt;- you MUST draw cards to resum your hand of 3 caravan cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a destination is full, the sale takes place and the players get proceeds from the caravan cards based on the effect and the value of the characters they played (the value could be increased by weapons). Then also character cards are splitted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game goes on until the end, that triggers after the 4th sale. At the end, the richest player is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
