			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The carefree activity around Beta Canum often belies the horrible reality of the Kafer was in the bright visible stars overhead. Only the most experienced and fearless crews dare travel through that area of space, through the hotly contested systems of the border. Several centuries of human civilization can attest to the simple fact that a frontier is always a dangerous place to conduct business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LaFarge made its final call at a human port at Hochbaden over two years ago, heading into the middle of the Kafer conflict - on Trilon company business. When they did not return no one was too surprised. They'd probably fallen victim to the war and that was that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now a routine survey vessel has picked up survivors from the crew of the LaFarge and they tell an incredible story of treks across the ice fields of a glaciated world, stories of strange alien races on the verge of civilization. The crew of the LaFarge are coming back to human space after a multi-year odyssey on an uncharted world, a world where evolution of life has been perpetually bound to it exotic Energy Curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the crew of the survey ship LaFarge, you live out the thrill of discovering a truly alien world. Survival will be difficult and will probably depend on the cooperation of a native alien race of beings. Can you communicate with them and can you live among them for what might be years before a human rescue?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
