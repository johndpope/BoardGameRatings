			<description>Time runs out and only few boats remains to escape. Each player manages a gang of animals trying to escape from the zoo by crossing the river. Players has to do their best to put them safely on the different boats. But be careful, if a boat is overweight it might get sink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game last 3 rounds. &lt;br/&gt;Each round has two phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Boarding the boats: Starting with the first player and going in turn order, players have to place their animals on the different boats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Resolution:  Resolving each boat takes place. &lt;br/&gt;Check the boat capacity: If the sum weight of the animals aboard is equal or less than the boat resistance the boat will set sail. If so, players place their animals in their player area, otherwise the boat sinks and animals go to the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful the animals you place on each boat, since depending on the kinds of animal that meet aboard might cause different situations, so some animals might be eaten by other animals or taken out of the boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After finishing the third round the game ends. Players total the weight of the animals in their player area. (those which got to escape on the boats). The player with the most points will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
