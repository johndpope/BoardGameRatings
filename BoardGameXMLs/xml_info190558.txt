			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BATLHEX (pronounced bat'l-heks) is a novel strategy board game played by two opponents who battle against one another with game pieces on a hexagonal board. To win a player must be the first to capture all of the opponent's pieces. Each player&amp;rsquo;s ability to move or return a piece to the board is determined by rolling a die. This highly replayable game, which features a game board, die, twelve game pieces, and a rule sheet, incorporates a unique method of play that makes the game both easy to learn by the youngest players and a challenge for mature gamers. (Level: Beginner-Intermediate)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BATLHEX Commander is a variation of the basic game that removes the die and adds a Commander piece to both sides. The object is to capture the opponent's Commander first. All of the pieces (with the exception of the Commander) share the same unique movement capability, and both player's have a chance to bring a captured piece back during a turn if they occupy a certain hex. BATLHEX Commander allows both players to think several turns ahead and develop various long-term strategies. (Level: Intermediate-Advanced)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
