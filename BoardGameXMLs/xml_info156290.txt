			<description>user summary:&lt;br/&gt;apocalypse girl is an abstract, competitive role playing game in which three (or possibly more) players take on the roles of the Girl, the Dragon and the World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the end notes:&lt;br/&gt;This game was written as a submission for the November 2005 Ronnies. The chosen terms, just in case you missed them, were gun and dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Acknowledgements:&lt;br/&gt;The core mechanic of this game is essentially the dice currency from Ron Edwards's Sorcerer on crack, and as such is probably broken in at least two important places. It also draws heavily on Tony Lower-Basch's Capes, most obviously in the Charges (which are Inspirations by another name) but also in the whole concept of encapsulating every element of the story on a 3&amp;quot;x5&amp;quot; index card. My ideas were also powerfully shaped by several conversations with Tony, and by the online discussions at the Forge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
