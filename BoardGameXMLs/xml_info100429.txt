							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mysterium (1991 / GB)</name>
									
			<description>Taken from the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your life long fascination with alchemy is about to be tested.  You have come to the famous alchemist Hermetrix and been accepted as his apprentice.  The task of an alchemist is to magically convert metals and minerals into gold and other useful items.  After a short introduction to alchemy, Hermetrix has sent you to the Mysterium to prove yourself.  Here you must find your way through twisting halls created by the Arimasp, a race of giant ants who live in the Mysterium.  You must use the pools of transformation with your knowledge of alchemy to create any item you will need.  To pass the test, you must learn the nature of each metal and mineral, and the transforming powers of each process: fire, water, acid and mercury.  When you have mastered alchemy you may succeed in the final test.  You must rescue the giant ant civilization and Cadmia, the alchemist who tried before you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
