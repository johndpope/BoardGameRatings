			<description>From &amp;quot;Adventure Summary and Background:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs must determine their own reasons for being in the Altherian city of Semar. Many of them will be here to celebrate the annual ceremony commemorating the victory over the invading Ssethric horde in 1026 I.C. (those who played in either the Battle of Semar interactive or the subsequent two-round version of LA-SP2-07: The Serpentine Path). Other PCs may be traveling here to witness the festival, which is said to be spectacular, or for a variety of mercantile reasons (in other words, they just happen to be in the right place at the right time).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either way, General Muatma Bunkakin of the Altherian Shining Patrol (who some PCs have met previously) seeks the PCs out (through an adjutant) for a mission. The PCs are needed to find out why there has been no word from several of the outlying fortified outposts along the western border with Ssethregore. With the instability that has been happening throughout the rest of Onara, many nations have pulled back their troops from the Shinning Patrol. As a result, the General is very short-staffed. He needs the PCs to go out to the fortress and find out what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
