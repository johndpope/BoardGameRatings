							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savage Pendragon</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;While Pendragon is a great system, the combat always left me feeling it could be better., somehow it never scaled well for me, and was sometimes TOO deadly. Also, the Mass battle Rules are good, but somewhat more complicated then I like. So here is my conversion to my favorite system. I&amp;rsquo;ll elaborate the SW battle rules a little as well in this conversion. I&amp;rsquo;ll always use he and him instead of she and her in this document. Just easier for me. Remember however, that Pendragon is very well suited for female gamers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use this document, You need the Pendragon books (I used 3rd edition ) or have very good knowledge of the rules to understand my conversion. Certainly only for all the background therein, you should look into, and buy, the Pendragon line! (I haven't got the newest edition yet, but a friend has. I&amp;rsquo;ll look into that edition later to see if I can use anything from that for this conversion)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t change: Money, all rules regarding the manor (only the skills governing some stuff are now different) Knight Values as measurement for Battle stays as well, and everything Governing Glory gain and loss, although they are only used to indicate your renown, and is no longer used for experience purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
