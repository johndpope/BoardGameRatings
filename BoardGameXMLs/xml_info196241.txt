			<description>Let the good old times roll in a beautiful town-building simulation with lots of character(s)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Villagers is a beautifully rendered mixture of a town-building- and artificial people simulation in a medieval, europeanesque setting. Besides a freeplay mode, giving you full access to all of the 25 buildings of the game and a selection of 10 different maps to explore, it comes with a storymode worthy of it's name, including six gripping chapters, each providing an attractive introduction to different aspects of the game.&lt;br/&gt;By telling the story of a group of settlers, this storymode will guide you through the construction of your first village and explain the difficulties of life in medieval times and how to play the game.&lt;br/&gt;Travelling through various different areas, you are going to establish towns in muddy swampland, on a deserted mountainside or rebuild a mysterious ghost town. You are going to encounter travelling artists infected by the plague, fierce bandits and wild animals attacking your townspeople and live the story of your hero and his people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5-6 hours of campaign-gameplay plus unlimited hours of fun in Freeplay-Mode&lt;br/&gt;25 beautifully designed buildings&lt;br/&gt;16 professions, coming with individual clothing sets for the villagers&lt;br/&gt;Sophisticated AI living everyday life, forming families and doing their duties&lt;br/&gt;Production chains e.g. a mill doubling the food income from grain&lt;br/&gt;Challenging subsystems like trading with the merchant, your livestock in the barn and your water in wells and raincatchers&lt;br/&gt;Gripping story, providing joyful introduction to the game in the campaign-mode&lt;br/&gt;16 illustrated and colourful characters&lt;br/&gt;Wonderful music introducing chapters and seasons&lt;br/&gt;Player can choose between a male and female protagonist&lt;br/&gt;English and german localization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
