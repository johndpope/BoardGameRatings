			<description>&amp;quot;Collect, Stretch &amp;amp; Destroy!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle Bands is a collectible elastic band game where players build armies and take turns flicking them at a board. When two opposing bands touch, they &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; using the corresponding character cards to see who wins. The game ends when all players have depleted their armies,and the points are tallied based on where their bands are on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elastic bands are shaped like different creatures, and come in red, blue and green. Each elastics' corresponding card has a strength level for the creature, and players build armies up to a certain level (for example, if they are &amp;quot;brawling, each player's army will consist of creatures totaling a strength of 50).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, each player may add one black elastic band to their army. These black creatures have special abilities which will affect the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game draws heavily from Magic: The Gathering for theme, and from Heroscape for building your army of bands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
