							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Invasion of Europe: The Great War Game</name>
									
			<description>This strategic war game was produced in the years leading up to World War I. Two invading forces are set against each other, a 4 strong Navy against a 5 strong Army. The object is to secure possession of Europe by placing pieces on squares containing &amp;quot;Ringed Cities&amp;quot;. Moves are made by both a die roll and a compass spinner which determines the direction that all moves must be made in. If either Commander cannot move a single one of his forces he must &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; and offer his roll to his opponent who can either use the move or chose to reroll the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
