			<description>Card game made as a promotional item for Dettol, a very popular disinfectand in Britain. The game is endorsed by the Child Accident Protection Trust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards consists of pairs of cards. One of the pair warns of a danger and the other gives advice on how to avoid that danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three games are described in the rules. Keeping Me Safe is the main game. The first player places a danger card face up. The next player checks her hand and plays the advice card on top of it (if she holds it). If not the next player looks, and so on. Once a pair has been completed, the next player lays a danger card and the game proceeds until one player has used all their cards. He/she is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two games are more traditional, Snap and Pairs, but both are a little more difficult because the two cards that match are not mirror images which would be more usual in games of Snap or Pairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
