							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirate Polo</name>
									
			<description>Pirate Polo is a frantic live-action game for 2 - 4 &amp;quot;pirates&amp;quot;. The game is played using a mini-trampoline as the playing surface. Each player has 5 dice of a single, unique color. In the center of the mini-trampoline is set a heavy, non-fragile cereal bowl. The players space themselves evenly around the mini-trampoline and place all five of their dice on the game surface in front of them. Each player has a polo mallet (at times also known as a serving spoon). On the starting signal, all players strike underneath the mini-trampoline with their polo mallet to try to propel their dice into the bowl. The first player to get all 5 dice in the bowl is the winner. This game is an alternative to the difficult to obtain Piratenbillard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
