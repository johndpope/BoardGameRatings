			<description>Anno 1404, known as Dawn of Discovery in North America, is a real-time strategy and city-building game. It was developed by Related Designs and Blue Byte and is published by Ubisoft. Anno 1404 is the sequel to Anno 1701 and is the latest installment in the Anno series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with other Anno games, the player, at the will of their unnamed country of origin, creates and manages their fief aside AI players. The player must colonize islands, plan settlements, set up factories and farms to meet their citizens needs, enter diplomatic relationships with AI players, and engage in naval and ground combat with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the player progresses through the game, they gain access to naval vessels and troops which allow them to invade and ultimately to defeat other players. Anno 1404 features an updated interface, bigger islands and worlds to explore, a sandbox mode and other features new to the Anno series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Anno 1404 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
