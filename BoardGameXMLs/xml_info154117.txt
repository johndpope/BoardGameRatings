							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jennifer vs. The Leprechaun</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty years ago, a horror movie named Leprechaun was made. Its star, then up-and-coming actress Jennifer Aniston, has been trying to forget it ever since. But when she decides to comment on the film to talk show host Conan O'Brien, she learns that leprechauns are sensitive creatures...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... who will beat the heck out of anyone who speaks ill of movies named after them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer vs. The Leprechaun was devised by ROLF! creator L.L. Hundal in observation of the upcoming 20th anniversary of the release of her favorite horror movie, Leprechaun, as well as an opportunity to celebrate her favorite talk show host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring three pre-generated characters, and a slew of combat maneuvers, this supplement returns ROLF!: The Rollplaying Game of Big Dumb Fighters to its roots of super-silly, mindlessly violent battle scenarios that are ideal for playing on the side while you wait for your DM to finish with some boring roleplaying thing or another that only involves specific players at the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
