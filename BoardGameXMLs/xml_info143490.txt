			<description>Theme &amp;amp; Goal&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to be the first to get his/her train token to the destination station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;The plastic insert is put into cardboard frame (i. e. the board) and the 10 cardboard strips with the tracks are placed into it. Each cardboard strip is divided into four areas (one for each player colour). Each player is assigned one train token. All train tokens are placed at the start station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling the die (six-sided, faces show the numbers 1-3). The active player moves cardboard strips according to the die result, i. e. if he/she rolls a 2, he/she can either push one strip two slots into/out of the frame, or push two strips one slot each. At the end of the turn, the active player's train moves as far as it can on a track of that player's colour. If you are the green player, you need to get a green track section in front of your train token before you can move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the destination station wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
