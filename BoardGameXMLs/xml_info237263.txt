			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mark Smith made a number of changes in the show to make it better fit for networks S&amp;amp;P and parents groups. The third season also had a number of budget cuts to make it more profitable. This included cutting down on original music used for each episode and using a cheaper animation style. The show became less violent and contained far less action scenes. Many episodes also where given important social lessons for kids to learn from. The villains where also tone downed to make them less threatening. The changes made the show fell in the ratings quickly. Teenage audience did not like change in stories, lost of action and the show being less dark. Younger kids did not like the static action and the preachy episodes of the new season. The network canceled the show after the third season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
