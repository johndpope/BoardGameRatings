			<description>ROLL DICE KILL MONSTERS HAVE FUN DUNGEON CRAWLER is a fresh take on mazes, this game is more than just finding a path from start to finish, it's also about overcoming the obstacles along the way. The obstacles come in the form of traps and adversaries. The traps are whatever the players imagine them to be they could be a pit of spikes, a falling boulder, etc. The adversaries are met by the players by means of a random encounter system, defeating adversaries will most certainly garner usable rewards for the players. In ROLL DICE KILL MONSTERS HAVE FUN DUNGEON CRAWLER there are two kinds of mazes. The first is to successfully reach the finish from a set start point. The second is to successfully meet and defeat a boss type character. ROLL DICE KILL MONSTERS HAVE FUN DUNGEON CRAWLER is the groundbreaking amalgamation of a board game and an analog role playing game, without any of the convoluted aspects of analog role playing games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
