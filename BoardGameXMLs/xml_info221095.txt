			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Road to Redemption is a difficult one&amp;hellip; Ask the Redeemer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The priest intoned, &amp;ldquo;Gerana has willed it that the Stone of Hearts must be returned to the Great Library, Kothus, you do understand that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is that so?&amp;rdquo; said the black-cloaked man, who cocked his head, his mouth quirked in a smile beneath his unseen eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Was it not sold to the Nerians of Olthar for the price of several indiscreet prophecies, my Lord? A legal, if not an approved of. transaction by the late Pericodion Althus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shaven priest reddened and said nothing.  Kothus replied anyway,&amp;rdquo; Worry not, loan me a ranger and a wizard or two and it will be back in a fortnight.  My Lord.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Redeemer hybrid 20-level class from Purple Duck Games creates the unique combination of paladin (or antipaladin) and rogue, for a holy thief that obeys the will of his patron, to get the job done when no one else will do&amp;hellip; Author Aaron Hollingsworth&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Class: Redeemer from Purple Duck Games brings this intriguing class to life, describing the various reckonings (similar to inquisitor judgements) paladin-like auras, and roguish talents that this versatile class brings to the game.  Alterative reckonings are available to make redeemer characters exactly what you want them to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
