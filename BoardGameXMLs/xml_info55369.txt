							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Romulans</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book (2nd printing):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This rules expansion for STAR TREK: The Role Playing Game provides hundreds of interesting facts about the Romulans, their personality, their history, and their religion. These books also tell about the Romulan Star Empire, the fascinating Eridam Papers that describe it, its government, its relations with the UFP and the Klingons, and its extent. And they tell about the Imperial Navy, its starships, its weapons and equipment, its organization, and its combat tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can find out about the Romulans. All you need is right here to add these mysterious aliens to STAR TREK: The Role Playing Game. Included are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Romulans: Star Fleet Intelligence Sourcebook - This 32-page book contains the latest intelligence on the Romulan people, the Romulan Star Empire, and the Romulan Imperial Navy. It includes up-to-date information that every Star Fleet officer should know if he is to serve anywhere near the Neutral Zone or the Triangle. Its many illustrations show uniforms and equipment, as well as starships, and Romulans engaged in various activities. It also contains short articles written by Commander Spock and others about the Romulans, as well as a short dictionary of common Romulan words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Romulan Way: Game Operations Manual - This 48-page book contains all the information necessary to create and train Romulan characters; a Romulan Character Record also is provided. This information is complete and accurate, unlike the information possessed by Star Fleet Intelligence. With it, a gamemaster may add the Romulans to his game, keeping much of their mystery to his players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
