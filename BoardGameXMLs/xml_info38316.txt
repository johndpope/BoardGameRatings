							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Millennium Wars Advanced: The Lebanon Scenarios</name>
									
			<description>The game explores the past, present, and future of the Arab/Israeli struggle. Includes a 56 page booklet focused on the history behind (and yet to come of) the game. The game is based on the Advanced Millennium Wars system, incorporating asymmetric situations, non-state actors, and political constraints. The game scale is 10km per hex, units are brigades or divisions, or cadres/groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenarios included in the game:&lt;br/&gt;1. '48 War Phase 1&lt;br/&gt;2. '48 War Phase 2&lt;br/&gt;3. '67 War&lt;br/&gt;4. '67 War Jihad (What if)&lt;br/&gt;5. &amp;lsquo;73 War &lt;br/&gt;6. &amp;rsquo;82 Lebanon War&lt;br/&gt;7. &amp;rsquo;06 Military Solution in Southern Lebanon&lt;br/&gt;8. '12 Hypothetical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Millennium Wars system is quite unique relative to traditional wargame designs. Rather than utilize quantitative &amp;quot;factors&amp;quot; for such things as movement and combat, the game is entirely missions based, with each unit being capable of performing a given set of missions as indicated by icons on the backs of the unit counters. Missions are combined into Operations against specific targets, which can include other units in play, populations centers on the map, or political capital. Targets on the receiving end of such operations must execute specific casualty chains to account for losses caused by offensive operations. The game also utilizes a unique &amp;quot;Tier&amp;quot; system that determines the number of phases the units of any given faction may conduct missions per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
