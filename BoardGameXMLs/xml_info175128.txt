			<description>Tank Platoon: West Front is a solitaire game of Armored Combat in Western Europe during World War II. The player assumes the role of a Tank Platoon Leader responsible for securing your Sector of Advance by successfully taking and holding key objectives with the least amount of casualties. Although there are many support units available to you, they may often times be limited to you by political, logistical or geographical obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE &lt;br/&gt;The objective of Tank Platoon is to successfully take and secure a number of key objectives and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for your Nation&amp;rsquo;s Forces. Once all Objectives have been secured or the Campaign Deck is exhausted, the Campaign is considered over. The Player must then total his VP and compare this with the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;Tank Platoon features many colorful counters and includes many combat units including M-24 Chaffees, M-4A1 and M4A3 Shermans, M-26 Pershings, PZ-IVf1s, PZ-IVf2s, PZ-V Panthers, PZ-VI Tigers and a variety of Infantry, ATG and support weapons. Your Tank Crews have the ability to improve their ratings and gain Tank Upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional Rules allow the Player to play as a British Commonwealth Tank Platoon with M5 Stuarts, Mk.VI Cromwells, Mk.VII Churchills and M4A3 Shermans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
