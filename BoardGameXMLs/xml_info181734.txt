			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 40 x 40 inch, full color battlemap of a Drawbridge .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Raise the drawbridge, the enemy is coming to attack the keep!&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Sergeant at Arms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawbridge is an exterior map of a plains field, moat with a lowered drawbridge spanning the center, a fortified wall with four circular towers, and an inner keep. An extra map page has the drawbridge in the raised position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawbridge is intended for use in fantasy or medieval historical settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure idea for this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night of the Undead Siege: The fortress of Stonewall Keep was built by humans. The elves did not appreciate the fortress so close to their borders and took over the fortress in what they called The Battle of Stonefall, renaming the fortress Ivywall Keep after growing ivy along the walls of the stone fortress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A human wizard&amp;rsquo;s son had died in the battle. By calling it the battle of Stonefall, he felt the elves mocked his son&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice to defend the fortress. He hated the elves for their arrogance and for killing his son. Consumed by grief and the need for revenge, he studied forbidden tomes in secret and became a necromancer. He sold his family&amp;rsquo;s manor with no longer any hope of heirs and used it to buy siege weapons and hirelings to prepare for his revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He had the weapons delivered one day&amp;rsquo;s journey from Ivywall Keep by the hirelings. At dawn he began a massive ritual spell to be completed by dusk. The hireling&amp;rsquo;s contract ended at dusk, but they would need to protect him until then. At dusk the spell was complete and he paid the hirelings their money.  As night fell, the ritual spell raised those killed by the battle of Stonefall and any other human corpse a day from Ivywall Keep as skeletons and zombies. Urging his undead army forward, the necromancer reunited with his undead son and they went to slay the elves of Ivywall Keep during an all-night battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group can get involved in two ways, either by stopping the ritual during the day or by helping to defend Ivywall Keep during the all-night battle whilst fighting both the enemy and fatigue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
