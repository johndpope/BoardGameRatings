			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is still in active development and available to the public for purchase in it's unfinished state, either in Early-Alpha or Beta (or any status in between).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A standalone expansion that does not require the main game, Superhot: Mind Control Delete uses roguelike elements to create a series of levels but otherwise follows the same mechanics as Superhot. Levels and challenges will be procedurally generated. The expansion will have the player choose one of several MINDS (the player-character) that each have unique abilities, unlocking these based on their progress in the game, and as they complete levels, gain power-ups that allow them to face tougher challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Superhot&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
