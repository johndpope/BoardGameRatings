			<description>For this game the players rotate as the role of host. The host takes a card and selects one of the three Web Speaks to use. For example, the host might choose the acronym category question, such as ROFL. S/he then reads the acronym aloud and all the other players write down either what they think it means, or a bluff answer to fool the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The host puts the answers in a folder and reads all the answers aloud. Each player then votes what S/he thinks is the correct answer. Players that guess correctly move ahead 3 spaces on the game board. Any player who receives votes for the Web Speak they make up (that isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as the correct Web Speak) moves ahead 2 spaces for each vote they get. The first player to reach the FIN space wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
