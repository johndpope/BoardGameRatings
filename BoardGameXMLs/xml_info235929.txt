			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a list of genuine books on military subjects, including such as history, strategy, tactics, leadership, biographies and autobiographies of military leaders, guerrilla warfare and combating terrorism. Each book has its tile, author, if applicable, publication year, original language, if not English, and some notes on the topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of the books are published in the 20th century or later but there are also some older classics. The books are heavily Western in their subject matter, with a concentration on British and American topics and military affairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The books can be used to flesh out an appropriate modern bookshelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leadership: The Warrior&amp;rsquo;s Art by Barry R. McCaffrey (2001, case studies, concepts of leadership, both ancient and modern, reaching leadership, examples from history including Frederick the Great and American and German experiences in World War II, leadership from the view of followers and creating special operations teams)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
