							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crisis at Marstan</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the last adventure you are now on a quest to find a warm bed and good food. Passing travelers have pointed out that you are quite close to the Thorp of Marstan, a small settlement in the area under the control of the Earl of Sakov. His troops are well known for their horsemanship skills and after all your walking perhaps you may find proper mounts! What the party will find is a community fearful from recent humanoid attacks but with the passing of a guard unit they have hope&amp;hellip;.except the guard unit hasn&amp;rsquo;t been heard from since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for a pair of low level players in the FD series.  This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
