							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tigley (System Neutral Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wracked by disaster, Tigley is a village reborn. Standing on the fringes of a noisome marshland, its folk make their living from the swamp, and harvesting the guano excavated from the caves honeycombing the spire of rock upon which stands much of the village. But all is not peaceful in Tigley. The villagers&amp;rsquo; unique burial rituals have attracted undead to certain nearby sunken ruins and goblins have been seen in the locality. In the village itself, influential figures vie for control of the local industries, a bully uses his influence to spread lies and cause trouble and the village priest hides a terrible secret. Once again, Tigley is a village teetering on the edge of disaster, but this time it is a disaster of the village&amp;rsquo;s own making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
