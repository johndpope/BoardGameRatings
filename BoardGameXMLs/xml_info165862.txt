			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otto Skorzeny is the Nazi's most elite commando. His infamous deeds have earned him the title &amp;quot;The Most Dangerous Man in Europe&amp;quot; in the Allied press. The Nazi propaganda machine has worked hard to embellish his reputation even further, turning him into a virtual superhero to the German people and an arch-villain to the Allies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otto's list of accomplishments is amazing. He has rescued Mussolini, the Italian dictator, from imprisonment in the Alps. He has waged a successful sabotage campaign against the Allies just before the Ardennes Offensive and he has kidnapped foreign leaders and staged coups to overthrow other governments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file contains all known information on the Nazi super commando. It includes a summery of his background and tracks his rapid rise through the ranks of the SS. It also includes a personality description and information on his combat methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This file features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Details on the life and adventures of Otto Skorzeny&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure hooks and setting information&lt;br/&gt;     d20 stats for Otto and his gear (including an experimental combat suit)&lt;br/&gt;     d20 stats for a new prestige class (the Combat Master)&lt;br/&gt;     d20 stats for a new template (Thule Warrior)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
