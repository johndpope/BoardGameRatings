			<description>Game description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top Flopp is a fun trick-taking card game for the whole family. For 2 - 8 players. Aged 10+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three ways to start the game. Based on your cards, you decide and call whether you play: TOP, FLOPP or Chance. If you call TOP you must win each round and all other players will try to trump whereas in a FLOPP round you must lose each round and all other players will try not to trump. If you win a TOP or FLOPP you gain points but if you lose all others get points. When calling Chance you just play a card, which can be trumped or not and everyone has the chance to gain points. The player who trumped then gets to call TOP, FLOPP or Chance&amp;hellip; The player who reached the winning amount of points (depending on the number of players) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing time varies depending on the number of players or the amount of winning points you decide on. reviewers and testplayers played from 15 minutes up to 5 hours (with many rounds and special self-invented challenges for winners or losers ;-).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reviewers and testplayers say Top Flopp is similar to Swiss/German/Austrian traditional card games like Jassen, Schnellen, Schnalzen... and is most fun with 3 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
