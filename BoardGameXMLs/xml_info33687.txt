			<description>The Welsh tafl game Tawlbyund or tawl bwrdd is thought by many scholars to have obtained its name meaning &amp;quot;throwing board&amp;quot; specifically because it most often was played with dice. Linguistically this makes sense but evidence is otherwise scarce. The game was definitely played on an 11x11 grid and a diceless version is described at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.html&lt;/a&gt;. The dice if used would as noted above either have determined if a player got to take a turn or how far he could move a piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
