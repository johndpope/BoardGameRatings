			<description>Sheep is a puzzle game developed by Mind's Eye Productions and published by Empire Interactive for Windows and PlayStation in 2000. The Mac version was ported by Similis and published by Feral Interactive. The Game Boy Advance version was ported by Capcom and published by Empire Interactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released for download from the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 3 and PSP on 14 August 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheep bears some resemblance to the video game Lemmings. The player can choose between 4 herders, the people Bo Peep and Adam Halfpint, and the dogs Motley and Shep. The player must then guide sheep of 4 types (Pastoral, Factoral, Longwool, and NeoGenetic), actually aliens from the planet Ovis Aries, through a series of obstacles to the finish line in the level.There are a series of different worlds, starting with Polygon Farm and on to others, such as Village Fete and Lost in Space. If you collect all the golden sheep trophies in a world, you get to play a bonus game, devised from some other, like Snake (in this version, you are riding a sheep, and have to collect the trapped sheep in bubbles). The obstacles between you and victory vary from world to world, including tractors, knights, archers and demonic chefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sheep (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
