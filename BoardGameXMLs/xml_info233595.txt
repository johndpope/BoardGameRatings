			<description>The object of Scrabble Twist is to form words using the five random letters displayed on the electronic game unit. Players tap in the letters and then twist the unit to bank each word. The more words a player can find, the higher his score. Scoring ranges from three points (for three-letter words) to seven points (for five-letter words).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features three difficulty levels and three different game modes. Party mode is a knockout round in which each player gets 15 seconds to bank a word before passing the game unit to the next player. Turbo mode offers a head-to-head challenge for two to eight players: Each player must bank words to score as many points as possible in 60 seconds. In Solo mode, a single player can practice his word-spotting skills in a 60-second time frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
