			<description>The players shall be able to correctly build new words by adding a prefix and/or suffix to existing base words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player in turn takes the top card from the draw pile OR from the discard pile, not both. If the player can form one or more words, the words are laid on the table in front of that player. Words must have a base word+prefix or suffix or both. (dis+respect) (respect+ful) (dis+respect+ful)&lt;br/&gt;Scores are calculated at the end of the game. The total point values of the words in front of each player are added, along with any bonuses. Point values of the cards remaining in a player's hand are subtracted from the total. Each word which consists of a root word plus two more word parts i.e.: a prefix AND a suffix earns a 5-point bonus. The person with the highest point total wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;54 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
