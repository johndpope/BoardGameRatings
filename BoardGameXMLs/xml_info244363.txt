							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Order of Vampire Hunters: Gugadeth and the Beast Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for The Order of Vampire Hunters includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Highly Detailed Plastic Miniature, Gugadeth and the Beast.&lt;br/&gt;2 Vampire ID Cards.&lt;br/&gt;10 Elder Influence Cards.&lt;br/&gt;1 Rule Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both Gugadeth and the Beast are Elder Vampires. They have their own Elder Influence Cards, and can be added to any Hunt that includes an Elder Vampire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUGADETH AND THE BEAST&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gareth was a kennel master living on a small country estate. When the Night swept through, he was feeding the hounds, making sure the pack leader, Dex, did not take too much more than his fair share. The Vampires sensed the vicious nature of the hunting dogs, so it was the pack that the Vampires turned, while the workers and family were simply drained as food. But the kennel master&amp;rsquo;s de&amp;not;votion to his pack gave him the strength to cling to this world, although the corruption in his dying body meant he was no longer truly capable of that emotion.&lt;br/&gt;Caring for the pack of Guardians was now his new role in the clan and soon the pack ran at the vanguard of the Vampire raiding parties. With so much blood spilt, his power grew, as did the Guardian&amp;rsquo;s alpha, who was seemingly immune to the harm that caused attrition to the pack. What was devotion was now an unholy bond, passing power in both directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slowly the pack began to spend more time hunting and sleeping alone. Despite their ag&amp;not;gression, Guardians fell in battle, and eventu&amp;not;ally it was just the pair that was left. No-one from the clan was there to chastise the kennel master for his slack work, but then, he was no mere minion anymore and would not take criticism easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, Gareth and Dex had grown to be the Elders Gugadeth and the Beast, forever bound as a pack of two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
