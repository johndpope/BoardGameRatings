			<description>Banzuke Shoushin (番付昇進 'Rise through the ranks of sumo') is - as the name already indicates - a sumo wrestling career simulation game. Hence, it does not focus on individual bouts (even though hundreds of fights are simulated during the game), but on the whole of a rikishi's (sumo wrestler) career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 rikishi in the game, but only a small number of those are player-controled; the others are 'automated', i.e. controled by the game. The game is intended to be played by a very small number of players or solitaire. In principle it could work with up to 6, but it is recommended for 2 or 3 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a single game year, rikishi first train, which means that they improve their skills in 1 or 2 of 5 different areas of skill (endurance, strength, weight (yes, that's a skill here...), speed, technique). In the meanwhile their oyakata (stable masters, comp. coaches) try to improve their spirits, which works like a 6th skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After training the basho (tournament) begins. A whole year of sumo (6 basho) is condensed into a single tournament (of 45 bouts) in the game. Every bout is decided by the match tactic and a number of dice. Rikishi can try to influence the match tactic such that it matches their strongest skills (or the opponent's weaknesses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the basho the banzuke (ranking) is adjusted, rikishi age one year, and some retire (forcibly or voluntarily).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing one game year takes about 45 to 60 minutes, most of which is taken up by the tournament. Consequently, simulating a 10-year sumo career will take up to 10 hours. It is, however, easy to store away the game in between years, and thus to play the game in many different sessions spread out over a longer period of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
