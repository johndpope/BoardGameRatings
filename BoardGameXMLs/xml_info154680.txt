			<description>Chanakya's Chakkravyuh is a unique learning tool in the form of a financial board game. Its main purpose is to help players from all walks of life (including common man, entrepreneurs, corporate professionals, students, educators, home makers, investors) attain financial literacy. Minimum age is 15 years and above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the 2000-year old wisdom of prominent Indian economist Chanakya, this game enlightens individuals on how to manage money and connect financial knowledge to resourceful opportunities, which are ever-present in today's changing world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player initially chooses a dream out of various dreams listed on the board. Each dream has a purchase price listed on it. In order to win the game, the player must purchase his/her pre-selected dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two parts in the game, the first is Chakkravyuh and second is Rajmarg. All players start inside the Chakkravyuh. In the first part of the game, a player may not have enough money to buy his/her dream. Chanakya's Chakkravyuh simulates real-life investment opportunities, various market scenarios, and unforeseen life situations to throw challenges that the participants have to tackle. By successfully navigating these challenges and deriving &amp;quot;passive income&amp;quot; (income where each rupee works to bring you even more rupees), participants eventually build enough income generating assets to move into the second part of the game, i.e. the Rajmarg. It is in the Rajmarg that the player can acquire their pre-selected &amp;quot;dream&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though there is no official time limit, the entire game normally lasts about 4 hours. The first player to purchase his/her dream wins the game, and that is officially the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiential nature of a game-based environment makes the process of learning a lot more fun, and there is also a sense of competition among the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides gaining financial knowledge and learning how to leverage passive income, participants will understand the real difference between an asset and a liability. Additionally, important lessons will be learned in basic accounting principles, debt financing, interpersonal communication, negotiations and joint deal-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No background in business or finance is required. Absolutely anyone can play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
