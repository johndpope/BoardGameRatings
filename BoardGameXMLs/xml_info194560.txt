			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alpha is a territory and connection game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the cells of a hexhex board, which is initially empty. The suggested board size is between 5 and 8 cells per side. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of black and white stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A group is a set of connected, like-colored stones. A single stone is also a group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must place one stone of any color on an empty cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the board is full. A player's score is the product of the size of the largest group of their color and the number of distinct groups of their color in the final position. The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, whoever has fewer stones of their color on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pie rule&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pie rule is used to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
