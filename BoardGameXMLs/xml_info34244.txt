			<description>A  seventeenth century French game played on a Backgammon board. Each player only uses three pieces. The pieces race in the same direction along opposite edges of the board rather than circling the entire board as in Backgammon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces start off board. Entry and movement are determined by the roll of two dice. The number on each die may be used separately to move two pieces or combined to move a single piece, except when doubles are rolled in which case the player is only allowed to move the amount shown on a single die (i.e. on a roll of double sixes, the player is allowed to move only one piece six spaces). Rolls which may not be played are lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player's pieces must remain in their order of entry - there is no passing - and two pieces cannot share a space except when they reach the home space (the twelfth point) at the end of the board. When a piece is moved to a space which is immediately opposite a space containing an opponent's piece (except the home spaces at the end of the board), the opposing piece is sent back off the board to re-enter on that player's next roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
