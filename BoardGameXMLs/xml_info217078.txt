			<description>28mm miniatures 23rd Century sci fi wargame. Player vs player or co-op, 1 vs game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The apocalypse has come bringing forth the legions of hell. Demons obliterate and corrupt entires systems. The technology advanced militaries unite and battle the demons throughout the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose form a dozen races, from humanoids, aliens, robots, monsters and demons.  Command massive tanks and mechs. Destroy with arch demons and arch Angels. Lead your army to victory with hundreds of units and heroes to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those liking the western armies, the Alpha Omega and Invictus Dominae are to command. For Asia fans, the Ming styled with manga art. For the darkness, choose the rough art of the demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An average game is 800 points with around 30 miniatures per side. deploy first and take your turn first.  set up the scenery or play on the massive multi tiled board maps provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move and attack. you can move all your units then attack or move and attack with which ever model you choose.  Average moment is 10 inch and fast units are 12, jet packs 14 and heavy unit 8.  Firearms like shotgun have a range of 10.  Sub Machine Gun 14, Light Machine Gun 16 and rifles 18.  Sniper rifles are 22 and 24. Once within range declare you target. you do not roll instead the target is hit automatically.  If your unit has a firepower of 6 then it does 6 damage. But there are things that could affect this result for say the defending unit may has Relfex skill which is -1 to all incoming firearms damage or maybe they are wearing one of the many types of armour available which could avoid the attack all together. Stealth armour can be shot at from more than 12 inch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit has many skills and levels. the higher the level the better but more points they cost. Heroes are the best at level 5 and have around 10 skills each and can shoot 3 different weapons per turns or attack like melee and psychic abilities etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some abilities are Lock On which means the enemy do not get a cover save. At the beginning of the game you also choose 3 army powers which you can use one powerful army power per turn but only once. Do not tell the other player your powers. You also choose your Dominus (General) and give that unit a Dominus power which is very powerful but if that unit dies and you've not yet used your power then tough luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melee is the same as shooting.  Move within 1 inch and attack. do the calculation of - and + for the skills in affect to give the total damage caused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blast weapons use a scatter dice. Pick the target and roll a D6 (6 sided dice) and the arrow scatter dice.  If its a hit then anyone under the Blast marker is hit. Small blast is a 3 inch circle, large is 5 and there are other like flamer templates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each units gets  Grimm Reaper roll (saving throw) once there health is gone.  Roll the dice and its a 50/50 chance of life or death. If its life then place a 1 nect to them for 1 health left.  Level 1 units only get to roll the saving throw once. nect time hit they die. Level 2's get two throws up to level 5. Heroes though get to reroll failed throws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standard game is kill the enemy army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HQ mission is destroyed the enemy HQ which has 50 health points. You can upgrade you HQ with guns and traps. Also you can capture building throughout the map. Different building grant various positives like orbital strikes, shields, forward drop zones etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;void missions is a 1 player or co-op which your uses only your heroes to move around the map trying to find tech to close the worm holes. the worm holes continues to bring in evil flesh eating demonic cannibals (Ravenger's) Each wave bring more baddies and tougher monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vector missions is a Hero vs Hero combat only. choose your 4-5 unit squad and fight the other unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the standard mission after turn 3 your map is invaded by the Ravenger's which can be a game changer. Ravenger's are player by the game and attack who is close by. Also entering new rooms there may be a chance that Ravenger's are inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
