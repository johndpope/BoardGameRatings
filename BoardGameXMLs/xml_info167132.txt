			<description>designer summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Coming... Is a storytelling game where you and your friends can create a great horror story in around an hour without any pre-game prep. Designed to be free form and as fun as possible, your story will progress along storytelling 'beats' to mimic the way screen plays flow while being highly adaptable to the tabletop setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell the story of a coven of witches turning a small town into their plaything, of cultists raising the Cthulhu from the deep, or of simple Florida gator hunters who find themselves hunted by something far worse than a gator...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's Coming... Can be as serious or as campy as your players want it to be! It is also part of a series of storytelling games that can be played in one hour or less produced by Heathen Kings Press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
