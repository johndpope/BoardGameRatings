			<description>From the instruction sheet:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Qal&amp;quot;  -- pronounced &amp;quot;Cal&amp;quot; -- is a Bible-times word that means &amp;quot;to remember.&amp;quot; Qal is an interesting and challenging game of memory -- one where even younger non-readers can compete effectively with adults and teens. ...&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to find and match as many of the 18 different Bible symbols as possible. When played for advanced learning, the secondary object is to find the Bible verse which is referenced by the matched symbol. ...&lt;br/&gt;After all symbols have been matched, players count the number of markers they have collected to determine the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
