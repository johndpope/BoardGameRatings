			<description>The game board is a square grid showing a meadow which is enclosed by stables, a river and some trees. The goal of the game is to have the fattest cows (i.e., the cows who ate the most grass, in the form of green plastic chips).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eighteen event chips showing different weather conditions. Sunny weather means the cows are moving around eating grass. Lightning kills all cows standing in the water or under a tree. Cows caught in the rain (i.e. are not in the stables or under a tree) catch a cold and cannot eat in the next turn. If there is dry wind (after a sunny turn), new grass grows. Wind after rain also damages the cattle's health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a push your luck element - which locations are safest while offering good grazing grounds? The stables are safe, but the cows don't get fat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all eighteen events have been played, the player with most grass chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
