							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legerdemain Betrayers</name>
									
			<description>designer blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of magic in public is punishable by death. Those who risk exposing the community of magicians must be dealt with swiftly. Jack Tennyson, Madeleine Khaw, Alexander Dabila, and Marcus Fax must die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Legerdemain Betrayers follows four magicians who have been using magic in public. Though veiled as entertaining tricks, the magic they use is real -- and, unfortunately for them, this has earned them no favor with the Coven. Until now,they had believed that these abilities were exclusive to them. Whether the Coven cares about this or not is uncertain, but one thing is sure: They have summarily decided to execute the magicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rousing after having been knocked out, the four find that they have been abducted and taken to an old warehouse for execution. Luckily, their abductors have stepped out for a moment, giving them the precious time they need to form a plan of escape. This is where their story begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
