After trying these rules, you'll never go back to the core d20 grappling rules again!&lt;br/&gt;'Advanced Grappling for Beginers: How to Master Your Chi (originally called Grappling for Advanced Students): these rules expand the grappling rules introduced in Grappling for Beginners, introducing new unarmed combat feats and prestige classes while keeping the elegant simplicity of Grappling for Beginners grappling rules.&lt;br/&gt;Carnage for Beginners: How to Fight with Flair: a set of mini plug-in systems designed to add a swashbuckling edge to your combats. A simple system for critical hits and fumbles, rules for random battlefield events which affect the combatants or the environment, and introducing Stunt Areas, colorful maneuvers which characters may use while in combat, and which serve to liven up combats, creating more interesting and varied battles - now your character can easily swing from that chandelier!&lt;br/&gt;Drinking for Beginners: How to Survive Dwarf Spirits: these are EN Publishing's drinking rules, revised after appearances in EN World Gamer and Tournaments, Fairs &amp;amp; Taverns. Never again will you scramble to invent rules for drinking on the fly as your characters engage in an impromptu drinking match!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;Grappling for Beginners: How to Strike, Hold, and Throw&lt;br/&gt;by Russell Morrissey&lt;br/&gt;Grappling for Advanced Students: How to Master Your Chi&lt;br/&gt;by Russell Morrissey&lt;br/&gt;Carnage for Beginners: How to Fight with Flair&lt;br/&gt;by Russell Morrissey&lt;br/&gt;Drinking for Beginners: How to Survive Dwarf Spirits&lt;br/&gt;by Russell Morrissey and Ryan Nock&lt;br/&gt;with artwork by Joe Calkins of Cerberus Illustration&lt;br/&gt;and additional artwork from the public domain&lt;br/&gt;and updated layout by Eric Life-Putnam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
