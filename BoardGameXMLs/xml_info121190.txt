			<description>Object of the game is to be the first players to have toured the multicultural France (central hexagon) and have successfully responded to the ultimate question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls the dice to determine his home community (Africa, Asia, No Paper, North Africa, France, Europe)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, a player rolls the dice and moves his pawn as many spaces. If it lands on a space issue, it must draw a card question and answer it before the end of the hourglass, otherwise it returns to its original square. If it lands on a space event, he must draw an event card and follow the instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After answering a final question of his community, the game is won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
