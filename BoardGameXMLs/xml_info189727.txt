							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fish Side</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Driven by the opportunity to fulfill the needs of roleplayers, we introduce to you this innovative and outstanding project.  This supplement is a mixture of descriptions and adventure ideas connected with the town of Fish Side.  Because Fish Side is fleshed out with illustrations and descriptions of its locales, rather than particular rules, it can readily be used with any fantasy RPG system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most pages are divided into two parts.  The top half is for game masters.  There, you will find detailed descriptions of Fish Side as well as ideas for adventures.  The bottom half is a set of illustrations that you can easily print and cut out as hand-outs for your players during the game, in order to enrich the description and verisimilitude.  Included at the end of this supplement is a four-page, unkeyed map of the town that is perfect as a hand-out.  We hope that you enjoy our little town of Fish Side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
