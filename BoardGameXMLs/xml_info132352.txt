			<description>The game consists of task cards, which show an animal and are placed openly on the table, and animal cards, which show three different animals and are dealt to the players. The players place one of their animal cards on the table. If three of the same animal can be found on the table, the player who notices touches the dog meeple and names the animal. The player gets an animal card as a reward. If he or she can find another set of three animals on his or her collected cards, s/he can take the task card. When the stack has been played through three times, the players count their points: An animal card counts one point, a task card counts three points. The player with most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
