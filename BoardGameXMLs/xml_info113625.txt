			<description>Tuff E Nuff, fully titled as Hey Punk! Are You Tuff E Nuff? and known in Japan as Dead Dance (デッドダンス), is a 1993 head-to-head fighting game produced by Jaleco for the Super Nintendo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is set in a post-apocalyptic Earth in the year AD 2151. To the inhabitants on Earth it seems like the only chance for a decent life is to fight, in a &amp;quot;survival of the fittest&amp;quot; scenario. A man named Jado finds a powerful blue fighting armor and calls himself &amp;quot;The Fighting King&amp;quot;. With it, he quickly gains control of the world. Using his newfound power, he erects a tower with six guards. Many try to take Jado's power away, but unfortunately, they die in their attempt. Some weeks after the building of the tower, a tournament is held all over the world to see who is the strongest. Of the many fighters, only four people are chosen. Now they need to fight each other to see who is going in the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played with one to two real players. The game starts off with only four characters, but a Boss Code can unlock the other seven characters. The game has three modes: Story Mode, 1-Player to CPU Mode, and Multiplayer Mode. The fighting engine is a traditional style, 4-button engine. The B and A buttons are the kicks, being light and fierce respectively, and the Y and X buttons are the punches, light and fierce respectively. All characters have at least two special attacks. In all modes, the more life anyone loses, the more bloody the characters' faces become, much like in SNK's Art of Fighting series; however, like the final epilogues of the main characters, were removed from the North American and European versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are ten stages in story mode, where either Syoh, Zazi, Kotono and Vortz fight. After picking a character, the player must fight the other three in a tournament-style fashion. After fighting the other heroes, the player must fight the six guards leading to Jado. After fighting Jado, there is an ending sequence (only in the Japanese version) followed by a screen saying to go to hard mode, or a congratulations for the completion of beating hard mode. After beating hard mode, the closing credits show a clip of the players' battles with the enemies faced. The four main characters' skills evolve over story mode, featuring a RPG-like element, meaning their special moves become slightly larger and more powerful after each group of opponents are defeated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tuff E Nuff&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
