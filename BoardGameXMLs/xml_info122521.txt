			<description>Hexzled is a highly addictive puzzle game based on the popular Flood-It game, however Hexzled takes this simple concept into innovative new ways adding new elements to enhance the game play experience. Introducing both a puzzle mode and free play mode, gamers can pick if they want to go through the gauntlet of brain challenging puzzles that will test your nerves or sit back for a causal free play game. New game play elements include a timed mode, where you have limited time, but unlimited moves to solve a puzzle, inner-hexes, which adds a new dimension to solving a puzzle, voids which contain no color and are a general annoyance, and fog where you must remember what color is underneath. There is unlockable content that will be rewarded upon completion of various achievements that are gained throughout playing the game in both free play and puzzle mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
