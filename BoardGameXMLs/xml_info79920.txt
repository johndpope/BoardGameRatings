			<description>Fatal Fury 2 (餓狼伝説２ ～新たなる闘い～ Garō Densetsu 2 Aratanaru Tatakai, &amp;quot;Legend of the Hungry Wolf 2: The New Battle&amp;quot;) is a 1992 fighting game released by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home platforms. It is the sequel to Fatal Fury: King of Fighters and the second game in the Fatal Fury franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fatal Fury 2 was the second game in SNK's 100-Mega Shock series, offering improved graphics and gameplay over the original Fatal Fury. The play controls were modified, this time making full use of the Neo-Geo's four button configuration, by including four attack buttons (Light Punch, Light Kick, Strong Punch, and Strong Kick). The player can also dash towards the opponent or retreat by pushing the lever right or left twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two line battles from the first Fatal Fury has been retained. This time, the player can change freely between either lines by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously for the Line Move. The player can also perform a Super Power Attack that will knock the opponent to the other line. When the opponent is another line, the player can press either punch button to jump towards the opponent with a Low Light Move Attack or either kick button for a High Line Move Attack. Certain stages have hazards in the background line, such as electrified wires or a stampede of bulls, and thus the player cannot change lines, but can knock the opponent to the other line, causing extra damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other specialized techniques have been added as well. After the player guards an opponent's attack, they follow it up with a special counterattack technique known as an Evasion Attack. The player can also taunt the opponent by pressing the Hard Punch button from a distance. Fatal Fury 2 also introduces Super Special Moves, a powerful type of Special Moves that can only be used when the player's life gauge is at 25% and flashing red.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single-player mode has the player facing against all eight characters (including a clone of the player's character), followed by four computer-only boss characters. After every fourth match, the player will participate in a bonus round for more points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Fatal Fury 2 , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
