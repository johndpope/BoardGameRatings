							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightfall</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the adventurers' ship entered the system out of FTL, they immediately discovered that a solar storm was headed their way. But the danger posed by the storm paled into insignificance compared to what was waiting for them on the asteroid on which they took shelter, and within the derelict starship that had gotten there first. Madness, disease, and murder is the fate of all who dare board the lonely vessel. And the nearest help is millions of kilometers away...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nightfall is a short, no-frills adventure for Cepheus Engine and other tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic (including The Original 2D6 Science Fiction Game) starring characters of varied career backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
