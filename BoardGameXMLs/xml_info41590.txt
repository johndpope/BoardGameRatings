			<description>You&amp;rsquo;re a miner.  You want to make enough money to live the easy life.  If you work hard and save up enough money then you can retire and leave the working to other suckers.  But beware, life in the mine is hard. There are thieves and hazards all over and you must be ready to deal with them in order to get ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the hazards faced will be Cave-ins, pockets of gas and of course the other desperate men who work the mines.  You will not be working alone though... you can purchase the highest technology that 1850 has to offer... the pick-axe, the flood pump and even dynamite... a miner's best friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
