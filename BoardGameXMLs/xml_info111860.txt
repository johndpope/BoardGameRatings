			<description>A mathematical game for 2 to 4 players. Each player has 9 balls in his game colour. The playing field is 6x6 and numbered from 1 to 36. If it is your turn, you have one minute (egg timer) to roll 3 regular dice and arrange them in a formula with the four basic mathematical operations. The result is where you put your ball. The target space must be unoccupied. If you can not create a formula in one minute for a free space your turn ends. If you achieve 3 or more own balls in a row you get VP. If you get five own balls in a row the game ends.  The first to have no more balls ends the game also. Player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
