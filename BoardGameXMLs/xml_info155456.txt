			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TERMINUS: PRISON PLANET&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year 5027 A.D. the most notorious gang of villains are the Wanglers. A teenage group, from various worlds in the Empire, they have spread chaos throughout the Galaxy with their anti-education campaign. School computers have been deactivated on hundreds of planets due to their insidious activities leading to more free time for the pupils and an increased level of social satisfaction (ie. happiness) across the Empire. THIS MUST STOP AT ONCE. We are not to enjoy ourselves. We are here to serve the Emperor and all this playing of games during indoctrination time ahs to be stamped out. It could lead to an independent thinking generation that will question the status quo. They will want CHANGE!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have the Wanglers leader locked up at last, on Terminus our most impregnable prison planet. He must not be allowed to escape at any cost. Ever. If the gang is foolish enough to try to get him out, let them. We will annihilate them one by one and rid ourselves of the menace of Wangling once and for all. No-one will ever wangle a day off school ever again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long live the System!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can select from four characters. Mobod and Xann can fly, but need to recharge their energy in order to do so. Magno is able to attach to the ceiling, which allows him to bypass some traps. Spex is able to bounce around, with the ability to change direction in mid-air. He can be used to climb vertical shafts. Getting to a teleport terminal allows the player to switch characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits from inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written, programmed, conceived and generally done by Paul Hargreaves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
