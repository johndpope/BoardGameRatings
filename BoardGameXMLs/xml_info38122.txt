			<description>&amp;quot;Two player Card game depicting Napoleonic era warfare.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses two card decks, the Battalion Deck and the Tactics Deck. The Tactics deck is composed of maneuvers, formations, weapons, incidents, and terrain types. The Battalion Deck consists of thirty three types of military units (Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are played on the table in battlefield positions representing the Left Flank, Left Center, Center, Right Center, and Right Flank positions. The first player to be routed from three of the five forward positions loses the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules served as the basis for the game Ready Aim Fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
