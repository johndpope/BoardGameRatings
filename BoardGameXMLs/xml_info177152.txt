							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Skylanders: Giants (Nintendo 3DS)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skylanders: Giants for the Nintendo 3DS is the 2nd installment of the Skylanders series to be released for the 3DS. The 3DS versions of Skylanders are considered companion stories to their big brothers on the consoles and PC. Giants for 3DS has its own story and play style. Here are some of the main differences:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A different story about Skylanders thwarting an attempt of a nefarious Pirate, Frightbeard, to free his pirate brethren from their thousands of years of captivity From the Chest of Exile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Much stronger emphasis on platforming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Jumping and double jumping is possible with all Skylanders (there is no jumping in the console version).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Before each level you import two Skylanders into the game to use on that level.  There is no swapping once the level has started.  If both Skylanders lose all their health before the level is over you must start from the begging of the level again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Single Player is the only option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
