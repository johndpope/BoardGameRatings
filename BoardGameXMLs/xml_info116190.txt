			<description>TSL is an adventure game by Ulf &amp;Aring;str&amp;ouml;m, similar in style to the classic &amp;quot;Rogue&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;You play the role of an adventurer exploring a bleak and hostile world. Battle peculiar beasts and overcome sinister traps. Improve your character by replacing body parts with machinery. This is no ordinary &amp;quot;fantasy&amp;quot; setting. Everyone loses, everyone dies.&lt;br/&gt;TSL has quick gameplay and high replay value. Each game is randomly generated and has different levels, item and monster placement. Turn-based gameplay gives you ample time to think about each move. There is more than one way to deal with each situation. There is no need to &amp;quot;grind&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;level up&amp;quot; - only player skill counts. You start each game with the accumulated knowledge of previous sessions.&lt;br/&gt;TSL is not easy and forgiving - it is actively trying to kill you and requires great skill to outsmart. Death is permanent: when you die, there is no way to bring a character back. While this might sound discouraging at first, the appeal lies in the trial and error, discovery itself. Even death tries to be fair and educational: every time you die, you will know what killed you and learn not to do that again. Eventually you will master rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
