			<description>YOU ARE STRANDED ON A DESERT ISLAND!&lt;br/&gt;You're on an ocean liner crossing the Pacific when a gigantic wave knocks you overboard.After several hours floating on a wooden crate, you land on the shores of a tropical island. You have no way to get home! You could explore the island, but you can't be sure what you will find. Perhaps you should stay where you are and hope to signal a passing ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you decide to stay where you are, turn to page 45.  If you decide to go exploring, turn to page 36. But be careful! The island seems deserted, but there could be many dangers waiting for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the tropical island, you might come face-to-face with a roaring gorilla. Or you might find people there who will help you find a way home! What happens next while you are stranded depends on the choice you make. Some of your adventures will be scary, some will be exciting - but all of them will be fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(back of book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
