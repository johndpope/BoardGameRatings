			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bevy of Blades contains 4 classes designed by Brian Moran. &lt;br/&gt;Each of these classes centers on the summoning and use of a specific blade and the quirks that go with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Aether Blade forms his weapon from the raw magic around him. His force of personality allows him to produce a myriad of with different auras. The ability to meld his blade with an item, also allows for him to bond with a wand, staff, or rod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light shining upon all things is always mirrored by a darkness. Pulling from its effects the Shadow Blade uses this shapeless form to her advantage. Able to strike unexpectedly from the shadows, she learns shroud secrets of the past and conjurers dark revelations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nature calls to rangers and druids to protect and serve the wilds, while a Verdant Blade is a blessed champion of nature. Given the secrets of the woad weapon, she discovers various types of seeds that can grow into different effects. Fused with nature, she is able to temporary create makeshift items and harness the power of a treant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With his sanguineous sword, a Vital Blade draws his power from his own blood.
