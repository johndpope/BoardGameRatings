			<description>From the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Galaxy wide game of shipping and trading and exploration and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were two books:  A game manual and an exploration manual.&lt;br/&gt;There was also a map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was very crudely produced.  Star Travel is instantaneous so most time is spent finding and haggling over cargo, unfortunately this is done virtually entirely using random die tables.  There is a lot of background information, but the gameplay is so driven by random die rolls that it is virtually unplayable.  It is the equivalent of an RPG-Roguelike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
