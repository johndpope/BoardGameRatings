			<description>Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ri+Val (Ritual) is a game of strategy based on the Books of Rituals. &lt;br/&gt;The books are collections of rituals, where each page is an ancient manuscript with which you can tackle your opponent. &lt;br/&gt;In Ritual every player embodies the spirit of an Immortal Sorcerer who must demonstrate his magical abilities and strategic skills. &lt;br/&gt;Each book is protected by 5 seals: once they are destroyed the Sorcerer can take possession of the opponent's Book: &lt;br/&gt;the ultimate goal is to control as many books as possible becoming the most powerful sorcerer in History!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setting:&lt;br/&gt;Millenias ago, an ancient powerfull civilazation was at its most high evolution point. All of its society was based on the magic and spiritual power of Nature. There were five Guilds,&lt;br/&gt;Earth, Fire, Water, Air and the Guil of Destiny which rulled them all with justice and equity.&lt;br/&gt;One day Evok, the demon spirit of the Abyss, escaped from his century long imprisonment. He promised revenge over the ones who chained him for so long in Darkness.&lt;br/&gt;Gathering all sorts of evil souls and demons he attacked with fury the Capital of that ancient world.&lt;br/&gt;The flames reached the sky, floods destroyed the land and everything seeemed near to an end...&lt;br/&gt;The most powerfull Sorcerers then united their powers for the final battle against Evok: after an epical fight the evil spirit was resealed in his Jail forever.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunatly, that ancient world was destined to extinction, therefore the Sorcers wrote down on books all their knowledge and magic power.&lt;br/&gt;Now these books have returned to chose the future of this world: who will be the most powerfull Sorcerer?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Game Rules:&lt;br/&gt;Every player has a book which contains 33 Rituals&lt;br/&gt;Evey book is &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; by 5 Seals (this can be read as every player has 5 life points)&lt;br/&gt;The Rituals are devided in Curses, Blessings and Summonings&lt;br/&gt;which use Runes to be cast in to play.&lt;br/&gt;They also have Element Points and Seal points which show the&lt;br/&gt;power of every single Ritual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn you have 5 Runes to use.&lt;br/&gt;The Turn is divided into &lt;br/&gt;1-Casting Phase: &lt;br/&gt;put into play the Rituals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-Combat Phase&lt;br/&gt;fighting phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-Closing Phase&lt;br/&gt;resolution of combat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the general description of the game's rules,&lt;br/&gt;shortly it will be available on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
