			<description>Requiring no prior bible knowledge, Inheritance teaches the Seven Pillars of Wisdom (Prov.9:1) while players have fun trading, hugging, paying tithes and making offerings for the poor. The winner ascending to the center of the inner board celebrates Christ as the Lamb of God in a final result where everyone wins as &amp;quot;Happy is the man who finds Wisdom.&amp;quot; (Prov.3:13).  &lt;br/&gt; Designed for 3-7 players and ages from 8-to adult, game play in Inheritance offers a level of play which will be immediately familiar to both Monopoly and Parcheesi players, providing a completely new board game experience and principally cultivating the Wisdom of God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
