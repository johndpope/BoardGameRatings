							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GURPS Martial Arts (Second Edition)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Exotic Combat Systems From All Cultures&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major expansion of the original edition, it added 48 pages of new material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masters of Death&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mystic ninja who can kill with a single blow... the boxer with the lightning hands... the swordsman and his razor edged saber - all these evoke the mystique and excitement of exotic martial arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you prefer tournament competitions, the stark realism of the mean streets and the evening news, or the high-kicking, door smashing action of comics and the silver screen, Martial Arts can bring your battles to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Martial arts presents rules for over 50 different armed and unarmed fighting arts, including the historical and modern styles of both the East and the West, as well as fantasy and science fiction styles. Each style is presented in both its realistic and cinematic forms. From the French fencing of swashbuckling cinema to Kendo down at the dojo, from Kung Fu at the Shaolin Temple to Savate on the piers of Marseilles, Martial Arts has it all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book covers everything you need to introduce martial arts into your campaign, including new advantages and skills, extensions to the combat system and over 60 new combat maneuvers. It also includes a variety of sample characters, complete rules for creating and customizing styles and maneuvers, sections on the history and philosophy of the martial arts, and statistics for special martial-arts weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
