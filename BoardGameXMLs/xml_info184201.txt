							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ticktock</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He deals in lead... Ticktock, the Clockwork Kid!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Power Level 10 Rogue, Ticktock is a steampunk android with an itchy trigger finger. A perfect way to bring an &amp;quot;Old West&amp;quot; theme to your superhero campaign, Ticktock's favorite capers can be pulled right from your favorite western films! He also comes complete with a posse of robots he's roped into his gang, should you need a quick villain group for an episode. Ticktock the Clockwork Kid is an iconic figure in the Beacon City universe, but can be dropped into any campaign with very little alteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ticktock is designated &amp;quot;Blue&amp;quot; for his technological origins, as are the members of his Robot Roundup. This can make him a great nemesis for technological superheroes, but he can also be an ideal villain for western-themed heroes who need someone to indulge their quick-draw skill against! Steampunk-themed heroes will appreciate his motif, and if you have any robotic heroes on your team, they may see this villain as an ancestor of sorts! His &amp;quot;Old West&amp;quot; code makes him a memorable character for any campaign, and his robot nature means he can return to plague your heroes again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
