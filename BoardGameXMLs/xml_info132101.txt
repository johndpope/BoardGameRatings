			<description>A cooperative die rolling game for toddlers that trains recognition and matching of basic colours as well as turn-taking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows 16 flower spaces and a track consisting of 7 butterfly spaces. Players take turns rolling the die. If it shows the flower symbol, the active player places one of the wooden flower chips on an empty flower space of the same colour on the board. If the butterfly symbol is rolled, the active player advances the butterfly token one space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If all the flowers have been placed before the butterfly reaches the end of the track, the players win together. If the butterfly reaches the last space on its track before all the flowers have been placed, the butterfly wins instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
