			<description>Third Person Shooter (or TPS for the acronym-hungry) is basically a tactical First Person Shooter transmogrified into a tabletop game. The intent was to have as few rules as possible, to avoid them getting in the way of the fragfest. TPS can be taught in under 5 minutes, and a game round usually takes less than 25 minutes. TPS scales well, and runs with little or no lag with 8 to 10 players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TPS uses simultaneous movement and combat with a minimum of fuss and constraints, such as hexes or movement allowances. As such TPS has been accused of thinking far outside the conventional box for tabletop games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TPS pits the Terrorists against the counterterrorists in the classic struggle for most frags and points to buy cool upgrades and fancy equipment. Supported game modes in v.1.0 are Hostage-rescue and Bomb placement/disarmament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More features will come with future patches and major versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future of TPS is currently uncertain - But in a good way - We are looking into doing a redesign and getting it published :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
