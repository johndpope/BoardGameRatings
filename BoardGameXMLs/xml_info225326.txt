							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Paranoia: Guide to Alpha Complex</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAPPY BIRTH-DAY, CITIZEN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Alpha Complex, your home. You may feel disoriented. Miraculously, you have just been born!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You feature the very latest in Cerebral Coretech&amp;trade; Life-Enhancing technology. Soon you&amp;rsquo;ll feel refreshed as your Omniskill generic memoryset comes online, providing all the information you&amp;rsquo;ll need about where you&amp;rsquo;ll live and what you&amp;rsquo;ll do, in the Perfectly Ordered and Completely Comfortable world of Alpha Complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, if you&amp;rsquo;re standing, damp, naked and confused, in a cloning chamber staring at a tablet placed in your quivering hands by one of our clone-bank operatives, then please take a Mood Elevator Happiness Supplement&amp;trade;. Terrorist Actions have interrupted Coretech&amp;trade; updating systems at this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the tablet has been replaced by a booklet, then tablet-delivery systems have been disrupted by Expected Unscheduled Service Upgrades. Take two Mood Elevator Happiness Supplements&amp;trade;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the booklet has been replaced by a clone-bank operative reciting from memory, then a Routine Abundance Shortfall has interfered with the smooth running of our systems. Help yourself to the Mood Elevator Happiness Supplements&amp;trade;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For your comfort and safety, do not interrupt the clone-bank operative: they serve your Friend, the Computer, and the security of Alpha Complex. Read/listen to, and commit to memory, the contents of this briefing document/experience before leaving this room, putting on any clothes, or taking any actions that may accidentally or inevitably jeopardise your future well-being, or lead to your prompt and painless* termination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Be advised that &amp;lsquo;painless&amp;rsquo; in this context is not covered under warranty unless Mood Elevator Happiness Supplements&amp;trade; have been taken as directed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
