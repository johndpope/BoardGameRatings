							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ESPN Baseball Tonight</name>
									
			<description>ESPN Baseball Tonight is licensed by MLB, but not by the Players Association, so while actual team names and logos are used, no player names are in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead programmers for the project were Alexander Ehrath and Russel Shanks who wrote the game's simulation engine. The game featured video clips of Chris Berman and play-by-play audio from Dan Patrick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Caesars Enterprises, Inc. got involved with the development of the game, seeing marketing synergy between baseball fans and pizza eaters. A large promotion was rolled out by the pizza chain to coincide with the game's launch, including point-of-purchase material at 4,500 stores; a mail-in offer for an ESPN &amp;quot;Best of Sports&amp;quot; videotape; and print advertising. The director of marketing for Sony called what Little Caesars received &amp;quot;a new method to reach families and men, 18-34, in a nontraditional, nonintrusive way&amp;quot;. The stadium walls in-game featured large Little Caesars advertising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the first in a series of ESPN-themed sports games. The next to be released was ESPN Sunday Night NFL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ESPN Baseball Tonight&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
