							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myriad Aliens: Even Stranger Options for Role-Play Adventure</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Syndics ruled over the 10,000 Worlds, their planets of choice were the most hospitable ones. Oxygen-rich atmosphere ... moderate gravity ... carbon-based life ... all of these qualities were prized by the mysterious masters of the stars. But not every world is the same... After the fall of the Empire came the rise of the forgotten, the forsaken, and then forbidden. People of all kinds, from the modest to the formidable, from the ordinary to the extreme, from the understandable to the unknowable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Aliens book adds 32 new options for playing even stranger creatures in your game of MYRIAD SONG. Some of the choices are simply exotic, like the scheming Serkai or the intellectual Nuderians. Other aliens cannot survive in common environments and must rely on special equipment to interact with others, like the augmented aquatic people of the Teleost, or the ponderous, solar-powered bodies of the Kyrix. And some creatures might not even be from this universe, such as the floating crystaline race of Pherix, or the hovering, mystical Ghen&amp;rsquo;Ti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever role you choose to play, just remember that you can never judge someone by their appearance, especially not in the Myriad Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
