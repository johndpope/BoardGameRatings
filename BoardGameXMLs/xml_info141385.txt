							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tower of the Scarlet Wizard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious and magical message literally drops into your lap from the very air.  Unsettled by the experience, you nevertheless open it.  It seems that there is a tower at the center of a nearby town, packed with magical items and untold riches... and it seems YOU have inherited this tower!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well...  almost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are one of several cousins vying for ownership of this magnificent edifice.  The task seems simple: convince the servants of the tower that you are the rightful owner.  Once all of the tower's servants have sworn fealty, the tower, and its riches, are yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It sounds too good to be true... So it probably is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of the Scarlet Wizard is a system-less adventure using generic terminology that should convert easily for use with most fantasy role playing systems.  It is designed for 3 or more thinking players of moderate experience level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those characters that survive will have a new base of operations, better than any room at an inn.  Those who forget to pack their wits along with the rest of their gear should probably have their wills in order before making the attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
