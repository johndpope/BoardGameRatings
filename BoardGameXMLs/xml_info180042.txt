			<description>Elemental Conflux is a game of dueling elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player summons elemental creatures to the battlefield to fight for dominance over five elemental nodes. Players create five stacks of creatures that will do battle, with the highest strength totals winning the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spells and certain powerful entities will make combat interesting and exciting. Summoners conjure additional creatures to their stack, Elemental Lords reduce the strength of the opposing elements' stacks, mighty dragons win no matter how many creatures oppose it (but can be thwarted by a wish from a Djinn) and cunning Wizards will very literally mix things up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast spells to turn the tide of battle. Fires of destruction might rain down, eliminating cards from your opponent's stack, a divination will allow you to peak at your opponents stack before battle is resolved, or a mighty whirlwind might scatter creatures into each others stacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles commence, and the player with at least three out of five winning stacks takes control of one of five Elemental nodes. The player who takes control of at least three out of five elemental nodes wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
