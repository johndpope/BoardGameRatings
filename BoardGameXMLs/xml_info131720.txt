			<description>In Copyright, players need to reproduce a pattern as quickly as possible using the transparent image sheets that they have in hand. Each sheet is a 3x3 grid that has a circle, a square, and a plus in three of its nine squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of a round, one player takes four image sheets at random, then stacks them together to form a model for that round. Players receive ten sheets at random, then try to reproduce the model by flipping the sheets and stacking them any way they like; the sheets do not have to overlap perfectly, but a player will lose points for any non-perfect overlaps. How does a player indicate which squares in his stack are to be considered the solution? Through the use of a 3x3 grid that has a thick black outline; each player has one of these in addition to the ten sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as a player recreates the model, the round ends. Each player scores one point for each square in the model that she reproduced in her image; whoever ended the round receives one bonus point, scoring 10 points (instead of nine). All players then lose one point for each row and column that &amp;quot;sticks out&amp;quot; from her 3x3 black-bordered grid. Players then shuffle the sheets and start a new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player's score totals 20 or more points, the game ends and this player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
