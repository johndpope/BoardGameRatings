							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LEGO X-Pod PlayOff</name>
									
			<description>Play 1 of 4 LEGO X-Pod models (Yellow/Red/Green/Blue) and construct a team of special units from set plans to deploy in head to head combat against those of your opponents.  Move your units across a 9x6 grid game board with various obstacles to score in your opponents home row.  The first player to score 3 units wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each X-Pod has unique strategies and abilities:  The yellow Aero Pod has many flying and Jumping units, which allow it to navigate the board very easily. The Red Wild Pod has a wide variety of units and abilities, including the special EAT action, which allows its unit to destroy a weak enemy unit and repair itself simultaneously. The Green Robo Pod has very slow units, but it is very good at disassembling and destroying opposing units. Finally, The Blue Auto Pod. This pod has the fastest units in the game, allowing them to score quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional X-Pod is included in the Game Pack. This black pod is a recolor of the Robo pod, and is included as a special edition pod.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2005, Lego released 4 more pods. A lime green pod with a Dragon theme, an orange pod with an Arachnid theme, a purple pod with a Monster theme, and finally a light blue pod with an aquatic life theme. Although these pods are not included in this or any other Game Pack, they can be used to play the game, using downloadable cards and boards available on Lego.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five individual pods included in this pack are available individually under the names stated above, however they will not include any X-Pod Playoff game content, such as cards. If purchased individually, the cards, boards, rules and Inventory sheets must be acquired off of Lego.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
