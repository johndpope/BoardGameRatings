			<description>An action tabletop game. Very loosely connected to soccer.&lt;br/&gt;At one end of the table you assemble a net and 5 hollow circles (called hoops). From the other end of the table, the players take turns to propel a ball towards the net, hoping to get it to settle in one of the hoops, thus scoring points. The propulsion of the balls is done by placing a ball into the bag provided and squeezing the bag so that the ball shoots out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box lid shows Dad and Son playing and is a good illustration of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one with the most points after a pre-agreed time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
