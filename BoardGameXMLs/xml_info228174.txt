			<description>A card game for 2-4 players based on The Muppet Show!  The game represents one Episode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a common deck. Cards are of one or a combination of types:  Character (C), Event (E), Bonus (B) or Special (S)&lt;br/&gt;Plastic discs are used to keep track of Act (victory) Points. &lt;br/&gt;To start 5 cards are dealt to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;1.  Dressing Room Phase &lt;br/&gt;-   Draw 1 card from the top of the deck or discard and put it in your hand. &lt;br/&gt;2.  Backstage Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may play (discard) a special card in this phase to activate its special ability. &lt;br/&gt;3.  Act Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   You may play an Act this phase. An Act requires 2-6 specific cards to be played (revealed) according to the Act Chart (comprising 18 different acts). &lt;br/&gt;-   Act Points are scored as listed on the Chart for completing the Act (2-6 points dependant on the act). &lt;br/&gt;-   Score an extra Act Point if you were the last player to also play an act. &lt;br/&gt;-   Each Act in the Act Chart can only be claimed once per game. &lt;br/&gt;-   Bonus cards can be played along with the required cards of an Act. Each Bonus card played is worth 1 Act Point.  Some Bonus cards give an extra Act Point for specific Acts. &lt;br/&gt;4. Finale Phase&lt;br/&gt;-   Max hand size is 7 cards.  Discard excess cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WINNING&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when 8 (of the 18) Acts have been played.  The player with the most Act points is the winner.
