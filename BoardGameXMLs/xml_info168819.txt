			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The War for Humanity's place in the stars rages on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For five years, war has raged between the Terran Sphere Confederacy and the Shohan. Overturning 100 years of peace between the two races, the Shohan have captured half of humanity's worlds. As each world fell, only silence remained. Now, the Terran Sphere has won its first major battle, stopping the Shohan on the doorstep of its core worlds and the war&amp;rsquo;s momentum teeters on the edge...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soldier. Captain. Admiral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a soldier in the Terran Sphere Navy, be it a marine infiltrating behind enemy lines, a captain of ship patrolling the front lines, or an admiral in command of the fleets charged with humanity's defense, your actions and their consequences will have an impact on the fates of all the human worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Refugee. Guerilla. Diplomat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the war's effects extend far beyond the battlefield. Refugees have fled the war altogether, trying to start a new life in the fringes, but it may be a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire. In alien halls of power, diplomats struggle to contain a dozen crises as other powers sense blood in the water. Meanwhile, resistance groups on the occupied worlds continue to fight for their freedom, and may have discovered an important clue to the Shohan's motivations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Redemption is a tabletop Military Sci Fi roleplaying game. The game is intended to support group play through multiple levels of combat - from firefights to fleet actions - and to give groups a wide range of toolkits from designing their own gear to bringing about social change as they make their way through a galaxy overturned by war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
