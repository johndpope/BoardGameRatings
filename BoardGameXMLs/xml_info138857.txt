							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Man Hunter</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marc is quite strong and can take very heavy amounts of punishment. He is a surprisingly competent man, with a multitude of useful skills including the use of weaponry, chemistry, mechanics, leadership, driving and physical fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His main driving force is the need to survive, (when he&amp;rsquo;s not trying to be killed by The Widow, his Ex-wife); which will force him to do great things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He possesses a strong personality and is always set on survival. In fact, he often sets his own survival before those of others, and can appear very abrasive and off-setting (womanizing, whoremonger, that cannot tear himself away from strip clubs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to use Man-Hunter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the characters need a vehicle to be created for the new fledging team and hear of Marc, or perhaps the com across the Bounty hunter while they both go after the same villain. Or perhaps they seen a body wrapped in chains being thrown into the river by shady looking men. Saving the man&amp;rsquo;s life they meet Man-Hunter who survived yet another attempt on his life by his wife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
