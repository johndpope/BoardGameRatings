			<description>From the Manual (with spelling intact);&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Hallelujah breetheren! Heeere, is your opportunity to aid in the salvation of sowels, and to pockit some cold, hard cash.  Ahhlll, at the same time!  In this four player game, you wa-ill play thuh pahrt of a Tee Vee Evangelist and attempt to accumulate a vast, personal fortune (and, oh yes, spa-red the good word too!) by reaching out to people's hearts and pocket books over the airwaves.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game comes with a small booklet containing the rules, the cover of which has the board printed on the inside, counters necessary and a small die.&lt;br/&gt;     The players take the roles of TV Evangelists, in a humorous way, to get to the last space on the board while getting the most money.&lt;br/&gt;     It has fairly simple gameplay.  A player rolls the die to move.  If the space the player lands on has a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; the player then chooses which of a number of choices for that space he gets. Or, if the space doesn't have a &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; he rolls on the chart for that space and takes the effect corresponding to that roll.  Once a player gets to the last space &amp;quot;Your Final REWARD!!&amp;quot; on an exact roll (if a roll would move you beyond that, you go back a space) the player with the largest bank account ,counted in billions, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
