							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Days and Nights of Onna Oa</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Onna Oa is a magical place, home to spirits of bygone ages seeking refuge from the mortal masses. During the day they rest, but at night they emerge from their hiding places. They're not overjoyed to find their home besieged by humans, but they're sympathetic to the plight of the unfortunate Marines. These are men doomed to die lonely and meaningless deaths far from home. Overcome with sadness, the spirits take it upon themselves to bring some joy into these mortals' last days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem: These spirits can see into the souls of men, but they only barely comprehend what they find there. They offer solace in the form of wishes fulfilled, but misunderstanding can turn a simple act of charity into one of perversion. As a suffering Marine facing inevitable death, trapped in a place equal parts heaven and hell, can you seek refuge in your heart while protecting it from corruption at the same time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
