							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Firestorm: Warsaw</name>
									
			<description>Firestorm:Warsaw takes place in 1944 during the Warsaw Uprising in which the people of Warsaw/Poland sought to liberate themselves after 5 years of German occupation.  Players will take control of either the German or the Polish forces.  Not only will players be able to roll dice to simulate combat achieving results such as destroyed, retreat etc. they will also be able to move their forces from one area of the game board to another.  Other than that there is very little wargame 'chrome'; And at best this game provides an introduction to Battlefront's Firestorm series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firestorm: Warsaw is a game of conflict simulation for 2 people in which victory will be determined by the player who occupies areas with a higher total point sum than their opponent at the end fo six turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firestorm: Warsaw includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 Set of rules&lt;br/&gt;     1 Gameboard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is part of a series of Firestorm games, although this one is much smaller than the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It may be noted that the rules for the game are included within a 30-page PDF, which also contains materials relating to gaming the Warsaw Uprising using the Flames of War rule system.  The Firestorm:Warsaw game is not an expansion to Flames of War, but rather a stand-alone game which can be played using the material provided, plus a few counters and figures and dice which will need to be provided by the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
