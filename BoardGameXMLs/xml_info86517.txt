			<description>From the Amiga box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the heir of the late Duke of Allada, it is your duty to fulfill your father's lifelong dream: Extend Allada's dominion and unite the entire Aragonian Empire under your banner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fantasy game gives you more than flashing swords and arcane sorcery. It is also a strategy game that requires plotting and planning if you are to win.&lt;br/&gt;Raise and equip an army of bowmen, cavalry, infantry, mages and priests. Hire mercenaries if you must. Just remember that, even in a magical world, you still have to deal with the harsh realities of limited budgets and resources.&lt;br/&gt;Lead your army against the demonic rulers of the Eastern Realms - while defending Allada against the plundering raids of Goblin hordes.&lt;br/&gt;Move across the strategic map and zoom into the tactical map when it comes to battle against human and inhuman monsters. Your warriors, knights and rangers fight with swords, bows and lances while the priests and mages wield magic spells. You, however, must make the right decisions if your forces are to be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The task that lies ahead is daunting. But the rewards are great. Assemble your army wisely and campaigns with vigor. Imagine how glorious it will be to sit on the Emperor's Throne and call all of Aragon yours!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
