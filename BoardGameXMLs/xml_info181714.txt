							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Page of Scrolls</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into the sewers&amp;hellip; &lt;br/&gt; The city of Riverton is home to beggars, goblinoids, humanoids, liars, merchants, soldiers, and thieves. It is also home to Ahren, Page of the Plar&amp;rsquo;s Court. When Ahren asks for your help retrieving a scroll from a vicious tribe of sewer-dwelling goblins, who are you to say &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;?  &lt;br/&gt; A Page of Scrolls is the first part of the Shadows of Riverton adventure path and is designed to be played during the course of two four-hour sessions. The scenario can also be run as a standalone adventure in your sandbox campaign as it can easily be adapted for use with any campaign setting. &lt;br/&gt; A Page of Scrolls is a module designed for four to six 1st-level characters and uses the medium XP advancement track. Each encounter includes optional scaling suggestions for more powerful parties. Successful completion of the adventure will take brand new 1st-level characters to 2nd level.  &lt;br/&gt; The scenario also includes a settlement stat block for the large city of Riverton as well as information about the city&amp;rsquo;s places of interest and notable NPCs. In addition, each of the city&amp;rsquo;s districts is detailed with its own settlement stat block to help bring the different parts of the city to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
