			<description>Intelligensspillet Investor is an intelligence game with endless possibilities. It has to work form&amp;aring;k entertaining and educational. The rules and procedures of the game are broadly the same as those used in everyday life when you place (invisterer) money in real estate or mortgages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to buy properties (there are 12 houses to choose from), pay out your mortgage - and avoid bankrupcy and foreclosure!&lt;br/&gt;The game mechanism is a roulette with 12 (six large and six small) tiles - divided into five options;&lt;br/&gt; - H: The six large green ones where you have to pay the rent for your house(s)&lt;br/&gt; - D: One red where you pay taxes for roads and sewers&lt;br/&gt; - S: Two reds where you pay Property Tax&lt;br/&gt; - T: Two reds where you have to pay mortgage&lt;br/&gt; - ?: Black where you have to pay out the last loan of the house.&lt;br/&gt;Every player spin the wheel for EVERY property (s)he owns - if (s) owns more than one it is needed to state which house there is on spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player can't pay up and can't get money by other means the house will be set on auction.&lt;br/&gt;The profit will go to the bankrupt seller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over after an agreed time, where every player sells there propertied back to the bank (they will get the price in the deed MINUS the eventually debt). The winner will be the one with most profit - or least loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed by real estate broker Aage Eliasen, Copenhagen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
