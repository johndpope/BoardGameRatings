			<description>Boer'n Bluf is a stunning tricky game for 2 to 10 players where it's all about trickery and deceit. Whose bluffing is best and who can outsmart the other players. But watch out! when someone caught you bluffing, you can start all over again. Try to get rid of your handcards as soon as possible. Be smart and challenge your opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game you try to get rid of all the cards in your hand by laying them down on a pile. the first player starts with the Dog card with the golden bone. After that the second player puts his 2 on the pile and the next player his 3's. If you don't have the card that needs to be put down, you &amp;quot;bluff&amp;quot;. If someone catches you, you take to whole pile of cards. The first one with no cards in his hand wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
