			<description>Meander is a mechanized board game with a game board that rotates on its own while players try to reach their home base on the opposite side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, each player has five colored spheres in a starting area of the corresponding color. Players take turns moving their spheres one space per turn &amp;mdash; but a turn can occur only when the board has paused and isn't currently moving. If a player has a sphere in hand when the board starts to rotate, he must return the sphere to the start position. A player cannot move into a colored space other than his own. If a player moves a sphere to the center of the game board, he can warp that sphere to the home position. Two spheres cannot occupy the same space. The first player to move all of his spheres to his home spaces wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a different gameplay experience, during set-up, each player takes turns placing neutral white spheres on the game board, one sphere per player. The neutral spheres can be moved by any player and serve as blockers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
