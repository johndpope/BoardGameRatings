							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You&#039;re the Banker</name>
									
			<description>You're the Banker is an educational game, designed to be played by large groups of students (up to 30 in 5 groups of 6).  The game aims to teach the purpose and practices of the Federal Reserve Bank, by having teams of players run banks.  Many of the consequences in the game are automated, but the teacher/moderator of the game is required to decide whether loans are sufficiently sound to accept as collateral for borrowing from the Federal Reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
