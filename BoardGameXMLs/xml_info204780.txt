			<description>(Fire Sale is still in alpha testing / early production).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You have stumbled upon the news that there is a fire sale going on at a bankrupt estate a few blocks away. They are selling priceless antiques off at insane prices! You gathered all the cash you could and ran to the now defunct mansion. Little did you know however that tons of people would show up, all with huge wads of cash, ready to outbid you on all these &amp;ldquo;priceless&amp;rdquo; treasures!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire Sale is playable at home with 2 decks of cards, 5 dice per player, and rules (in Files section). Fire Sale is a 2-4 player game featuring auction/bidding based dice placement/manipulation and set collection. Over multiple rounds players must use their dice rolls wisely to try and buy cards from the center of the table to earn sets that they can trade in for victory points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player is chosen by whoever rolls the lowest amount of the lowest die value and on each turn a player has 7 possible actions to choose from, 5 being their available &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; actions and 2 being possible free actions. These actions include the ability to buy cards (to form sets), bid on cards against your opponents, play cards from your hand, turn in cards to earn points, or discard cards to get new cards in your hand. The free actions include re-rolling and &amp;quot;flipping&amp;quot; your dice. The game requires efficient use of a player's five dice that are rolled each round, in which &amp;quot;opposite&amp;quot; faced die are very valuable, though each player has ways to influence their dice rolls in tactical ways to suit their needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game players make moves with their dice, play cards from their hand, and turn in their collected sets for points. Players can use the point &amp;quot;pool&amp;quot; wisely to gain extra points while also blocking their opponents from gaining extra points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
