							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Midian: Dark Fantasy Role-playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Midian is the flagship product of Lost Souls Publishing. This is a dark fantasy noir game (with bits of science fiction added in for good measure) which means that the game has warriors charging in on horseback, necromancy, and strange beasts. As Midian is in the Dark Fantasy genre, the game focuses less on slaying monsters in caves, saving princessess, and amassing obscene amounts of power and wealth, but rather it focuses more on personal struggles, man's inhumanity to man, grey morality, personal horror, and the other less pretty aspects of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing Midian requires no dowloads or purchases. It is a table-top roleplaying game, meaning you and your friends play this together with pencils &amp;amp; dice, rather than using cards or a board, or in front of a computer. Midian was created for face-to-face gaming, but you can play online on the forums, or using a third-party client.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
