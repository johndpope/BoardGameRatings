			<description>SIXIS is a fast and simple little game about rolling smart and pressing your luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It may seem at first like Yahtzee, as players roll six dice in an attempt to match patterns. Sixis is unique, however, in that the patterns to match change each round, determined by randomized cards. When you match a card, you can take the card to score it, or raise the stakes by flipping it to reveal a more difficult and valuable goal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your opponents are also after the same cards, leading to some surprisingly interesting decisions for a simple dice game. Will you block an opponent by taking a card that's less valuable to you, or will you risk it and flip a card you think you can nab next round?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
