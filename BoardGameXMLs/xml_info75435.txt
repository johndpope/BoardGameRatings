			<description>User Submission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry is for the handheld version of Vigilante 8. Please see the original VGG Entry of Vigilante 8 for more details. &lt;br/&gt; The handheld version was published for Game Boy Color by Vatical in 1999 and developed by Vicarious Visions. It's gameplay is similar in style to the original, but the graphical implementation had to be adjusted to suit the portable gaming format. The gameplay in this version is therefore presented from a top-down perspective. This version of the game was a US only release and attracted an ESRB E rating, unlike the original game which received an ESRB T rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the beginning the player chooses one of six Vigilantes or six Coyotes as their avatar. Each of these characters has its own slogan and unique vehicle. Five game modes are available:&lt;br/&gt;Road Trip&lt;br/&gt;Arcade&lt;br/&gt;Timed Attack&lt;br/&gt;Progressive&lt;br/&gt;Survival&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When gameplay begins, you accelerate of brake your vehicle, turn, find the bad guys, and shoot them until you emerge from your ESRB:E rated experience the glorious victor. Game modes can add some variation to your mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamplay possible for 1 or 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
