							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darwin&#039;s World: Sandwalkers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Sandwalkers, a useful resource for the post-apocalyptic role-playing game, Darwin's World 2nd Edition. Sandwalkers is intended to serve as a practical GM aid providing concise information on a number of pre-generated NPC heroes and villains, potential campaign allies and enemies that you can slip into your games with little or no preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Use Sandwalkers&lt;br/&gt;Sandwalkers is filled virtually from start to finish with characters that you can use to fill out possible voids in your adventures, providing well-developed non-player characters with complete stat blocks, backgrounds, physical outline, and even a description of favored, pre-planned tactics for each NPC - as well as possible &amp;quot;hooks&amp;quot; for encounters with or against these unique and unusual characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character described in this book is designed to be a challenge for a particular level of game play, ranging from low level (5th and above) to the most epic (topping out at 20th level). In addition, each character not only represents a varying level of danger (or help), but also hopefully a unique &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; on each advanced class that will give more depth and variety to the more obvious faces of Darwin's World's numerous iconic character types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
