			<description>This game was designed by children of the small town of S&amp;uuml;&amp;szlig;en in southern Germany. The board shows a map of the town. The players use dice rolls to move through the town, picking up event cards as they go along. The aim is to complete a photo puzzle consisting of several pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
