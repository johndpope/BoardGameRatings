			<description>Each player gets a pawn and numbered game tokens of the same color. The pawn is placed on the corner starting space of the matching color, and the number tokens are placed on their corresponding spaces near the player&amp;rsquo;s start space. Six yellow tokens&amp;mdash;numbered 1 to 6&amp;mdash;are shuffled and placed face-down on the black circles in the middle of the board. All but the middle one are then covered with caps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Object:  Players try to collect the numbered tokens of their own color and to assemble them into the highest possible number (i.e., 4321). As the first token is collected, it the must be placed on the ones column, the second on the tens, the third on the hundreds, and the last on the thousands column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Play:  Chose a start player and play clockwise. The active player takes one cap of his choice and places it over the one yellow token that lies free (for the first player, this will be the one in the middle of the board). The number token just freed is turned face up (if not already face-up). The number on it determines how many spaces the player moves his pawn. If he lands on a yellow space, he repeats the procedure (i.e., transfer a cap, reveal a number, move pawn). If he does not land on a yellow space, his turn ends and it is the next player's turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, a player who remembers which number is under which cap may plan his moves accordingly. He cannot, however, use the same movement number in two successive moves because the cap must always be placed on the free token. If a player lands on a yellow space three times in succession, he reshuffles the yellow tokens, places them face down, and covers them as was done at the start of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Winning:  The first player to complete a 4-digit number wins and ends the game. If additional rounds are played, a running tally should be kept of each player&amp;rsquo;s numbers, which are totaled at the end of the game. The player with the highest total is the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
