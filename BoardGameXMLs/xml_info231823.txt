			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the year 4000.... The sounds of whirring drills, buzzing saws and massive metal footsteps fill the student workshop. That can mean only one thing: it's time for the Giant Robot Science Fair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this high-energy set-collection card game, collect robot pieces from across the galaxy, collaborate with your peers, and scheme against your rivals to create the coolest robot you can for the University of Robottery's annual science fair!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, players travel to planets to collect robot parts represented by Limb and Head cards. Each player connects parts together to form their own complete, anatomically correct robot. Your class convenes for a Study Session every two turns, during which you can trade any parts you have collected with the other three players and attempt to sabotage other robots by stealing parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors have various point values and want to see certain combinations of limb cards to favor your robot. The professors judge your robots after eight turns, and whichever student builds the most impressive robot wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
