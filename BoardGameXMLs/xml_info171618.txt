			<description>From the adventures introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a basic Shadowrun mission suitable for starting players to learn some of the rules or as a short emergency game for a more experienced group. The challenge level is scaled relatively low and is gauged towards the example characters in Shadowrun 4th edition. Scaling the power level should be relatively easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot consists of the players being hired to break into a corporate facility and retrieve a blood sample of an employee's wife before it is sent for testing at a medical laboratory and the fact that she is infected with the Kreiger strain HMHVV (the &amp;ldquo;ghoul&amp;rdquo; virus) is discovered. As cover, the characters are expected to damage certain items of equipment to conceal the true purpose of the break in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
