			<description>In おにぎりさん　(Onigiri-San), players work together to make onigiri (Japanese rice balls) using cards that show seaweed, rice, or one of three different fillings.  To win, players must create one of each type of onigiri in front of each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the active player must either (1) play one of their hand cards onto another player's tableau; or (2) &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; (i.e., discard) a completed onigiri from their tableau and then discard and replace one of their hand cards.  Played cards are replaced from the draw deck.  Discarded cards are not reshuffled when the draw deck runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends either when a player is unable to act on their turn (a loss) or when each player has one of each nigiri in front of them (a win).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
