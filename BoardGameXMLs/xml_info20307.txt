			<description>Chocolate-opoly...A decadently delicious property trading game for chocolate lovers! Dark, milk, bittersweet, semi-sweet, in a shake, filled with caramel, covered in nuts, or as a warm, frothy brew - there's nothing the cocoa bean can't do. In Chocolate-opoly players buy favorite chocolate properties, collect chunks of chocolate and trade them in for chocolate factories. Sounds easy enough but pay your conching fees, suppress your cravings or get sent to Chocoholics Anonymous and it becomes a little more difficult...and a lot more fun! So choose your token and roll the dice! Who knows? You may be chosen as a &amp;quot;Supertaster&amp;quot; or you may experience Death by Chocolate. Here's a game for the true chocophile! For 2-6 players, ages 8 to adult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
