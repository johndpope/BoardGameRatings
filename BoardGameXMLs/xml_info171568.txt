			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 48 x 30 inch, full color battlemap of a Medieval Quarry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pull! We must work as fast as we can. If brigands discover that we have found gold deposits in this simple quarry before we can get it back to the safety of town&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight for resources at our Medieval Quarry! Ramps, stone ledges, and ladders offer an upwards battle up the side of the quarry. A rope and pulley system offers a cut of a rope and a swing to a new spot in the quarry as stone slabs fall on your enemies below or an acrobatic balancing act to walk the tightrope from place to place in the quarry. Special maneuvering and trap options abound with this map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Quarry is a single exterior map of a medieval mining operation. The map has a single interior of a storage barn used for sheltering wagons bringing in supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Quarry is intended for use in fantasy games. It can also be used in historical games in BC times (For example, it would work well in a game focusing on Greek city-states). It might also fit in the Dark Ages after the fall of Rome when mining techniques the Roman used were lost (The Romans used their aqueducts to bring water to mines to perform more advanced hydraulic mining than depicted here).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quarrel over the Quarry: A local quarry offers a curiously high price for guards via a messenger to a nearby town. The group is offered the job by the messenger. It is odd in that the job isn&amp;rsquo;t listed on any job boards in local taverns and inns and the price seems too high to guard mere stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, a group of local bandits attack the nearby logging camp during this time to procure horses, oxen, carts, and wagons for their heist. The miners&amp;rsquo; frenzied activity after a slow start has not gone unnoticed by the brigands. They are determined to get the valuable ore themselves without doing the hard labor of mining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group should arrive during the daytime so they can look around and plan on how they will defend the quarry during the night. Archers and magicians can take up lookout positions on ramps or stone ledges excellent for sniping or casting from afar. Rogues can set up traps of stone slabs that can be cut loose by slicing the attached rope from pulleys. Swordsmen can fight on ladders, ropes, and other platforms to show their prowess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At night the bandits arrive to steal the slabs of rock excavated from the quarry and it&amp;rsquo;s up to the group to fight them off and prevent the theft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the group succeeds in defending the quarry, the quarry master gives them a wagon with stone slabs and some gold pieces to pay for smelting the ore as payment. And the amount of gold is much less than what was offered. The quarry master can&amp;rsquo;t pay that price in gold pieces but insists the gold in the slabs should be enough for the offered pay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
