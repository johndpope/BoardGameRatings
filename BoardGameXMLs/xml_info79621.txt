			<description>Follie (our heroine!) comes from a planet of gentle plant-like creatures. Their planet is happy and colourful, yet heavily populated, and is famous around the galaxy for its &amp;quot;Flowerworks&amp;quot; - special flowers that bloom into a cascade of fireworks. The flowers hungrily suck in the fireworks which they create, using the energy to grow larger. This symbiotic relationship is a central part of life on Follie's home world, which is constantly lit up with fireworks - both day and night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flowerworks have another special property: the flowers transform the terrain around them, making it more hospitable to Follie's kind. The terraforming ability of the Flowerworks means that Follie's relatives have spread across the galaxy, turning lifeless rocky planets into ones that literally explode with colour and life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
