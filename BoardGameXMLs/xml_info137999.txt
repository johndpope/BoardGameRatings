			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so it began&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was four thousand years ago this day that our common culture was forever sundered. We were one proud race, the Ev, keepers of the great forests that, long ago, covered our island home and creatures of peace and nature and of the sun. Our civilization had reached new heights of beauty and philosophic understanding. Our mages and priests, commoners and royalty all worked together in harmony, as few peoples ever had in eons past. We were one people in every way that mattered, in mind, in body and in spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Typhoon came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord of Entropy and Chaos, Bringer of Anarchy and Madness came to call upon us, alongside his armies of Madenlings, Entropos and Kaotiks, to destroy the grandeur that we had wrought together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Time of Entropy raged for less than a year and our peoples were all but decimated within that short time. With only thousands left of our once prosperous race, and genocide opening its doors, the Elementalis came. The Embrace of the Elementalis, the Lords and Ladies of the Four&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elementalis came to us with a proposition that we could not ignore if we wanted to live, a proposition that would divide us for four thousand years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
