			<description>Heist is a competitive game with cooperative elements that has only one winner. You and other professional thieves have been hired to infiltrate a secret facility and loot the Executive Vault. As part of the agreement, you can keep anything else of value you discover along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thieves spend actions and each build a hand of skill-boosting Equipment cards used to overcome such obstacles as Bounty Hunters, Exploding Aerial Drones and Killer Robots. The game is highly social, and players will frequently work with (or double-cross) fellow thieves to advance through the building. But ultimately you&amp;rsquo;re in it for yourself ... despite what you may have told anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any thief loots the Executive Vault and escapes the building, then the thief with the most total loot is the winner. But in an unusual twist, if you're caught as a thief, you're not out of the game. Instead, you &amp;quot;flip&amp;quot; and become an informant working for the authorities against the other thieves. If all the thieves are caught, then the informant with the most &amp;quot;credibility&amp;quot; gains immunity from crimes committed and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
