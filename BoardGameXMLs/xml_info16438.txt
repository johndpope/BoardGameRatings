			<description>The Littles Pop-up and Play Game is a Milton Bradley board game that is based on the early 80s television series, &amp;quot;The Littles&amp;quot;, which is based on a series of children's books by John Peterson.  The Littles are little 4 inch tall humanoid creatures that live in the walls of human's homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board was rather interesting because it had pop up sections that made up The Littles' living area.  The object of the game is to collect some inventions and get them to Dinky Littles' room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
