							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawaii - an idyllic island paradise. It's the spot Brian Basco and Gina Timmins have chosen to take a well-earned vacation. An impromptu daytrip to a remote and relatively uninhabited island goes awry, however - Brian forces Gina from the plane, giving her the only working parachute. Brian luckily survives the plane's crash landing, but Gina has disappeared, setting the stage for a highly entertaining story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humor, hotties, hijinks and a hilarious plotline all combine to make a fantastically fun adventure in Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle, the sequel to 2003's smash-hit adventure, Runaway: A Road Adventure. In Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle, players will travel the world, from Alaska and Hawaii to the depths of the sea and the sky above. Become immersed in a tongue-in-cheek story where you'll meet a crazy cast of miscreants in order to solve a mystery too weirdly entertaining for words in this title that pays homage to all that was great about the glory days of graphical adventure games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
