							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bushido: Hill Tribe Warrior</name>
									
			<description>The many tribes of the mountain have been chased and persecuted for as long as the stories tell. Hounded into the mountains and left to scratch a meagre existence from the barren earth. This has made them a strong, resilient and resourceful people. Little is known about how or why the Tengu reached out to the tribes but the alliance has proved valuable to both sides. All the people of hill tribes are able warriors as they must be to survive in the harsh cold, when the need arises these people of snow and ice are fearsome combatants.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
