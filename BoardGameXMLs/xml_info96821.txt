							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Verne Character Creator</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a semi-automated adventurer creator for Verne. The way it works is pretty simple:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Go to the next page&lt;br/&gt;     Initialize things by hitting the red reset button&lt;br/&gt;     Answer the questions from your adventurer's point of view, or hit the &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; button to generate a semi-random selection of answers&lt;br/&gt;     When you are happy with the answers, hit the &amp;quot;calculate&amp;quot; button. This will generate both a nationality and a profession for the adventurer&lt;br/&gt;     Go to the adventurer sheet on the last page and hit the &amp;quot;make adventurer&amp;quot; button. This will generate a full selection of Attributes, skills and Traits for the adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There a number of ways you can do this for generating adventurers, and some hidden tips and tricks. We recommend that if you are going to generate adventurers using the questions, that you get three tries at it. If you do not like the results of your first questions, you can change up to three answers and try again, and then one more time if you still do not like it. As long as you keep track of the changes, this gives you three adventurers to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for some detailed stuff. This adventurer creator works off of Victorian stereotypes. Each answer has weighting factors that will lean it towards a nationality and a profession. The total result of your answers is in the bar graphs on the lower left of the page. And because it is based on stereotypes, you can &amp;quot;game the system&amp;quot; fairly easily. For instance, if you choose a sexist Catholic who values his reputation above all else, thinks his nation is strong (but is not sure of it) and prefers style over substance, you're well on your way to a Spaniard (an Italian would value love over all else). Or, if you choose a Protestant who knows his nation is a major player, is slightly racist, prefers order to chaos and believes troubles are to be endured, then congratulations, you're probably going to be an Englishman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wealth of an adventurer is based on the Verne rules and EABA guidelines. This means there can be extraordinary variation in wealth. Some professions pay more than others, the Wealth Trait magnifies this, and skill levels also adjust things. You can have a starting adventurer who is destitute, or one who has a country manor and owns their own ocean-going steamship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
