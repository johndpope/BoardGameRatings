							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Bamboozle or the Enchanted Isle</name>
									
			<description>This was one of the first large folding board games produced by Milton Bradley.  Game board has a wonderfully lithographed fantasy land where one takes paths to get to the Enchanted Isle.  The center of the board has two castle, woods, bears, a tent, a windmill and a church.  The paths weave along the outside and into the center.  The paths along the outside represent water and has pictures of a steamboat, canoeist, serpent, and whale.  The four corners of board are one city scene, one house scene, one mermaid and one lighthouse. This particular version, with a plain box (likely considered &amp;quot;deluxe&amp;quot; at that time) is later than the first 1876 version, which probably featured a more decorative printed image on the box cover. This version probably dates from around 1900.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
