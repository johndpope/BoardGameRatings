							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Schreck</name>
									
			<description>The players are monsters and have to escape from the monster hunters. This is achieved by elimination: Every monster which gathers 7 or more hunter points is out of the game. Last monster standing is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a monster card and draws two action cards into his/her hands, then three hunter cards which are placed openly in front of him/her. Now each player can play action cards on two of the hunters and the monster card can attack the third one. Some action cards can take hunters out of the game while others can redirect them to other players (there is no defense against this). When all actions are resolved, the player with most hunter points has to keep the highest hunter card. When after a few rounds the number of hunter points a player has gathered exceeds 7, that player is out. The others continue untili only one monster is left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
