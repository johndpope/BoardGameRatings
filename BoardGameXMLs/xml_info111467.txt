							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Forgotten Futures: Rules Summary</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;THIS is a BRIEF synopsis of the Forgotten Futures rules for the use of players. Referees are STRONGLY advised to check out the full rules, which contain considerably more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What will the future be like? Every generation has its own set of ideas and predictions. At the turn of this century most pundits thought that the mighty power of steam and electricity would usher in a new age of peace and prosperity. In the fifties the future was mostly seen as doom, gloom, and nuclear destruction. In the nineties we are obsessed with computers, and convinced that the future will revolve around information technology. Each of the earlier views was valid for its era; each was at least partially wrong. By looking at earlier guesses we may be able to discover what is wrong with our own vision of the future - and make even worse mistakes when we try to correct it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgotten Futures is a role playing game based on these discarded possibilities; the futures that could never have been, and the pasts that might have led to them, as they were imagined by the authors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
