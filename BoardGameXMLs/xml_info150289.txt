			<description>Fisherman's Profit is a simple bluffing &amp;quot;outsmart the others&amp;quot; card game based on the Japanese proverb &amp;quot;If snipe and seashell fight, the fisherman profits&amp;quot;, meaning that if two struggle, a third party wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a deck of either blue or red seashells of different values, three cards are placed face down on the play area, and in turn, players peek at the unoccupied seashells, then place either a fisherman or a snipe on one of them. When all have placed, the seashells are turned up and resolved: Blue seashells can be taken only by snipes, and red only by the fishermen. If two have placed on the same, the latter will steal a previously claimed seashell from the former &amp;mdash; but if both fisherman and snipe are on the same seashell, the fisherman profits according to the old proverb and both gets the seashell and catches the bird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
