							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lucky 13 Quick Guide</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules as presented are light-weight.  Characters have Attributes but the only examples in the Quick Guide are Fitness, Agility, and Charisma.  Characters have Skills--defined skills include:  Brawl, Dodge, Martial Arts, Listen, Wrestling, Gun, and Sneak.  The game infers characters can have any Skill they desire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Skill score of 1-2 represents an intelligent but untrained individual; 7-12 indicates a normal, skilled range; 15+ indicates exceptional ability.  Skill resolution is 2d6 plus Skill modifiers; a roll of double 1s is always failure and double 6s is always success.  Typical Difficulty scores noted are:  Very easy - 7; Easy - 10; Average - 13; Hard - 15; Very Hard - 18.  If the action is opposed (as in combat) then the Difficulty score is the opponent's relevant Skill roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An associated HTML page notes conversion methods to move 3d6 and d100 Attributes into the Lucky 13 system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
