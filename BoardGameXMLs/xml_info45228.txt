			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization by using the pdf technology at its best. A small control bar (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled and don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves&amp;rsquo; guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Hill of Many Dungeons is the bread-n-butter of every fantasy RPG player and game master. The Hill is a rocky formation that houses five different dungeons. Some of the dungeons are accessible from the hillside, while a couple of them are accessible through the hilltop. Although the dungeons vary in number of rooms and features, they are all classic dungeons that can be adapted to any setting and filled with the critters of your choice. The dungeons are not linked each other, but you can easily imagine connection tunnels between them. Similarly you can forget the hill and stack the dungeons to build a unique multi-level dungeon.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
