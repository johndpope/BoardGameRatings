			<description>Vintage Dutch language game from the interbellum period (probably 1930's). The gameboard (54x24cm.) has a 5 line oval track and 5 cyclist-counters colored, each in a different color. Movement is decided by two dice, the cyclist ahead always has to be in the inside lane, whenever a cyclist passes another cyclist, they change lane. The game is played over 1 or multiple laps (this has to be decided before the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
