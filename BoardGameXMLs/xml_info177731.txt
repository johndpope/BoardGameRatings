			<description>A funny game that helps children to understand the job of post office men, and the different kinds of letters, parcels etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with 2-6 players. At the start of the game you receive some cards which represent the letters and parcels. The number of the cards depends on the number of players. Then you have to roll the dice and move in the board, in the direction which is the fastest and more convenient for you to deliver the letters. But some times you may land on &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; spots, which might not be the best for you! The winner of the game is whoever delivers all that he's got and get back to the post office first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
