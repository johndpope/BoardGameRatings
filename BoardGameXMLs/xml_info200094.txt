			<description>Paper 'Mech: Factory is a free print and play solitaire game played on a single sheet of A4 paper and is the first official expansion to Paper 'Mech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play a 'mech pilot in an ongoing war against a stronger enemy. Your faction has salvaged a single 'mech, not having the technology to produce their own and you have proven to be the most able pilot and are sent on various missions to disrupt the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this mission you are tasked with finding and destroying an enemy 'mech factory, but the odds are heavily stacked against you.
