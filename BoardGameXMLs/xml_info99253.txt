			<description>Sequel to R.B.I. Baseball 1 and 2 -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R.B.I. Baseball 3: RBI 3 also has every major league team available from the 1990 season, as well as postseason teams from 1983-1989. A regular season feature was available for RBI 3. Players could choose one team to compete against every other team. All star teams and postseason teams were eligible for this season mode. Passwords were given after each game to help players complete schedules. Once all teams had been defeated, the player had to compete against a fictional all star team from Japan, which included players with incredible HR and AVE stats and pitchers that could not be hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;R.B.I.
