			<description>Described on the box as &amp;quot;The Card Game for Pony Lovers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 7 cards and the game-play is similar to Rummy. You can draw a card of the deck or take the top card in the discard pile. The aim is to be the first to complete a 'set'. A set must contain a pony, a bridle, a saddle, a pair of stirrups and 3 other cards that a rider might need or desire (a rosette is good and is worth 9 points whereas a grooming kit is not so nice and only scores 3 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in the set has a points value. The winning player scores those points and a new hand is played. The one with the most points after an agreed number of hands, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
