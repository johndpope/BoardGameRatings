							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rampagia: The New Kingdom</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rampagian Kingdom is much younger and more vital than its larger brother. The succession is still being established, sometimes through heredity, sometimes through force. It is a kingdom where the bold and ambitious can obtain power. There are few large cities and none with the opulence of those in the Kingdom of Peace or even that of the Principality of the Confederacy. There are small non-human enclaves here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is presently ruled by Norman I who exercises complete autocratic control. The five duchies are almost completely parceled out to his family. He has an ear for his chief, an old wizard and his younger brother. If he doesn't fall into untenable rash decisions, his family may well have a lasting hold on the monarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
