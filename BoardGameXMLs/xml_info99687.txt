			<description>In Moto Racer DS, the player races motorcycles in various settings in order to complete the game. The game has races on both dirt and paved roads, and contains a number of different game modes: Moto GP, Traffic, Supercross, and Freestyle. Moto GP makes up the core of the game, where the player races against the computer in a series of different races on pavement. A championship mode inside of Moto GP places the player in a tournament where to advance, they are required to place at a certain level. Multiple people can play each other in races through the multiplayer function in Moto GP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traffic places the player on a busy street with oncoming traffic and tasks the player with making it around the circuit without hitting any of the cars on the road. A multiplayer version of Traffic pits two players against each other on the same track to see who can maneuver through traffic better. Freestyle requires the player to perform a series of motorcycle tricks in order to earn points and advance to the next level.Supercross forces the player to drive motorcycles on a dirt track in order to perform tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Moto Racer DS&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
