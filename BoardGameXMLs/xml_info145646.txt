							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boom Town</name>
									
			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Boom Town you join the gold rush and your starting truck is all you have. With your bit of starting cash invest in a starting plot, some explosives, and start digging. Concentrate in the gold-rich areas and sell your gold ore for cash. Invest in a refinery and upgrade your rig. You will soon build a Tavern and have the first settlers move into the area. You will gradually build the Water Tower, General Store, Doctor's Office and many more buildings and attract many more tax paying settlers. Can you build the ultimate Boom Town?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
