			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 5th-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 10, 15, or 20 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several months ago, a team working for W.A.R.D. (the World Alliance for Regional Domination) attempted to steal a top-secret weapon from a military installation in Northern Scotland, but an Agency team intervened and thwarted the plan. Information gathered by the Agency operatives alerted the world to the existence of W.A.R.D., but the criminal organization&amp;rsquo;s ultimate aims remained unclear, and subsequent Agency efforts to gather additional information about W.A.R.D. and its activities have been unsuccessful. For more information about these events, see the Living Spycraft serial, SPA2-02: The Beast of Dunvegan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandra McGregor was the only survivor of the W.A.R.D. team sent in to carry out the theft in Scotland. She is an exintelligence operative and mistress of Sir Simeon Smythe, the current head of W.A.R.D. operations in Europe. Against the advice of his colleagues, Smythe authorized McGregor for the Scottish assignment, and the decision nearly cost him his position &amp;mdash; and his head. To save himself, he offered Sandra up as a scapegoat, dispatching her to W.A.R.D.&amp;rsquo;s biological research facility on Malta. She was ostensibly to become the facility&amp;rsquo;s new commander, but when she arrived, she was detained and handed over to the resident scientists to be used as a test subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
