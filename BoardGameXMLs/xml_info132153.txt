			<description>1km1kt blurp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Opposite of People is a game of illegal art. The participants will create stories of theatre and debauchery (because there&amp;rsquo;s always debauchery where theatre is involved) in settings where such works are frowned upon or outright banned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description by the author&lt;br/&gt;In The Opposite of People, the players take up the roles of a travelling troupe of actors. Though they start almost penniless and down on their luck, they hope their travels through the villages and towns of the world will bring them fame and fortune. Particularly fortune.&lt;br/&gt;The game can be set anytime and anywhere, though three settings are provided. These settings are sketched broadly in order to allow plenty of space for the players to detail their own towns, countries, cultures and people.&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed for four people, and is played in ten one-hour sessions. Each session represents one town on a tour. The first shows are performed in small communities, but the final performance takes place in the capital city itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
