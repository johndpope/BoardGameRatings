			<description>Paraphrased from the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kiss My Rules!&amp;trade; is comprised of two poker-style card games (Straight and Flush) and two fun dice-shaking games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players win rounds, &amp;ldquo;behavioral&amp;rdquo; rules are added to the game-play. Some examples of rules are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No Swear Words.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;No Pointing with your Finger.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No crossing your arms or legs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your opponents catch you or will you get away with it? As the game progresses, you&amp;rsquo;ll have many of these rules in effect at the same time. You&amp;rsquo;ll be afraid to speak or even move. If you&amp;rsquo;re really good you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to trick other players into breaking the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the Rule Cards allow you to make up your own rules.  All new rules begin as &amp;ldquo;Community&amp;rdquo; rules and must be obeyed by all players. But if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to draw a rule-changing card, you can give any rule to any player you choose to pick on. Now only that player has to play by that rule. But revenge is mighty sweet since there are several of these cards, and you may soon find yourself on the receiving end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
