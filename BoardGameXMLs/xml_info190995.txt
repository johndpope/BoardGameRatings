							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cyberblues City</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyberblues is a lot like cyberpunk, only more mellow. The game is set in an entirely fictional, near-future dystopia in which the rich 1% own 99% of the world's resources, supported by militarised police forces, global surveillance systems and by the mainstream media outlets which they control. It's a world where fairness took an extended lunch break and never came back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Cyberblues City are the kind of people who with guns, guile and superior technical skills try to make a difference. Or maybe they're just out to make a buck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
