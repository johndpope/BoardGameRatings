			<description>Knights is a Chess-style boardgame for two players, black and white. There are three types of playing pieces: soldiers, knights and one &amp;quot;knight the first&amp;quot;, soldiers are pieces dual color like the pieces of Othello.  The board is hexagonal and it has triangular spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights and &amp;quot;Knights the first&amp;quot; are placed on triangular squares, soldiers are placed at vertices of triangular spaces (intersections of the lines bounding triangular squares). Knights and &amp;quot;Knights the first&amp;quot; must be always completely surrounded by its own soldiers. Knights and &amp;quot;K.t.f&amp;quot; move from square to square, soldiers move from intersection to intersection. Players use a 4-side dice to move Knights and &amp;quot;K.t.f&amp;quot;and a 6-side dice to move soldiers. Players can move more Knights to run out the score of a dice and so for soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     players must fully deplete the score of the 4-sided dice but do not necessarily of the 6-sided dice &lt;br/&gt;     players at the end of their turn must have all his/her own knights completely surrounded by their own soldiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack and capture of a knights (or &amp;quot; k.t.f&amp;quot;):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     player must bring his/her knight(or &amp;quot; k.t.f&amp;quot;) on a triangular square with a common vertex with a triangular square occupied by an enemy knight(or &amp;quot; k.t.f&amp;quot;), then player turns the soldier placed on the common vertex, Soldier thus changes its color and owner.&lt;br/&gt;     the attacked knight now has only two soldiers of its color in the two vertex of its triangular square and the third soldier of the opposite color, so it must run away.&lt;br/&gt;     a player must use the 4-side dice to escape his/her knight(or &amp;quot; k.t.f&amp;quot;) and must use all of the score of the dice to move that knight.&lt;br/&gt;     a knight on the run must finish the move in a triangular square where are three soldiers of its color on the vertices or two soldiers of its color on vertices and a soldier of the opposite color on the third vertex, otherwise the knight is captured.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Knight the first&amp;quot; can attack two knights at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the game is to conquer opponent's home-base. Another way to victory is to defeat all opponent's Knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
