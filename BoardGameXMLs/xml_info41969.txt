May The Baddest Win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember playing boardgames like Candyland? You were an innocent kid with a dumb hair cut wishing so &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; you were playing something else like &amp;quot;Super Colossal Master of All Elementary Schools or Ruler of All the Fudgesicles in the Freezer!&amp;quot; Your super strength allowing you to flick your opponent across the orange shag carpet? Well... Your wishes have come true. With The Wild Wigout Comix Gameboards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kids These Days was one of seven crazy art boardgames produced by Scairy Hairy Toys, San Fransisco in the early to mid-1990s. Each was created by a local underground artist and each was handmade, silk-screened and extremely limited (around 100 each).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
