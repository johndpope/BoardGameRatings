			<description>A game about spiritualism, but not a spiritual game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction to the book:&lt;br/&gt;This game is written in 24 hours as part of The 1KM1KT / Free RPG Blog 24 Hour RPG Competition.&lt;br/&gt;It is based on the sentence &amp;rdquo;A better living through Necromancy&amp;rdquo;, and had to include a NPC named Keeton.&lt;br/&gt;Inspirations I'm aware of:&lt;br/&gt;Happy Ends by Tobias Wrigstad,&lt;br/&gt;Raven &amp;ndash; Claw and Beak by Tomas H.V. M&amp;oslash;rkrid,&lt;br/&gt;and Polaris by Ben Lehman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, oh Seeker of the Dead&lt;br/&gt;This game is about relationships &amp;ndash; dysfunctional relationships. We&lt;br/&gt;will each bring one problematic relationship from our lives into the&lt;br/&gt;game, and in game it will be transformed into a fictional&lt;br/&gt;relationship to a spirit.&lt;br/&gt;We will perhaps be able to resolve the issues of the relationships by&lt;br/&gt;contacting the spirits at a s&amp;eacute;ance. Hopefully reliving the past and&lt;br/&gt;speaking to the dead will help us resolve our issues with the once&lt;br/&gt;living. Time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
