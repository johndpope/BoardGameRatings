			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game which tests both dexterity and nerve.  Unexploded bombs litter a minefield.  Your job is to quickly defuse the bombs without tripping a mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World War II.  London is battered and scorched.  And although there is a pause in the fighting, a peril remains among the rubble:  UXB's - Unexploded Bombs.  These are shells that failed to detonate, but remain a danger, their unstable nature making them literally time bombs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UXB was written by Roger Hagerty and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 30, November 1982.  Versions of the code were provided for VIC-20 and Atari 8-bit systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
