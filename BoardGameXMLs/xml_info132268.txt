However, the United Nations do not see the need to intervene. Even the public request for help made by ambassador Behnam Atiqullah, whose origins lie in Khanpaa, does not make an impact: Military intervention in the case of a religious conflict is not an option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Khanpaa cannot expect any official help &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a last consequence Behnam Atiqullah has only one option: To fight fire with fire. Mercenary against mercenary. An now it&amp;lsquo;s your turn! Conquer the tormented country again. Help the suppressed people. Hire a vigorous troop of experienced mercenaries and meet old friends.
