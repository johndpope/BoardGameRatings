							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">West Point A Game For The Nation</name>
									
			<description>The game is a rather simple roll and move game. It has 43 spaces arranged in a triangle. Some spaces are marked with a cannon ball or a star. The cannon ball marked spaces are penalty spaces. Lose a turn, go back spaces and so on. the star marked spaces predict good fortune for the player but bestow no advantage in the game itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses one six sided die (1-6) for determining the number of spaces to move. The game sample has two dice cups so there may have been more than one die originally. The markers are red, black, yellow, and green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game box is mostly red with the title in yellow. A West Point Cadet in full dress is standing at attention with a bayoneted musket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
