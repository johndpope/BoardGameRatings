			<description>Erwischt vermischt! is a party game which is played while doing other activities. It is based on the original game Erwischt! (aka J'te Gage Que... or I betcha...).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a card with certain tasks which have to be fulfilled within a time frame upon which the players agree at the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this version of the game the tasks are quirks which they have to adopt. The players have to identify the quirks of the other players. In order to prevent the other players from finding out the quirks from the card, the players have to adopt as many quirks as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score points for identifying the right quirks of the other players and for their own quirks which haven't been identified. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
