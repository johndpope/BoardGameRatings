							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crop Rotation: Bug Plague</name>
									
			<description>Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar or different types of crops in the same area in sequenced seasons. In this game, you'll cultivate corn, beans and soybeans, and to win, you'll need to harvest more than your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do that, you must complete the patterns in the objective cards, all while outsmarting your opponents so they do not harvest before you. Each turn extra events can help you, allowing you to plant more, exchange crops, or even destroy parts of the farmland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crop Rotation: Bug Plague contains the base game and the Bug Plague expansion. The expansion adds an action rondel as alternative to the die to define the turn's extra event. Each player must evaluate if it is Worth pushing their luck with the die or discard objectives to use the rondel and ensure the desired event. This lowers the base game's randomness and increases the game's strategic possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the defining characteristic of the expansion is the appearance of a locust swarm that endangers the whole farm. Using it, the game changes from competitive to solo/cooperative, and the players must work together to complete the objectives before the bugs devour everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
