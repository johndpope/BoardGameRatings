			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its all about the trucking business, You know those BIG TRUCKS that are always flying down the road.  The object of the game is, who ever builds a fleet of ten trucks first wins. As you build your fleet of trucks, you contend with WEIGH STATIONS, DOT CHECKS, IRS, FUEL TAX, ROAD TAX, SHIPPERS, BROKERS TRUCK STOPS AND THE LIST GOES ON.  Unlike some game's where every one gets tired and quits, this game is fast, fun and keeps you thinking. Someone will build a fleet of trucks and win the game in a fair amount of time. If you are wondering, yes there are forty trucks in the game to support up to 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
