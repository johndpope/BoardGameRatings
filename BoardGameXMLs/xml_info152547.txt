			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fast moving miniatures game that provides the feel of modern warfare. Land, sea and air units interact on a 3D battlefield. Armored thrusts are met by guided missiles, APDS rounds, and attack choppers. Defensive positions are pounded by aircraft and artillery, as infantry are all present. All the rules and data you need to refight Desert Storm or other scenarios are included. All you supply is miniatures, dice, and enthusiasm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While data has been included for all of the major weapon systems of the War in the Gulf, this book is suitable for simulating modern armored combat anywhere in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes:&lt;br/&gt;- Rules for modern micro armour&lt;br/&gt;- Complete rules for three dimensional combat&lt;br/&gt;- Data for over 70 vehicles, 40 aircraft, and boats&lt;br/&gt;- Complete combat charts and templates&lt;br/&gt;- Organization charts for over 50 Allied and Iraqi units&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;122 page softback book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this book includes 1980 through 2000 period weapons and vehicles, the rules can be used for any period 1914 through today. Each model represents a vehicle or fire team/squad depending upon historical organizations. 1 inch = 50m ground scale, each turn is 1 minute of movement/combat capability (really 5 minutes of time when we account for command and control). Complementary books include Mekong...Vietnam and Frontlines: Korea 1950-53, which also include the full rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available from MSD Games within the Frontlines Series &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.msdgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.msdgames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
