			<description>Each player takes the role of the Librarian. Players try to retrieve precious artifacts to expand the Library Collection. Based on the 'Librarian' Series of Movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses two custom card decks, an Action Deck and an Artifact Deck as well as a six-sided die for determining Initiative each round and the number of Fate cards drawn from the Action deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Action Deck is composed of 80 cards divided into 8 suits of 10 cards. The suits are Knowledge, Danger, Travel, Companion, Escape, Foe, Puzzle, and Location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Artifact Deck is composed of 27 cards, each of which grants a special ability to the player controlling it. Artifact cards are acquired by playing melds of Action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won by collecting a certain number of Artifacts. The players choose the game length prior to play - from a &amp;quot;Short Game&amp;quot; (3 Artifacts) to a &amp;quot;Full Game&amp;quot; (9 Artifacts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic game play is for an Artifact and a number of actions (Fate cards) to be displayed.  Players collect action cards into their hand attempting to collect a meld of 8 different suites in order to claim the artifact.  If no player can claim the Artifact, it remains in play for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artifacts currently in player control and optionally disposed of action cards can be used to modify the flow of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
