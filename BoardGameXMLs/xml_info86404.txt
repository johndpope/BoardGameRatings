			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not the place you thought it was. Your textbooks and histories are all wrong. Nothing is as it was, as you expect it to be. This is a changed world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Mundus Novit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mundus Novit: The Changed World is a source book for modern role-playing games, encompassing magic, parapsychic powers, and super-soldiers all lurking in the hidden recesses of the world we read about in the newspapers every day. How did we get here? The secret histories of the world have been compiled, and the changes wrought since December 23, 2003 have been outlined. The secrets are here. Who are these people? Here, you will find the black projects and covert organizations catalogued. Here, you will learn of the forces arrayed against you, and those to whom you can turn for help. What have we wrought? A world of wonders and horrors await you. Whether adding to an existing campaign or starting fresh, you will find words of advice on how one might use the strange secrets collected herein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your world is about to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes no system and mechanical information. This sourcebook describes the Changed World of Mundus Novit, and can be used with any role-playing game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
