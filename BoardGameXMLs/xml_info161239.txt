			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I've got weapons, armour, a baggage train, a household, but... There's more. More than my artificers can make. There's that...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being: More or Less Fantastical Olde Worlde Technologies is a tool designed to support development of certain beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On just one page it provides 216 table entries arranged across six columns, for use individually or in various combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entries cover aspects of form, function and behaviour, along with specific parts and their nature, including glitches...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is compatible with various genres and systems and suitable for use in roleplaying and beyond. It can be used to inspire and detail beings, even at the table in the course of games - and not least to find out what it is the party just stumbled across...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three pages are arranged for ease of use on screen or printed, the key features in two variant layouts. The tool includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     216 table entries arranged in six columns and six rows, all on one page&lt;br/&gt;     six categories - appearance, feature, structure, detail, element and glitch&lt;br/&gt;     a smaller multi-purpose table for status, levels and relative positions&lt;br/&gt;     a compact diceless number generator for a specific range used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be used in conjunction with Elaboration: Structure &amp; Surface, which has 540 descriptive terms for detailing locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
