			<description>Adsubmuldi is a self-described checkers variant utilizing pieces with numerals on the undersides of the pieces.  Apparently its name was derived thus: ADdition, SUBtraction, MULtiplication, DIvision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the game are instructions for two variants, Adsubmuldi and Adsubmuldi Fractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a quote from its introduction: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These two series of games are based on the game of checkers, and are played on a standard checkerboard with checker-like pieces.  The basic rules of checkers also apply.  Although two players normally oppose each other, the games can be played by one person opposing himself or by four players pairing up and playing as partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the games is to accumulate the most points by solving correctly the larger number of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems.  Adsubmuldi is designed to reinforce these skills with whole numbers, and Adsubmuldi Fractions does the same with fractions and mixed numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, as in regular checkers, when all the playing pieces belonging to one of the players have been captured.  However, the winner of the game is the player with the most points, even if he is the one who lost all the playing pieces.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
