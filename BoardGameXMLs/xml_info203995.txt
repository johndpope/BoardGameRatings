							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wildlands</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wildlands is the name of the large area filled with land unclaimed by the Southern Kingdoms. There are city-states, small duchies, even a country or two, freeholds, gathers and unpopulated areas that fall under the general protection of Grayson's Grey Rangers. While there is no capital, Kithros is used as a meeting place and there's a number of cities that have sprung up along trade routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come, explore with us. Learn about the different things you can find here in the Wildlands. There are forests, hills, marshes and even some land that lies upon the ocean. There's an encounter table, new creatures and plants and you'll find several towns that came to being as a part of the living Justice and Life campaign that was created during the Shaintar Kickstarter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside, you'll find a nice GM supplement that will help you when your party is travelling around the Wildlands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
