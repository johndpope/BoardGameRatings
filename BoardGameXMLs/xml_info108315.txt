			<description>An American Tail: Fievel Goes West is about a cartoon mouse who must make his way to the Wild West based on the movie of the same name released back in 1991.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must either fight or avoid cats and other obstacles as he strolls westward. The game is side-scrolling with a side-view of the action at nearly all times.  The character is armed with a pop gun that can eliminate the bad guys using a non-violent approach to the Wild West genre. An NES version of this game was planned. However, it was never released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
