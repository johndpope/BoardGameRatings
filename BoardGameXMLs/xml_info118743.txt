			<description>Namco Driver's Eyes is a first-person Formula One simulator on the namco system 21 hardware released in 1990. The game has a pseudo-panoramic view using three C.R.T. screens; the player would sit in a then realistic formula one car cockpit with L.C.D. instruments. The game starts with the player selecting either &amp;quot;easy drive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;technical drive&amp;quot; (this is an explanation of what happens after the player has made his/her selection) when selection was made the screen would show a 3d model of a formula one car with a V8 engine being placed into the engine bay then the body work gliding down. As this happens the camera view changes and reveals a sign saying &amp;quot;BRAKES ON&amp;quot; when the sign is lifted the race starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Driver's Eyes&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
