			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2 players game in which players search the city looking for the coolest pictures of Monsters (who just happen to live in a parallel dimension we've just discovered).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players will manage their hand of cards and their action tokens in order to collect the most valuable and powerful cards on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed by the author to ask his girlfriend to marry him, and was a wedding present for the people attending to his wedding. It was also used as a product sample by Cartamundi promoting their &amp;quot;MAKE MY GAME&amp;quot; online platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
