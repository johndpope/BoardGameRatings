							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mechaphisto: The Demon Lord of Technology</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His Name is Mechaphisto&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is woven throughout our history. He is inspiration and temptation. He is our muse and our tormentor. He is Mechaphisto; the Demon Lord of Technology, and he wants the souls of mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time in the history of Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game, we offer this insight into the workings of Hell itself. See how the hierarchy of demons is established, exactly what they want human souls for, and what they do with them. Learn dark secrets of human history, and peek behind the scenes of the infernal connection between mankind's sudden leaps in inspiration, and mankind's damnation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And while you're at it, Mechaphisto has an offer for criminals, governments, and Adventurers of all kinds. Oh, it isn't much - just a tiny little device that will make any piece of technology work better, maybe even miraculously so. Weapons do more damage, tools work faster and better, armor protects more strongly, vehicles move faster, and everything becomes tougher. What would you pay?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And in that moment where that boost of effectiveness might be the only thing that could save your life... what wouldn't you pay?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We refer heavily to material in Librum Enchantus, you may want a copy of that for reference. Also recommended, but not required, is a strong sense of the difference between right and wrong, and the ability to see when something is just too good to be true...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
