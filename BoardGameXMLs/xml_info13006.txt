			<description>This game is based on the Arduin Role-Playing system by Dave Hargrave. It's described as a game like Poker with unusual twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are the same numerical cards, 2-10, Jack (Knight), Queen, King and Ace. And like in some Poker varients the Ace may be played as high or low. Whereas a standard Poker deck has four suites, Swords &amp;amp; Dragons has eight. And there is a similarity in which one hand will defeat another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play appears to be a mix of Hold 'Em, Stud Poker and Go Fish. Cards can be asked for and received by another player if one hasn't hidden them in their Trove. The Trove allows a player to hold up to four cards without worry of them being asked for in Go Fish style. Essentially players can use the cards in their hand and the one &amp;quot;Up&amp;quot; card, that being the last card discarded, as their current hand. The &amp;quot;Up&amp;quot; card may also be taken by a player on their turn and the discard becomes the new &amp;quot;Up&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round ends when all but one player folds - due to not calling a raise, or the deck runs out of cards.. or, all players call the raise. Then a showdown occurs and it's winner take all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components are a bit flimsy. Two medium quality shrinkwrapped decks stashed in a cotton bag, a photocopied rules set and a white fold-up box with a label glued on. The retail is $14.99&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
