			<description>The goal is to better understand the cities of France and their specialties. The winner will be the first that will link 10 cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plateau represents France with its major cities, roads and highways.&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives 10 cards at the start &amp;quot;step-Specialty&amp;quot; and a map of &amp;quot;Help&amp;quot;. Each examines his cards and decides the best course to perform and then announces each departure city and arrival city. In turn, players roll a dice marked 1 to 6 (for roads) or a spinning top marked from 1 to 10 (for highways) and move their vehicles to as many boxes as points obtained. Obtaining a duplicate card entitles &amp;quot;Help&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each time a player reaches a milestone, it exposes the corresponding card and draws a token &amp;quot;tourist&amp;quot; (the latter will lose 1 turn an opponent coming into the city's token).&lt;br/&gt;Fields marked with an asterisk qualify for a card &amp;quot;Bon Voyage&amp;quot;, the boxes marked with a danger sign forced to draw a card &amp;quot;Danger&amp;quot; (which may be offset by a relief map).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each step relates the items on the map &amp;quot;step&amp;quot;, the first arriving at its destination town gains 200 points, the second 150 points, 100 points the third and fourth 50 points. A penalty of 30 points is imposed for each stage missed.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the one who scores the highest score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
