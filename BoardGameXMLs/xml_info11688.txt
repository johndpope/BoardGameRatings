			<description>Tactical Football (Soccer) at its best.  Teams have a card for whether they play at home or away.  Die rolls determine how many men may move, dribble, or kick through a unique Team Card.  Team cards were sold separate for different teams, each with their own stats.  The game does take Free Kicks, Penalty Kicks, Goal Kicks, and other soccer rules into account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is overlaid with hexagons and the game comes with a cardboard stadium to build around the game board.  Players are stand-up cardboard placed into plastic bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was produced in association with the Bobby Charlton Soccer School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
