							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Million Onion Hotel</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Dr. Peace's strange hotel!&lt;br/&gt;Everyone comes this hotel to find out the secret of &amp;quot;Miracle Soup&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long, long time ago, there was a tiny country between that country over there and this country over here. In this country was a strange hotel. This hotel's specialty was &amp;quot;magical onion soup&amp;quot;. They say many famous and great people came to taste this soup, though apparently not one of them thought to describe the flavor to anyone else. Maybe it's because the soup had a hidden power. Yes ... a secret power. One night, some esteemed guests find themselves suddenly sucked into a far-off galaxy! Maybe this is because they ... drank too much of the magical onion soup?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
