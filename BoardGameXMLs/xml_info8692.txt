			<description>Do you remember your first kiss? Can you recall how your grandparents met and fell in love? Family Reunion: The Game is an exciting new board game that comes complete with 240 photo cards that will inspire friends and family to recall memories, pass down traditions and reveal never-been-told stories and family secrets. Skeleton in the Closet, Snapshots, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not telling the whole story&amp;rdquo; and Family Secret cards provide lively competition allowing players to challenge stories and thwart opponents. The first player to collect one photo from each category, (Traditions, Magic Moments, Happy Days and Hand Me Downs) wins. Losers tell all as the winner asks all players to reveal a family secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family Reunion: The Game can be customized when players use their own photos in game play and trace their family history with the provided &amp;quot;Family Tree illustration&amp;quot;. Reproducible invitations allow friends and family to personalize each Family Reunion occasion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Source:  USAopoly.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
