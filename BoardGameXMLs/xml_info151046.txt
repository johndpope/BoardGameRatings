			<description>From the text:&lt;br/&gt;This game can be played as a simple series of individual tales about individuals seeking enlightenment, but it can be a complete world building experience as well. Places described in one pilgrim's tale can be expanded with the descriptions of another, events that seemed important in one pilgrim's story might occur as cursory incidents in the next pilgrim's quest. As an incentive to build up the world this way, the Auspicious Bodhisattva might award another player a random token from the centre of the table if they feel the continuity of the outside world was been maintained (this may be done once per pilgrim and should be awarded to the player who created the best piece of worldbuiding.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
