			<description>Mennonite Manners is a simple fun and crazy dice party game. All you need is a sheet of paper per player, one pencil, and one six sided die. The first player to write out the numbers 1-100 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Place the pencil in the middle of the playing area. Players each roll the die in turn until someone rolls a six. That player takes the pencil and starts writing out the numbers 1-100 as fast as they can. The other players continue rolling the die in turn. When someone else gets a six they gently grab the pencil from the player currently writing and start writing 1-100 on their sheet. Continue until someone gets to 100. Numbers may be checked for legibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game doesn't sound like much, but usually generates a lot of laughter, especially when someone is just beginning to write and the pencil is grabbed away. If grabbing pencils sounds dangerous then you can try ringing a bell to stop play in order for the writing player to give the pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
