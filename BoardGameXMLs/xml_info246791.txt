			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trapped in the ruins of Washington D.C., the last survivors of the human race are on the brink of extinction.  Robot keepers hold them captive in the Human Preserve, an exclusive zoo for the highest species on the planet.  The preserve has a thousand hiding places, but it's hard to tell enemies from friends.  You'll meet a reclusive scientist with mysterious motives and a bottomless bag of tricks.  A beautiful woman is trapped in a high-tech palace swarming with robot guards.  There's a robot in the White House.  The Capitol is full of Death Poodles.  The old subway is a river of slime where Harry the Subhuman holds the key to the darkest secrets of the Preserve.  You're the only one who can put it all together and fight back.  Go ahead.  Beat the 'bots.  Free D.C.  You can do it.  Maybe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
