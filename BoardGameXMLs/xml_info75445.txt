			<description>&amp;ldquo;Grunwald &amp;ndash; the Greatest Battle of 600 years&amp;rdquo; - a history card game with illustrations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everybody knows that on the 15th July of 1410, at Grunwald the joined armies of Poland and Lithuania defeated the Teutonic Knights Order. However, only few people will have the opportunity to&amp;hellip; change the course of history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the occasion of the 600th Anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, the National Centre for Culture, in order to promote the celebrations, has published a two-players' history illustrated card game  &amp;quot;Grunwald &amp;ndash; the Greatest Battle of 600 years&amp;rdquo;. One of the player is the leader of the Polish-Lithuanian army and the other leads the Teutonic Order. Each of them has a separate deck of 55-cards. The fight is a dynamic 20-30 minutes game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players use the figures of military leaders, historical divisions and unconventional tactics enabling to tilt the scales of victory in one of the players' favour. The rules are simple and easy to learn even for the beginners, and the possibility of applying diverse tactics and strategies makes the game quick and dynamic, each time with a different scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a series of successive clashes between subsequent military leaders and their divisions. The game is won by the player who is the first to gain six banners of the enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to familirise young people with history, that is why it includes educational elements such as real historical figures, battle formations and real medieval weapons. It features a description of the battle. The card illustrations were verified for their historical fidelity by a military historian, Tomasz Mleczek. The game was created by Michał Stachyra and Maciej Zasowski from the publishing house Kuźnia Gier, and Piotr Foksowicz and Krzysztof Rogulski are the authors of the illustrations in the form of comic-book-like drawings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the box there are 110 cards (2 decks) together with an instruction including educational elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is not for sale and was distributed free of charge, among others, during &amp;quot;The Grunwald Days&amp;quot; on 15-17 July 2010 on the Fields of Grunwald.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source - nck.pl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
