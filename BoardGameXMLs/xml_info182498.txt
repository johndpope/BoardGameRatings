							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tea House of the Blue Moon</name>
									
			<description>A Tea House is a place where patrons come to drink, eat and be entertained by honorable, traditional Japanese female entertainers who act as hostesses; and whose skills include performing various Japanese arts such as classical music, dance, games and conversation, mainly to entertain male customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with a &amp;quot;Tea Table&amp;quot; in the center of the table. &amp;quot;Patrons&amp;quot; are randomly drawn, and placed at each of the six place settings. Each player starts with three cards; and each turn, players must play one card onto a patron, and then draw one card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is most important that the patrons are kept happy. A happy patron gives generous tips. Each patron favors or dislikes some of the services that the entertainers provide, so serve each patron in a manner to make them most happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You entertain the patrons by playing cards onto a patron of your choice, which adds the promise of a tip. The amount of the tip increases as additional entertainment cards are played on the patrons. A player can only collect the accumulated tips on a patron by playing a &amp;quot;Collect Tips&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player has collected enough Yen to end the game (based on number of players), they may choose to end the game by saying: &amp;ldquo;I win.&amp;rdquo; All players finish the current round, and the player with the most Yen is the winner. If players are tied for the most Yen, they share the victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the August 2015 24-Hour Game Design Challenge! Revisions and tweaks being made to publish on The Game Crafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
