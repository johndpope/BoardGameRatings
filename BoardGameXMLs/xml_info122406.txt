			<description>SYNOPSIS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Since the Ascension, the universe is a hard-fought setting of the Technomagi. Besides their schemes and secret agendas, they fight a power struggle for the most valuable resource that is known to sentiment beings: Crystallium. This substance fuels all Magitech, an invention that grants godlike powers by fusing magic and technology. Mighty legions and armadas of spaceships became obsolete within the blink of an eye, as the Technomagi tapped into the possibilities of Magitech. In the far away future, battles are fought and decided by a selected few instead. Accompanied by their Minions, Technomagi strive for nothing less than ultimate rulership over the universe. And Crystallium is the key to victory...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUMMARY OF PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;The Magitech Wars&amp;quot; - players take the roles of mighty Technomagi - competing to claim  Crystallium Sources on the plane, through skirmish battles. Using customized Vaults of cards, a hex-tile gameboard, six sided dice and tokens, they let their minions fight  to become the emperor of a fictitious multiverse. From turn to turn the players summon Minions and move them around the board to let them battle. Players gain crystals by putting some of their Minions into the crystal zone, and win the game through gathering six victory points. Those points are scored by controlling the most Places of Power on the gameboard, or by banishing enemy cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player who scores six Victory Points, wins the game. This is done in two different ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Control Places of Power.&lt;br/&gt;     Banish enemy cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
