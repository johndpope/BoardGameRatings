			<description>Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style - aka Wu-Tang: Taste the Pain in PAL regions - is a four-player, 3D fighting game for the PlayStation. The basis for the game's story and setting is the real-life rap group the Wu-Tang Clan, featuring characters based on their stage personas and the martial arts themes of their music. Some members of the group also provided voiceover work for the game and made vocal and production contributions to the game's music.&lt;br/&gt;Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style uses the same engine created by its developer, Paradox Development, for their unreleased PlayStation title Thrill Kill. That game was noteworthy for allowing up to four players to fight simultaneously, a feature heavily utilized in Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style.&lt;br/&gt;Due to the game's graphic depicitions of blood and violence, a special code had to be entered within the game to see the full, uncensored action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
