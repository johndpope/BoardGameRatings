			<description>Subtitle: A Devilishly Simple Roleplaying Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MACABRE is a game about something that is a part of every culture&amp;rsquo;s history - witchcraft. As the game is supposed to be short and sweet, to include a long description about witchcraft and it&amp;rsquo;s history, lore and impact on the varying cultures would fill up a whole book in itself, let alone a short 14-page game such as this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SKETCH games are designed for one-off, single night adventures, for when gaming groups are taking a break between campaigns, or if a few players want to do a fast off-the-cuff adventure with no intention of getting involved in a long campaign. As such, this game does not have a detailed experience system. Of course, the rules can be used for long campaigns if you really want, but the simplicity of the rules and character creation is such that a game can be set up in minutes. The rules are simple and easy to use, requiring only the use of a six-sided dice for all aspects of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
