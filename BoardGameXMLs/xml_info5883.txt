			<description>This game, the only product from Rebel Games, an Australian company, is a simple wargame about the struggle between rival ant colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The (rather plain) map shows a number of danger areas (spider webs and the like, although they are all abstracted) and ant trails, with the nests around the edges. Players move worker and soldier ants out of their nests and around the board trying to collect food and avoid the danger areas and the praying mantises, which move randomly across the map eating ants. Soldier ants may attack ants from other colonies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
