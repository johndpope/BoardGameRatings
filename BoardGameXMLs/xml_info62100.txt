			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We all know the legends of the brownie tinkerers. Many of us has seen a movie or read a book or two of goblins, gnomes, or other little people gifted with the ability to craft wondrous objects and strange mechanical devices. The boggles are the embodiment of that concept. Even they are the product of arcane tinkering; derived from lowly and dim goblin slaves. Boggles are born with an instinctual knack for building, breaking, and fixing things. They thrive on solving puzzles, crafting new solutions, and unraveling mechanical mysteries. Unfortunately, they are also born with a dreadful affliction that threatens their tightly wound intellect. In their old age, without a near constant infusion of a special alchemical formula, they degenerate into murderous maniacs. Ready to live life on the edge of genius and madness? Want to build a better orc-trap? Like breaking things? Then perhaps the Boggle PC race is meant for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
