			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer of 2011 was blisteringly hot and humid, both in Britain and in the rest of the world.&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps nothing too unusual.Then it started to rain.&lt;br/&gt;Still nothing unusual.&lt;br/&gt;It started to rain everywhere in the world, even in deserts.&lt;br/&gt;And it didn't stop.&lt;br/&gt;Ever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About this Book&lt;br/&gt;The Drowned Lands is a sandbox for the Wordplay roleplaying game.  It details a number of communities in part of what was once the south coast of England, and the wilderness that lies between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each community has its own strengths, weaknesses and resources it needs. There are opportunities and adventure hooks in every place, both for people from that community and visitors from elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Navigator will be able to use Drowned Lands for a single adventure or short series of adventures within the setting with a minimum of preparation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, the player characters will have a wide variety of options open to them and places they can visit- with significant things they can do at each one.&lt;br/&gt;In some cases, the player characters will find opportunities to do big and potentially setting-changing things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
