			<description>&amp;quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 (also known as NFS6, NFS: HP2, and Hot Pursuit 2) is a 2002 racing video game, serving as the debut Need for Speed (NFS) title from EA Black Box, and the first Need For Speed for the sixth generation of consoles as well as the last of the Classic Era Need for Speed Games. In 2003, the game was awarded Console Racing Game of the Year at the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot Pursuit 2 draws primarily from the gameplay and style of Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit; its emphasis was on evading the police and over-the-top tracks featuring lengthy shortcuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the game's predecessor, the player also has the option to play as a police officer trying to arrest speeders. To do so the player rams the speeding vehicle multiple times to disable it. The player must turn on their lights and sirens while in pursuit, and they automatically turn off after arresting the suspect. Police can call for a road block, spike strips, and request help from a helicopter to assist in chasing the target vehicle. At the end, the player is awarded for the cars busted. In the PlayStation 2 version this mode is called You're the Cop mode while in the PC, Gamecube and Xbox versions it's Be the Cop mode.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Need_for_Speed:_Hot_Pursuit_2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
