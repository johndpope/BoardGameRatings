			<description>A Liar's Dice-like game. The players try to get as few minus points as possible. One player gets the writing pad and writes down the names of all players under a preprinted face. The active player rolls the three dice inside a cup and announces a result. He's free to tell the truth or to bluff. The next player can contest the result or continue with the next throw, in which he has to have a higher result than the player before him.&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player is contesting the result the cup is turned over and the player who's wrong gets a minus point. If a player gets a pair, a trimmel (three similar numbers) or a street he gets bonus points. Whenever a player gets a drilling of six he can reveal his throw and distribute 5 minus points among the other players. Whenever all but one player have six minus points the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
