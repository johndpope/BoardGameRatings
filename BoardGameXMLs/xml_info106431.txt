			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This web enhancement for &amp;quot;Warriors of Heaven&amp;quot; describes the Quesar race in 2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the front of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quesar are, at once, a source of pride and shame for the aasimon. Unlike the clumsy, nonsentient golems crafted by mortals, the quesar are radiant, free-thinking beings infused with life and an unshakable desire to uphold the cause of good. They are virtuous, strident, and compassionate by design. The aasimon, in their supreme arrogance, thought they had created the perfect servitors. However, once the eagerness to please their creators had worn off, the quesar rejected their role of servitude. They had every intention of remaining a powerful force for good, but they wanted to walk their own path. The aasimon reacted poorly to the quesar's push toward freedom, thinking them insolent and disrespectful. The rift between the creators and the created widened until, at last, this divergence led to war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
