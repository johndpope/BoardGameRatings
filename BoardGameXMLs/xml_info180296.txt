							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fever Chill</name>
									
			<description>Fever Chill is a light deduction game for 3 players. Players are doctors trying to keep themselves healthy and sabotage their rivals. In simultaneous card selection (and occasional revealing), they will choose to raise or lower their opponents temperature using their virus or medicine cards. After 3 rounds of playing cards on the players to their left and right, the player plays the final card on themselves. The player that is closest to their original temperature wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
