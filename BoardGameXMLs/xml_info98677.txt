							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Player Starship: The Gunslinger Betty</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome aboard The Gunslinger Betty, the toughest little transport this side of the corridors. She should make a swell base of operations for you and your partners for whatever business ventures you have in mind. From exploration and survey work to mercenary duty and even blockade running. There&amp;rsquo;s precious little she can&amp;rsquo;t tackle with the right crew and the right Captain at the helm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is more than a quick overview of a single starship. In almost any science fiction novel or film the starship figures largely in the unfolding drama. Starships in science fiction occupy a spot as vital as any character on screen and yet even the best ships are provided with the merest of cursory overviews in most RPG source books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This starship feature series has been produced as a tool for making this starship the most immersive experience possible for you and your players. Significant efforts have been invested into this resource book so it will provide game directors with dozens of plot hooks, adventure ideas and tons of little details written to enrich their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
