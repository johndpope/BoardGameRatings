							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ossoko Draconsha</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep within the swamp lies the lizardfolk village of Ossoko Draconsha, founded to honour the defeat of an ancient black dragon who terrorized the area long ago. Starting out as a neutral ground between warring lizardfolk tribes, the village has prospered in recent generations thanks to rumours of its magical, restorative pool. Merchants now arrive regularly at Ossoko Draconsha to trade for exotic and hard to get animal skins, herbs and plants from the swamp. However, recently the sacred skull which symbolizes the village&amp;rsquo;s neutrality disappeared and something or someone seems to be interfering with the lizardfolk contacting their guardian spirit. If these issues are not resolved, the village could see itself swallowed up by the denizens of the swamp, or worse, taken over by a greedy merchant consortium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
