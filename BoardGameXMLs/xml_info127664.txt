			<description>The world has collapsed.&lt;br/&gt; In 2012 modern civilisation is coming to an end. Global economics have been disrupted, money has lost its value. People have risen against the ignorant politicians who were just lining their pockets &amp;ndash; and they didn't spare any of them.&lt;br/&gt; However, those who really ruled the world were prepared - and escaped, leaving billions of people to die from a strange virus, while others turned into butcherly beasts with just one thought: &lt;br/&gt;TO KILL!&lt;br/&gt; Only a few people on the planet have survived, at least until they run out of ammo... or learn what else they must do to stop them...&lt;br/&gt; Smash hordes of bloodthirsty zombies * Secure vital supplies * Save other survivors * Protect the safe haven * Explore the city * and uncover the provoking truth in this intense FPS action game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
