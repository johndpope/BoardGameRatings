			<description>Who's the hungriest Zombie among your friends? Find out with this outrageous, fast-paced party game. This game is based on the popular &amp;quot;I Have&amp;quot; card game. The winner is the first player to run out of cards. Players race each other to drop Zombie, Werewolf, Ghost, Spider, and other horror creature cards into the Darkness Pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt cards with &amp;quot;I Ate&amp;quot; side up and these cards will be laid out in front of themselves, same side up. The first player reads his/her &amp;quot;I Ate&amp;quot; card. Example: &amp;quot;I Ate a Werewolf&amp;quot;. After reading the &amp;quot;I Ate&amp;quot; statement, he/she flips that card over and reads the &amp;quot;Who Ate&amp;quot; side of the card. Example: &amp;quot;I ate a Werewolf. Who ate a Zombie?&amp;quot; All players then race to respond to the &amp;quot;Who Ate&amp;quot; question if they have that specific card. To respond to a &amp;quot;Who Ate&amp;quot; guestion, a player says, &amp;quot;I Ate a...Who Ate a...?&amp;quot; and places his/her card &amp;quot;Who Ate&amp;quot; side up in the darkness pit (card pile). Play continues as stated above until a player gets rid of all of his/her cards to the darkness pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
