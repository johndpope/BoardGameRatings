							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Prince of Pies</name>
									
			<description>A micro-card game played in your hand.  You take the role of the Jack, who is out to steal as many pies as he can before the Kings can catch him.  Played with a unique deck of 17 cards, you have to use the abilities of your Jack to steal pies and avoid the Kings.  If there are ever two Kings in a row, you have been caught!  At the end of the game, tally up how many pies you managed to steal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is based on the old poem &amp;quot;The Queen of Hearts&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
