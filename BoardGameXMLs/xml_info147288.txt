			<description>In F&amp;uuml;hlzwerge, players need to put fingers on their eyes in order to find the right items fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, place all twenty cardboard tokens into the bag; these tokens are shaped to resemble the items depicted on them: an elephant, a ship, a wheel, a tree, and so on. Each player receives an equal number of cards from the deck, with each card showing one of these twenty items. The youngest player takes the dwarf die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game starts, everyone but the youngest player shoves one hand into the bag at the same time and tries to grab items depicted on the cards in front of them. If a player draws a token matching such a card, great! Place the item on that card. If he instead draws a token matching a card in front of another player, well, he just helped that player get one step closer to victory as he must place the token of the card anyway. The player with the die rolls it repeatedly, possibly needing to jump up then sit back down, possibly needing to switch hands. As soon as she rolls her second dwarf, she passes the die to the closest player clockwise, who must then start rolling while she tries to fish tokens from the bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as someone has tokens on all of her cards, she wins the game! (Players can also play without the die, with everyone fishing for tokens at the same time.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
