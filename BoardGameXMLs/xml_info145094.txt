							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mission #0772</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fan-created mission for Orpheus.&lt;br/&gt; From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MISSION TYPE: Black Ops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOCATION: Palliser Hotel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have received a special request from a regular, highly valuable client of ours. A small, talented crucible is needed to handle a very sensitive mission on extremely short notice.  You have been selected on the basis of your previous performances and dedication to Orpheus Group, and also because of your unique abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Senator Garrett Brahams (D-New York) chairs the Senate Committee on Intelligence Affairs, and is facing re-election in this state soon. Senator Brahams is a highly charismatic and personable man with a wide base of electoral support; preliminary polling indicates that he is going to be re-elected to one of New York's Senate seats by a large margin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senator Brahams, however, has made numerous enemies during his term in office. Our client has expressed certain concerns over his impending re-election; although the reasons why have not been made fully clear to us, our client does not wish Senator Brahams to have a second term as New York Senator. They have hired Orpheus to this effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tonight at 19:30, Senator Brahams is holding a fundraising dinner for Democratic Party supporters at the Palliser Hotel in downtown Manhattan. Afterwards, approximately 22:00, he has invited a small number of reporters back to his hotel room to discuss campaign issues and, secretly, to leak some unknown information to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
