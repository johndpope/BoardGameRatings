			<description>You are an ambitious jarl of a small tribe of Vikings. Only featly leading your people and steering your tribe to wealth and prosperity you will be able to become a respected leader of your people! Improving your settlement, pillaging the villages and building the temples in the name of Odin, gain glory and become the legend, perpetuated in a Viking saga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Lords of the Fjords, you start your game in a poor village with just one ship at the pier and a couple of sellswords. Each turn, the players take from the —Åloth bag the specified number of meeples that exist in three different colors. Each of three colors means a certain type of specialists and for your turn you have to choose only one one color to perform one type of action: Builders (yellow) allow you to build new ships and temples; Counsellors (blue) are great at diplomatic and trade affairs, which can attract new skilled people to your village, which is necessary for its growth; while Warriors (red), for sure, are needed to attack other villages (because no Viking can live his life without tough fights and glorious victories).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting the game with identical resources, all players must find their own strategy towards the glory. Building new ships and temples brings you more gold and victory points respectively. Improving your facilities allows you to get more actions on your future turns, hire new sellswords that will fight for you to the last breath, or even send an intruder that will get in the way of your opponents and steal their gold for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquering unexplored lands you can achieve everything at once: get some useful bonuses, do some extra actions of other types on the same turn and gain the victory points. But you should be careful attacking the villages - most of tribes will call for help of their neighbours when you try to pillage their lands and some of them can also be protected by high palisade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of the Fjords is a simple but involving game of strategy that combines different game mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
