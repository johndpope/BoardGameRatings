							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fuzion: Appleseed</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These rules assume the character is generating a human, nonbioroid, and non-cyborg character. These rules also use the same mechanics presented in the standard Fuzion core rules, and therefore will gloss over rules that remain the same and material that does not differ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: These rules assume the use of the 3d6 dice mechanic, and the 10-point DT bonuses have already been integrated into the DTs of mechanics listed in this RPG. To allow for the 1d10 dice mechanic, simply subtract 10 from all DTs. Also note that in all cases; refer to the standard Fuzion rules except where they are contradicted in these plug-ins and rulings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
