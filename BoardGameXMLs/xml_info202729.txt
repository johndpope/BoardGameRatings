							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">When Pigs Fly: A Card Game for Cincinnati Cynics</name>
									
			<description>Inspired by the famous game for terrible people everywhere, Cards Against Humanity, this card set will have you laughing and crying about our beautiful and horrible city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not a Cards Against Humanity expansion deck, nor is it meant to be mixed in with your Cards Against Humanity deck. With 60 question cards and 240 answer cards, there&amp;rsquo;s more than enough content to play a full game using only this deck. Every single card is Cincinnati-themed, so this game will give you and your friends hours of local laughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disclaimer: This game is intended for players 18 years or older. We do not recommend this game for minors. In other words, do not buy this game for your children unless you want to corrupt their innocent minds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legalese: We have absolutely no affiliation with Cards Against Humanity nor is this an unofficial expansion deck. Cards Against Humanity is a trademark of Cards Against Humanity LLC, and is completely unaffiliated with this site and its contents. Price includes sales tax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
