			<description>Camouflage is a card game from 1918 comprised of three games: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Camouflage&lt;br/&gt;    Young America Battle Game and Tactics&lt;br/&gt;    Militac&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards consist of suits of Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering Corps and Ammunition. There is also a President Card. Each suit is numbered from 1 to 11. The President card is unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Camouflage is a trick taking game for 2 to 6 players. The object of the game is to take as few ammunition cards as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young America Battle Game and Tactics is for four players &amp;quot;every man for himself.&amp;quot; The President and Engineering Corps cards are removed from the deck.&lt;br/&gt;The player to the left of the dealer looks for an ammunition card in his hand and if there is one, throws it face up on the table with a spinning motion. He then decides in which direction the card points. The players not pointed to by the card, play cards which are then taken by the person it is pointing to. Continue until all cards are played. Whichever player has the highest points wins the round. The first player to win three rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Militac is for four players in two teams of two. In this game the Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery and Engineering Corps cards are used. In this game, there is bidding as in bridge for the number of tricks or &amp;quot;corps&amp;quot; that can be taken. The first side securing 50 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
