			<description>Darklight Conflict is a science fiction arcade style shooter computer game developed by Rage Software and published by Electronic Arts in 1997 for PCs running MSDOS or versions of Microsoft Windows before Windows 2000, and the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation game consoles. In this game, you play the part of a contemporary, Cold War-Era human fighter pilot abducted by the alien Repton species during your aerial battle, and biologically modified to become a starfighter pilot for them in their war against the Ovon race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game itself, you would usually pilot one of three different starfighters, each with different strengths and weaknesses, along with occasionally piloting a captured enemy ship, or controlling a gun turret on your Mothership (The &amp;quot;War Drum&amp;quot;). The missions are quite varied, ranging from simple combat missions to missions where you need to defend your Mothership, destroy an enemy Ovon Mothership, clear an asteroid field, or retrieve an object with a tractor beam. Your ship moves between mission areas via &amp;quot;hyperspace portals&amp;quot;, passing through a hyper-space environment, resembling that seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often during hyperspace transit, varying streams of energy are encountered - yellow energy replenishing the energy which fuels the ship, while blue energy drains it, reducing the ship's effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Darklight Conflict&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
