			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you play table top RPGs and would you like to dump that messy notebook?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Role Playing Database can reduce your messy notebook of character sheets, maps, spell sheets, monster descriptions, and other essential information you need to drag around to your games with a USB memory stick! Yes, be prepared for a game anywhere there is a computer with an USB connector!&lt;br/&gt; The Role Playing Database helps you keep track of player and non-player characters, including the character&amp;rsquo;s attributes and characteristics as well as the character&amp;rsquo;s personality and possessions. The Role Playing Database is compatible with most role playing systems, including the D20 system. Monsters of all types can be created and managed. Spells, tricks &amp;amp; traps can all be created and managed (and even shared!). Adventure maps can be created and kept up-to-date. All sorts of treasures can be hidden throughout your role playing world. It is even possible to to provide furnishings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included on the RPGDB CD is Donna&amp;rsquo;s Body Shop, a collection of images of bodies, heads, and facial parts (hair, noses, mouths, and eyes). These parts can be combined to form self-portraits of player characters (and non-player characters too).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
