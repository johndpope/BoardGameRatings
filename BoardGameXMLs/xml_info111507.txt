			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a fictional fantasy context, the user chooses a leader from amongst an array of four races and classes (16 total different options) and proceeds to raise a small squad to take through a series of chained scenarios for the purposes of obliterating all opposition.  Each of the four races - human, dwarf, elf and orc - seeks to conquer and/or kill all the other races, and the player's mission is to bring peace to the world by killing the leader of each race, thereby fulfilling some vague prophecy.  The player can recruit up to sixteen troops using money gained in the various scenarios.  These troops can be ordered into different formations, but who generally follow the leader and act as the leader does.  Each troop memeber is, in all meaningful respects, a clone of the leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay consists of playing through the different scenarios.  Each scenario involves exploring a large map from an isometric perspective centred on the leader, and scrolling in eight directions.  The object of each scenario is to obtain goods hidden on the map, survive any traps, and defeat any foes.  Combat consists of a singe button, mashed in real-time, which causes the leader and all the leader's followers to attack with their equiped weapons.  Various items can be found in different scenarios to increase the leader's survivability and to alter and increase the damage of the leader and his or her troops' attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
