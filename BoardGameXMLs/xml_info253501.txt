							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Martial Art: Battlefields</name>
									
			<description>The battle continues for feudal Japan in this expansion to Martial Art. Battlefields introduces two new mechanics: terrain and weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain cards may be played before battle to augment your battle card and affect the outcome. Because terrain is played before battle but the effects don't happen until later, other players may guess your intention and act accordingly. Alternatively, terrain may be used as a feint to trick your opponents before you surprise them with an unexpected battle card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weather cards are shuffled into the land deck at the start of the game. When a weather card is drawn, its effect continues until a new weather is drawn to replace it. Weather will affect the battles in unpredictable ways, forcing you to adapt your strategy to what the battlefield is giving you. Will you charge your troops through the snow to capture a valuable bridge? Will you send your troops to battle during a severe drought? It is up to you to decide if the risk is worth the reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
