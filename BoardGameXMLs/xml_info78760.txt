			<description>Wrath of Gods is an area control game set in ancient Greece where players take on the role of Gods (Ares, Poseidon, Aphrodite, and Artemis) in an effort to gain enough control over the people to overthrow Zeus. Each god in the game has unique powers and interacts with the game in different ways. Players will use these powers to try and gain control over the people, and build temples and fortresses for themselves to help solidify their victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a series of rounds, in which players will simultaneously select one of their available action cards, and then execute them. Playing action cards costs the players wrath, which is the main resource in the game. While enslaving, converting, and battling your opponents followers can gain you the precious tribute and points you need to win the game, doing so will increase the other players' wrath, making their ability to respond that much more powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
