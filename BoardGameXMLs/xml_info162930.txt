							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Earth Expects</name>
									
			<description>Earth Expects is a highly detailed set of tactical space combat rules which emphasise skill over firepower. It is well suited to playing battles from duels to squadron actions; because of the high level of detail large fleet battles can be slow to play and therefore optional rules are provided to speed play in these games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth Expects is designed to represent battles within the solar system between ships capable of manoeuvre at sub light speed. No aliens have been encountered; battles and wars are fought between human factions as they have been since before the dawn of history. Modification for use in a galaxy spanning campaign is straightforward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
