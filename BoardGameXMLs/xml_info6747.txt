							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman: Poker gegen Joker</name>
									
			<description>This is a game about the first Batman movie. The notorious Joker attempts to bring the cities under his control and Batman comes to save the day!&lt;br/&gt;One of the players takes the role of the Dark Knight and the other one that of the Joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a stack of cards that correspond to his character according to the symbols to the back of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;From the City maps the two cards with zero are discarded, the remaining City maps are juxtaposed in the center of the pitch.&lt;br/&gt;The City tickets are each rotated to their current owners, with each player at the beginning of 4 &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; City Card. &lt;br/&gt;Joker starts the game and then players alternately play.&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of cards: Power cards and Action cards&lt;br/&gt;On his turn the active player takes the top card of his own deck of cards. The card is then applied to the City maps. Just keep in mind that there are power and action cards.&lt;br/&gt;The City maps are quite large. They show a numerical value of 0-4 and a symbol of Batman or Joker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cards:&lt;br/&gt;1) Power Cards: Each player has in his deck 36 power cards with values ​​from 1 to 12, each card is available three times. A maximum of four cards can be applied on the City maps.&lt;br/&gt;2) KO Card: This card means that the opposing player is obligated to discard the next card that he draws.&lt;br/&gt;3) Stop card: it is placed under a City map. Players use them on the opposing side of the city. Their effect is that the opponent can only go to that city with power cards valued 1 and no other value. &lt;br/&gt;4) Tchomb cards: They can also be stored underneath a city map on the opposing side rendering the cards already there worthless (they now have 0 value)&lt;br/&gt;5) Attack Card: Will be played on an opponent's row and the player can take a power card from that row.&lt;br/&gt;6) Change Map: Players switch roles and change sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends in the round in which neither player can do more to create a map. &lt;br/&gt;The City cards are counted and they are considered to belong to the player who has the higher total numbers on the power cards. In case of a tie, neither player wins the City map. City maps that have been conquered, that belonged to the other players at the start get an extra point to their printed score.&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest total score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
