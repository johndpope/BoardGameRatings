			<description>Publisher Description&lt;br/&gt;A game for hunting enthusiasts. Who can shoot the biggest bulls? But watch out, you don't just have to worry about you: the other hunters are trying to find the biggest bulls as well. You'll have to use strategy to hunt and to avoid other hunters searching for the big ones. Will you be able to thwart the other hunters while pursuing your goal? The best strategy and a little bit of luck will determine who gets the big ones.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic gameplay could be considered similar to Mille Bornes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player is dealt 7 cards. Remaining cards stays on the table face down&lt;br/&gt;     Youngest player begins the game&lt;br/&gt;     Each turn begins by drawing a card.&lt;br/&gt;     Then they play one either on their side to hunt bucks or on opponents side to block them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin hunting, you must a card to attract a bull, then you put a bull and finally hunt it with a gun card. Bulls have different point values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also block opponents using cards like bear or gamekeeper that will make a bull leave or cost a fine if you have no permit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when a player hunted 3 bulls. The person with the most bull points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
