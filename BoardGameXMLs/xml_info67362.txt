							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SpaceNinjaCyberCrisis XDO</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpaceNinjaCyberCrisis XDO is set in the world of San Metro, a massive city home to some 45 Million people. Highlights of the city include the Bay Marina, The Spire, PersComm Tower, The Sumarii Building and The Arch. The city also receives some 10 Million commuters on the complex public transport and ground traffic network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city is also home to vigilantes such as the Boom Boys with their pirated high-tech power armour, covert Military Police (The Red and Black SOX) and organised crime. San Metro Police Department is stumbling under the workload. Vigilantes like the Boom Boys can only do so much to help. Perhaps it is time for another group to aid the city?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SNCC XDO contains rules for all this and more. It covers the Horde invasion of 2019 and the intervention of two alien races, mortal enemies who have chosen Earth as their battleground. The Final War is beginning soon. Dare you miss it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
