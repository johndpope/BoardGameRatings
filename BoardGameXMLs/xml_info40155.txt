			<description>Collection of four luck-based games around a family doing various kinds of sports. In the &amp;quot;main game&amp;quot;, each player has several cards of one family member and has to get complete families doing the same sport by asking other players about their hand cards, much like in the German classic &amp;quot;Quartett&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
