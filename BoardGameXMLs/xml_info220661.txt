			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genso Suikoden Card Stories is a collectible trading card game based on the Japanese role playing video game series, Genso Suikoden. The card game used characters encompassing virtually all of the main numbered titles in the video games with the exception of Suikoden V which did not appear in the cards at all. All of the cards as well as the rules are in Japanese only as the game has never been made available outside of Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a trading card game in which players draw cards from their respective decks and take turns playing cards onto the field. Each player uses a deck containing 50 cards. Before the game begins the players agree on a set number of VP (Victory Points) needed to win the game, the rule book suggesting 5 VP being the standard amount to win. Much like many other card games the game can also be won if the player's opponent cannot draw any more cards from their deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players prepare their 50 card deck before the game and once prepared and turn order established, begin the game. Player's place Mission cards and attempt to fulfill the card's qualifications in order to acquire the VP gifted by the card, as marked on the card itself. The opposing player can also attempt to fulfill the cards qualifications, winning the VP for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides this, players can also attempt to construct Facilities cards. They are built in much the same way as Mission cards are played but do not provide VP. If the player succeeds in building the Facilities card they played, they gain the bonus granted by that card. If the opposing player wins, however, the Facilities card is considered to have been destroyed and no bonus is granted to either player. Character cards are used to either attack mission cards to earn the VP or to either build or destroy facilities depending on who played the Facilities card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this manner, with control passing between each player at the end of each turn until one player meets one of the victory conditions listed above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
