							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Magnificent Starfarers</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the tradition of the movie The Seven Samurai and its various homages and imitations, including The Magnificent Seven and the space comedy Battle Beyond the Stars, The Magnificent Starfarers honors the classic scenario of a small group of hardened adventurers (the PCs) hired by a community unable to defend themselves against a local threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As there are many different types of space opera campaigns, this installment of Star System offers three variations of a common core. This supplement begins with a discussion of the main elements of the archetypal adventure, with each of the three variations following. This is done not only to familiarize readers with the common story elements, but also to provide the GM a blueprint upon which to design his or her own variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
