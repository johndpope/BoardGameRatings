			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s your senior year of high school, and you don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;re going to graduate.  You and your friends have been cutting class to sell dope.  The Mexican gang that controls your neighborhood is pressuring you to join, and you&amp;rsquo;re considering it.  Meanwhile, your brother─the only one you&amp;rsquo;ve ever really looked up to─is sitting in a county jail cell for armed robbery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, your Urban Outreach mentor, Mr. Jameson, insists that you&amp;rsquo;ve got some hidden potential.  And he&amp;rsquo;s right, but in a way that&amp;rsquo;s nothing like what you could imagine.  He&amp;rsquo;s been assigned to you by the System to make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t fall through the cracks, but his true agenda will turn your life upside down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentors is a role-playing game for three players.  In this mashup between Finding Forrester and Unbreakable, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover a youth&amp;rsquo;s true potential as it is revealed through a Pictionary-like mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
