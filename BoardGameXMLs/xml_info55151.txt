							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maelstrom Storytelling (Dogbound Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From Precis Intermedia's product page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precis Intermedia brings this fabulous storytelling world (originally published by Hubris Games) back in PDF format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FROM THE ORIGINAL BACK COVER:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confront the Unknown. Transcend the Impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Before the Great Equinox, there was an Empire. In the Empire all things were good. The world didn't shift around, and the shrikes were far away. There were great machines, and ships that flew in the sky. There was the Law, and there was the Word. The storm was tamed, you see, and the Empire brought the whole world together with their obelisks and their roads.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What happened to it, uncle?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's gone, son. It wasn't strong enough. In the end, the storm tore it apart at the seams. And now all the world is broken into little pieces, all separate and beautiful. Until the storm comes. And washes the world away.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rich world and fluid system that stand alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RULES are adaptive, resolving events through a bidding system that allows whole scenes to unfold fluidly. Designed in a cinematic vein, the Story Engine (first edition) yields engaging stories and dynamic role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SETTING is a rich world of shifting realities, all tied together by the same storm. Home to alien cultures, Leonardan magic, gunpowder and pseudo-science, it caters to many different styles of play. From piracy on the high seas of the Outer Crescent to illegal duels at the Queen's Amphitheater, the setting touches on magic, science, and the world of dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative game designed to satisfy the needs of role-players and daydreamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This reformatted edition is optimized for printing and includes only a minimum of artwork. The Story Engine Universal Rules (available separately) includes a plug-in to update Maelstrom to the revised Story Engine mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
