			<description>&amp;quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure is an upcoming puzzle video game in development by 5th Cell. It is the fifth game in the Scribblenauts series of games and the first to be based on a licensed property. The game combines the series' traditional gameplay of bringing up words and objects in order to solve puzzles with characters and settings from the DC Comics universe. The game will be released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Wii U, Nintendo 3DS and Microsoft Windows in Q3/Q4 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following previous games in the series, players control a boy named Maxwell who has the ability to manifest any object or person using his magical notepad. These objects can be used to solve each mission's objective in a variety of ways. The notable feature of this game is the appearance of heroes, supervillains and locations from the DC Universe. According to 5th Cell, the game features almost every character in the DC Universe, around 2000 characters in total, ranging from popular characters such as Superman and Wonder Woman, to more obscure characters such as Bloodwynd and Matter-Eater Lad. Variations of certain characters are also included, such as multiple Batman interpretations and hundreds of different Green Lanterns. Players can use the assitance of these characters to help solve puzzles, such as using Superman's heat vision to free a key trapped in a block of ice. These characters can also be modified using adjectives, allowing for creations such as 'Zombie Batman' or 'Super Doomsday'.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
