							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dracula: The Undead</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dracula: The Undead is a game released exclusively on the Atari Lynx in the United States.  Playing as Jonathan Harker, the player must explore Dracula's castle as a captive and both figure out how to escape and discover a way to prove Dracula's identity along the way.  The game focuses much more on exploration and problem-solving than action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the few who played this game, it was also notable for its brown-shaded graphics, which made it appear like an aged photograph, and the fact that there is no in-game save feature and that the game must be beaten in a single session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
