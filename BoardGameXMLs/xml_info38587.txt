							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle of the Atlantic (1942)</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;It is summer in the North Atlantic, 1942.  Admiral D&amp;ouml;nitz&amp;rsquo;s German U-boats are prowling the east coast of North America and the mid Atlantic shipping lanes, inflicting heavy losses on the Allied merchant fleet carrying desperately need supplies to Europe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each Convoy player has at least one US or British destroyer and two merchants in their charge.  On the base of the ship is space for a name, a box for a letter to further identify which destroyers/merchants are under the same player control, hit counters and relevant info about movement and attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each German U-boat player controls at least one U-boat and three &amp;lsquo;Ocean cards.&amp;rsquo;  U-boats are represented by cards with a U-boat number, hit counters and other info on one side and a blank &amp;lsquo;empty ocean&amp;rsquo; on the other.  When submerged, the U-boat card is turned over with the blank side up.  When on the surface, the card is turned with the U-boat side up.  Ocean cards have a number and space for a letter on one side, and empty ocean on the other . . . They are used to introduce uncertainty as to the whereabouts of the submerged U-boats on the playing table.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Objective:  The Allies must get their merchant ships past the waiting German U-boat wolf packs and safely deliver their cargo to England.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Allies win if they are able to get 50% of the merchant ships safely through the wolf pack and on to England; otherwise the victory goes to Germany and the U-boats.  A merchant is considered to have reach port once its front edge touches the far edge of the playing table or crosses a similar agreed upon line.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
