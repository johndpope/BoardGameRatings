			<description>Noby Noby Boy (のびのびBOY Nobi Nobi Boy) is a video game for the PlayStation 3 and the iOS by Keita Takahashi of Namco Bandai, creator of the Katamari Damacy series. The PlayStation 3 game was released worldwide on February 19, 2009. The iOS version was released on February 18, 2010, a day less than a year after the PlayStation 3 version. Since Noby Noby Boy's initial release, Takahashi himself has admitted that he is &amp;quot;not completely satisfied with the game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes control of a worm-like quadrupedal character referred to as BOY. Using the controller, the left analog stick moves the front of Boy while the right stick controls the back. By moving both ends in opposite directions, the player can stretch Boy's abdomen to great lengths. The player may maneuver Boy around its environment, interacting with stationary objects like houses, or AI-controlled characters such as barnyard animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player accumulates points by how much they stretch during gameplay. These points can be submitted online via a character called Sun to another character called GIRL. Points submitted online by players to Girl will be added cumulatively, causing Girl to stretch and unlock new levels. Beginning on Earth, Girl has stretched to the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter and will proceed to several other planets, each unlocking new playable environments for Boy to stretch in. The Noby Noby Boy team expected players to take between one to two weeks of cumulative play time to reach the Moon. The moon was reached on February 23, 2009, just four days after release. Mars was reached on May 23, 2009, and Jupiter was reached on November 20, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Noby Noby Boy,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
