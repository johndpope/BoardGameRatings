			<description>Prehistoric man was best known for hunting and gathering and not much else. No radio show hosting, no paragliding, no unicycle riding: the lives of our ancient ancestors were utilitarian and boring &amp;ndash; or were they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer Roberto Fraga doesn't think so, as in Mammut Mambo he introduces (or reintroduces?) gamers to a caveman dance craze. Each round card after card is added to the playing area, introducing more quirky gestures and moves to those already in play, creating a dance that all players must perform simultaneously. If you fail to keep the beat, you receive all the cards in play as punishment. What's more, the best mammoth-hunting clan chief gets to push his cards on another player. Whoever can best keep their head &amp;ndash; and their rhythm &amp;ndash; in all the confusion will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
