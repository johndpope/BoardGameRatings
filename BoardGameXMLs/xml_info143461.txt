			<description>Proudly made in the USA, the board game is ideal for 2 to 4 players. Not only do children develop social and emotional skills but thoughtfulness toward others. Once a winner is determined, players are requested to cheer on the remaining players until all youngsters reach the finish line, arriving at Queen Grace's marvelous tea party. Subtle illustrations such as a princess seated in a wheelchair reinforce empathy, a much-needed skill for kids to combat teasing or worse, bullying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to collect all 8-neighborhood charms, the key to the Golden Gate of the Golden Rule and enter the royal tea party. As players make their way around the Kingdom, watch out for the 4 Slippery Slopes of Bad Manners and the 4 Faux Pas Spaces. Rainbow Baguettes and baby Daisy Fairy spaces help little princesses with shortcuts into the Golden Gate of the Golden Rule. Naturally, with the best of good manners, remaining players are to be cheered on as they make their way to the tea party. To keep the game fresh play after play, there are a whopping 368 question cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the board game, parents can keep up with their niceties by visiting Queen Grace on her Facebook Page, also called &amp;quot;Kindness Kingdom&amp;quot; where she imparts pearls of wisdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
