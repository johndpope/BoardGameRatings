			<description>&amp;quot;Disciples II: Dark Prophecy is a PC game by Strategy First that was released on January 24, 2002. The game is the sequel to the 1999 game Disciples: Sacred Lands, and has become significantly more successful in terms of both sales and popularity than its predecessor. A limited edition version of the game was released, which included a card game based upon the story and game dynamics of the video game called Disciples II: Blades of War. This game, along with the expansion pack Gallean's Return, was part of the Strategy First &amp;quot;Fantasy Pack&amp;quot;, which was released with 3 other games: Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood, Dragon Throne: Battle of Red Cliffs, and Prince of Qin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel named Disciples III: Renaissance, has been announced by Strategy First as currently being in development, and will include the Empire, the Legions of the Damned and the Noble Elves. A port of Disciples II for the Nintendo DS is also under development [1]. Disciples II: Gold Edition was released via the digital distribution services Steam, Direct2Drive, GOG.com and Impulse (Where it is named Disciples II: Ultimate Edition).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Disciples_II_DS,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
