							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dynacomp Golf Pro</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both realism and beautiful graphics are joined together in Golf Pro to produce the best golf simulation available.  To really appreciate this game, you should have a color TV so that you can see the green of the fairway, the blue of the water hazards, and the white sand of the traps.  You tee off with a wood, use your wedge in the sand trap, and putt on the green just as would be done on the course.  Show off the Atari to your friends with Golf Pro.  Requires 16K and one joystick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
