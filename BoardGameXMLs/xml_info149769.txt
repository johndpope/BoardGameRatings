							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dryads</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the dryad. These tree-bound women of the woods are longtime favorites of the fantasy genre, and can easily serve both as quest-givers and allies, but also make for excellent villains and other obstacles. Rather than create dryads at a wide variety of CRs, this Exotic Encounters does things a little differently, and provides three very different styles of dryad that all appear at the same CR (CR 5). While each of these dryads (ashbound, oakbound, and yewbound) are flavorfully differentiated by the type of tree to which they bond, they are wildly different mechanically, with the ashbound dryad serving as a charismatic manipulator and seductress, the oakbound dryad serving as a stout warrior and dispenser of great wisdom, and the yewbound dryad being a powerful mage capable of inflicting great curses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
