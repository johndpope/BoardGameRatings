			<description>Temple of the Moon (N)&lt;br/&gt;Use the large tile with the Temple of the Moon on it (N) during setup to replace the large tile that is basically identical to it (E).&lt;br/&gt;The Temple of the Moon space is a construction space equivalent to a Reg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a building on the Temple of the Moon, then during your Reinforcement phase, you can destroy two discs from your reserve (put them in the box) to place a solitary disc in reinforcement, wherever you like on the board, ignoring the usual reinforcement rules. That is to say that you can place this disc by itself on an empty space and/or on a space adjacent to an enemy building, and/or on a tempest space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Emperor cannot be sacrificed to use the Temple of the Moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temple of the Sand (O)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the large tile with the Temple of the Sand on it (O) during setup to replace the large tile that is basically identical to it (B).&lt;br/&gt;The Temple of the Sand space is a construction space equivalent to a Reg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a building on the Temple of the Sand, then one time during your turn, before your Action phase, you can destroy two discs from your reserve (put them in the box) to return an enemy disc (other than an Emperor) from the board to its owner&amp;rsquo;s reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Emperor cannot be sacrificed to use the Temple of the Sand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beacon of Eon (U)&lt;br/&gt;The Beacon of Eon tile (U) is intended to be used with the variants that use Tempest tiles. During the setup, add the Beacon of Eon tile wherever you like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beacon of Eon tile is a Tempest tile (see base game rules, page 6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whoever occupies the most of the spaces around the Beacon of Eon ignores the rules for Tempest tiles (in the event of a tie, no player benefits from this effect). This player therefore treats Tempest spaces like normal spaces: She does not lose a disc by moving into or through them, and can reinforce her stacks there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
