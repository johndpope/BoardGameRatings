			<description>The Sword of Hope (セレクション 選ばれし者 Selection: Erabareshi Mono) is a 1991 first-person RPG for the Game Boy, developed by Kemco and published by Seika Corporation. It was later followed by a sequel, The Sword of Hope II, developed and published by Kemco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The person assumes the role of Prince Theo whose father, King Hennessy has become corrupt and maniacal with power. He has enslaved the kingdom and exiled the great wisemen who once maintained the balance and prosperity of the kingdom. Theo's mother Queen Remy was killed by Hennessy but Theo was rescued from the castle without harm with the help of an old sage. Now that Theo has reached his teenage years and become a skilled warrior it is time for Theo to face his destiny and return to the castle where he was raised and defeat his father.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, The Sword of Hope , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released in Sweden in 1993, translated to Swedish, something that was very unusual for the time. The translation was, however, terribly bad. The most famous example is that chest (as in treasure chest) was consistently translated to &amp;quot;br&amp;ouml;st&amp;quot; which means either of the body parts chest or breast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
