							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Flooded Temple</name>
									
			<description>From the publishers blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;n the flooded temple is hidden a great treasure, and the adventures are in race to get there first, but the ancient temple is the home of Death's Messenger and several cults each with their own agenda. Will the adventurers survive or be dragged off to the lands of the dead?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flooded Temple is a low-level OSR adventure based on the greatest RPG ever written as system agnostic and easily adapted to your favorite version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure was originally written for the Danish Living Campaign The Hinterlands, and it is for the first time presented in English. The adventure introduces the players to a different tradition of adventures, and it one with a focus on exploration and encountering the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure contains several new items to entertain your players, and several challenges for them to overcome as they encounter the residents of the abandoned temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
