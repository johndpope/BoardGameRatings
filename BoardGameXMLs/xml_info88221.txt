			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sept 15, 2410. The universe is on the verge of collapse because of Professor Chronos' experiments with the Vectorial Propulsion System (VPS), a time-travelling machine. The first prototype of the machine has exploded, scattering its components in time and space. You must enter the Professor's research facilities, fight the berserk research robots, pick up every historical artefact you can find and travel through time to retrieve each of the ten parts of the VPS. If you fail, the universe as you know it will be destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le 5eme Axe is a platform and beat'em up side-scrolling game. Players create a character by distributing points between three stats: Life, (which decrease with each wound), Strength (expended in fighting robots) and agility (used for jumping over holes). Once done, the player enter the research complex. There are elevators that allow travel to the upper floor, holes that lead to the floor below (there are different keys that allow the character to cross over a hole safely) and a lot of robots to destroy (by hand-to-hand combat or by pushing them in a hole) or dodge. The goal is to pick up enough items (or destroy enough robots) to increase the &amp;quot;Fifth axis&amp;quot; score by 10%, at which point the player is sent in time to retrieve a VPS part. The player must run to the location of the part while dodging hazards (spears, arrows, falling rocks...) before the timer reach zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le 5eme Axe is one of the few Amstrad CPC arcade games to have a savegame feature implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
