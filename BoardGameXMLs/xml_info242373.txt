			<description>Let's pretend we have a time machine and go back to the time when the Elohim walked on Earth. We pretend to be one of Elyon's sons and to find ourselves in a vast territory that goes from Egypt to the Urartu chain, divided into thirty regions, one of which has been assigned to us as a legacy, together with the people who live there and few weapons he owns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;in God's War, everyone impersonates an Elohim who, starting from the initial territory assigned by Elyon, will have to earn the most Power Points by the end of the game, conquering peoples and new territories with their armies and appropriately dislocating the subjugated peoples in these territories. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, each Elohim will be able to influence the course of the game using wisely and cunningly the weapons he will find in the arsenal and the Miracles he will be able to obtain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
