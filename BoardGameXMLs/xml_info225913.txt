			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graph Wars is a strategy game, which can be played by up to four players on a field resembling a sheet of graph paper.  Players enter the game by occupying a corner of the field with a &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; mark and subsequently take turns expanding their positions on the board with additional marks and attacking other players' positions.  The object of the game is to reach and block out opponents' homes until the player is the last remaining player on the field.  Game board dimensions, number of moves per turn, and number of players can be controlled by players, leading to different strategies and lengths of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
