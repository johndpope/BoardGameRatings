			<description>A rugby simulation that tries to capture the end to end excitement of top class Rugby Union.  Using real team and player stats, the game aims to simulate a full match rather than just the attacking highlights system used in it's predecessor, &amp;quot;Line Out&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many team cards are available, where real teams are rated for Attack and Defence plus their ability in set scrums, rucks, loose mauls and line outs, as well as individually rated players for each team - to produce statistically accurate results and scorers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll dice and refer to various charts depending on the action, field position, and team ratings, to determine the outcome of events.  Players have opportunities to dictate teams tactics or actions during the match, and the result is the full end-to-end flow of a match, the grim battle between the opposing packs, tactical defensive play, the power of the loose maul, the rucks and scrums driving forward, and the sweeping open play as the backs come into the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the Strat-O-Matic of rugby gaming!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
