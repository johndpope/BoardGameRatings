			<description>In Plenty of Fish in the Sea? players take on the role of a shoal of fish trying to survive on a Coral Reef.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a limited amount of fish and actions to perform, they must try to shoal their fish to avoid starvation, predators and also remember to spawn and thus increase the gene pool. Players may place tiles, rotate them or move fish to attempt to maximize their final score at the game end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Plenty of Fish in the Sea? you're not paranoid, everyone is out to get you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
