			<description>Children learn better and retain more when they are having fun. So if you can teach with a game, why wouldn't you? BrainBox games will teach your children basic geography facts in a way that makes them eager to play; when have you ever been able to say that about flashcards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BrainBox games develop both short and long term memory by challenging children to recall what they saw. Players study a game card for 10 seconds trying to memorize a variety of features such as surrounding countries or states, flag colors, famous landmarks, historical figures, and so forth. A die is rolled and if the player can answer the corresponding question, the card is his. Play until one child has won a set amount of cards or play until all cards are acquired. With 55 cards and 10 questions per card, this is a painless way to learn 550 geography facts. Designed for readers, but pre-readers do not have to be left out; just adapt the questions to their level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players with the most points win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
