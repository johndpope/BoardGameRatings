			<description>A 2-player pure abstract strategy game using a single stash of Looney pyramids. Each player has 3 pyramids in hand, and 9 pyramids are arranged lying in a circle or star-like pattern with a gap for a 10th pyramid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, place one of your pyramids into the gap and remove a pyramid of a different size, n spaces clockwise or counterclockwise from the gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have no legal move, you lose. If you all 3 of your pieces in hand are the same size, you lose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
