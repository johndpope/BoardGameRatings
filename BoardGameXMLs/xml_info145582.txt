			<description>Like Rack-O with words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are over 200 letter cards in 2 colors, and 80 word cards, each of which has 1 word each of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 letters.  One word card is dealt to each player.  In each round the letters are mixed in a face down central pile, and players fill up their racks with 10 letters.  Then they draw and discard until they spell one of the words on their word card starting at the front of their rack.  The score is the word's length plus the sum of the letter values, doubled if all of one color, minus the values of unused letters. Others get scores for partially correct words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your total score increases, you cannot score shorter words: with 70+ points you must to 7 letters or more, 90+ 9 letters or more, etc.  150 points wins the game.  For 2 players, draw and discard twice during the turn, and play to 200 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
