							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beast of Dunvegan</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard Living Spycraft tournament for a team of four to six 3rd-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 8, 13, or 18 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunvegan Castle is situated north of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) uses the castle as a facility for weapons development and testing. The only civilians who live close by are the inhabitants of the small fishing village of Fuilden. The locals know that the castle is a military installation, but are encouraged to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s a remote listening post for monitoring communications. Lt. Colonel Fraser Campbell, an officer of the Highlanders Regiment, commands the facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efforts at the facility are being focused on development of a resonance weapon. A breakthrough has recently being made by Dr. Roger Bainbridge, a chief scientist on the project, making construction of the weapon viable. This work is very high security, as the UN has strict restrictions on developing this type of weapon, and the MOD would rather they didn't find out. Unfortunately, Professor Norman Whyte, the project's other chief scientist, is a double agent. Recruited several years ago into W.A.R.D. (Worldwide Alliance for Regional Domination), Prof. Whyte has informed his superiors of the existence of the weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
