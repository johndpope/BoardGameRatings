							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Victorian Villains</name>
									
			<description>Heroes and villains of history and literature battle in this game of Victorian Era adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player uses a separate deck, one for the heroes and one for the villains. Heroes portrayed in the game include Sherlock Holmes, Van Helsing, Tarzan, and Philieas Fog. Villains include Dr. Fu-Man-Chu, Jack the Ripper, and Thugee Assassins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masterminds attract Minions. Inventors and Scientists craft fantastic vehicles and weapons. Martian Tripods attempt world conquest. These events and more occur during the thirteen phases of each turn: New Day Phase, Genius Phase, Healing Phase, Minion Phase, Invention Phase, Recruit Phase, Plot Phase, Spy Phase, Assassin Phase, Plot Phase, Intercept Phase, Track Phase, and Attack Phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to eliminate all of your opponent's major characters. The first player to do so after the fifth turn wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
