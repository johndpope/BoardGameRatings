			<description>Tricala is a two- to three-player Kalah game played on a triangular layout of twenty-one pits (six to an edge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate placing stones in whatever pits they choose to set the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with conventional Mancala games, a player's turn consists of &amp;quot;sowing&amp;quot; stones: all stones are picked up from any cup containing at least one stone of the player's color, then stones are redistributed one-by-one along a line of pits leading away from the source. Unlike most Mancala games, [1] there are between two and six sowing directions to choose (depending on the cup), and [2] the direction deflects when a board edge is reached. Sowing is extended (&amp;quot;re-sowed&amp;quot;) if the last stone drops into a pit containing only the active player's stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones are captured when the last piece sowed lands in a pit containing an opponent's stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is won when a player captures nine stones or claims the majority in each corner pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
