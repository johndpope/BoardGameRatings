			<description>2 player game played on the spaces of an 8x8 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 chess pawns, 2 black and 2 white.&lt;br/&gt;64 bi-colored reversi pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definition&lt;br/&gt;piece = a bi-colored reversi piece&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set the empty board between the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set two like color pawns diagonally adjacent to each other onto two of the four center squares on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set two pieces at each row and column along the outer edge of the board .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player plays black the other white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black moves first, then play alternates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move a friendly pawn in a straight line orthogonally or diagonally ending the movement on an empty square. Then take a piece from the outer edge of the board, flip it to your color and move this piece in a straight line orthogonally ending the move on an empty space. The piece last moved and the pawn last moved should now be in line of sight of each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When both players pass in succession the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Restrictions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A piece is not in line of sight with a pawn if another pawn or piece is in-between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Neither a pawn nor a piece may jump over another pawn or piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most pieces in his color on the board at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inspiration for this game comes from Walter Zamkauskas Amazons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
