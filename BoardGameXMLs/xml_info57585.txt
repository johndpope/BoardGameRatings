							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Boot Camp</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations on joining the Mobile Infantry, the backbone of the Federation military. This book will teach you everything you need to know about being part of this elite fighting force. You will learn how to fight, how to think, and how to survive. You will learn to use power suits, Morita rifles and other tools. You will learn how to stare death in the eye and laugh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book details the process of becoming Mobile Infantry. It covers every step from recruitment through the first mission. If your players all want to be Mobile Infantry, this book provides adventures at every stage &amp;ndash; you can run them through select pieces or use the entire book as an introductory campaign. If the Player Characters are not all Mobile Infantry, this book can be used to provide the ones who are with valuable background. The Starship Troopers corebook provides all the rules necessary to create Mobile Infantry characters, but it does not go into details about their training. This book does that, offering players a chance to see exactly what their characters went through and thus think about how those events affected them. Players who read this book will have a better grasp of their Player Characters, and can create more believable figures because they know understand the Player Character&amp;rsquo;s history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boot Camp is divided into four sections. The first section deals with how characters become recruits. The second section talks about the training itself, and details the boot camp where training takes place. The third section discusses the characters&amp;rsquo; placement after their graduation from recruit to private, and gives suggestions for introductory missions. The final section, Escort Duty, provides a full adventure that ties back to the training characters received in Section Two. Each of the first three sections offers smaller adventure suggestions and these can be used to fine-tune Player Characters and solidify the group before the larger scenario at the end. But whether you choose to use one section or the entire book and, whether you are a player or the Games Master, this book will tell you how the Mobile Infantry are created from lesser men, and what rites of passage they must endure to gain that privilege.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
