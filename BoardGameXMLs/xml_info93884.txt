			<description>After a long voyage in space, they are back at the doorstep of our planet. The funny aliens are here to learn more about the European Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though they are outstandingly intelligent, they suffer from a big concentration problem. If they have to think for too long, their brains explode. That's why they record all their knowledge on memory cards. These cards are precious to them, and our alien friends have no intention of sharing them !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;27 member states of the European Union, 27 memory cards to win ! Which one of them will bring the most of them back to his mother planet ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neurodyss&amp;eacute;e is a Trivia game where players take the role of aliens who want to learn more about the European Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, the players alternate taking one of the three roles:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     One player is the &amp;quot;Candidate&amp;quot;: he must answer a question correctly to win &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot; cards. The number of cards he may win depends on the difficulty level he chooses.&lt;br/&gt;     One player is the &amp;quot;Game Master&amp;quot;: after the debate led by the &amp;quot;Disturbers&amp;quot; (see next bullet), he reads the question from the question card and the three answers.&lt;br/&gt;     All other players are &amp;quot;Disturbers&amp;quot;: each of them choses one of the answers from a randomly drawn question card and try to convince the &amp;quot;Candidate&amp;quot; to choose that answer, before the &amp;quot;Candidate&amp;quot; even knowns what the question is. Once the &amp;quot;Game Master&amp;quot; decides he had enough of the debate, he reads the question and all possible answers aloud and the &amp;quot;Candidate&amp;quot; chooses one answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a character card representing an alien with a second card that is shifted above the first to indicate the alien's brain size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the &amp;quot;Candidate's&amp;quot; chose the wrong answer, his brain grows the number of levels equal to the difficulty level he chose. He also loses one of his memory cards to each &amp;quot;Disturber&amp;quot; who defended that answer, if any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the candidate chose the right answer, the &amp;quot;Disturbers&amp;quot; who defended that answer lower their brain size by one level. The &amp;quot;Disturbers&amp;quot; who defended a wrong answer raise their brain size by one level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player's brain &amp;quot;explodes&amp;quot;, he draws one question card and reads all four questions. He loses memory cards to the first player who gives a correct answer to each question. The number of cards lost depends on the question's difficulty level. The player may loose up to 10 cards in this process (1+2+3+4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the memory card pile is empty, the player with the most memory cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
