			<description>Vestfirzka kv&amp;oacute;tasvindli&amp;eth; (The Westfjord Quota-swindle) is a humorous game about the fishing industry and fishing quota. The players start the game with a small fishing boat and can buy bigger boats/ships so they can fish more. Selling the catch makes money to buy Quota. Ten Quotas are needed to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards with some actions are included giving bonus or costing the players something, usually money but sometimes just funny things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
