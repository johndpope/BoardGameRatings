							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beyond the Serpentine Lock</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ages past, a tiefling witch sequestered herself within a trap-laden tomb in order to acquire immortality for herself and her daughter. The witch must have failed, for her tomb has been sealed behind a serpent-shaped lock since that day. A clever hero found a way into the tomb centuries ago, but she was never seen again. Now, a key to the tomb has fallen into the hands of her descendant, who commissions the PCs to breach the ancient tomb and recover the hero&amp;rsquo;s remains. But this is no mere dungeon crawl; the PCs must overcome devious traps, intricate puzzles, a village of wary lizardfolk, and ancient betrayals to unearth a lost legacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Beyond the Serpentine Lock&amp;quot; is a wilderness and dungeon adventure for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game suitable for any campaign world. Presented for PCs of 3rd or 4th level, this adventure also includes notes and statistics for scaling challenges to PCs of lower or higher level. The adventure contains several player handouts and a file containing 1 inch scale color maps of the encounter areas ready for printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
