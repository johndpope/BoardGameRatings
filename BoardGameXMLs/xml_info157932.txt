			<description>In this custom card game, players are adventuring archaeologists trying to remove the most valuable set of items from a seismically unstable cave. The deck contains 54 item cards and 14 seismograph cards. The item cards show an item name, its volume, its weight, and its value. These quantities range from 1 to 5. The seismograph cards show a picture of a seismograph and a number from 1 to 5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, all the cards are shuffled together and the deck is cut into 4 face down piles. Players take turns using action points to uncover cards from the piles and add items to (or remove them from) their backpacks. The backpacks hold a maximum weight of 15 and a maximum volume of 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When seismograph cards appear they are put in a separate pile. When the total of the numbers on these cards reaches 21, each player takes one final turn and the game ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the game is the one who, at the end, has the most total value for the cards in his or her backpack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
