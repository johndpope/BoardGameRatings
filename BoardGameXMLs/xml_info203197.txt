			<description>Gamer Deck is a series of card decks that appeal to gamers and game designers. Each deck will be more like a card system then a standard deck of cards. A card system has multiple elements to be used to play and design many games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deck 1 is similar to a standard poker deck with different suits and a game mechanic on each card. Those of you who don't know what game mechanics are, they are certain skills and techniques highlighted in a game. The deck has dice on each card representing the value of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
