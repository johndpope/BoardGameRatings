			<description>from Welcome to the Thaecian Isles:&lt;br/&gt;It is the author&amp;rsquo;s intent that this book is not just as sourcebook, nor is it a straightforward adventure module. It was designed to be the start (or part of) an ongoing campaign where the GM and the players can explore the Thaecian&lt;br/&gt;Isles together. So instead of the regular adventure or a dry sourcebook, the islands are presented as an open-ended realm where the characters can explore freely, encountering adventure and danger at every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for a mid-to high level party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It begins with the player characters receiving a mission to find a Gnorl&amp;rsquo;s missing Secret. She will pay the for the characters to reach Thaecia Isle just in time for the famous Festival of the Bizarre. While the hunt for the Secret is the impetus for the characters to travel to the islands, they are in no way constrained to follow the one plotline and are free to explore any part of the islands they desire. While terrible dangers lurks at every turn, there is also the opportunity for great rewards, including the chance to uncover rare magics and treasures not seen since the Great Disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
