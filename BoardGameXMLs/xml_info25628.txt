			<description>Welcome to TRANQUILITY BASE&amp;trade;, The Exciting Game of America&amp;rsquo;s Race to the Moon&amp;trade;. This comprehensive game is the new and expanded second edition of Moonshot the Game&amp;trade;, called &amp;ldquo;One of the Coolest New Board Games&amp;rdquo; by Inquest Magazine and awarded &amp;ldquo;Best New Family Game&amp;rdquo; by GAMES Magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRANQUILITY BASE recreates the fascinating story of mankind&amp;rsquo;s greatest adventure&amp;mdash;the Apollo voyages to the Moon. No trivia, no dice...Just real men, machines and two chimpanzees. NASA projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo provide the backdrop as players are put in command of the Space Race. Each landmark event, pioneering mission, heart-pounding crisis and incredible machine is represented by a playing card. Players use these cards and a supply of fuel counters to complete historic NASA space missions in a race to be the first to land on the Moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complete each mission, you must use your fuel supply to assemble the correct equipment, launch the mission and move your playing piece to the corresponding mission patch on the game board. This completes the mission, you receive a replica mission patch and gain a fuel bonus. During the game you can take advantage of special wild, history and instant cards. These represent historic events in space history and can be played to speed your progress or hinder your opponents. After completing the required number of missions, be the first to land on the Moon and win the game. TRANQUILITY BASE has a wealth of detail and flavor for the space enthusiast. If you're big on space travel or really enjoy space history, this game is a must. And it's expandable too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
