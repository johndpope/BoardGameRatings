							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">P. P. Hammer and his Pneumatic Weapon</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P. P. Hammer and his Pneumatic Weapon is a computer game for the Amiga and for the C64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a platform game with puzzle elements. It draws obvious influence from the earlier game Lode Runner. In the game, you control a character called P. P. Hammer, who is on a quest to discover and acquire all treasures from a series of more than 60 levels. These levels are divided into four graphical themes: Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, Medieval castles, and ice. A fifth theme, LegoLand, appears on bonus levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level in the game is made up of rectangular blocks, and contains various things including treasures, enemies, locked doors, bonus items and traps. P. P. Hammer carries a jackhammer, which allows him to drill through a block he's standing next to. As in Lode Runner, drilling through more than one layer of blocks requires creating a triangle-shaped cavity more than one block wide, and blocks reappear after a short while. A block reappearing on top of P. P. Hammer kills him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P. P. Hammer can collect treasures and various power-up potions lying around the level. When he has collected all the treasures, the exit door opens, and going through the exit door completes the level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
