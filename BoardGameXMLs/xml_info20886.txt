			<description>Unusual game from Transogram that really relies on components which glow in the dark for gameplay mechanics.  Comes in a very large box (17&amp;quot; x 12&amp;quot; x 8&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a large hat with spring platform, four plastic rabbits (three of which glow in the dark), a large silk Hocus Pocus handkerchief, a wand with four detachable tips and many rings that are the game's 'currency' which also glow in the dark and must be  worn on the fingers of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player has won enough rings during gameplay (they must be wearing 10 rings BEFORE their turn) they get the opportunity to insert the tip of the wand into the hat &amp;amp; release the spring, causing the rabbits to pop up in the air.  This may or may not occur, depending on whether the correct wand tip is chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to make the rabbits fly out of the hat is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this game can be played in the light (by pretending the black rabbit is 'invisible') it is much more atmospheric and exciting in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
