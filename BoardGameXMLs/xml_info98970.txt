							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dragon Age Legends: Remix 01</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first &amp;quot;remix&amp;quot; of the Facebook game, Dragon Age Legends. It was remixed by Evan Miller of Pixelante, with assistance by EA2D members. There are five levels that have been made for this remix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses the same in-game models as the original DA:L, but it drastically alters the gameplay. This game is self-described as &amp;quot;hack 'n' slash&amp;quot; and it is correct. The player controls Ravi as he advances through the levels destroying his enemies. The player can choose between four play-styles: Power (smash through enemies), Range (launch shockwaves), Defense (block and push enemies), and Finesse (dodge &amp;amp; parry attacks). Your magic attacks will differ depending on which style you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finishing the levels of this remix will unlock 15 exclusive items that can be used in the original DA:L web-browser game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
