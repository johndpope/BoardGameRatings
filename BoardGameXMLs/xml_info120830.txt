							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gundam SEED: Battle Assault</name>
									
			<description>In 2004 Gundam SEED: Battle Assault was released for the Game Boy Advance and featured units exclusively form the recent Mobile Suit Gundam SEED anime. The units included all the Gundams from the show sans the Providence, as well as Rau Le Creuset's CGUE and the Gundam Astray Red Frame. It was released exclusively in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay for this portable installment is similar to its three PlayStation prequels, with the difference of being faster and more user friendly. The player had the option of choosing a manual method for executing special moves or an automatic one (similar to the easy mode of Capcom's Vs. series). The player could also adjust one of three parameters (HP, Phase Shift Armor or Thrust) at the cost of the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was also an updated version of the game focusing on the sequel of the anime, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Unlike SEED: Battle Assault however, it was instead released only in Japan and it included as a lockable bonus SEED Battle Assault itself. The game featured also all the units from the previous game plus the initial ones of Destiny (it lacks Strike Freedom, Infinite Justice, Destiny and Legend).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gundam: Battle Assault (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
