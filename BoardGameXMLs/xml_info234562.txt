			<description>A smart, vibrant and dynamic racing game. You accelerate, crash against opponents, sabotage other cars, put traps on the speedway, launch missiles, and have a lot of fun! It's a wacky race where all the players are the &amp;quot;Dick Dastardly&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Rasher game all players manage cards that can be actions against opponents (&amp;quot;Take That&amp;quot;), defenses for attacks received or to move around the track. The number of cards caught at a time, offers many strategic possibilities for the player to decide his next actions. But the player can also leave some cards stored for later use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 1, 2, 3, or 4 house motion cards that can be combined with other actions like jumping obstacles, stealing opponents' cards, using side saws, and more. Even if your car is damaged by missiles or collisions, you can still use repairs to continue running, non-stop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modular board allows you create a racing circuits with number of laps defined by the players: whoever arrives first wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
