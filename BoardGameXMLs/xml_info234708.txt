							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sine Tempore: Silicio</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cold planet in a sector not far from Primevus V emanates a known signal; a spaceship identical to yours is sending an unmistakable message: &amp;quot;Life here is possible&amp;quot;. However will it be what you expect? Why is another spaceship so close to yours? Why is it so far off course? ... Silicio will guide you along the discovery of numerous events in waiting behind the &amp;quot;Kraken&amp;quot; on an apparently inhospitable planet, against a totally unexpected enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This box too contains fantastic miniatures, new boards, new objects and a mini narrative campaign with 10 missions, plus 5 new exploration missions. Silicio&amp;rsquo;s creatures are classified into three types; at the lowest level of the scale, we have the Babooms, obtained by recycling the oldest remains of the Kraken crew. These beings, turned completely crazy by the transformation, will throw themselves onto our Heroes, with no regard for danger.  The O.R.C. are lethal assassins who kill their victims with hard-hearted ruthlessness. Silent, and almost invisible, they will put the cold blood of Achab and company to the test. A.D.E., a true killing machine... is the largest miniature that LMS has ever produced. Driven by an O.R.C., this exoskeleton is able to create an incredible amount of fire. Its physical defense is almost impenetrable, but its gynoid nature means it can be used not only by the Enemies...&lt;br/&gt;And of course, how could we not speak of their leader? The first specimen of the Andromeda model, having awakened, has decided to rebel against its owners, killing them only to bring them back to life as mechanical creatures of its own invention. Andromeda is driven by an atavistic hatred for living creatures, second only to her hate for her &amp;ldquo;younger sister&amp;rdquo; who replaced her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Kickstarter exclusive expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
