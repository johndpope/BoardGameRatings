							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The City of Ravenclaw: The Crossed Blades</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tavern of the Week pdfs provide GMs with a fully fleshout out tavern with a description, meals, fleshed out patrons and an adventure hook for each patron as well as links from the tavern to various organizations within a generic city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crossed Blades tavern sits in the middle of the docks and warehouse districts and has become the hub for the local thieves guild, The Dockworker's Association. The Innkeeper, Sane, is a member and fixer for the Dockworker's Association. The Crossed Blades was a front for the operations of the previous owner's rather notorious adventuring company, the Five Fingers. They ran all kinds of jobs and operations all throughout the city from the small rooms of the Crossed Blades. At least they did until they ran afoul of Rollo Cavalli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Merchant Prince Rollo Cavalli owns the Crossed Blades after &amp;quot;purchasing&amp;quot; it from its previous owner Darren Bladestorm, a semi-retired adventurer and daring thief. It is said the thief and his Five Fingers tried to steal something from Rollo and got caught. In the aftermath Rollo ended up owning the Crossed Blades and Darren and company left the city in a hurry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cavalli uses it as a place to hire prospective adventurers, whom Cavalli plans to employ against the business interests of his rivals among the Eight. Rollo's agent, Maly Hydaye, frequents the tavern on a regular basis and poses as a low level clerk within Rollo's organization. Rollo also uses the tavern as a front for his many illicit dealings and to launder money he recieves from the Dockworker's Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pdf provides a brief description of each tavern, meals and costs, patrons and some rumors and news that have been fleshedout with what is really going on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
