							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Carcosan Grimoire</name>
									
			<description>\'\'subtitle\'\'&lt;br/&gt;A CARCOSA COMMUNITY PROJECT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\'\'from the foreword by Geoffrey McKinney\'\'&lt;br/&gt;Herein lies a wealth of imaginative and horrific material for use in D&amp;amp;D campaigns, especially those campaigns inspired by Supplement V: CARCOSA. Everything herein is, of course, entirely optional. That said, nothing held between the covers of this tome would I hesitate to use in a D&amp;amp;D campaign. What weird ceremonies occur in that squat stone village beneath twisted and bloated trees? What incomprehensible customs do the men practice, and in what sort of alien architecture do they lurk? All such questions can be easily answered with the aid of the treasures in your hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are bizarre pigments, new monsters (suitably terrifying), new mutations, new artifacts, new eldritch locations, new character types (the apothecarial witch and the implacable Brothers of the Skull), various random tables (including encounter tables), and more. None of the contents of \'\'\'\'\'The Carcosan Grimoire\'\'\'\'\' adds complexity to the rules. Instead, everything is calculated to make the referee&amp;rsquo;s thankless job easier, and to provide greater variety for the referees and their players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, the kind originator of this volume, Cameron DuBeers, has seen fit to include some of my comments regarding Carcosa, gleaned from various places on the internet going back over three years. Anyone reading this section will discover that my conceptions of Carcosa have mutated over the years, and they continue to mutate. I hope that this invaluable booklet will help all our D&amp;amp;D campaigns mutate in extraordinary and unsuspected directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\'\'user comment:\'\'&lt;br/&gt;Two versions of this fan-created supplement are available, one for reading, with single digest-size pages, and another for printing, formatted for duplex printing and stapling to create a booklet.  The content is the same in both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
