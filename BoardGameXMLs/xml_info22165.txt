							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alfa-Kubes</name>
									
			<description>Alfa-Kubes comprises six dice with letters on each face; each letter has a value - as in 'scrabble'. The aim is to create the highest value word over 3 throws, keeping the dice you want and re-throwing the rest - as in Yahtzee or poker dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simple, but infectious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Dating note: The box and rules are not dated. However, the place of manufacture is Harborne, England, where Chad Valley shifted production in 1920. Their Royal Charter mark, granted in 1936, is not printed on the box, so this edition of Alfa-Kubes must have been created between these dates. Hence this submission of 'c.1928')&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alfa-Kubes is a word dice game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
