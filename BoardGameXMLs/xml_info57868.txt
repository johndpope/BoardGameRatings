							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Temple of Solusek Ro</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasures of the Wizard God&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in a cliff overlooking a vast lava-filled pit, the Temple of Solusek Ro offers no pretensions to hospitality. Those who would visit or worship here must struggle across a jagged landscape scoured by elementals, fire imps, lava beetles, duct crawlers, fire drakes both great and small, and flame and inferno goblins. Why then do so many seek the temple of a god not worshipped predominantly by clerics but by wizards instead? Partly because this great temple is considered neutral ground by its inhabitants, but mainly because those inhabitants know the secrets required to create suits of armor that are iconic to many of the professional adventurers of Norrath. For each of the 15 of the EQ character classes, a detailed quest and a unique suit of magical armor are included herein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100% compatible with 3rd edition Fantasy role-playing rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the adventures and items of the inhabitants of the Temple of Solusek Ro in your EverQuest Role-Playing Game campaign or in any 3rd edition fantasy role-playing campaign. The Gamemaster's Screen compiles all the tables most important for playing EQrpg and also offers some new ones, such as a summary chart for all available mana recovery effects and powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
