							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemy</name>
									
			<description>The game comes from First Quench's 'Vision 2003' customer service initiative for managers and assistants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the components in The Alchemy Set are team-building exercises in which goals are set to improve the reputation of the First Quench Brand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, one component is a simple game based upon snakes and ladders, where poor customer service and attitude result in going down, and good customer service and attitude result in going up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components are nicely produced, but the Alchemy strategy was abandoned after only a few months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
