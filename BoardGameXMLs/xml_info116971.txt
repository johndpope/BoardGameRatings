He is a rare powerup known as Summon Phantomon. He randomly appears and stalks a Digimon. If a Digimon touches Phantomon, he'll instantly KO it with his Shadow Scythe.

The Jeri clone can be seen flying in the background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Digimon Rumble Arena 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
