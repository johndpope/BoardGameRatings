			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unmerciful is a short detective scenario that focuses on roleplay and investigation. It is an event based quest, meaning that things will happen with or without PCs interaction. You will have a list with all the murders and details about them. At the end of the product you will find several handouts prepared for print. You will also get a list of NPCs that are relevant to the case and how and we will provide you with one of the ways players could track the killer down.&lt;br/&gt;A party of any level can be challanged with this scenario and it can be played in any (low) fantasy setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Synopsis:&lt;br/&gt;The players are hired to find out who has brutally killed Father Marius. After inspecting the murder scene, players can be sure that killer is driven with revenge and that this is only the first murder. Good old detective work brings them closer to the killer, but also to the fact that everything isn&amp;rsquo;t like it seems. As the body count rises, players must decide whom to aid in the final confrontation, the Church or the Punisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
