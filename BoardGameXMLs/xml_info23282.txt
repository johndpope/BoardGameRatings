			<description>&amp;quot;The golf trivia game that will leave you longing for the greens without leaving a divot on your brain!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board depicts a nine-hole golf course, with spots along each hole equal to that hole's par.  Players advance their golf tee from spot-to-spot and hole-to-hole by successfully answering golf trivia questions.  Some spots have a possible penalty or bonus, as determined by a die roll when you get there.  A die roll also determines which of four categories a player's question will come from: History, Tournaments, People, or Rules.  First player to complete the course wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect to play in the golf clubhouse while waiting out a thunderstorm.  Avoid under any other circumstances!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
