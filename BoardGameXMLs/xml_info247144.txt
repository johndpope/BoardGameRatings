			<description>In Shields Up players race to destroy the opponents shields and ship. Captains take 2 actions each turn, choosing to either draw or play cards. Assemble sets of cards in order to activate weapons and other equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As captain of your ship you can place any card face down as a shield. A ship can have up to 3 shield cards. Destroy your opponent&amp;rsquo;s shield and do at least 1 additional damage to destroy their ship and win the battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
