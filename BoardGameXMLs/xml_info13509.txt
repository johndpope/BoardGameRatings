							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Beverly Hills 90210 Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This trick taking game comes with a deck of 4 different colored suits. Each suit has 13 cards numbered 0 through 12, with 12 as the high card. Four of the cards in each suit (the 9, 0, 2, and 1) are Zip Code cards that score points. Each player is dealt 6 cards and a standard trick-taking round follows. The high card of the suit led wins all the other cards played. After the round, all players draw a new card from the deck to bring their hands back up to 6. Play continues until the draw deck depleted and the players have played all the cards in their hands. Players then score 1 point for each Zip Code card they have won. The first player to score 50 points wins the game (this may take several rounds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
