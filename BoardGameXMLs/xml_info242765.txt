			<description>The Life You Can Lead is an effective altruism game with a reincarnation theme and interesting trivia questions and funny action cards. The players start out as humans with incomes randomly chosen from the real-world distribution, although less fortunate players may also reincarnate as chickens and dung beetles. The players collaboratively try to achieve normative good (donating to charities and answering trivia so as to get 1000 human QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years), 10,000 animal QALYs, and 10 x-risk points (x-risk points help prevent human extinction.)) Additionally, players have private moralities that give them alternative ways to win the game, such as moral relativist, sadist, preference utilitarian, nihilist etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
