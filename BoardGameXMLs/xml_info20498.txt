			<description>A logic game for three or more players. Object: To end the game with the most status by guessing the keys to the other players cyphers while keeping your cypher's keys as much of a mystery as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's 2138 AD. You attend an exclusive academy for individuals with psychic talents. For the past two months you've been under consideration for admission to an elite program. Now it's just down to you and a handful of others: The best of the best. If you pass this final test, you'll be sent on an important mission to an outpost outside the solar system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this test, you will choose a sequence of four concepts, or 'keys'. This specific sequence of keys is your 'cypher'. You and your fellow applicants will be locked in an isolation chamber. Your mission is to use your telepathic abilities to probe the minds of your rivals to uncover the keys to their cyphers while protecting your own cypher from discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success means a promotion and adventure. Failure means another 21 sessions of Dr. Quinto's 'Meditation Under Extreme Duress' class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have what it takes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://invisible-city.com/play/104/psi-squad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://invisible-city.com/play/104/psi-squad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
