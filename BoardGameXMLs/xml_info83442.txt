							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Batman Begins</name>
									
			<description>Batman Begins is a 2005 video game based on the film of the same name. It was released June 14, 2005, a day before the 2005 American superhero film was released. It was developed by Eurocom and published by Electronic Arts in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It was released on Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a unique system involving intimidation. Whereas most superhero games require straightforward fighting, Batman Begins  features the utilization of the environment to frighten opponents. Certain gadgets designed to frighten enemies during combat are provided, such as smoke grenades, flash bang grenades, and an 'HF Transponder', which summons bats to gather around and incapacitate enemies with fear. On top of this is traditional stealth gameplay reminiscent of the Splinter Cell series (this probably due to the fact that the game was written by Splinter Cell  creator JT Petty), such as sneaking and taking out enemies from behind. There are many ways to incapacitate enemies with stealth, using various combat and martial arts techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Batman Begins (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
