			<description>This is a child's game from Jean du Poel and Historien Spielgalerie. Each player is trying to deliver Easter eggs to nests, using three rabbits shared by all. The large board shows rabbit tracks, and nests that will hold specific styles of Easter eggs.Using dice, players move any or all three of the rabbits, trying to reach nests that that need the specific eggs that the player can deliver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game offers two scoring options. The simple scoring option, for younger children, awards the victory to the player who delivers the most eggs. The more advanced scoring subtracts points for eggs not delivered and is played over several rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
