							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dwarven Stoneguard</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dwarven Stoneguard is a new Hero for you to use in the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dwarven Stoneguard were once the pride of the dwarven strongholds. They were elite warriors, charged with defending the strongholds from the many enemies of the dwarven people: the orc tribes of the north, the goblins from beneath the ground, and the various monsters and savage beasts that roamed the wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, they were highly successful. On only one occasion did the fortresses of the dwarf people become compromised, and that was mainly due the corrupting and poisonous magic of the goblins causing illness in many of the Stoneguard. But even then, they were able to overcome this and eject the goblins from their home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this changed at the start of the Age of Darkness and Nightmares. The orc hordes attacked on masse, the goblins found new and powerful magics, and demons and undead monstrosities added to the dwarven problems. Slowly, one by one, the dwarven fortresses began to fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stoneguard, being the first line of defence for the dwarven people, were blamed for not defending their homes properly. They became maligned amongst their own people even though, in the face of overwhelming odds, they never once faltered or fled, laying down their lives for their homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the Stoneguard continue to defend the last two dwarven fortresses left standing from their enemies. They do so with skill, bravery and resolution. Some Stoneguard have left their ancestral homes, traveling out into the wider world in the hopes of finding some sort of aid for the dwarfs. What they have found has left them in despair, yet they continue to fight, never giving up on the hope that, one day, the will push the darkness back and a new age of light will begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
