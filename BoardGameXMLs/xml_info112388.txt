			<description>Faux&amp;bull;Cabulary: Expansion 2 includes twelve new word cubes and sixty new cards (with 120 definitions) for use with the Faux&amp;bull;Cabulary base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those not familiar with the game, in Faux&amp;bull;Cabulary, players create new words for descriptions that lack appropriate nomenclature by using randomly drawn &amp;quot;word segment&amp;quot; dice included in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, one player is the Wordmeister while the other players draw three word cubes at random from the box. The Wordmeister reads a Faux&amp;bull;Cabulary card out loud, e.g., &amp;quot;The compulsion to pop bubblewrap&amp;quot;, then each player creates a word using 1-3 of his cubes &amp;ndash; perhaps &amp;quot;Bust-O-Ific&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; and conceals the word in a plastic holder. The Wordmeister mixes the words in their plastic holders (so that she doesn't know who created which word), reveals them one-by-one, then awards the card to whoever submitted the word that (in her mind) best matches the definition. Players then return all the dice, and the Wordmeister position rotates clockwise. Whoever claims the required number of Faux&amp;bull;Cabulary cards first wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
