			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In space opera settings that allow the PCs to own their own ship, transporting passengers is a common occurrence. But coming up with unique passengers for each trip can be a real drag for the gamemaster &amp;ndash; all too often they get relegated to a simple &amp;quot;you find 5 people who want to travel&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 Space Opera Passengers offers a wide selection of 15 people (or groups of people), each with 5 different stories who are seeking travel on the PCs ship (giving 75 different stories in total). Some of these stories can be the entire focus of a session, while others merely provide a diversion on the trip to make things more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few of the passengers seeking travel on the PCs ship include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Elderly Couple&lt;br/&gt;    * Former Stage Actress&lt;br/&gt;    * The Playboy&lt;br/&gt;    * Newly-Wed Couple&lt;br/&gt;    * A Disruptive Teenager&lt;br/&gt;    * The Assassin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15 Space Opera Passengers can be used with any system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
