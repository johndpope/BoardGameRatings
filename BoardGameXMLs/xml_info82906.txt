			<description>A fast paced action RPG following a dramatic storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is based on the Three Kingdoms era and begins where Guan Yu receives the news of Liu Bei. He leaves Cao Cao escorting the wives of Liu Bei. Cao Cao's subordinates felt that Guan Yu behaved far too rudely and arrogantly by leaving without bidding farewell and wanted to pursue and bring him back. However, Cao Cao gives Guan Yu a clear passage to travel as he is well aware that none of his generals can defeat him.&lt;br/&gt;Guan Yu begins his journey to reunite with his sworn brother, Liu Bei. Along the 5 passes, he encounters 6 generals. The generals of Cao Cao refuse to clear the way for Guan Yu. Infuriated, Guan Yu kills all of them. However, he soon realizes that Liu Bei was no longer in Yuan's territory and had left for Runan. Guan Yu and his party then make their long journey back and finally reunite with Liu Bei and Zhang Fei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
