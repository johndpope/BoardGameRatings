							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sprites: Battle Arena</name>
									
			<description>Players compete for fame in a popular, non-lethal sport. The sport is played in the Sprites Battle Arena. Within its walls, contestants attack and defend against each other. And they do so with companions called Sprites. The world is full of humans that are accompanied by Sprites. And its the Energy of Sprites that power and fuel all of the various tools and weapons that used in the Arena. These tools, which are called Wands, create constructs that are used to defend and attack, with the Energy of Sprites. Many of them have unique characteristics and effects. And while using Wands, and Sprites, successfully, the crowd of the Arena will take notice. And it is the crowd who chooses the champion. By collecting their cheers and gaining fans, the winner will be decided and declared champion. To battle in The Arena is to show who can use Sprites the best in this turn-based, free-for-all card game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
