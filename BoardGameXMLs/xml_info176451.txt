It is set in the city of Arkham. The Cast are called together by their mysterious host; Mr. Ramirez, to attend an exclusive party at the dance club; the Metal Church of Asmodeus on the west side of Arkham. Some of the party goers have much that they would rather stay hidden and they will do what they must to keep those secrets coming to the light of day.
