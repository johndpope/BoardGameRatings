			<description>&amp;quot;Crysis is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek Frankfurt, Germany, published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows, and released in November 2007. It is the first game of a trilogy.  A separate game entitled Crysis Warhead was released on September 12, 2008, and follows similar events as Crysis but from a different narrative perspective.  Crysis, Crysis Warhead and a multiplayer expansion called Crysis Wars were re-released as a compilation pack titled Crysis Maximum Edition on 5 May 2009. At the time Crysis was released, and years thereafter, it has been praised, and denigrated, for its milestones in graphical design (which corroborated with likewise high hardware requirements).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based in a future where an ancient alien spacecraft has been discovered beneath the ground on an island near the coast of the East Philippines. The single-player campaign has the player assume the role of United States Delta Force operator Jake Dunn, referred to in-game by his call sign, Nomad. Nomad is armed with various futuristic weapons and equipment, most notably a &amp;quot;Nano Muscle Suit&amp;quot; which was inspired by a real-life military concept. In Crysis, the player fights both North Korean and extraterrestrial enemies, in various environments on and around a tropical island in the Pacific near Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with Crytek's previous game Far Cry, Crysis is an open-ended first-person shooter game with many ways to meet objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a special forces soldier codenamed Nomad whose weapons can be customized without pausing the flow of time, for example changing firing modes, changing scopes or adding sound suppressors. The player is also capable of selecting various modes in Nomad's military prototype &amp;quot;Nano Suit&amp;quot; which draw power from the suit's energy. When the suit's energy is depleted, no modes can be used and the player is more vulnerable to damage before the suit recharges. One of four modes can be selected: Armour deflects damage and recharges the suit's energy faster; Strength allows stronger hand-to-hand combat, the ability to throw objects and enemies with deadly force, higher jumps, steadier aiming and reduced weapon recoil; Speed increases running and swimming speed, as well as other forms of motion; and Cloak renders Nomad almost completely invisible and suppresses movement noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suit's integral mask has its own HUD, displaying typical data including a tactical map, health, current energy levels, and weapons information. The view is electronic in nature, shown in-game through things such as a booting readout and visual distortion during abnormal operation. A particularly useful utility is the binocular function, which allows the player to zoom in and electronically tag enemies and vehicles from afar, thereby tracking their movement on the tactical display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can engage enemies in a variety of ways; using stealth or aggression, bullets or non-lethal tranquilizers, ranged rifles or short-range weaponry, and so on. Enemy soldiers employ tactical maneuvers and work as squads. AI soldiers will respond to noise caused by the player, including using signal flares to call for reinforcements. If the player has not been detected in the area, enemies will exhibit relaxed behaviour, but if aware of the player they will draw weapons and become combative.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crysis,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microbadges:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Crysis Series fan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
