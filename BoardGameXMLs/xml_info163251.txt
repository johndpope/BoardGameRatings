			<description>Did your Mother tell you not to play ball in the house?&lt;br/&gt;Well, now you can. &lt;br/&gt;With Bocce Piatta you can play a game of Bocce just about anywhere. &lt;br/&gt;Bocce Piatta is a table top version of the classic ball sport Bocce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player tosses the Pallino disc onto a flat surface and players take turns tossing their Bocce Ball cards in an attempt to get closest to the Pallino. Points are scored just like the real game of Bocce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bocce Piatta comes with 12 cards in 3 pairs of warm colors and 3 pairs of cool colors, so it can be played by 2 players or up to 6 players in teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bocce Piatta can be played on just about any flat surface. On the table, the floor, the lawn or even at the beach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
