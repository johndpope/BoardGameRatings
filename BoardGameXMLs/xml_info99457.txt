							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Christmas in Hell</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The snow begins to fall heavily against your windscreen as you slowly drive along the lonely country road, your wipers fighting a losing battle against the icy drizzle. Shivering, you turn to the radio for some much-needed Christmas cheer. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way, oh what fun... You manage a smile as you picture the warm turkey waiting for you at your cousin's house in Mingleford. It will be a very merry holiday season indeed if you can just navigate this labyrinth of paddocks and unused dirt tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your forehead creases as you consider again the given to you by the traveller you met along the highway. Dressed in a Santa suit with scraggly white hair, he'd certainly looked the part even if the sherry on his breath undermined his reliability. But his knowledge of the local area had seemed sound enough, hadn't it? Surely no decent human being could have any malicious intent on Christmas Eve!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright, oh... fun it... laying son... ells... the radio begins to flicker. You unceremoniously slap the dashboard, looking with concern at the dusty speakers. The way... sleigh, oh... gle... dewol lah neva eh... rehtaf... The volume of the increasingly scrambled carol begins to rise frighteningly. You bend down to examine the dials, frantically pushing buttons to try and end the ghastly noise. As the screeching reaches an unbearable level you straighten up for a quick glimpse of the road - and then the car plunges into the white stomach of the enormous snowman that has been built in the centre of your path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a moment all is silent beneath the night sky. Then you throw open the door with a groan and scramble out of the car and out into the roadside ditch, panting heavily as the shock continues to pulse throughout your body. The light glowing from the car windows reveals the face of your icy tormentor; sticks and rocks have been used to create a wide, nasty smile that laughs down at you. You curse and walk back towards the car, sticking your arm through the open door and twisting the key. The engine makes no sound. Above your head the car light flickers and dies, leaving you with nothing but the light of the moon and stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fear finally begins to seep into your consciousness; tonight's consistently unlucky events have left you lost, stranded and chilled to the bone. As you try to piece together a plan of action your eyes focus on an orange glow in the distance. Your heart leaps - a fire! Someone is camping just a short distance away from where you are stranded. You quickly begin to jog towards the light, forcing your body to warm itself against the cold. The closer you get, the more lights you can see - and some of them are high above the ground. You smile as you realise you have stumbled onto a construction site! Mingleford must be close by. You bow your head against the snow and continue to trudge forward, still feeling shaken from the crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
