			<description>Publisher Blurb: &lt;br/&gt;Perseverant is a tabletop roleplaying game about the struggle to survive in a brutal wilderness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, players collaborate to create the Wilderness, its significant locales and deadly challenges, how their characters are connected, and why they traverse this hellish landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout play, the characters will confront both the Wilderness and each other, haunted by the grim specter of betrayal and sacrifice. It's unlikely that everyone will survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game works with any kind of setting--from the arid Silk Road to the vastness of space--so long as there are people determined to pass through an inhospitable environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perseverant is designed to create an entire story in a single session lasting two to four hours, and supports between two and five players. Since it's a collaborative story game, it doesn't require a GM or any preparation; you'll start creating your desperate journey as soon as you sit down to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
