							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mysteries of Madness</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Mysteries of Madness introduces two new mysteries for the oracle base class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cacophony - Elsewhere. It is there, just on the edge of hearing, a chorus of lost souls, dead gods, and spirits never given the chance to take shape in this universe. They claw at our universe, screaming out in timeless agony, crying out to regain an existence that once was or to gain one that never was at all. Some individuals are capable of tapping into Elsewhere and making bargains the forgotten vestigial remnants of these beings. Others aren't quite as lucky. Living conduits who are somehow attuned to this Elsewhere, oracles of The Cacophony spend every waking moment steeped in an incessant barrage of tortured screams and are doomed to eventually become one with the white noise of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perfect Bacon - You have seen it in your dreams. Bacon. Not just any bacon, but a delicious shoulder cut from the most perfectly-raised free range swine ever conceived, lovingly marinated after the fact to make it even more chock full of bacon-y goodness. You desire this bacon. You downright lust for this bacon. The only problem is everyone else believes such an amazing piece of pork product is all part of your imagination. But it exists. It has to! And it has to be divine, too! How else could you start throwing conjured bacon salt at people? A bacon god is, of course, the answer! Your source of power is an enormous, and necessarily invisible, strip of bacon cut from a massive divine sow... and you're going to eat it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
