			<description>Ho, traveler! If you would wander these lands, you must prepare yourself; pitiless death stalks all those who roam far here. Carry with you strong iron blades, and cover your shoulders with heavy cloaks. Select with care those hale companions whom you can stoutly trust. I pray ye have honed your skills in combat, or perchance taken on the trade of magics. You will find many aged relics on your path: make use of them, if ye will. For there are those who would pursue you, and their steel is sharp, their ilk stalwart, their wits keen. The fragments of that ancient alliance weaken now, and the tenuous peace of this age threatens to expire&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third Age: Eternal exists in an exciting universe where beasts, known as the Awakened, inhabit a land that would not be unfamiliar to the player. As a modular card game, one must select a cadre of heroes, outfit them with arms and armor, call upon the aid of companions, and employ skills and actions to face the opposing player in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Third Age: Eternal, vitality, a card&amp;rsquo;s life force, is also one&amp;rsquo;s main form of currency, and a delicate balance must be stricken to win&amp;mdash;so weigh your defenses against your offenses or you may quickly find yourself overrun. Certain cards or abilities require additional payment in the form of exhaustion, a card&amp;rsquo;s capacity for exertion; but overwork a companion or gear and you will find it will expire. In Third Age: Eternal, one must constantly balance one&amp;rsquo;s own vitality and exhaustion, which ensures a challenging game of tough choices and rich tactics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck in Third Age: Eternal can play through wildly different strategies. You may be a hero whose skills with the gun are all you need; or strike among an army of companions and ride into battle with your brothers-in-arms. Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re a mercenary of magic and action, and you will weave great firestorms to devastate even the largest forces. The possibilities are endless, but you must be clever if you wish to be standing after the dust settles&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third Age: Eternal is a robust and customizable game that is unmatched in its flexibility of strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
