			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The witch is perhaps the most common unofficial character class for the first and original editions of the world's most popular fantasy RPG, with variations appearing in magazines, unauthorizaed supplements, fanzines, and no doubt the house rules of 1000s of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version is different than most, rather than being inspired by modern interpretations or religion, is instead inspired by the witch in fiction. Rather than being mother goddess worshipers, these witches are self-powered spell casters tied into a theme or adjective, such as fire, storm, wood, frost, and yes, both black and white&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although intended for 1st Advanced Edition of the original fantasy role-playing game, tables are also included for original edition and the Basic and Expert edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
