							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sequence</name>
									
			<description>Sequence is played with numbers or letters. The game is based on an idea which eliminates both arithmetic and word-formation. The object is to place numbers (ranging from 1 to 10) or letters (ranging from A to Z) in sequences on a limited number of squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pieces are drawn at random from bags. Both numbers and letters are graded. The numbers are themselves equivalent to points. The letters range in value from 1 (for A) to 26 (for Z).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is either the first player to dispose of all his pieces or the one left with the lowest number of unused points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
