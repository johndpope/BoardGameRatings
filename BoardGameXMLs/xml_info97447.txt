							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Munch</name>
									
			<description>Guide 'Munchie' around the maze and help him to eat all the white dots. Watch out for the monsters. If they catch 'Munchie', one of his three lives is lost and the player is killed by a bolt of lightning. Turn the monsters blue by eating one of the flashing power pills. While they are blue, 'Munchie' can kill them and gain lots of bonus points. When the question mark appears, eat it for a mystery bonus. When all the dots are eaten, you start a new screen which has even more dangers then the last.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Munch_%28C64_computer_game%29,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Munch_%28C64_computer_g...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
