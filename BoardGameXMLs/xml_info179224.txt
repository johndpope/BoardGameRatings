							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PrisMix Card Game</name>
									
			<description>PrisMix is a color spectrum card game. Players mix and match 12 prismatic colors to create 30 colorful scoring combos with prisms. Players want to strategically create color mixing combos to play multiple cards from their hand at a time to quickly play out all the cards in their hand first to win. So even though a player may have more cards in their hand... they can surprise their opponents by creating color mixing combos with 2, 3, or even 6 cards in a single play. May the best color mixer win! Quick prismatic fun with family and friends is what you will have when playing PrisMix.... let's play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
