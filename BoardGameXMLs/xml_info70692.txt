							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Killing Floor</name>
									
			<description>From the Official Site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a co-op survival horror game. Up to 6 players in online co-op mode, or just you, on your own, playing the Solo mode. The aim &amp;ndash; cleanse each area of zombies, in waves, until you get to the last one. The Big One. The Patriarch. Then exterminate him, too. Actually, they aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;zombies&amp;rdquo;. They are the left-over &amp;ldquo;specimens&amp;rdquo; from a cheap and dirty government program to clone soldier-monsters. The basic ones will just munch on your arm and try to disembowel you. The bigger ones were the first ones they tried arming. Nothing much. Just a chainsaw or a blade for starters. They had just got on to the chain gun and rockets when the government tried to secretly shut down their secret program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, in the typical way these things go, the program didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be shut down. The specimens got loose. No-one was left alive to turn off the specimen-cloning equipment. And now they are running amok. Well, some of them are running amok. Others are shambling amok or even jumping amok, but you get the idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The police were sent in, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a challenge for the specimens. The first army units hadn&amp;rsquo;t been warned what to expect. The screams of &amp;ldquo;its got a bloody chainsaw!&amp;rdquo; over the radios probably didn&amp;rsquo;t do much for morale, as whole units were chewed up. Quite literally, in some cases, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now, there is just you. And a few friends. The few survivors from the first police and army units thrown in. Of course, you can&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone anything, because that would be a breach of the Official Secrets Act 1911, 1920, 1989. And that would be a disciplinary offense. So just get in there and do your bit for Queen and Country&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombies. Lots of them. Big ones, little ones. Armed and Dangerous. JUST MAKE THEM ALL GO AWAY!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
