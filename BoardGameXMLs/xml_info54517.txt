			<description>Echo is a LDS quiz game similar in style to Family Feud. The game comes with questions that were asked of 100 LDS church members. Players must try to give the most popular answer from that survey result. For example, for the question &amp;quot;Name a state other than Utah where many Latter-day Saints reside,&amp;quot; the answers were: California (41), Idaho (32), Nevada (15), and Arizona (12). Players earn points by matching the most popular answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has rules for two players or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
