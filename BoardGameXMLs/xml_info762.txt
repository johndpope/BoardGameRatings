			<description>With parade season just around the corner, the elite members of the Shryners go-cart squad gathered at a local taco eatery. Tales were told, old parade glories were relived, and many burritos were consumed. With their bellies full of greasy meat, the field of battle awaited. No words need be spoken between these warriors of the speedway. Only one place would quench their need for speed: the go-cart track at the local Golf 'n' Games. Gentlemen start your engines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
