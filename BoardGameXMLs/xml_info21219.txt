							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Hot Silly Dragon</name>
									
			<description>Each player leads a team of four expert treasure hunters. Namely &amp;quot;Spark&amp;quot; the hot shot, &amp;quot;Teaser&amp;quot; the flaming girl, &amp;quot;Double Boiler&amp;quot; the fire fighter, and the huge but very slow &amp;quot;Ice Breaker&amp;quot;. All have gathered in front of a nearby cave entrance with the intention of collecting as many treasures as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, deep inside this cave, the Red Hot Silly Dragon is lying comfortably on his mountain of gold, and he is not ready to share his colossal wealth. He will not hesitate to breath his magic fire on anybody getting too close to his savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So caution Hot stuff, Who will dare enter the dragons lair? Who will manage to bring back the most treasures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic principle of this small risk taking game is extremely simple. During each round of play, all players simultaneously choose an adventurer, from the four of their respective team, which they wish to send into the cave to recover treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This choice will be done according to a &amp;quot;crystal ball&amp;quot; prediction, which is never highly reliable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So players must bear in mind the power and the range of the flame of the dragon, and the &amp;quot;fire resistance&amp;quot; of each adventurer (from very weak for Spark, to very high for Ice Breaker). Also because the cave is narrow the placement of the adventurers in the cave is very limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ascending order of fire resistances will be carried out. In fact, the more resistant an adventurer is, the slower he runs. In other words, the more you take a risk, the higher your choice of placement will be, but the more likely it is your adventurer will get scorched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, to protect your valorous adventurers from the small sudden changes of mood of the dragon (anger, fury...) as well as the various tricks of your adversaries, who will surely never miss an opportunity to prevent you from recovering treasures, you will have at your disposal a complete set of magic items tailor-made for this kind of &amp;quot;sport&amp;quot; so it's up to you to use them wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner will obviously be the player who has piled up the most treasures at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
