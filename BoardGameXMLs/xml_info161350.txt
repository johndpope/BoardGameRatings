			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where the waves of the Endless Sea lazily roll into a rocky inlet lies the small svirfneblin fishing village of Deephearth. Hidden in a seldom used tunnel network, the svirfneblins of Deephearth lead quiet lives unnoticed by the many lurking dangers of the Ebon Realm. Recently an earthquake blocked the mouth of the inlet where Deephearth is sitting, but the village itself escaped the event damaged. However, lately svirfneblins have gone missing. At first fishing boats disappeared without a trace, but now even villagers have disappeared from their own beds! The villagers look to their leaders for guidance, but the council is unable to act, as one of their own is among the missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subterranean Enclaves are short, richly detailed supplements that each present a single subterranean settlement ready to insert into almost any home campaign. Perfect for use as a waystop on the road to adventure or as an adventure site themselves, Subterranean Enclaves present the details so the busy GM can focus on crafting exciting, compelling adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
