			<description>Team Yankee is a video game adaptation of the 1987 Harold Coyle's World War III novel Team Yankee that was developed by Oxford Digital Enterprises for the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released in 1990 by publisher Empire Software, and was followed by two sequels that used the same game engine (titled Pacific Islands and War in the Gulf).

The player is able to use several well-known late Cold War-era tanks and other armoured vehicles (M1 Abrams, M2 Bradley IFV, M113, T-72, T-62 and BMP-2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Yankee_%28video_game%29 Team Yankee (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
