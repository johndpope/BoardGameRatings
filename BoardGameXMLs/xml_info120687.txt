			<description>Each player has a single game board which includes an area for letters in use, an area for the formation of a sentence and an area of ​​points account.&lt;br/&gt;The game features consonants, vowels and Jokers replacing any letter of the alphabet.&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each handle 6 letters are drawn at random: three consonants and three vowels, each letter has a point value (3 to 8) also corresponding to the number of copies used during the game.&lt;br/&gt;Wildcards are 6 in number per player and have no point value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player attempts to write a sentence with the highest number of points with the letters available. Once a sentence exceeds 150 points, the player can if they wish to stop the game. If the sentence is considered correct, the player scores points over its 100 bonus points if they used one or more wildcards, and 300 points if no wildcards have been used (and 500 bonus points if the value of sentence exceeds 199 points even with wildcard!).&lt;br/&gt;Opponents mark only the value of their sentence. Of course an incorrect sentence does not relate points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then new round begins with new letters by drawing new letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who scores the first 1000 points.&lt;br/&gt;Note: a sentence written without wildcard totaling 199 points and is called Super Volap&amp;uuml;k and allows the player to win the tournament immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
