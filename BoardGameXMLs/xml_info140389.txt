			<description>Global Operations is a first-person tactical shooter computer game developed by Barking Dog Studios and published by both Crave Entertainment and Electronic Arts. It was released in March 2002, following its public multiplayer beta version which contained only the Quebec map. The full game featured thirteen maps and featured both a single player and a multiplayer mode, which supported up to twenty-four players and three teams. Afterwards, a multiplayer demo with only the Antarctica map was released.&lt;br/&gt;The game itself was focused on firearms in a special forces setting, with a mixture of military and counterterrorist type themes. The game featured a large number of firearms, numbering in the dozens and including a wide selection of handguns and rifles. Many of them could be further customized as well. For example, a C-mag and silencer could be added. The multi-player offered different classes (Reconnaissance, Commando, Medic, Heavy Weapons, Sniper, Demolitions and Intelligence Officer) with extra abilities and class-specific weapons. All classes could use all other classes' firearms (by picking them up off the battlefield), but each class might not have the same level of skill with a given weapon (such as less precision).&lt;br/&gt;Other features existed as well, including a life-sign tracking device, as well other game items like tear gas grenades, smoke grenades and medkit. A LAW (Lightweight Anti-tank Weapon) could be used, as well as night vision and thermal vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Global Operations&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
