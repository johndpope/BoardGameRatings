			<description>The game play is simple be the firsy to correctly answer two questions in each of 4 categories and you win. Maybe you're not sitting pretty with a Best Actor Oscar award, but you can win the Movie Buff Bragger title when you beat your friends and family at Movies Trivia game night!  Your family and friends will try to distract you with buttery popcorn, fizzy drinks and sugary concoctions, but you stay true to that movie brain of yours!  And when you need a short break, stand tall and tell em', &amp;quot;I'LL BE BACK!&amp;quot;.  That's right, they'll be quivering as you exit the room. Game play as follows, grab a pad or piece of paper abd write down every ones name. Then one player selects a category and the person to the left asked the question question on the card if you get it right you get a point in that category. Play then continues in a clockwise direction, the game is over when one player has correctly answered two questions in each category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
