							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Horde</name>
									
			<description>A card game based on the vintage Crystal Dynamics fantasy computer game of the same name. The game is played with two custom decks, a Recruit Deck and a Horde Deck. The Horde Deck is composed of Hordlings, the creatures that make up the Horde. The Recruit Deck includes forces which the player will use to combat the Hordlings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The takes on the role of Chauncey, who must hold off the Horde for five years, battling the Hordlings in a predetermined series of locations, including the Shimto Plains, Fetid Swamps of Buuzal, Tree Realm of Alburga, Kar-Nyar Desert, and Frozen Wastes of Vesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Victory: You (Chauncey) are killed if all 4 Grimthwacker cards are in the Recruit Discard Pile. You lose if you are ever unable to play your taxes. You win if you survive all 5 years (=20 turns).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
