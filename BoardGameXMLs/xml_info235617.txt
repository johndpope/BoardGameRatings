			<description>The Cylons have rebelled! The First Cylon War has begun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The day is here: fleets of  Basestars are assaulting the Twelve Colonies. Your goal is to stop them. In 'Battlestar Galactica Deadlock' players will lead the Colonial fleet four years into the First Cylon War in an attempt to save mankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will be able to build their fleet, fight tactical battles and strategically defend the Twelve Colonies during the First Cylon War. 'Battlestar Galactica Deadlock' is based on the award winning sci-fi universe, &amp;ldquo;Battlestar Galactica,&amp;rdquo; created by Glen A. Larson and produced by Universal Cable Productions (UCP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command an extensive range of ships, including fan-favorite Vipers, Battlestars, and brand new ships which were designed specifically for the game. Play through the exciting campaign story and witness the heroic deeds of the officers of the Fleet Group Daidalos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 'Battlestar Galactica Deadlock', the simultaneous turn-based system will test your tactical prowess: the only way to prevail is to outsmart your opponent, as you build up intimate knowledge of how to configure ships and weapon systems all under your command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.slitherine.com/news/2335/Battlestar.Galactica.Deadlock.is.out.on.PC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.slitherine.com/news/2335/Battlestar.Galactica.Dea...&lt;/a&gt;!
