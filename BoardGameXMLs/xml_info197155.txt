			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about family, your family.You have a husband or wife and at least one child. Like all parents before you, you want a better future for your family, and that future is definitely not on the cramped and environmentally exhausted Earth. You dream of a better life on the new colonies that have been rapidly expanding with the discovery of Faster than Light (FTL) technology 15 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2256 Earth is over crowded and its resources are stretched to the breaking point. Resource extraction colonies have been the norm for over a century but until recently they have been limited to the native solar system of humanity. The FTL system has led to a massive expansion of colonies throughout nearby solar systems most of these are resource operations for Earth&amp;rsquo;s survival but a few habitable worlds have been found and brave men and woman have been sent by Earth to begin life again amongst the stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a settler, you would be allowed to bring your family away from Earth and make a fresh start and possibly even make a name for yourself on the edges of known space. The catch, like everyone before you who wanted their settler&amp;rsquo;s permit, was the mandatory term of service for 9 years in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s Colonial Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
