							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fort Talon</name>
									
			<description>From the description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fort Talon is a town of about 3200 inhabitants that lies high in the Terrorbald Mountains, 24 miles south of Jamestown. Fort Talon was founded by the decree of Lord Relequin James in the year 772. At first, the fort was simply a walled garrison designed to protect the mountain passes from goblin and cobrat invaders. In addition, a few small mining operations cropped up to take advantage of the tin and iron in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, four years ago, prospectors found a large vein of gold. Miners and prospectors of all types have flocked to the town, hoping to stake a claim. In the past four years, the population has increased from 400 to over 3200. The streets are crowded with miners, traders, street vendors, mercenaries, and fortune hunters from all walks of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
