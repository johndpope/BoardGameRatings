							<name  sortindex="1">All About Fortune Tellers</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Yugsalanti Fortune Tellers of the Roads</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yugsalanti are infamous for being the best fortune tellers in the world and some of the best conmen.  This makes them the most sought after travelers on the road as well as the least desirable.  Want to see both sides of this notorious group?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to look long and hard at the Yugsalantis.  We&amp;rsquo;ll get into their fortune telling (and how to make it work for game masters), their con games, their camps, and the scandalous parties thrown after dark.  It&amp;rsquo;s life on the road, but for whatever else they do, the Yugsalantis squeeze every moment out of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Build Your Fantasy World in Small Bites, or Small Bites for short.  Our goal is to take a subject, whether an archetype, a monster class, or some other FRPG theme and bring you as much content about it as we can.  But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a simple one-shot supplement.  We want to get you involved in the process - giving us the themes you want most, the articles you like the best, and the feedback we need to make you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the &amp;ldquo;World Walker&amp;rdquo; edition.  The Game Master edition gives you even more, including ideas about campaigns, enemy characters, and world building.  We know that veteran and starting players and game masters are all going to find things they can use, and ideas to spark their characters, campaigns and game worlds!  Come on - You&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement contains 22 pages of content, compared to the full version which contains 48 pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
