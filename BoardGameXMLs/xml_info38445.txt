			<description>&amp;quot;Rules for Toy Army Soldiers. This is a simple, easy game for play in the backyard or on the beach. Our goal is to make it fast, fun, enjoyable and cheap.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players must supply at least thirty toy soldiers per side and any heavy weapons or vehicles (tanks, APCs, half tracks, artillery, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each type of weapon (rifles, mortars, grenades, flamethrowers, etc.) is rated for range (long, medium, and short), shots per round, and damage. Explosive weapons are rated for their damage radius. Vehicles are rated for armor (front, side, and rear) and speed (road, off road, and steep/rough ground).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also cover terrain effects and scenario types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules add leaders, radiomen, minesweepers, obstacles, bridges, morale, and concealed movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the Sandy Hook Battle Games, available for free online at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thortrains.net/armymen/wargame1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thortrains.net/armymen/wargame1.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
