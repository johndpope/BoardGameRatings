							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Pippo</name>
									
			<description>Super Pippo (Italian name for Super Goof) is one of those children's games you love when you're an adult too (much like Looping Louie). The board has a big plastic peanut in the middle, filled with holes with numbers in them. The players move around the board collecting peanuts of several colors; once a player has a particular combination, he may &amp;quot;launch&amp;quot; a Super Goof miniature, using a spring-driven plastic skyscraper, trying to make it land in the holes with high numbers. The higher the number, the more the tiles of a puzzle the player gets. The player completing a puzzle for first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
