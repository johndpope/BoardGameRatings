			<description>Theme&lt;br/&gt;Utopia, according to Sir Thomas More, is a model society in all aspects.  This educational game is built upon the Utopian ideal as well as the practical matters in real life such as making a living, setting a family, investment, etc. Through Utopia players realize the importance of opportunities, knowledge and possessions in attaining personal goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The game is divided into 7 cycles, starting at 15-20 (years) and ending at retirement.  Each player chooses a Chart of Personal Possessions, a colored horse head marker and receives $3000.  Placing their horse head at the bottom left corner of the starting zone, players roll two six sided dice and move the number of spaces equal to the difference between the two numbers. If doubles are rolled, players earn either money or a Utopia card as indicated by the chart printed on the board.  At the end of each cycle (circuit of the board), players received a Utopian card and $1200 or their salary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to be the person who retires with the most points based on markers, money and price of property owned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
