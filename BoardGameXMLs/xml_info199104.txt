							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Short Days Ago</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second in a trilogy (possibly of more than three books, as is traditional), Short Days Ago is part of an extended campaign in the exotic West African region (as well as the Bight of Benin) and deals with one of the more important conflicts that resulted from the growing tensions between the three major power Blocs prior to the actual outbreak of the Three Way War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventures are not for the faint of heart &amp;ndash; the adventures take place in what can only be described as the Third World &amp;ndash; and at least one of the nations you&amp;rsquo;ll adventure in is easily what can be called a &amp;lsquo;third world ****hole&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip; exotic, in other words. Commando Raids. A mission to blow two major Bridges. Supply Interdiction. A genuine treasure hunt &amp;hellip; all the sorts of things that can put the PCs in deep trouble with the locals &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortunately, your mission is backed by the Western Alliance (mainly the US, and through the auspices of the CIA) &amp;ndash; so the PCs will not have to worry too much about these things. They&amp;rsquo;ll just have to remember that the playbook the other side(s) are using are very different from what they might expect in more established parts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thrust of the book is the early months of the secessionist rebellion by the Republic of Biafra, the south eastern part of Nigeria around the oil rich Niger river delta. The Federal government has been booted out of the Delta by the rebels &amp;hellip; but the terrorists of Boko Haram took the opportunity to stage their own rebellion and have seized the north, founding an Islamic Republic (aka &amp;lsquo;fanatical religious dictatorship&amp;rsquo;). But they aren&amp;rsquo;t satisfied &amp;hellip; they want the whole of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are part of the struggle to make sure that they fail &amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
