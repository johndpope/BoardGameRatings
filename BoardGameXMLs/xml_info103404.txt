			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bet On Soldier: Blood Sport&amp;quot; is a First Person Shooter, set on an alternate Earth in the year 1998. The story revolves around an unknown World War, that has lasted for 80 years, and shows no signs of ever stopping. Fighting is not only a matter of being alive, it's a manner to make money too, and Elite Soldiers now compete against each other in bloody deathmatches which are broadcasted all over the world as a televised, and very popular sport named &amp;quot;Bet On Soldier&amp;quot; with a large, expectant audience.&lt;br/&gt;You play the role as Nolan Daneworth who&amp;rsquo;s family was killed by two champions of the B.O.S. and you enter these &amp;quot;Games&amp;quot; in order to seek revenge.&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is simple, and consists of classic missions, (destroy a base or infiltrate a bunker etc.), and you must fight 2-4 champions of the B.O.S. during these missions. This way you earn money, which makes you able to purchase new armors, weapons and upgrades, - or repair your stuff at the different repairing posts. There are no medikits in this game, so your equipment is your only one protection!&lt;br/&gt;B.O.S. is probably the sequel to &amp;quot;Iron Storm&amp;quot;, because there are lots of parallels between the two games, and they share many of the same themes, plot elements, weapons, character and level designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
