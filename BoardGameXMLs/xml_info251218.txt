							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Forbidden Treasure of Miftenmad</name>
									
			<description>It's a combination of games like Yahtzee with D&amp;amp;D. The result is a fast-paced, fun, dice-rolling game based on my popular Journal of an Outlaw book series!&lt;br/&gt;Each character plays a rogue trying to open a treasure chest that is protected by 10 locks. Each player takes turns rolling their polyhedral dice to see if they make the combination and open the locks. If unsuccessful at opening a lock, they arm a trap. They get one more chance to pick the lock, and failure means taking damage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns trying to open their treasure chest, they are not only trying to get treasure, but must also live to the end! Hit points are exchanged for gold at the end of the game. Whoever winds up with the most gold wins! There are also special skills that can be earned to help your rogue achieve success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the designer's webpage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
