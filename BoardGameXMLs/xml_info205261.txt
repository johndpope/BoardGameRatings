							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ELLIPSIS</name>
									
			<description>ELLIPSIS (&amp;hellip;) is a party card game where players try to compare things that are not necessarily similar. In addition, players have to explain their comparisons in the form of some sort of punch line. For example, &amp;ldquo;parents are like boogers &amp;hellip; always hanging around making you look like a fool&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;parents are like belts &amp;hellip; supportive.&amp;rdquo; Here&amp;rsquo;s the catch, the key word revealed on the drawn card must be compared to a certain letter word. Rolling the 20 sided die will dictate the starting letter of a word. In the aforementioned example, the key word was &amp;ldquo;parents&amp;rdquo; and the letter &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; was rolled to come up with the words &amp;ldquo;boogers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;belts&amp;rdquo;. Notice the dot dot dot (&amp;hellip;) in the example? It&amp;rsquo;s called an ELLIPSIS. Each player will write their own witty, humorous, or even barbed punch line following the ELLIPSIS. Players earn points for guessing who said what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
