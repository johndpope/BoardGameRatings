			<description>Each player has his own game board and four pawns. The goal of the game is to get all meeples off his board, either by moving them past space 49 or by getting them on the board of another player. Movement is determined by two dice. The player may choose to move two pawns with the result of each die, or one meeple with the added result of both dice. If a meeple gets on a space of it's own color it stays there, but if it gets on the space of another color, it moves to the game board of this color onto the space of the same number and is now controlled by the player of this color. Instead of rolling the dies, he may move a meeple of his own color ten spaces ahead, if it lands on a space of his own color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get all pawns off his board, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
