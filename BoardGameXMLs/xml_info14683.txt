			<description>(from GMT website:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men of Iron covers the re-emergence of infantry in the early 14th century, along with a more perceptive understanding of the value of combined-arms warfare especially with good use of defensive terrain. The scenarios highlight the key elements that made these battles so fascinating: the defensive power of the longbow, especially when used in coordination with dismounted, or even mounted, men-at-arms. Given the right deployments and forces, the inability to take advantage of the marvelous abilities of the vaunted knights, the finest mounted force in Europe, became something of a surprise to many &amp;quot;experts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men of Iron is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, there are no &amp;quot;turns&amp;quot; - play is Continual, with ample opportunities to steal play from your opponent - and combat resolution is a single dieroll. Playing time is about 1 hour per battle. Really!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men of Iron is also GMT's gift to the gamer who enjoys playing solitaire - the system is designed for both individual and face-to-face play without any loss in insight or Fun - to see what happened in these famous battles and why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battles included in Men of Iron are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Falkirk - Scotland, 22 July 1298 - Wallace's great disaster, despite his massive schiltron.
