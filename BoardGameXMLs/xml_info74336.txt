			<description>[User Summary]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Came From the Desert is another of Cinemaware's movie-inspired games. This time, inspiration comes from the cult horror B-movies of the 50s, especially those featuring giant monsters. The games starts when Greg Bradley, a geologist newly arrived in the small town of Lizard Breath, heads out to investigate a mysterious meteorite. Of course, the meteorite has mutated a nearby ant colony, and soon the town is under siege by 20 feet long ants hungry for human flesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other Cinemaware designs, the game combines several gameplay elements: adventure gaming (exploring the town, meeting its inhabitants, trying to convince authorities of the giant insects threat), arcade sequences (first-person shooting, car chases, overhead bug fighting) and strategy elements (defending the town with the help of the national guard, the police and the citizens players have persuaded to fight).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
