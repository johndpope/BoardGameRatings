			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've unchained your monk, now make him shine with Everyman Unchained: Monk Archetypes II! This product by Everyman Gaming, LLC finishes the good work of its predecessor by updated a variety of official Pathfinder RPG archetypes to make them compatible with the unchained monk from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Pathfinder Unchained as well as several archetypes from other Everyman Gaming products. Some of the archetypes that you will discover within Everyman Unchained: Monk Archetypes II include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Golden Devil Master, a member of a female monastery that studies the fighting styles of barbed devils to learn to deliver painful strikes of her own.&lt;br/&gt;    The Kyuubi Visionary, a kitsune monk who learns to manipulate his ki so as to help him unlock the secret of manifesting additional tails.&lt;br/&gt;    The Monk of a Million Lives, a samsaran monk who enters a zen state where he can draw upon the abilities and experiences of all of his prior reincarnations.&lt;br/&gt;    The Monk of the Seven Forms, a monk devoted to an esoteric fighting style that strives to perfect his body.&lt;br/&gt;    An update to the Cracking the Code sidebar that now includes a conversion for standard monk archetypes that trade the maneuver training class feature.&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
