							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Port Republic</name>
									
			<description>1862 - Port Republic (American Civil War in 3D)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the final of the five battles in the Jackson Valley Campaign of 1862 and the ninth battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D.It sees a Confederate force under General Thomas J &amp;quot;Stonewall&amp;quot; Jackson launching an attack against the Union force that is under the command of General Erastus B Tyler. Tyler is under the command of General James Shields who unfortunately is still with the rest of his division that is strung out on a very boggy road to Luray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General Richard S Ewell&amp;rsquo;s division has been ordered to support the attack, this leaves the Union General John C Fr&amp;eacute;mont free to attempt to Tyler&amp;rsquo;s aid. Fr&amp;eacute;mont withdrew his division in the night having fought the battle of Cross Keys the previous day with Ewell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Port Republic initially has a time limit of 16 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their task objective.Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 2 to 3 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavor of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
