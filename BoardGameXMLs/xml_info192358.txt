							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Octask System Rules</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the system have seven standard Qualities (Attributes), including Brawn, Durability, Finesse, Acumen, Awareness, Conviction, and Influence.  Qualities have numeric Ratings from 1-7.  Characters also have Statistics that are game traits, including Grip, Knockdown, Speed, Knowledge, Progression, Courage, and Social Armor.  Characters adapt to specific genres by using some subset of fourteen Capabilities (somewhat like Skills), with Ratings from 1-4 allocated from a points pool.  Damage is tracked using a numerical Wound Level chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Octask System contemplated eight separate genre systems utilizing the same core mechanics.  The six systems actually noted were:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Dark Places - Supernatural evil in a modern setting&lt;br/&gt;     Supragen - Super heroes and science fiction&lt;br/&gt;     Winterblood - Dark medieval swords, sorcery, and ice&lt;br/&gt;     Clockwork Dissonance - Postmodern ecological apocalypse&lt;br/&gt;     Red Cube - 1950s Communist earth&lt;br/&gt;     Portalis Draconum - Dragons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, none of these systems emerged beyond the conceptual or initial design stages except for Dark Places which was reworked into a standalone game (not using the Octask System Rules).  Winterblood, Red Cube, and Portalis Draconum also are featured in the author's novel series Spiralchain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
