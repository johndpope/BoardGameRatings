							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cartoon Action Hour Season 2 Halloween Special</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halloween is more than just another holiday. It&amp;rsquo;s a time of year in which ghouls and goblins roam freely amongst the newly fallen leaves of brown and orange. It&amp;rsquo;s a time of year in which many people seek thrills and chills by going to &amp;ldquo;spook houses&amp;rdquo; or by watching an insane amount of horror flcks. But during the 1980s, it was also a time in which the networks showcased numerous animated Halloween Specials that kids of all ages could (and did) look forward to. In most cases, such specials were derived from a popular series of the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along similar lines, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t unheard of for a series to have horror elements year-round rather than just a one-off special in October. Granted, the brand of horror demonstrated by these series was a far cry from that of the horror fims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document seeks to bring horror to your games of Cartoon Action Hour, whether you want to run a Halloween Special for your existing series or create a new series laden with horror trappings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fist section of the document deals evoking the appropriate style of horror into the game, offering hints, tips and advice. The second section presents a new horror-themed series, Creature Busters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
