			<description>The Game Boy Printer, known in Japan as the Pocket Printer, is a thermal printer accessory released by Nintendo in 1998. Nintendo ceased manufacture in 2003. The Game Boy Printer is compatible with the Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, and Game Boy Color systems and is designed to be used in conjunction with the Game Boy Camera. It also prints images from compatible late-generation Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. It runs on six AA batteries and uses a special 3.8 cm wide thermal paper with adhesive backing called Game Boy Printer Paper. One package of printer paper came with three rolls, including one roll of white paper, one roll of pale yellow paper, and one roll of pale blue paper. In Japan, a bright yellow Pok&amp;eacute;mon version of the Game Boy Printer was released which featured a Pok&amp;eacute; Ball-style feed button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Game Boy Printer , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
