			<description>According to the introduction of the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Imagine a castle in the middle ages with four armies facing one another, ready to battle. You command one of those armies. You send your soldiers off to attack the enemy and capture prisoners at the same time remaining vigilant so that your own troops don't fall into a trap.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this abstract strategy game, you command an army of 8 soldiers and one captain. Each turn you have six movement points to distribute among your forces. A standard move is one square horizontally or vertically. The captain add the possibility of a diagonal move. The board offer many opportunities for jumping (black squares) or diagonal movement (black squares with an &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;). The capture of an opponent piece is made by surrounding it with two friendly pieces. You score one point for capturing a soldier and three points for a captain. You can also score points by occupying enemy territories or denying an opponent's army to move is full movement points allowance. 27 points is needed for claiming the victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game included:&lt;br/&gt;- a game board (10 x 10 squares)&lt;br/&gt;- 36 game pieces (8 soldiers and a captain in each of four colors)&lt;br/&gt;- an instruction booklet&lt;br/&gt;- some pegs to indicate victory points on the board&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
