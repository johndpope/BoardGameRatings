							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Curious George Nutrition Game</name>
									
			<description>Young Curious George fans will delight in identifying the food cards and matching them to the pictures on the game boards. Sorting and organizing skills are developed as players learn to classify the objects they see, and visual discrimination and fine motor skills are enhanced as they play. Best of all, as the game is played, knowledge of the basic food group units is acquired, reinforcing the importance of good nutritional habits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
