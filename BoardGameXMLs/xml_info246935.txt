			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any System! Any Setting!&lt;br/&gt;Character, Worldbuilding, and Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The appeal of the fighter is that it&amp;rsquo;s the most generic of character classes. It plays to the most basic rules, regardless of what system you&amp;rsquo;re using. There are no complicated and esoteric exceptions to be learned, making it perfect for new players. For those interested in roleplaying over tactics, it actually presents a chance to focus on character interactions and narrative because there are, metaphorically, fewer moving parts. At the same time, the variety of types of fighters, based on background, history, weapons, armor, and tactics, makes it a delightful class for veteran players. Where other classes have a broader set of abilities, the fighter allows a player to go deep, exploring maneuvers, feats, stunts, and other special tricks that allow them to be highly effective in almost any type of encounter. While certain other classes might require some explanation as to why they&amp;rsquo;re in a specific scenario, or simply might not fit with a particular setting, fighters are an appropriate character choice almost anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the Class Theory supplements are system-agnostic, this volume will delve more into the perceptions and archetypal personalities of the fighter rather than specific abilities. In places, some broad generalizations will be made. You should adapt the concepts to what best fits the mechanics, setting, and character that you&amp;rsquo;re working with inside the context of your campaign. As an example, while not all systems have classes, the word fighter will be used generically to represent the actual character element of that name, character archetypes and templates, and other conceptual details that fit the general spirit of the fighter. Because if we&amp;rsquo;re going to be intellectually honest, we need to just admit that everything in tabletop roleplaying, no matter how innovative, unique, and transcendent it may be, with always be compared to the baseline created by the game that started the hobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Player&lt;br/&gt;This book is not about new abilities, optimizing your character build, or exploiting game mechanics for maximum effect. The intention of this volume is to help you tell your character&amp;rsquo;s story. By the end of this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the fighter in relation to the Three Pillars of Fantasy Storytelling, and use the unique features of the archetype to create unique characters, enhance your worldbuilding, and tell unique stories tailored to their roles and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Gamemaster&lt;br/&gt;By taking a look at the specific strengths and opportunities of the fighter class, you will be able to create truly balanced encounters. You will gain a fresh perspective on how the fighter fits into the Three Pillars of Fantasy Storytelling, so you can work with the player to create a character that fits seamlessly with the setting and your campaign. The way fighter characters can be leveraged to expand your worldbuilding efforts, and can be mined for story hooks, will allow you to have a richer creative experience, and an overall better roleplaying experience for everyone at your table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
