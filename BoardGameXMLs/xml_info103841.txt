							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crunglecheese</name>
									
			<description>A 1-player game in which players control a team of 'Crungleteers' as they move through a winding subterranean cave and attempt to eat their way through a rapidly-multiplying mass of Crunglecheese, a culinary abomination, in order to repair six failing machines to avert disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a modular board, somewhat like a Carcassone board,  with the option to track all points with moving dials or with conventional counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of repeating 5-step rounds, the steps of which are revealing a new tile (each tile is two spaces, leading to some strategy in placement), rolling a die which will lead to growth of the 'Crunglecheese', which can block cave passages and damage machines (the next round), and directly damage machines. On the player's step of the round, four pawns with different abilities may take actions including moving, eating crunglecheese, and repairing machines among other actions. There are a limited number of actions, so these must be taken carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
