			<description>You really aren't awake yet. You never are until at least your second cup of coffee, and this is only your first. You're having a hard time getting your eyes to focus. But it certainly looks like there's a man in your front yard, crouched down on all fours, gnawing at a leg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A human leg. Definitely. It's still wearing a sneaker. And a sock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The man gnawing on the human leg suddenly stops chewing, as though some sound disturbs him. He slowly looks up from his meal. His eyes don't blink, and they seem to be too large for his face. His mouth hangs open. Drool and blood trail down his chin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've heard about the outbreak in Millbury, of course. You just hadn't thought it was as serious as the eleven o'clock news made it out. They get hysterical about everything. A couple of inches of snow, and it's THE SNOWPOCALYPSE. You can't really be blamed for putting their ZOMBIEPOCALYPSE warnings in the same category. Boy who cried wolf, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it seems the newscasters were at least a little right, because there's a zombie chowing down on a human leg in your front yard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
