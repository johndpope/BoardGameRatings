							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Patient Zero: A Solo Epidemic</name>
									
			<description>You are a lead Doctor with the CDC, specializing in Pathogens and Contagious Disease, top in your field. You and your team of highly trained Specialists are tasked to determine the source of a new deadly, highly contagious disease. They have discovered the original carrier who has transmitted the disease to countless others and brought him to you.  You have only three days to keep Patient Zero alive and discover a successful treatment before it becomes a worldwide pandemic and all is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is simple:&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 Disease types infecting Patient Zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Virus&lt;br/&gt;    Bacteria&lt;br/&gt;    Fungus&lt;br/&gt;    Parasite&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patient Zero consists of 6 cards: Head, Torso, 2 Arms, &amp;amp; 2 Legs.&lt;br/&gt;There is one single deck containing &amp;quot;Positive, Negative, and Neutral Effect&amp;quot; cards in 4 colors representing the 4 types of Diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you flip cards to determine starting Disease Types...&lt;br/&gt;The turn order is broken up into 3 Phases:&lt;br/&gt;1. INFECTION&lt;br/&gt;2. RESEARCH&lt;br/&gt;3. TREATMENT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is broken up into 3 &amp;quot;Days&amp;quot; being the number of times you cycle through the deck. If Patient Zero survives the end of Day 3, you then add your points based on how well your treatment was. If your score is over 100, you lose, treatment was a failure. If under 100, you win! Your treatment was successful and you can start manufacturing a cure! You saved the world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
