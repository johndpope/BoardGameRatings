							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Joshua: Hebrews vs. Pagans</name>
									
			<description>In Joshua: Hebrews vs Pagans; will you like Joshua conquer the promised land? Will you avoid the Sin of Achen and the Plague of Peor? Will you be tricked by the Gibeonites? Will Caleb and Othneil be at your right and left hand? Will the Ark of the Covenant remain safely in the hands of Eleazar, Phineas, and the Levites? Will 1 of your soldiers put to flight a 1,000 of the enemy?&lt;br/&gt;As the Pagans, how long will Ai hold out? Will you keep Balam the Son of Beor from Hebrew justice? Will you unite to defeat the Hebrews? Will you take advantage of Hidden Movement, Concealed Pieces, Fortified Cities, and Siege Sorties? Will you utilize off-board Ambushes, the Iron Chariots of the Canaanites, and the might of the Philistine Anakin to drive the Hebrew invaders back across the Jordan River?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joshua is  card driven game. Joshua must conquer three of the major tribes, or two of the major tribes and most of the minor tribes in order to win. The Pagans win by stopping Joshua.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
