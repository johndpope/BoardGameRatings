							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Harley Davidson: Road Trip</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freedom is a powerful thing. So is being a part of something special. Rev up your V-Twin and hit the highway in Harley-Davidson: Road Trip for the Wii, a cross-country adventure that puts you in control of the most iconic motorcycle brand in the world. See the United States the way it was meant to be seen: gripping the handlebars of your very own Harley-Davidson. Revving your engine has never felt, or sounded, this good in a game. How much of the country can you see before breakfast? Ride coast to coast for HOG Magazine, taking on over 18 assignments across 3 regions of the United States in 5 game modes. Twist the Wii Remote to feel the power. Tilt the Wii. Remote to lean into the curves, all the while hearing the authentic H-D V-Twin engines for the ultimate experience. Customize your bikes with over 70 official Harley parts and different custom paint schemes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
