							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nightraiders</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elite corps known as the Nightraiders are trying to bring freedom to a conquered earth.  Since they are few in number, compared to the enemy, they must operate under the cloak of darkness.  As the group's leader, your mission is to fly over enemy strongholds... identify targets of opportunity and destroy them thoroughly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the invaders cannot mount an air attack after the sun has set they do have weapons of awesome power... weapons which relentlessly track your flightpath and anticipate your movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success does not come easy.  You must be able to maneuver like the crack of a whip... accelerate and decelerate in an out of hyperdrive... while carefully lining up the targets for your twin ion bombs.  And always keep an eye on the special radar screen which spots enemy action for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Become a Nightraider and meet the most fascinating challenge of your space career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
