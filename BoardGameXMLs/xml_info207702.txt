			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; UNAVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has officially been announced by the publisher or developer, but has not yet been released and made available for purchase. Therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please do not submit images for it, nor add new releases. Press Kits are an exception and a maximum of six can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anor, the Old Kingdom, fell long ago to the strife of Men who, armed with tools of war, broke Covenant as they turned against one another, muddled by the workings of ancient evil. Far from their minds were hallowed notions of the sacredness of life, the sanctity of nature and the power of love, as much blood was shed, much destruction wrought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In penance for such great damage, a leaving was sentenced: far from the lush plains and rolling hills of the Old Kingdom and high into the harsh, dry mountains, into the ancestral sanctuaries, the survivors would recede. There would be sought truer, stouter ways, leaving the scarred lands below, forbidden thenceforth, to heal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
