			<description>On the Road to Rome 1944: SANTA MARIA INFANTE: A brand new take on the struggle along the ridge ... along the road to Rome. The Germans are dug in, the Americans well-armed ... the outcome is in YOUR hands. The battle for Santa Maria Infante was important in the opening of the Allied offensive toward Rome on 11 May 1944. Strong Allied forces were concentrated on the west side of the Italian peninsula to renew an effort stopped by the winter and heavy German resistance. Eighth Army was poised for attack through the Liri Valley along the axis of Highway No. 6; main Fifth Army faced a chain of mountains, in a 13-mile zone from the Liri River to the sea. The forces in the Anzio Beachhead were ready to strike when their opportunity came as a result of progress on the other fronts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the ATS CORE MODULES, all new for 2014.
