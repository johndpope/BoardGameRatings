			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably one of the first simulators not about a plane. This is a game where the player must drive a lorry. He must ferry loads from A to B and has the option to choose between several types of trucks, from the smaller 24ft truck, hauling 6 tons, to trucks twice that large that can transport up to 15 tons. This means less trips so easier to meet the deadline. However, these big beasts are a lot harder to drive and hitting the pavement (for instance) will lead to damage that'll be deducted from the driver's score in the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
