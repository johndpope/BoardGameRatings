			<description>A One-Round Tournament&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asenka Elizaveta Rashenkov had been married less than a year when her husband, Mikial was found drowned in the lake on his family&amp;rsquo;s country estate. Mikial had gone out that morning to fish, and since he usually took a picnic lunch with him on these trips and made a day of it, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t missed until the family gathered for dinner that evening. His fishing trips were a habit retained from his childhood, and he preferred to go alone, claiming it helped him think. Most of the family and servants knew his favorite spots, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to find him, floating face down in the shallows, under the old willow tree that he and his brothers and sister had climbed as children. There were no witnesses, but it seemed clear that he had gotten tangled in his line, slipped and fallen into the water from his boat, which was found floating in the center of the lake. His picnic lunch, still packed in its basket, lay untouched at the bottom of the boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
