							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Megadungeon Delver&#039;s Player Options</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Megadungeon Delver&amp;rsquo;s Player Options, a short, free pdf designed to give players in megadungeon campaigns (games set entirely or primarily in vast dungeons or similar complexes of barrows, catacombs, caves, chambers, corridors, graves, mazes, pits, prisons, sepulchers, shrines, tombs, traps, and nasty subterranean lairs) extra options specifically designed for dungeon-delving. Because let&amp;rsquo;s face it, while it&amp;rsquo;s great that a game that began life primarily focused on labyrinths and lizards has expanded to be able to handle games built around political intrigue, piracy on the high seas, or nation-building, sometimes GM and players both just want to kick in the next door and see what orc needs to be killed to claim a pie. (And realistically if a 27-level dungeon the size of a small city does exist in a campaign, people are going to devise tactics specifically designed for fighting and surviving within it!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While these abilities are written up as feats, they would also work well as talents (and similar class options, such as rage powers or magus arcana) or special powers granted in place of normal class abilities by dungeon delving archetypes created by a GM for megadungeon-heavy campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feats included are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Caged Fury: A creature of the vast steppes and wide open spaces, you are particularly frenetic when forced to do battle underground or in enclosed spaces, and you want to get things away from you!&lt;br/&gt;    Corridor Combatant: You are a master at running partway up walls, bouncing off the ceiling, and generally making indoor terrain work for you.&lt;br/&gt;    Delver's Saga: You have mastered the art of the dungeon-delving story.&lt;br/&gt;    Doorkicker (Combat): You are a master of kicking in doors, smashing idols, and generally wrecking destruction on construction.&lt;br/&gt;    Dungeon Stalker: You are skilled in reading tracks left in the dust and stone of old tombs.&lt;br/&gt;    Earth Dragon: When surrounded by enough rock, you can call on the mystic powers of the earth.&lt;br/&gt;    Herald of Justice: Your presence helps others deal with the difficulties of carrying the cause of justice into hostile regions.&lt;br/&gt;    Mole Master: You can summon creatures adapted to the dark, earthen places below the surface.&lt;br/&gt;    Room Sweeper: In your capacity as a hunter of fugitives and monsters lurking in the corners of civilization, you have been trained to enter a room and immediately assess it for threats.&lt;br/&gt;    Shrine Keeper: You are often cut off from your place of worship, and have learned to make any structure double as a temple.&lt;br/&gt;    Spread Spell [Metamagic]: You have learned to spread your spells around corners.&lt;br/&gt;    Trap Master: You don&amp;rsquo;t just disable traps, you become their keeper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
