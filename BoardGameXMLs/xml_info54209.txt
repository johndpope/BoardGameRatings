			<description>MagiFlux is a card game for 2-4 players. The inspiration for this game came from Fluxx and Magic:The Gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the game is to be the first to have cards in play that have a total of 10 Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each turn, a player takes the top card from his own library, and untaps all resources. During each turn, a player may play 1 card face down as a resource. Resources and cards played remain in play.To play a card, pay by tapping the number of resources equal to its cost. Each card's cost is also worth the same amount of Victory Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player may activate the abilities on his cards in play. Ability costs must be paid or triggered before the ability is resolved. Costs are usually related to player's own cards. A player is out of the game if he has no cards in his library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
