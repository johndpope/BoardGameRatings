							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flying Saucer Blues</name>
									
			<description>This is a playset for Fiasco and a copy of that game is necessary for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying Saucer Blues is a balanced blend of two things: flying saucer based aliens and stupidity. On the one hand, there are the aloof aliens who held the world in their hands in all those late night flicks and on the other are all the mean and shortsighted problems that we have no reason to believe are native to our world alone. We peel back the Saucer's aluminum siding to show you what humanity was never meant to see: the real reason why the invasions always fail (it ain't human ingenuity), why redneck colons and eviscerated cattle hold such fascination for supposedly superior intelligences, and what happens when the Saucer fails to land on the White House lawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three things that set this apart from the vast majority of Fiasco playsets; and if you have a problem with any of them you may want to swap to a more conventional playset filled with lust, understatement, and humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)  We keep things family friendly and generally G rated (an honest G rating, not an Andromeda Strain what-was-the-board-thinking sort of G). In case you didn't notice, most Fiasco playsets are solidly in the R to hard PG range, making them unsuitable for parent/kid groups and some new groups still trying to get comfortable with each other. Having said that, the playset is G but your group's imagina- tions may not be. Your game, your call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2)  One of the most common pieces of advice for playset developers is to tone it down, that too many extreme options on the tables will lead to an overly intense mush of a game. We ignored all that advice from people smarter than ourselves; this is an absolutely gonzo, over the top, ice cream for dinner experience where each and every one of your choices should be ripe enough with possibilities to fill the Saucer with problems. Go big or go back to Omicron Persei 8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3)  No one is going to be playing humans. You are going to have to make challenging characters work; how do you play a computer with an addiction to 1970s TV, a cardcarrying robo unionist, a creature that lives as much in the future as the past, or perhaps the Saucer itself? That is for you to figure out but our suggestion is: with gusto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power up your viewscope and try to remember where you left the Annihilator Beam;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is going to be a Fiasco!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
