			<description>All will be reduced to cinder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have winessed the birth of Metamorphosis and the revival of the C.O.R.E., but now, from of the flaring sands of the east, the blazing subterranean dwellings of the Dragyri, and even the very sky above, new threats rise to challange the factions of Samaria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Age Conflagration is the newest expansion  book for the Dark Age Miniature game line. Conflagration contains 140 full color and beautifully illustrated pages nestled in a hardcover binding. Inside readers will find generic forcelist additions to all of the factions  as well as the forcelist of the new Kukulkani, Ancient warriors imbued with alien technology hell bent on sacrificing every living thing they come across for their alien masters. The Dragyri Sub-Faction of the Fire Caste, unlike their Air and Ice Cousins the Fire Caste use alien technology and what can be deemed dishonorable methods. The new Outcast Sub-Faction of the Slavers of Chains Barrow, these ruthless Outcasts capture and enslave those they come across without mercy or morals to fight for their amusement or greater gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All contents have been writen to work in conjunction with the new 2013 Core Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
