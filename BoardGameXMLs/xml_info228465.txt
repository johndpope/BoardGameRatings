							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Diving Room</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a full-color, 48 x 20 Inch Battlemap of a Diving Room , with Hex, Square and No Overlays. The Zip file contains the VTT (Virtual Table Top Images for online play).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is this green ooze doing on my rig? It&amp;rsquo;s spreading all over the diving room! We gotta get those pilots out of there and seal that bulkhead to prevent the spread!! Damn those eggheads&amp;rsquo; curiosity! &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;Rig Pilot Eddie Briggs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diving Room includes two small maps of an interior diving room in a mobile exploration rig for exploring underwater areas. One map version has an empty center pit while the other map version has the center pit flooded with green water with algae or plants floating on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diving Room is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction games. It could also be a high tech facility in a modern game. The room with the green goo could also be a radioactive sludge in a post-apocalyptic game. Imagine a fight along the walkways surrounding the pit with knockdowns into the pit having crippling or deadly consequences. The map can also be of use in horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map can also be used as a SciFi sewer map. The green goo represents sewage with it purged in the empty center pit map version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Came From Beneath the Ocean! A group of marine biologists are using a new mobile exploration rig to move along the surface of the ocean. The lowest level of the rig has a diving room with a center pool that is used to dive into the ocean. The diving room can be filled with waterproof drones with cameras, small submersibles with manipulator arms, diving gear, cables for attaching to vehicles or diving suits, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During an exploration of a deep ocean trench with their submersible, the submersible pilots find strange green goo on the bottom of the ocean. The scientists direct the pilots to use their submarine&amp;rsquo;s manipulator arms to gather samples of the ooze before returning to the surface. However, after entering the diving room to return to the ship, the submersible is quickly overrun by the rapidly growing green goo that seems to have clung to its hull while getting a sample for the scientists and it quickly expands all over the diving room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the rest of the ship&amp;rsquo;s crew is in a bind as the submersible pilots are now sealed in their submarines and quickly running out of oxygen. The crew needs to figure out how to stop the spread of the green goo and somehow get the submersible pilots out of their vehicles before it is too late&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
