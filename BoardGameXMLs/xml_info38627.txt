			<description>&amp;ldquo;The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) began when the King of Spain died without an heir. King Louis XIV of France and Emperor Leopold I of Austrian both claimed the throne, and Spain's territory. England and the Netherlands sided with Austria, while Bavaria joined the French . . . At the start of the war the French army had a reputation as the best in Europe. At the battle of Blenheim (1704), also spelled &amp;lsquo;Blindheim,&amp;rsquo; the Duke of Marlborough soundly defeated the French, puncturing the myth of French invincibility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order of battle for each army (Confederate and Franco-Bavarian) is broken down according to the position of the units on the battlefield: the left wing, right wing, or center. Each wing has one or more commanders, and each army has an overall commander. A few terrain features must be marked on the game table &amp;ndash; namely two fortified towns and a stream which bisects the battlefield between the two armies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
