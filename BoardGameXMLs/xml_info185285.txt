							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dear Mr. Hadley (the Doll Game)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dear Mr. Hadley,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I trust that you received the package I sent ahead. I am loath to part with the amulet, but you need it far more than I. As for the Doll Game, it is far too dangerous to be performed, under the best of circumstances - but as I am bound to our agreement, I have disclosed the Game in its entirety as per our prior arrangement. Until now, only myself and Ms. Wells carried knowledge of this Game, and then I alone. It was entrusted to us by Madame Charron, who claimed it to have been written in the Black Book. It is my hope that you never have need to use it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
