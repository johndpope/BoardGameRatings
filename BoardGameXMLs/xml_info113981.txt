			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Renaissance system forms the rules bedrock of Cakebread &amp;amp; Walton&amp;rsquo;s historical fantasy role-playing game, Clockwork &amp; Chivalry (2nd Edition), published by Cubicle 7 Entertainment and available from all good game stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Renaissance system is a new D100 system based on Newt Newport&amp;rsquo;s OpenQuest, and is designed for historical and fantasy gaming in the age of black powder weapons. Released under an Open Gaming License, which allows companies and individuals to incorporate the rules into their own games, it features familiar mechanics, grim and gritty combat, extensive period weapons and equipment lists, dozens of professions, and rules for factions and belief systems. It also includes two magick systems &amp;ndash; the powerful battle alchemy first introduced in Clockwork &amp; Chivalry 1st Edition, and a streamlined and expanded version of the witchcraft rules from the Silver Oggie Award-winning supplement Divers &amp; Sundry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
