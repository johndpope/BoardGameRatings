			<description>The game comes with two 11x17&amp;quot; map, 280 counters, rules. The map scale is about 1.5 miles per hex. Each combat unit is one platoon to battalion. Turns are 8 hrs. The game simulates the opening few days of the dramatic Egyptian assault across the Suez Canal in October, 1973. The game includes an air game system, a ground system and unique rules where command and control are critical for movement purposes. Use of SAM missiles and SAGGER AT play important roles to keep the Israeli at bay. At first, it appears as a &amp;quot;David vs Goliath&amp;quot; battle because of the disparity of forces. The Egyptian needs to create breaches and bridging and move quickly before the balance favors the Israeli. Time is not a friend to either side at various times in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
