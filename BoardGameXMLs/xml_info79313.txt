			<description>&amp;quot;Boppin' is a puzzle game developed by Accursed Toys  (Jennifer Diane Reitz and Stephen Lepisto), originally published for the Amiga by KarmaSoft. The Amiga version only sold 284 copies, according to the developers, and so it was ported to DOS  and released as shareware, published by Apogee Software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary differences between the Amiga and DOS versions are that the graphics of the Amiga version only had 32 colours compared to the 256 colours of the DOS version, the Amiga version had different music and sound (considered by Accursed Toys to be superior to the DOS version), and the DOS version had a different plot to make way for an increased number of levels. The plot below is from the DOS version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Levels are made up of blocks, elevators, refractors, prizes and two starting points. The game involves throwing blocks picked up from the starting point (one for each player in two-player games, only one is used in one-player) at blocks of the same type which are already in the levels. The blocks are thrown at 45 degree angles, and can be bounced off refractors placed in strategic parts of the levels. The blocks already in the level can be pushed around, and of course the prizes can be collected.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Boppin' , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
