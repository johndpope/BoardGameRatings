It's part of a bigger nation, or it once was, but those old power structures are mostly forgotten. Local corporate overlords rule the day and violent gangsters rule the night. The police are an army that serves both of those masters, depending on the neighborhood and the night and the sack of cash. The working people of Nowhere City pray that they can live their lives in peace and anonymity, without attracting the attention of the city's masters' or worse. Behind the bald-faced municipal graft and the corporate corruption, even worse things lurk. Factions battle each other in the never-ending underground occult war that some call &amp;quot;The Shadow Conflict.&amp;rdquo; Sorcerer cults have turned their back on what&amp;rsquo;s left of civilization in order to serve the extra-dimensional Veiled Ones. Cadres of Gutter Knights are dedicated to exterminating those cultists at any cost. And the slick, unscrupulous Free Agents will go anywhere, kill anyone, take anything... for a price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventures in Nowhere City might involve:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Gutter Knights destroying a coven of Sorcerers.&lt;br/&gt;    Free Agents stealing an arcane relic from a corporate headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;    The power-mad Sorcerers stealing spells from rival cults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Nowhere City Nights?&lt;br/&gt;Nowhere City Nights is a roleplaying game based on the core rules in the Dungeon Crawl Classics Roleplaying Game.
