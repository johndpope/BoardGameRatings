			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A puzzle game based on the four colours theorem (any surface divided in any number of rectangles can be painted by only four colours without two adjacent rectangles being of the same colour). There are 3 game modes: free (the player has limited colours but can choose the rectangle to paint), imposed (the computer chooses which rectangle to paint), and match, either against a human opponent or the computer. In this mode each player has a different set of paints and the goal is to prevent your opponent from using her colours while emptying your pots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
