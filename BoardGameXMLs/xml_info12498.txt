							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Plaza!</name>
									
			<description>This game is themed on The Country Club Plaza, or simply &amp;quot;The Plaza&amp;quot;, an upscale shopping district in Kansas City, Missouri. I'm not certain where to begin describing this one, so let me give an overview and a look at the components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is styled after the traditional Monopoly board as a square with properties down each of the sides and special areas on the corners--in this case the corners are *J.C. Nichols Parkway* Start &amp;gt;, Tax Audit &amp;laquo;Pay&amp;raquo;, &amp;deg;Stock Market: Collect&amp;deg;, and *Uninsurable Loss*.  Unlike the traditional Monopoly board, there are no squares that are not properties (e.g. no Chance, Community Chest) Additionally, the properties are not grouped in colors.  All of the properties are representative of Plaza businesses at the time of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six player pieces are small, colored, enameled, metal, horse-drawn carriages, like the type that they use for carriage rides down on The Plaza.  Additionally, there is money in denominations of $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000.  There is a spinner with the numbers 1,000 to 12,000.  There is also a deck of action cards with various things like &amp;quot;Option to buy  - spin dial, pay  amount on dial&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Stock Market Falls - Pay $10,000 to bank, don't move, resume play&amp;quot;, and the enigmatic &amp;quot;Two Spaces&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and that's it; no instructions, no dice, no property deeds or property values.  I'm stumped as to whether this was actually a game, or if this was a game prototype that never made it to fruition.  The cardboard insert inside the box has no markings on it, there is nothing on the inside of the lid, and the box itself is completely blank and made to look like a nice leather briefcase (albeit made of cardboard) and has no information on it, not even the game's name--the name only appears on the board. If anyone knows anything about this game, please add information because I'm at a loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE 09-07-2015: Instructions under &amp;quot;More Information.&amp;quot; -- ActorDi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
