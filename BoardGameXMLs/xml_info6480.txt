			<description>A unique mixture of checkers and wargame theming.  Single checkers are &amp;quot;platoons&amp;quot;; double checkers are &amp;quot;battalions&amp;quot;.  Platoons can only move counter-clockwise around the board and only on the outside track.  Battalions can move in either direction and can use the bridges to move to and from the inner track.  A platoon becomes a battalion by reaching enemy territory and surviving for a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement is handled by rolling two dice that generate a number from 2 - 3.  Yes, that's right, one of the dice is nothing but 1's, and the other is 50/50 split between 1's and 2's.  No, I have no idea why they bothered with the first die.  Maybe they thought it would be less confusing than saying &amp;quot;roll the die and add 1&amp;quot;.  Yes, having a die that is 50/50 2's and 3's would have made the most sense, but maybe they bought these on clearance somewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capturing happens just like checkers, though you do not have to jump if you do not want to.  Captured pieces are kept in the POW camps (for theme).  Safety zones provide spots where pieces can not be captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
