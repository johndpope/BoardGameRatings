			<description>EverQuest: Depths of Darkhollow (DoD) is the tenth expansion pack released for EverQuest, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). It features monster missions, spirit shrouds, evolving items, new missions, new creatures, new zones, new items and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While certain aspects of this expansion can be enjoyed by characters of all levels, the new zones and missions are intended primarily for characters of level 45 and higher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster missions: These will allow players to take missions, but playing as a high end monster instead of a player character. For example, a player might assume the role of 'Lord Nagafen' and repel a raid of NPCs who have come to slay the dragon lord for his rare treasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirit shrouds: These will allow anyone to take the form of a monster of lower or equal level, to hunt with their lower level friends in any zone. For example a player with a level 70 character could take on the form of a level 15 spider to hunt with their friends of the same level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolving items: New types of items will be introduced in which, while equipped, will gain their own experience points and increase in level for better stats and function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;EverQuest: Depths of Darkhollow&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
