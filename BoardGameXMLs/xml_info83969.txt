							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Cheese</name>
									
			<description>The cheese is 12 inches high, 8 inches across and 9 inches thick at the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box; 'A Giant Slice of fun. Manoeuvre your marbles up the 'Cheese' mountain. It takes skill to be the first'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It looks like the marbles are pulled up the cheese mountain using a harness attached to the top of the cheese - pulled by strings at the bottom sides. I've only seen this game in a toy museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets four marbles and a mouse. A marble is put onto the mouse and then you have to carry that marble to the top, using a cord that acts as a lever and pulley. If you drop the marble, then you must go back to the base of the cheese and try again on your next turn. The first player to get 4 marbles to the top, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
