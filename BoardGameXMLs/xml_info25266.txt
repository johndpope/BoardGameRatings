							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armageddon</name>
									
			<description>The game &amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; was included in Spielbox 3/83 as part of the &amp;quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&amp;quot; series. The introduction refers to Armageddon: Das strategische Fantasyspiel, because the Spielbox game plays in the same fantasy world, &amp;quot;Magira&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armageddon has rules for a simplified game as well as for an advanced game. Both versions are played on a 17&amp;times;20 hex board showing Magira with 1 fortification in the middle and 2 on the sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The easier version is played with 12 axe men, 12 pikemen and 12 swordsmen only. Object of the game is to capture the fortress in the middle of the board. All types of warriors have the same movement factor. Combats are decided by the throw of 1 die, but several bonus point are added to the throw. One of them is a kind of Rock-Scissors-Paper effect, because an axeman fighting a pikeman, a pikeman against a swordsman and a swordsman against an axeman gets 1 bonus point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advanced version adds several new units (archers, horsemen, veterans, horses), enables ranged attacks, combat support possibilities and faster movements. The victory condition stays the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a variation, where a siege of a fortress is simulated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
