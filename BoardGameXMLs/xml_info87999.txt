							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Organizations of the Underdark</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Web Enhancement for the Forgotten Realms Underdark Accessory&lt;br/&gt; In the Underdark, countless organizations and individuals strive for goals ranging from survival to supremacy. The affiliations these creatures form are based on a variety of factors, including race, geography, and local customs. Grimlocks, suspicious of all other races, tend to operate in closely allied packs. A community of drow, on the other hand, has many different factions based on House and status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few groups look beyond their myopic worldview to see the Underdark as a whole. Three organizations that are exceptions to this rule are described below. All three count many different races and cultures among their members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though written with the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting in mind, these organizations could fit well into a regular D&amp;amp;D campaign with only minor modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
