							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Will of the Diseased</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a WFRP 3 scenario for characters in their 1st rank. It is intentionally short, allowing for convention play within a restricted time slot, but it is flexible enough to incorporate into larger campaigns as a minor sidequest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario rotates around sickness, suffering and Nurgle's joy of spreading diseases. It is set in the small town of Br&amp;ouml;ckel (on the travel and trading route between Altdorf and Middenheim) and the nearby forest, but it can easily be relocated to almost any other place. The town has a small,&lt;br/&gt;bedraggled Shallyan hospice, but sits on a trade route and is hosting an annual feast for the merchants who are vital for Br&amp;ouml;ckel's (rather modest) prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ill noble, Ferdinand von Ziegelstein, asks the PCs to bring an old friend who's a physician. Searching for him, the PCs discover he has been assaulted and kidnapped by orcs. While they are looking for him, disease is starting to spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Will of the Diseased was created for the WFRP3 scenario contest 2012, organized by Jay Hafner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
