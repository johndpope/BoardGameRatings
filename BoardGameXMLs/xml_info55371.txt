			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The warble of phaser fire filled the empty corridors. Through the heaby smoke figures moved, closer now, almost within range. Lieutenant O'Shanter crouched lower behind a blasted bulkhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Funny... I don't feel like a mutineer.'&lt;br/&gt;The gauge on his phaser showed the charge was almost gone. Maybe there was still time... if only he could talk to them, reason with them...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From behind him cam a low throaty growl - a sound no Human voice could ever make. Turning slowly, Tam found himself face to face with the pale yellow eyes of Commander Brr'ynn. The Caitian's weapon never wavered as she licked her lips in anticipation.&lt;br/&gt;'You tried to kill my captain...'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Tam time had just run out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
