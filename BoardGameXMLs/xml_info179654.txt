			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fortified ridge. Its bosky slopes are topped with archaic forts raised from the rubble of a wall long ago fallen, all now retaken as final bastions by a people in flight. Camps below grow as folk stream in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condensed to one page for slipping in among other materials, this sandbox-oriented content is intended as an easily absorbed framework for improvisation to be adapted by the user as preferred for a wider setting and specific system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It presents core ideas and key numbers to fall back on, with general approaches that can be applied in other situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content covers map generation on the fly for an abstracted ridge as well as suggestions for aspects of the locality, including departees, possessions, activities, fort structure and a destructive residue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forts and their drains could be simplified or extended using elements from Landscape: The Manse and maybe one or more of the maps also in the Location, Landscape &amp;amp; World bundle, most obviously The Noxious Ponds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
