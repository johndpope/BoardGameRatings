			<description>In Will Rock, the player takes on the persona of the title character Willford Rockwell, an archeology student, who is faced with the aftermath of a fanatical group called the Olympian Restoration Army (ORA), who somehow have managed to bring back to life a host of mythological creatures from Ancient Greece, including Zeus, king of the Gods, who has abducted Will's girlfriend Emma. Will is recruited by Prometheus, the Greek Titan of fire and craft, to destroy Zeus and his minions&amp;mdash;and rescue his girlfriend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are ten levels in the single player and coop versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Will Rock&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
