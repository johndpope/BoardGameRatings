			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dim the lights.... take a seat..... and prepare to challenge yourself in front of the scope of the most complete and most authentic Air Traffic Control simulator you'll ever experience on your PC with ATC Simulator. It's Air Traffic Control simulation made real!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's right! This is it! Your chance to experience the high-stress world of being an Air Traffic Controller with ATC Simulator!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATC Simulator puts you to work inside the TRACON - at over 48 U.S. TRACONs - and in front of a real radarscope as the departure or approach controller. You are the controller and it's your job to safely sequence the aircraft, carrying thousands of passengers, for arrivals and departures in your busy airspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the uninitiated, they're all just blips on the screen, but to the seasoned Air Traffic Controller, which is what you'll become, it's a challenging 3 dimensional puzzle solved by coolly and calmly, sequencing, vectoring and stepping 'em down to create that &amp;quot;string of pearls&amp;quot; that has them lined up on final and ready to be handed over to the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sounds easy? Well think again! All you need is 1 minute delay anywhere in the system or some bad weather and you're then going to have to stack them up in a holding pattern and then pick them off one at a time for landing when a slot becomes available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATC Simulator is a ground-breaking product! There's nothing like it! So you've always been fascinated with the world of Air Traffic Control, this is your chance, right now, to experience that world for yourself as you now take the seat in front of the scope. You're about to learn, first hand, why Air Traffic Control has the reputation of being the most stressful job anyone could ever undertake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product will give you thousands upon thousands of hours of entertaiment and edutaiment. It's highly addictive and one of those products that will always have you torn between going to bed or just having one more go at it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
