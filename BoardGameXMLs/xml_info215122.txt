							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Colossus of the Shattered Moon</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In what became known as the Age of Madness, an astral lich  calling himself the Crimson Hand descended from the sea of stars, setting his fell gaze upon Gaea. Her red moon he made both his temple and his phylactery, and from there he sought to enslave those who would be ruled and devour those who would not. The Ancients of the four corners of Gaea united their knowledge against this threat, constructing a colossal golem, and inscribing the four POWER WORDS upon four scrolls. These scrolls they fed to the colossus, who ascended to the crimson moon in an instant. The sages of the realm watched as the flashes of battle signaled in the night sky, ending as the crimson moon itself split in half. The lich and the colossus were destroyed, and the Age of Madness was ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millennia have passed, and now a new threat rises from the  netherworld. The four POWER WORDS have been forgotten, lost among the shattered remnants of the moon. The sages have once again united what remains of their power, this time to teleport a paltry handful of crusaders to retrieve the lost scrolls before the world is doomed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
