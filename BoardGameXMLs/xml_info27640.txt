			<description>Licensed Traveller Game. This stand-alone game is a miniatures wargame, a board game, and also a supplemental combat system for use with the various Traveller Roleplaying Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the BITS Website (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.bits.org.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.bits.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br/&gt;At Close Quarters &lt;br/&gt;ACQ has a tactical system that emphasizes the action and reaction process of real combat. Cautious combatants with fast reactions who use all their available cover will out-live reckless gun-slinger types! ACQ adds excitement to critical combat situations within your Traveller game, and is also excellent for ground skirmishes and starship boarding actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive rules are included for ranged combat (from aimed shots to suppression fire), melee combat, movement, action/reaction situations, types of cover (and how to reach it quickly), damage effects and healing, zero-G combat and much more. It includes extensive weapons lists and a quick-reference booklet for all the key tables, tasks and actions. And Penguins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ISBN 1-901228-13-4, 48 pages, A5 format, written by Doug Berry &amp;amp; James Lindsay. &amp;copy; 2000. No Penguins were harmed in the creation of ACQ, but it is the Traveller book that introduced them to the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
