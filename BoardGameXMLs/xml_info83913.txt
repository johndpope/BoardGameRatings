			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Description&lt;br/&gt;Cannon Cadets, the physics game from the people that brought you #1 hits Little Metal Ball and Marine Sharpshooter! 80 beautifully illustrated levels, addictive gameplay and lots of re-playability are just a few reasons why Cannon Cadets is the new must have game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cannon Cadets Story&lt;br/&gt;Not that long ago, in a galaxy not really very far away, a group of heartless scientists, driven by greed and a desire for power, carried out unrelenting experiments on a little monkey named Gordo. Each experiment chipped away at Gordo&amp;rsquo;s friendly demeanor, leaving him hardened and bitter. In a high-risk experiment to test a new type of rocket booster, Gordo was blasted into space. The rocket misfired and crashed on a nearby planet where both the experiment and Gordo were abandoned and soon forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gordo&amp;rsquo;s despair and anger became all encompassing and the beauty and happiness of the world around him only fueled his rage. Using everything he learned as a science experiment, he built an army of robots with the goal of making the rest of the world as miserable as he was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gordo now travels the galaxy, rounding up those most joyous and happy, trapping them in cages and leaving them behind, guarded by his robot minions. But one happy little boy has escaped Gordo&amp;rsquo;s grasp. Armed with a rocket and fueled by fun, the little RocketBoy is building an elite force called the Cannon Cadets. You must help RocketBoy free his friends so they can restore fun to the Galaxy and show Gordo how to have fun again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
