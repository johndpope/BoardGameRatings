			<description>Honorable Mention, 2015 Golden Cobra Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Golden Cobra website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guilherme Rodrigues has created a compelling game from an autistic perspective about the experience of finding and holding to one&amp;rsquo;s soul in an overstimulating world. Adding a spiritual layer, players are clay golems trying to find their sacred words while limited in communication. Attempts to help one another also come with risk of harm. At the heart of the game is a beautiful mechanic in which players phase in and out of ability to act depending on circumstances outside their control. In Singing Clay, Rodrigues defies more neurotypical forms of character embodiment by representing each character&amp;rsquo;s identity in a pattern rather than a set of facts or histories. We loved this game because of how the challenges arise primarily from an internal process of trying to hold on to the language of one&amp;rsquo;s own song amid external distractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
