			<description>Blue Chip (also published as Dow Jones) is a very simplistic stock market game with an interesting twist (sliding pegboards).  There are 12 companies divided into Industrials (such as GM), Railroads (such as Union Pacific), and Utilities (such as AT&amp;amp;T).  There are four of each type, and each type has a peg board of a different primary color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you may take one and only one action.  An action is either buying or selling stock in one company.  (You don't have to sell all when you sell.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you buy stock in a company, you move its individual peg up one, two or three spaces depending on how many shares you buy.  Likewise when you sell: you move the stock price down one, two, or three spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each action, draw a card and see what happens.  Many of the cards refer to the stock just transacted: a split, or all players holding the stock collect a dividend, or are assessed a fine, or the company goes bankrupt, etc.  (Yes, it's as fierce as the dot.coms a few years ago: five of the twelve companies will be bankrupt by the game's end!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other cards are general and refer to the whole board.  Sometimes you roll dice which affect all industrials or railroads or utilities.  In that case, you slide the whole peg board for that particular color up or down as necessary.  There are dice in three colors with sides of +2, +4, +6, -2, -4, -6 on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
