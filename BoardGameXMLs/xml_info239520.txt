							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legend of Zelda: Clockwork Realm â€“ Shards of the Triforce Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The second expansion for The Legends of Zelda: Clockwork Realm - Shards of the Triforce - completes the 3-phase structure of the game by adding a new Boss Phase to the end of each level.  Whereas previously the heroes were considered successful in a dungeon just by reaching the Boss Room, they must now instead face a fearsome boss monster in order to acquire the Triforce Shards they need to defeat Ganon.  And the ultimate challenge just got harder with the addition of Ganon himself as the final boss the heroes must face in order to win the campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players still use all the resources they have gathered throughout the rest of their adventures - Skills, Items and Treasures - but this time they will have to put them to use manipulating the Boss Action cards that determine how the heroes and boss attack each other.  Boss Action cards come in three types: Strike, Evade and Expose, and it is only by selecting the correct cards each round - maximising the damage to the boss and minimising the damage to the heroes - that will allow the heroes to be triumphant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
