			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This title contains five fully-stat'ed monsters for the BASH superhero roleplaying game that Game Masters can use individually or in conjunction with one another as villains! It is fully illustrated with custom images by game industry artist William T. Thrasher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Krampus is Saint Nicholas&amp;rsquo; evil opposite-number and, where Santa rewards good children with presents, his nemsis presents bad ones with lumps of coal, beats them with birch switches, throws them in chains, and drags them off to the underworld. Krampus is depicted as large and bestial, with horns and fangs that enhance his devilish aspect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the boss monster himself, this publication contains four sorts of minions to help him achieve his ends, including Evilized Orphanage Officials (EOOs), an Evil Utility-Grade Turkey, Krampminions, and the Hellcart of Krampus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These monsters originally appeared in the bestselling Skirmisher Publishing adventure “Krampusnacht: Night of the Krampus” and are provided here on their own with the addition of illustrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
