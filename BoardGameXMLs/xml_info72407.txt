			<description>From the bottom of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It's bulls vs the bears!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stock Market is a vibrant and exciting place where fortunes are won and lost.  This real life game helps you in understanding stock trading and could help you in making big money, one day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invest in Blue chips like Asian Paints, I.T.C., Grasim, Tisco, Reliance and Blow Past.  Buy when low and sell when high and you could end up becoming one of the stars in the ring!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything is in English, but this is a game either for Indians or made in India.  The currency of the stock market is rupees, and it's drawn from the Bank of Dalal Street.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
