They are not eliminated, and you may take any Equipment from their hand.&lt;br/&gt;     Helicopter (4+): Place this card face-up in front of another player. That player may view two Integrity cards when investigating. This card is discarded if the player takes any action other than Investigate on their turn.&lt;br/&gt;     Partner's Gun (4+): Use when a player holding a gun is shot. Take that player's gun without revealing an Integrity card.

At the beginning of their next turn, they must shoot a gun held by any player. The gun is dropped and Remote Trigger is discarded.

The wounded player may immediately take the Arm action.&lt;br/&gt;     Scope (4+): Investigate all players being targeted by a gun&lt;br/&gt;     Tear Gas (6+): Choose three players.
