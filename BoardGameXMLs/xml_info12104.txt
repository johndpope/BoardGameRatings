			<description>The game is played in two phases: the Primary and the General Election. In the Primary a player scores five points every time one&amp;rsquo;s pawn passes the National Recognition space; ten points by landing on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player reaches a target number of votes (the number varies with the number of players), the player moves onto the General Election phase. A player wins a state&amp;rsquo;s votes by landing on the space that represents that state. A player must forfeit a state to another player when landing on a state one already owns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score a plurality of Electoral Votes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
