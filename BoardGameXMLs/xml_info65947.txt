			<description>French board game published during the 1970's. In this game the players play an impresario who has to manage singer artists to the top of the billboard charts. Each player has to promote his star by using mediums such as radio, tv or by releasing a record or promoting them in the music scene. To do this the players can use promotion cards. The winner is the first player who can place 15 star discs on his palmares sheet. The game comes with images of real artists on the artist cards. These include the French singers from the 1960's-'70s era Johnny Halliday, Alain Barri&amp;egrave;re (who performed at the Eurovision song contest once), Thierry Le Luron, Michel Sardou &amp;amp; Marie Laforet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
