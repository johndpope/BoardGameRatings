			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dazzled to Death is a murder mystery game for 12 to 15 guests and a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 1948. The socialite Evington-Browne family (&amp;quot;E-B&amp;quot; to their friends) and guests are preparing for their annual cocktail party, held by tradition at the family's hunting lodge in the White Mountains north of Boston. A fierce storm has now set in, and the party finds itself cut off from the rest of the world. This is unfortunate, as the valet of one of the guests has been found dead in the kitchen! It looks like a heart attack - but is it murder? Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive Dazzled to Death? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dazzled to Death you will discover the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Who has been wearing a mask to sneak around? &lt;br/&gt;    Who will inherit the Dazzling Diamonds? &lt;br/&gt;    Would the infamous cat-burglar 'the Puma' dare to strike here? &lt;br/&gt;    Are the Evington-Browne family in danger of losing their money, their reputation in society and their sanity? &lt;br/&gt;    Can anyone keep control of Tracy's pet monkey? &lt;br/&gt;    ...and, of course, who killed the valet? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out in Dazzled to Death!&lt;br/&gt; Dazzled to Death&lt;br/&gt;In Dazzled to Death, the stage is set for an innocent family gathering, with a few friends and strangers added to make the party go with a swing. However, not everyone is as they seem - some have dark secrets they need to keep hidden... and someone is the killer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dazzled to Death lasts for three to four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (78 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
