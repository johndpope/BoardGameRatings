							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deep Shadows</name>
									
			<description>Adventure background:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is an extension of early Traveller adventures that included &amp;quot;Shadows&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Research Station Gamma&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Twilight's Peak&amp;quot;.  Familiarity with these adventures is unnecessary to run &amp;quot;Deep Shadows&amp;quot;. However, a copy of &amp;quot;Shadows&amp;quot;, last published in The Traveller Book (1982), could serve as a useful enhancement.  Both &amp;quot;Shadows&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Deep Shadows&amp;quot; involve exploration of ruins belonging to the same extinct race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this adventure is designed for Zhodani explorers in a coreward sector, its possible to alter the adventure for Imperial characters.  The Zhodani core expeditions are guided by Ancient map projectors that also depict events.  The referee could assume one showed the adventure setting where particular Imperials were also involved (the player characters).  The Zhodani will go to great lengths to transport the characters to the expedition corridor.  This is the same plot used in the adventure, &amp;quot;Vlezpridliashav,&amp;quot; from Alien Module 4 - Zhodani (1985).  The two adventures can be treated as the same except in perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only references required for play is the MegaTraveller rules set.  Other recommended references are the World Builder's Handbook, Referee's Companion, and most especially MegaTraveller Aliens Book Vol. 3, The Psionic Races: Zhodani and Droyne.  This last details the two races most actively used in this adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is available as a free download from the Traveller Downport website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
