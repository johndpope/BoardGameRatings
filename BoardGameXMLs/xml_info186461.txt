							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunt: The Unknown Quarry</name>
									
			<description>A bounty has been placed on the head of a monster terrorizing a small country town. Bounty hunters descend on the abandoned mansion where it is rumored to make its lair, each hoping to claim the prize. However, one of these hunters is actually the monster in disguise. One is forced to ask, then: who hunts whom?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hunt: The Unknown Quarry, from Darkest Night designer Jeremy Lennert, is a deductive combat game. One player is secretly the monster, and their goal is to cripple all of the other players in order to escape the mansion. The other players, the human bounty hunters, must discover and kill the monster before they are hunted down by the creature. Each player moves around the mansion's many rooms to search for clues, gather items, and target other players to deduce which of them is the monster (or, if you are the monster, to wound the other bounty hunters). Tread lightly, for the hunt has begun...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns moving about the mansion's many rooms, looking at cards for clues, and picking up items (cards) to add to their hand. Players can also interact when in the same room as another player and try to attack them using the cards in their hand in order to deduce who is the monster and what kind of monster they are. If you are the monster, then you want to do your best to avoid being killed and wound the other players in hopes to escape the mansion with your life. Play continues until either the monster is slain or all the other players declare that they have been crippled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
