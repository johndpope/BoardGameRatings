			<description>Think you&amp;rsquo;ve played all the shmups out there? We doubt it. In fact, MonkeyPaw would like to bring you some that have never seen our shores. Gaia Seed is one of them. A rare find and great play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;aia Seed comes from the fabulous line of Japanese shoot &amp;lsquo;em ups and has the classic parallax scrolling that you could count on from the games of this era. The soundtrack is considered a great score and will set an aura that will get you grooving to the Gaia Seed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who miss the days when the market supported a vast array of shooting splendor, GaiaSeed will satisfy you with its intensity and liquidity. One of the greatest shooters that never made it to Western markets, GaiaSeed is a smooth and silky display of algorhythmic perfection that always challenges but never frustrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GaiaSeed is a horizontally scrolling shooter from Techno Soleil. The game has solid control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system. With six stages, it&amp;rsquo;s not the longest game on the block, but the massively scaling 2D backgrounds and variable difficulty make up for that. Think you&amp;rsquo;ve got the skills to beat a Japanese import?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The technique and effects used will give shooter aficionados a work of art to go back to for multiple exposure. The soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood and is adds to the subliminal nature of the work. The effects and twists in the game will have you on your edge. Thoughtfully presented and wonderfully executed, GaiaSeed is a PSone gem. The game is very rare and can be found on online auction sites in the $150 range. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss this original Japanese hit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
