							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Militia &amp; Mercenaries</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Front and center! The complete range of basic human soldiery, from hard-bitten front-line warriors to abject and quivering draftees: in all, 105 complete characters pre-rolled by computer program and ready to play, as needed by Referee or new participant. Though the chracters may be used individually, they come formed up into squads, with designated leaders and seconds-in-command, and accompanied by 11 warhorses to speed things along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use them as needed or plot out an entire military campaign: reinforce a hill, seize a waterhole, rescue the Heir, raid a camp, fight your way into (or out of) a city in flames! The possibilities for decisive action on a grand scale are endless and fascinating!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are 11 officers, 11 warhorses, 10 militiamen, 22 foot archers of greater or lesser ability, and 43 foot mercenaries, also of two capability ranges: an entire column of troops at your command!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
