							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">D-Day Dice</name>
									
			<description>A finalist in the prestigious game design contest of Boulogne-Billancourt (France) and in the Canadian Board Game Design Contest of 2010, and nominated for a Golden Geek award on BoardGameGeek!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hit board game is now available on iPad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against a machine gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, he will roll dice to collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier. He will succeed... or die trying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D-Day Dice will get you right there on the beach. You will experience the fear of getting killed by enemy fire, the anguish of losing your men, and the thrill of surmounting seemingly impossible odds to accomplish your mission. This game can be played by anyone (you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be familiar with World War II) and has been enjoyed by families and wargamers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
