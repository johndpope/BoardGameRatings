			<description>MediEvil: Resurrection is a video game for the Sony PSP entertainment system. MediEvil Resurrection is a remake storywise to MediEvil (with a few alterations, such as the Anubis Stone sub-plot, which never appears in the original) but many things, such as level design and characters, have been changed drastically, and some levels have been removed altogether. Unlike in the original, there is no alternate ending. The game also features a variety of voice talent, including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper. It was released on September 1, 2005, in Europe and on September 13, 2005, in the United States. It was made available for download from the PlayStation Store in Europe on May 29, 2008, and in the United States on June 26, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;MediEvil: Resurrection&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
