			<description>&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://wiki.kingdoms.com/tiki-index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://wiki.kingdoms.com/tiki-index.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts the game as the leader of a small, undeveloped village, surrounded by undeveloped resource fields. Developing these fields increases their resource output.&lt;br/&gt;The village can be developed by constructing new buildings and upgrading existing ones; with Travian: Kingdoms you can now also make your village to a City, which increases the population of the village and offers higher building and resource levels.&lt;br/&gt;Training military units allows you to attack other villages or oases, plunder their resources, and defend from enemy attacks.&lt;br/&gt;Villages may trade their resources with other villages if both villages have a marketplace. The higher the level of your marketplace, the more merchants you will have and the more resources you can transport.&lt;br/&gt;You can choose to become King of your own kingdom, join another kingdom or to stay neutral. As neutral villages have no kingdom, they can be part of a foreign kingdom of another king. You expand your realm by founding new villages, or by conquering other players' villages.&lt;br/&gt;You can communicate to other players by using the in-game chat, and may join alliances or secret societies for military and economic co-operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
