			<description>Deduction Name Game is a party game aimed at guessing the secret names of other players. To start, each player will write down a secret name. Players should try to write a name not easily connected with themselves, as the goal is to use deduction skills to figure out the names each player has secretly written.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All written names will be placed into a bowl, and read out loud once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting player tries to guess the name of another player. If they are right, they get that player as their teammate! If they are wrong, that player becomes the guesser, and the game continues. As the teams grow, more names are guessed, until there is only one secret name left &amp;ndash; the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
