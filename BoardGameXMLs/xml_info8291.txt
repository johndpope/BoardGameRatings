			<description>Objective: &lt;br/&gt;To be the first player to bring 3 birds of any color home to your nest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The man acts as moving counter. The birds are pieces to collect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player pieces will travel along the path. If the man pieces lands on a bird space you can pick one and put it on the perch (that is the first step to go into the nest). You can pick from the bush, or challenge another player, in order to steal one. When challenging  you will need to guess in what hand the other player is hiding his/hers. If you are right you keep it, if not you loose the chance of getting a bird that time.  This allows for great interaction between players.  Here a bird in the bush (certain) worth more that one in the hand (uncertain)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On certain fields, one can put the birds from the houses into the nests. When a player has three birds in his/her nest, he or she is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
