							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lew Alcindor Basketball Game</name>
									
			<description>This game attempts to simulate a real basketball match.  It can be played head to head, or by up to six players.  Opposing teams face each other on opposite sides.  The game is played in real time using a timer or stopwatch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the game has begun players may not touch the ball with their hands, except to return balls which go out of bounds. Scoring is the same as in basketball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a piece of sheet metal with 19 indented holes.  A plastic basketball is used as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ball is placed in the center hole and players then use spring controlled flippers to lift a metal tab which propels the ball into the air.  The ball will then roll around on the board until it stops on an indent.  The corresponding player will then use the flipper to try to score goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board also includes wire boards which are elevated above the magnetic board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a wonderful and unique design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a side note, Lew Alcindor changed his name (after converting to Islam) to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  He is widely regarded as one of the best players in professional basketball and won numerous awards during his lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
