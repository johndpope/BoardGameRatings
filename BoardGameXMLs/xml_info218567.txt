							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Northern Crown: New World Adventures (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if Cotton Mather's paranoid fantasies about the Salem witches were all true? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if Paul Bunyan really was 10 feet tall and could fell a tree in one stroke? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What if Ben Franklin was a natural philosopher whose inventions blurred the border between science and magic? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Northern Crown, a colonial New World where the legends of North America come alive. Northern Crown is a place of high adventure, magic, and monsters, where history and myth intertwine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brawl with Mike Fink or swing an axe with Paul Bunyan. Brave the dangers of sweltering southern swamps in pursuit of the Fountain of Youth. Prowl the misty streets of Boston on the trail of hell-spawned fiends as a royal agent in service to your monarch. Take flight with a coven of witches, who wrestle their arcane powers from fiendish imps at the risk of losing their souls, or side with the Puritan firebrands who struggle against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shiver at the call of the wendigo as you traverse the frozen wastelands in search of the legendary Northwest Passage. Encounter those common folk who work wonders as hexes or firebugs, or even wield the dreaded evil eye. Aim a silver bullet at the heart of an elegant vampire beneath the Dueling Oak at Nouvelle Orleans. Take to the field of battle, where dragoons and musketeers clash amid the roar of cannon and shot, carrying the banner of liberty against the forces of tyranny...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northern Crown is a campaign world set in North America's legendary past, in an age of frontier adventure, political intrigue, and supernatural horror. Inspired by history and infused with myth, it is a place where heroes fight for freedom, chart a vast wilderness, and battle unknown evils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visit Northern Crown with the New World Adventures campaign book, which details the cultures, classes, combat techniques, equipment, spells, psionic knacks, and invention creation rules that will get players started. Explore further  the lands of Northern Crown with descriptions of the people, place, monsters, hazards, magic items, and inventions that will flesh our your campaign. From intrigue and rumors, to information on secret societies, the Gazetteer takes you into the heart of Northern Crown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
