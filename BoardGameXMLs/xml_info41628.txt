							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Majority Rules</name>
									
			<description>Majority Rules is a game of gathering votes for various factions: Governor, Congressman, Senator, and President; and collecting the money that's associated with them.  Rewards  of bonus states are available, but beware of the penalties, which include being exiled to D.C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;States are marked by chits as they are claimed, and the faction the are claimed for is decided by dice roll (d6, rolled 3 at a time).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production quality is minimal.  Chits are file card weight cardboard, colored blue and white with backings in dark and light gray.  Card stock is similar to Parker Brothers' standards for family games.  Board is eight-color on black backing.  Game bills itself as &amp;quot;The World's Most Exciting Game&amp;quot;, and MSRP was $19.95&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
