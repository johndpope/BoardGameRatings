							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shrek Smash n&#039; Crash Racing</name>
									
			<description>Shrek Smash and Crash plays like any other kart video game. The players first must pick from a line-up of thirteen different characters from the Shrek universe. The maximum number of racers on a track is six. Each of the characters have special stats that are not displayed in the game. Any other non-human racers will be controlled by the computer and chosen at random. After the racers are chosen then the player has the option to pick the track or cup tournament they want to play on.&lt;br/&gt;On the tracks are item barrels that contains items inside of them. The items are used as an advantage to help the racer out. The tracks are also filled with obstacles and short-cuts that can either help or harm the racers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
