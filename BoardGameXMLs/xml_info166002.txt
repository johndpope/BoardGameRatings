			<description>A jobs-themed collection of games for very young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game contains 7 picture cards (each consisting of two jigsaw parts) showing a profession, 7 wooden pieces (something to to with these jobs, like a fire for the fire rescuer) and a draw bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the basic game, the players take turns turning over two jigsaw pieces. If they match, the player gets the picture card and the wooden piece that goes with it. The player with the most wooden pieces wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants include one in which the players not only have to find the matching jigsaw pieces but also the corresponding wooden piece in the draw bag (by touch only, without looking), and another one in which one player secretly draws one of the wooden pieces and the other players have to guess his/her job by asking yes/no questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
