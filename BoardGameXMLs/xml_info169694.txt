			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demon~marked is a Role Playing Game set in the fantastic world of Grama. It&amp;rsquo;s built to be a low-magic and dark-fantasy kind of game, although it has a serious touch of epic-fantasy in it, since the Players will impersonate a Demon~marked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manual contains a set of basic rules, with simple mechanics for actions and combat. The game is played only with white and black D6 and with very limited calculations. These quick mechanics are build to favor story-telling, exploration, and talks between the Master and the Player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demon~marked is the first adventure set in the world of Grama; this manual contains a brief set of instructions for the Player, and short but complete directions for the Master on how to run the adventure and the scenes, plus enemies templates for the inevitable combat scenes. There are also a couple of pregenerated Characters, to begin to play immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demon~marked is a game for two players: one Player will impersonate the Character (the Demon~marked) while the other will be the Master, running the game mechanics, the world events, all NPCs etc. in a classic RPG way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the beautiful artwork is from J&amp;ouml;rn Zimmermann.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
