							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rainbow Fish and Friends</name>
									
			<description>Get ready for fun with Rainbow Fish and his friends! Shuffle all of the cards and put them in a pile where everyone can reach them. On your turn, turn over the top card and show it to everyone. If it shows either Rainbow Fish or one of his friends, you put this card face up in front of you and keep drawing from the pile. Continue adding cards to the one already in front of you as long as this is new friend. But don&amp;acute;t get too greedy - if you turn over a Wanda (stop) card, you lose all of the friends you&amp;acute;ve collected on this turn! The first player to collect Rainbow Fish and one of each of his five friends wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 4 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
