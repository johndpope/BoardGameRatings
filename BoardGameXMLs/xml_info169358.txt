							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced Arcana, Volume V</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic With A Mind of its Own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel like you&amp;rsquo;ve unlocked all the secrets of magic when you can simply flip through the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook and see every spell it has. The very nature of the game means that spells, and spellcasting, work a certain way. While there are plenty of spells to choose from, eventually you reach a point where just casting the same old things over and over again gets boring. And that&amp;rsquo;s where the books in the Advanced Arcana series come in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Arcana Volume V is more than just a collection of 120 brand new, never-before-seen spells. It, like its critically-acclaimed predecessors, was specifically designed to challenge the status quo of the way that magic works in your game. Previous installments of Advanced Arcana have created spells with different effects when cast at different spell levels, spells that modify other spells, and spells which blurred the lines between the schools of magic. This installment turns its eyes to the idea of spells with a mind of their own, in an attempt to create magic that feels more mysterious, out of control, and, ultimately, magical. In this book you will find spells whose effect depends on the roll of a die, spells that are more or less effective depending on the whims of your magical patron, spells that can be cast only when a predetermined trigger occurs, and spells that may backfire upon the caster if they are not handled with care, among many other fun and exciting new spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even above and beyond Advanced Arcana Volume V's numerous groundbreaking new spells that will have you rethinking what you thought you knew about magic, the book contains a number of expansive appendices on such topics as&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;a selection of feats that allow casters to make the most of the new spell mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;traits for familiars, giving them more personality as well as mechanical customization.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;a mini-bestiary of new sentient spells, containing 17 creatures from CR 4 to 20.&lt;br/&gt;    &amp;hellip;and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve already experienced one of the previous installments of Advanced Arcana, you know that this book is not to be missed. Pick up your copy of Advanced Arcana Volume V, and change the way that you think about magic today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
