			<description>Players vie to connect either pair of opposite sides of the board using their pawns. After an initial placement phase, pieces are then maneuvered between orthogonally adjacent points. When a diamond is formed by a player, a block counter is placed in the center reserving that point for that player. Pieces can jump an opponent's piece, &amp;amp; that taken piece is returned to the board either along one of the 2 adjacent sides marked in its color or onto one of its owner's blocks. Connections are made orthogonally &amp;amp; diagonally, &amp;amp; the first player to form a chain across the board from side to side wins. Originally marketed by the Design Centre, London (iirc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
