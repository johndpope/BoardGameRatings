			<description>Singapore-Go&lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 6 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box bottom:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s the game that takes you to the exciting, exotic experience of Singapore. Go shopping, sightseeing, sunning or sailing. Stretch your budget to buy 7 shopping items, visit 12 tourist spots, make some good decisions, and have great fun. Taste it, try it, get the thrill, stay out of trouble, and good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Singapore game from the 1980s is a roll-and-move-around-the-edge-of-the-board affair, where players try to get enough &amp;lsquo;fun stars&amp;rsquo;, visit enough tourist spots and buy enough shopping items to win. &lt;br/&gt;As one of the blurbs on the box indicates, &amp;quot;it's a fine souvenir&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box top has text indicating the game is copyright 1984 by SK Singapore, manufacturerd under license by Excelco Pte Ltd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
