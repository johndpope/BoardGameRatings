							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tree Trunk Home</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A well trod path, irregularly paved with stone slabs, leads ahead between two shallow ponds to the stump of what must have been a grand tree in the past. Large water lilies with strangely glowing blossoms float atop the muddy water of the ponds and small patches of some kind of reed grow next to the path where it meets what passes for solid ground on the other side of the ponds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What little of the trees trunk still stands has been hollowed out to make place for a cozy home as it seems. A few holes have been carved into the tree's bark to serve as windows and a larger one, quite obviously the entrance, has been closed with a solid looking door. A few faintly glowing mushrooms grow on the tree stump and the ground surrounding it, but otherwise the wood still seems to be in good condition. A single lamp has been hung over the door bathing the light immediately in front of the door in dim light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this small home a sturdy cast iron oven, set up on a stone slab to reduce the risk of setting the house on fire, takes up the center of the room. A pipe serving as its chimney leading out through a hole, set with a stone slab, in the roof. The wall around the stove is set with the rest over the meager furniture of the home, a rough table set under two of the windows with a single candle onto providing some light, a pile of straw serving as a bed, some neatly stacked fire wood and two small chests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
