			<description>From the rules translation:&lt;br/&gt;Dexterity game with a bit of memory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2-4&lt;br/&gt;Ages: 6 and up&lt;br/&gt;Duration: 15-20 minutes&lt;br/&gt;Bits: 36 cups in 3 different sizes and 4 colors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;All cups are placed on the table. Players put together a mix of different colors under their largest cups. Each player then grabs a set of the largest cups of one color. With 2 or 3 players, only use 2 or three colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To only have your own color under your cups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Course:&lt;br/&gt;The starting player chooses a player, and points to one of his cups. He then says something like, &amp;quot;The smallest cup in that stack is my color&amp;quot;. (He may also choose  the middle sized cup in the stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player spoken to uncovers the named cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the guess is correct, the player receives the cup of his color, and gives the other player a cup of the same size from beneath one of his cups. Both sets of cups are uncovered visibly so that all players may see what is beneath them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players may then shuffle their cups to try to obscure which cup was just revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player who made a correct guess goes again. He may choose a stack from the same player, or of a different player. A player can keep going as long as he is right. Once the player misses his guess, then the player whose cup he was guessing takes the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixing cups:&lt;br/&gt;Whenever a player has to reveal his cups, he is allowed to mix them. Players who have not shown their cups are NOT allowed to mix theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player may peek under his own stacks secretly at any time.&lt;br/&gt;End of Game:&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when any one player has only his own color cups under his stacks.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
