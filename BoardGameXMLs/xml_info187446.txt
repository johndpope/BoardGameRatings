			<description>Party quiz game about (mainly) pop stars. Each of the 55 large format (11.5 x 8 cm) cards gives five facts about a particular pop star. A player rolls a dice and is read the clue that corresponds to the number rolled. If they correctly identify the pop star, they win the card. The sixth fact on each card is the name of the pop star, so if they roll a 6 they automatically win the card. The game is won by the first player to win 5 cards. There are 9 special power cards that allow, for example, an extra clue or the opportunity to 'steal' a card. These are kept by the 'reader' who picks them up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
