			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strategy RPG where you control a mercenary company in a low fantasy setting with a procedurally generated world map, combat maps, and mercenaries. Hire your mercenaries, buy their equipment and supplies, and choose the contracts that you want to take. If one of your men dies they die for good, keep them alive with battle formations and tactics like shield and spear walls. Train your surviving men by having them learn abilities from three different skill trees and raising their combat abilities, health, initiative, and resolve. Different weapons grant different combat skills and have different accuracy, health and armor damage ratings, and range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
