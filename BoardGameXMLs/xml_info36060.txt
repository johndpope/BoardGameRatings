			<description>&amp;ldquo;Trivia game for 1 or more players. Winning: The first player to score 35 points is the winner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a custom deck of cards. Each card describes a category. A card is drawn and the players are given a set amount of time to write a list of items that come within the category. Once the time limit has expired, the players reveal their lists. Each correct answer scores one point, but a player may not score more than ten points in a single turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Categories on the cards include: Names of Physicists, Names of Cuts of Beef, Names of Computer Programming Languages, Names of Antibiotics, Names of Bad Guys in Star Wars and The First 10 Elements on the Periodic Table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
