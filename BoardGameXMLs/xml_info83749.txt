							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dracula Unleashed</name>
									
			<description>In Dracula Unleashed, the player assumes the identity of a young Texas businessman named Alexander Morris. Morris is living in London, England during the winter of 1899 and eventually proposes marriage to an English woman named Annisette Bowen. We learn that his elder brother, Quincey, who also lived in England, died some time earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due largely to their &amp;quot;extremely close relationship&amp;quot;, Quincey's good friend, Lord Arthur Holmwood, has proposed Alexander's induction into the mysterious and exclusive Hades Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, Alexander Morris soon discovers a part of his brother's life he had no knowledge of: Quincey Morris was part of a group which destroyed the legendary vampire, Count Dracula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Alexander Morris, the player must travel to specific locations in London at certain times with certain items you've gathered throughout your travels in hand to gather clues about the events which occur during the game and achieve victory over Dracula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dracula Unleashed&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
