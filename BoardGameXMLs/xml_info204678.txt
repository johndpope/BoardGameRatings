							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Societal Masks</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Call to Arms is a book line for players and gamemasters alike. Each book focuses on a different type of item, expanding rules for those items and adding everything from new mundane and magical examples of the item to new character options related to the item. Call to Arms: Societal Masks includes nearly 30 new masks drawn from the rich history of the real world, and an exploration of their role in various intrigues that draw on the newest Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Intrigue rules. Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find masks inspired by those used in Venice&amp;rsquo;s carnival, as well as masks used in war (drawn from ancient Romans and Greeks, to historic samurai, to modern-day fighters); in medicine; in entertainment (from masks inspired by Japanese Noh theater, to disguises in pulp and superhero c on, to Mexican wrestling); and in punishment (drawing on historic European terrors like the scold&amp;rsquo;s bridle and the mask of infamy). In addition, masks are perfectly suited to an intrigue-based game, and this book explores rules in   Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Intrigue, presenting a sample masquerade encounter as well as other ways masks may affect similar social adventures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Mundane, Magical, and Mythical Masks&lt;br/&gt;    Masked Character Options&lt;br/&gt;    Outlaw (Gunslinger Archetype)&lt;br/&gt;    Vigilante Variants&lt;br/&gt;    Masked Social Combat&lt;br/&gt;    and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
