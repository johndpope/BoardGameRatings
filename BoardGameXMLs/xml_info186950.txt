							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mad Mansion</name>
									
			<description>Mad Mansion is a competitive tile-laying game for two players, ages 10 and up, that plays in around 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt; In the game, each player represents a team of 8 Workers. During the game, players place between one to three tiles per turn to build Hallways, Rooms, and groups of linked rooms called Suites to create an overhead map of the mansion. The Workers who successfully build and complete the most Rooms in the Mansion will win the game! To score points, players place Workers on the tiles they build to claim Rooms and Suites that are Under Construction. At the end of the game, points are scored for the total number of Rooms claimed by each player... one point each for Rooms that are Under Construction, and two points each for Rooms that have been Completed (meaning that every door in the Room or Suite is connected to a hallway, or all of the rooms are bounded by solid walls.) When all of the available tiles in the game have been placed the game is over and the player with the highest number of points wins. &lt;br/&gt; Every game is a unique experience as no two Mansion layouts are ever the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
