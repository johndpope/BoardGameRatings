			<description>THE CLASSIC CLASHES OF HISTORY. THE HEADLINES OF TODAY. THE BATTLES OF TOMORROW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relive the brutal air struggle between Iran and Iraq. Wrestle the Falklands under your control. Hunt down rogue nukes in Pakistan. Go &amp;quot;Down Town&amp;quot; around Hanoi and spar with the deadly NV air defences. Lead nuclear-powered sharks of steel against the masters of antisubmarine ops. Trade volleys of fire in close-quarters gun duels, or obliterate the enemy with sophisticated, heavy-hitting hypersonic missiles from hundreds or thousands of miles away. Escort vital convoys to their destination, or make a last stand against all odds. When things escalate out of control, step up to unconventional or even nuclear weapons. Play the most dangerous game of hide and seek &amp;ndash; at sea, on land and in the air. Command is the next generation of air/naval wargaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU ARE IN CONTROL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface fleets, submarine squadrons, air wings, land-based batteries and even satellite constellations are yours to direct as you see fit &amp;ndash; from the lowliest pirate skiff to the mightiest aircraft carrier, from propeller biplanes to supersonic stealth fighters. Every sensor and weapon system is modeled in meticulous detail. You are given the hardware; but you have to use it well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE WORLD AT YOUR FINGERTIPS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throw your distorted flat maps away &amp;ndash; Command uses a realistic 3D earth globe for each of its scenarios. Rotate and zoom in and out of the action, from satellite view down to the trenches and wavetops. Play scenarios or build your own on any place on earth &amp;ndash; from classics like the Middle East, South Atlantic, North Cape and Europe to new and rising hotspots like the Arctic, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RELENTLESS REALISM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sensors and weapons work just like in real life, with all their strengths and weaknesses. Units move, detect, fight and win or die based on what their systems can and cannot do. Electronic warfare and technological levels can tilt the balance of battle. The weather can be your best ally and your worst enemy. The terrain, both overland and undersea, can hide you from the enemy but also can block your weapons from firing. Thermal layers, convergence zones, surface ducting, the deep sound channel and factors such as water salinity and temperature may decide the sub vs ship duel. Command&amp;rsquo;s battle environment is as unforgiving as the real thing &amp;ndash; and as rewarding for those who understand it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIR/NAVAL WARFARE AROUND THE WORLD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Korea. Colonial wars. Vietnam. Middle East. Cuba. Falklands. Iran-Iraq. World War 3. Desert Storm. India &amp;amp; Pakistan. The Arctic circle. Future conflicts in the Pacific, Norwegian Sea, Russian periphery and more. Experience conflict from post-WW2 all the way to 2020+ and beyond. Test your mettle against lethal land-based missile forces, air regiments, naval fleets or pirate groups. Face off against threats of the past, present and future. How do you measure up against the challenges of modern warfare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LEAD, DON&amp;rsquo;T MICROMANAGE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern warfare with all its technicalities scaring you away? Your staff &amp;amp; tactical AI sweat the details so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to. Aircraft position themselves to deliver their warloads optimally; Ships and subs maneuver on their own to reach out and touch the enemy (including winding their way around islands, landmasses and even known mines) &amp;ndash; and everyone tries very hard to save his skin when bullets are flying. Manage the big decisions and let your virtual crews get to the details &amp;ndash; and still intervene whenever you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAKE YOUR OWN WAR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think you can build a better conflict? Prove it! Command&amp;rsquo;s integrated scenario editor offers unparalleled functionality for making your own scenarios or editing existing ones. Create and share with other players detailed, exact-down-to-the-meter land installations from all over the world &amp;ndash; from airbases to port complexes to ICBM fields. Customize unit icons, sound effects, even platform weapons and sensors (Aegis on the USS Iowa &amp;ndash; click and done). Create multiple sides with variable, complex alliances and postures. Assign forces to detailed missions with custom behaviors and inheritable doctrines. Script complex interactive events with the advanced event editor. Assign variable success thresholds &amp;ndash; from triumph to utter defeat. From a gunboat duel all the way to global thermonuclear warfare &amp;ndash; the possibilities are endless.&lt;br/&gt; JOIN THE FUTURE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMMAND.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MODERN AIR / NAVAL OPERATIONS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPLETE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
