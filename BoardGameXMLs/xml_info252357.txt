			<description>An Old West race game, with donkeys! You and a handful of your fellow characters in boom town &amp;quot;Dead Man's Creek&amp;quot; are bored and looking for something to do. You decide to have a donkey race!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to race your donkey down the track (9 spaces) across the finish line. On your turn, move your donkey and play an action card that can help you or hinder your opponent. It's stunningly simple, surprisingly quick and deceptively strategic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the quickest games you'll play (average game play with 3 players is 15 minutes), and you'll be hoot'n and holler'n the whole time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
