							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alien Zombie Tentacle Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>Alien Zombie Tentacle Apocalypse. You don't have to outrun the monsters, you just have to outrun the other players. Everyone takes on the role of two or more B-movie archetypes, trying (futilely) to escape the apocalypse. Using their native abilities, gear and event cards, no one wants to be at the back of the pack when the &amp;ldquo;Die Horribly&amp;rdquo; phase arrives. Yeah, they are (were) your friends, but we're talking alien probing here. Not to mention brain-eating zombies and while you have never seen it yourself (yeah, right), you've heard what the tentacles do to you. Come to think of it, you never much liked those people anyway....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of AZTA takes between half an hour and an hour, depending on how cutthroat you are, and while you can play with two, maximum deviousness and treachery requires three to six players. You need to help your friends if you are going to survive. You just don't want to help them too much...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AZTA requires cardstock or business card sheets (11 of them), and preferably a color printer. The rules are one page long, so you can just dive in and play. The cards, rules and components all fit into a standard deck box for easy carrying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
