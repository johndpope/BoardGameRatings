							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Vol. III</name>
									
			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Vol. III is the title of a full motion video computer game released for the PC. The format of the game is the same as the first, except that there are three new and unrelated cases to solve. The first case is titled &amp;quot;The Solicitous Solicitor&amp;quot; and involves the sudden death of Melvin Tuttle, a solicitor who apparently has died of a heart attack, &amp;quot;The Banker's Final Debt&amp;quot; involves the murder of Oswald Mason at his home. Scotland Yard believes that the murder was a result of Mason disturbing a burglar but Treasury believes other way and &amp;quot;The Thames Murders&amp;quot; involves the murder of five bodies on the bank of the Thames, this at first being the only thing linking the murders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
