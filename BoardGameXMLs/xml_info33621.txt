							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yahtzee: Dragon Ball Z</name>
									
			<description>Like the classic Yahtzee game, you're rolling for various dice combinations.  Match Heroes - SS Goku, SS Trunks, and SS Vegeta or Villains - Android 20, Android 17 or Frieza 5th form to earn tiles.  The tiles add a different twist to the game, influencing your strategy plan.  They may provide you with Dragonball Z Radar or give you an extra roll or two of the dice.  You could even lose tiles to Perfect Cell.  Pick a Villain tile and you'll have to battle to keep it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more tiles you earn, the more points you'll score.  Roll Five of a Kind - that's Yahtzee, and you get to collect the Dragonball Tile along with any tiles collected by Perfect Cell.  Earn the most points and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique combination of battle, chance and strategy makes every game exciting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
