			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Iʼve always been a fan of Stargate SG-1 and later, the other Stargate series. When I got into role-playing games, I was excited to find out that there was a Stargate SG-1 roleplaying game and wanted to give it a try. When I borrowed a copy from a friend, I was initially impressed by the faithfulness to the series. But that excitement fell away when I discovered the dizzying number of combat options. Even worse, the gear section was a mess. I spent a good five minutes trying to find a P-90 and scratched my head when I found that I could take an MMORPG with me to a planet. By and large, I realized that this system wasnʼt for me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe that Savage Worlds is a system that could easily capture the exciting feel of the shows, especially during the more action-packed episodes. Iʼve created a conversion that Iʼve used with my role-playing group at college and theyʼve loved it, so Iʼd like to share it with the world. Itʼs my goal to create a conversion that is useful and accurately captures the feel of the shows. I encourage any feedback to help this to happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
