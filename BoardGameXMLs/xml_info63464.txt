							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reap the Whirlwind</name>
									
			<description>from the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;You've been hounded by jack-booted, white-shirted vigilantes. You've been hunted by killer robots.&lt;br/&gt;You've lived like an animal.&lt;br/&gt;You've had enough.&lt;br/&gt;Now it's time for mutants to fight back, time for the hunted to become the hunters. You've learned to survive, to thrive, by striking from the shadows. A thrust here. A blow there.&lt;br/&gt;Now word has begun to circulate of a mutant with enough power to frighten the sentnels...of equipment which can give mutants a fighting chance against their oppressors...of a man with a vision, a vision of a mutant army capable of overwhelming any foe.&lt;br/&gt;You'll strike like a whirlwind and reap what you can. Your lives will never be the same.&lt;br/&gt;The thought appeals to you.&lt;br/&gt;Reap the Whirlwind is the third chapter in the Future in Falmes series designed for use with the Marvel Super Heroes Advanced Set. It includes a 32-page book and a 33&amp;quot;x22.5&amp;quot; full-color map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
