			<description>A fantasy card game in which each player draws a character card and victory conditions card to start the game. An example of a victory condition would be &amp;quot;Gather 600 gold so you can buy medicine to cure your lover who's fallen ill.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;there are many locations in the dungeon, and certain monsters can only be played in certain locations. Each monster card shows its name, strength, where it can appear, the treasure it carries, and the experience gained for killing the monster. There are of course items and weapons to help you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
