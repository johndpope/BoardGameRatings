			<description>The original Japanese title means &amp;quot;Is it rock? Is it paper?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is basically Rock-Paper-Scissors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 12 cards, of which 6 are Scissors, 3 are Rock and 3 are Paper. Additionally, every card has a coin value between 0 and 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two cards are discarded secretly, and the other ten are dealt to the players. Players play a card face down and reveal it at the same time. The winner is determined by normal Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner of the bout takes as many coins as the two cards combined show. The loser takes the cards played. If there's a tie, the players move to the next bout and the tied cards stay on the table, adding to the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player runs out of cards or the 13 coin pile runs out. If the coin value of the last bout is higher than the number of coins left, the remaining coins are taken from the opponent. (This rule makes a last-minute comeback possible, even after the opponent has amassed 7 coins.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
