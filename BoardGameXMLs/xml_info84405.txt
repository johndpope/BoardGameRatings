			<description>The All-Time Favorites Scenarios are reprints with updates and errata included and are the perfect size for a round. All-Time Favorites provide scenario choices for all of the time frames and theaters of WW2, as well as not requiring the player to own Heat of Battle campaign games or packs to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ATF Scenario Cards are in a new full-color online format.&lt;br/&gt; There are three scenarios in the first installment of ATF:&lt;br/&gt;1) Paper Line (from Recon by Fire #1), Germans panzers crash into the Dyle Line in Belgium, 1940.&lt;br/&gt; 2) One Eye to the West (from Waffen SS:  No Quarter No Glory!), Late war SS trying to hold off the Russian onslaught in Vienna, 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Bear Hunt (from the same pack). SS and Russians clash near Cherkasssy in 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
