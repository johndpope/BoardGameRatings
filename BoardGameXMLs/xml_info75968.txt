							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mars Colony</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Political power and an isolated populace? Scandal never seemed so appealing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The colony was created by a coalition of Earth governments that advertised the project as a multi-national utopia. Now, after years of incompetence and disaster, the colony is dying. You have been nominated to turn things around. While you were a celebrated expert on Earth, Mars is a different environment entirely. Good luck...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mars Colony is a roleplaying game designed specifically for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One will take on the role of the colony&amp;rsquo;s appointed &amp;quot;savior&amp;quot;, while the other will be responsible for all the various problems that are plaguing the citizens of Mars. As the game progresses, the savior will face a constant struggle between competence and failure, honesty and deception. It is a game custom built to explore the cult-of-personality present in modern-day politics, but playable in the time it takes to watch a long movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
