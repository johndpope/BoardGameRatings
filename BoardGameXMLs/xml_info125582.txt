							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Box of Blox</name>
									
			<description>Digital Eel's Big Box of Blox is a column stacking game taken to outrageous extremes! The rules are simple. With easy keystrokes carefully arrange the three-blox-high columns as they fall. Match blox in each column to eliminate rows. The gameplay is very easy going at first glance -but there's more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why just simply stack blox? What if you could smash them, blast them, squish them or mutate them? Digital Eel's Big Box of Blox introduces jokers, bombs, hidden blox, frogs, fireballs, slot machines, &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; blox, boulders and lots of surprises to keep your eyes, ears, brain and fingers happy and challenged. (And that's a tall order!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Eel's Big Box of Blox also offers five different games (Flaming Peelout, Blok Atak, Groink, Mushroom King and Asylum Cubez), a custom game mode, eye-watering psychedelic graphics by Phosphorous, groovy sounds and music by Lextor Mucron and His Orchestra, multiple difficulty levels and even a cameo by our old friend, Plasmaworm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what are you waiting for? Enter the Asylum, visit the Mushroom King and spin the Wheels of Fortune with Digital Eel's Big Box of Blox!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
