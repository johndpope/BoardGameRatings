							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horse-Racing Tycoon</name>
									
			<description>Horse-Racing Tycoon is a boardgame with a horse-racing and betting theme. Players bet on 4 horses and then race them round the track using cards that determine their movement. Made in Hong Kong by a company called 'Playgo', a curious feature is the deck of cards which look remarkably similar to Uno cards, though the play is nothing like Uno at all. Another feature is that the game proclaims proudly (on the box) that it comes with free Playgo money notes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advice that appears on the box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Be careful, you can gain or lose a fortune in one bet! Never neglect other players' luck!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
