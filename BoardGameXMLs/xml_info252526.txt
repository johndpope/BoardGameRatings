			<description>Is she drawing an elk or a moose? Is he drawing a pegasus or a unicorn? These are the types of questions you will probably be asking yourself during a game of Pictomania!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's no time to draw a complex masterpiece in Pictomania, the drawing game in which everybody draws and everybody guesses &amp;mdash; all at the same time! Players sketch the essence of the word with a few quick lines and try to guess the others' drawings while there's still time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second edition of Pictomania features revised word cards with a brand new look. One big change for this edition compared to the base game is that only three word cards are in play no matter the player count, allowing you to jump into each round more quickly since you don't have to read as many words to guess who might be drawing what.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
