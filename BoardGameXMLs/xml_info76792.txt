			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bored with board games? Tired of pursuing trivia? Had your fill of ethical questions? Then you're ready for ANTICIPATION. This zany, unpredictable, totally wacked-out video board game begins with a giant connect-the-dots puzzle. Suddenly, a video pencil starts connecting the dots and, before you know it, you're in a maddening race against the clock, trying to solve the puzzle. Is it an Igloo? A Penguin? A Pineapple? Whatever it is, you - and all your friends - will have a great time trying to guess what the pencil is drawing. Guess right and you'll get a crack at the really tough puzzles - no dots or clues, just the pencil drawing a picture. Think you're up to it? Then challenge your friends. Or take on the Computer. Either way, this off-the-floor board game will challenge you, excite you and generally drive you crazy for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
