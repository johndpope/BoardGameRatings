			<description>&amp;quot;By 1824 the liberation of South America from Spanish rule was nearly complete. The last remaining seat of Spanish power was in Peru.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The final battle was fought on December 9 at Ayacucho. Shouting 'Paso de vencedores'(onward to victory). General Cordoba led the right wing of the rebel army in the attack that finally broke the back of the royalist army. This decisive battle marked the end of Spanish colonial rule in South America.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniatures wargame is intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infantry and cavalry figures are mounted two to a base. It takes six bases to make an infantry or cavalry unit, with an infantry unit representing about 400 men and a cavalry unit representing 200. The Rebels begin with 15 units and the Royalists 19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
