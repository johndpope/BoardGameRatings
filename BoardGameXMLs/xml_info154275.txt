			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 2013 iOS version of the Qwirkle boardgame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 108 blocks with six different shapes in six different colors. Players begin the game with 6 blocks. The start player plays blocks of a single matching attribute (color or shape but not both). Thereafter, a player adds blocks adjacent to at least one previously played block. The blocks must all be played in a line and match, without duplicates, either the color or shape of the previous block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players score one point for each block played plus all blocks adjacent. It is possible for a block to score in more than one direction. If a player completes a line containing all 6 shapes or colors, an additional 6 points are scored. The player then refills his hand to 6 blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all tiles have been distributed, and one player plays all of his remaining blocks, earning a 6 point bonus. The player with the high score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This implementation features 4 levels of AI opponents, and the ability to customize the colors of the blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
