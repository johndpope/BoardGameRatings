							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Game of Uncle Sam&#039;s Mail</name>
									
			<description>Players move around the U.S. by horseback, stagecoach, steamboat, and railroad to deliver their randomly drawn pieces of mail. Each player takes one postman piece. The object of the game is to deliver 6 letters.  The letters are first sorted into piles according to postmarks. Players then take 1 letter from each pile so that 1 letter will have to be delivered to each section of the country. Players either start in New York or San Francisco. The object is to deliver the letters to the various cities to which they are addressed. The game claims to have the best and most practical general railroad map in use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
