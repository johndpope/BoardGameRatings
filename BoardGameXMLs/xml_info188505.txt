							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fires of Skinspeake</name>
									
			<description>From drivethrurpg:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fires of Skinspeake is the first offering from brand-new Scottish RPG Publishers, X'I Publications.  A 16 page OGL adventure for low level characters, easily adapted to fit any D20 Fantasy Ruleset, it introduces the remote island of Skinspeake and its inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For generations life in the harsh environment of Skinspeake has relied on a simple exchange system.  The humans in the town of Stormshelter catch fish and trade their surplus for dwarven coal.  Recently though, deliveries from the Bronzehammer clan have ceased and the dwarves are staying tight-lipped as to why.  With winter fast approaching, it's down to the party to save the residents of Stormshelter from freezing to death by relighting The Fires of Skinspeake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small island of Skinspeake has been designed in such a way that it can be easily slotted into any existing campaign world.  It might be little, but it's jam-packed with colourful characters and can easily be used as a base for further adventures.  Look out for more adventures set on the island coming soon - there's a lot more to the place than meets the eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
