			<description>Game Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brilliant and enigmatic, Frederick the Great of Prussia elevated his small country to a position of respect throughout Europe. His masterful campaigns are held up to this day by historians and professional soldiers alike as shining examples of the military art. Frederick's grasp of both tactics and strategy earned him a prominent place in the annals of military history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you too can follow in his footsteps. Take command of his finely tuned Prussian War Machine and put yourself to the ultimate test.
