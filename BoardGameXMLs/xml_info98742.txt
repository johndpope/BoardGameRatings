							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sooty&#039;s ABC Game</name>
									
			<description>48 cards. Children's game which might have appealed to parents as the cards represented the first four letters of the alphabet and could therefore be seen as educational.&lt;br/&gt;Players collect sets of cards, 3 or 4, the only rule being that the letters must connect. So, ABC would be a legitamite example, as would ABCD, and AABC, or CCDD.&lt;br/&gt;There is interaction as you can block an opponent's play and take a set from them.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to collec t 12 sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
