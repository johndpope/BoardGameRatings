			<description>&amp;quot;HEROES in Mythical Greece&amp;quot; is a greek CCG (Collectible Card Game) that takes place in Ancient Greece. The game is heavily based in the greek mythology trying to be as faithful to it as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take control of a famous greek Hero and they play allies, locations, actions and equipment to assist him in his quests. The game can be played in two modes &amp;quot;Duels&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Quests&amp;quot;. In &amp;quot;Duels&amp;quot; two players fight each other, trying each to eliminate the opponent by either reducing his life total or gaining enough fame. In &amp;quot;Quests&amp;quot; players try to advance their Hero, by taking him from his early age and completing quests in order to take fame and have him rise to become a living legend. At the same time their opponents try to stop them by playing monsters that will prevent them from completing their quests. The first one to reach a certain level of fame wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, only one set has come out, the first Rhapsody as it is being called, named Genesis. There are plans for more expansions in the following years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
