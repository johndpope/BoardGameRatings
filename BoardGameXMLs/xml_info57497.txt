			<description>Subtitled: Fighters, Carriers and Mecha&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Red Five, He's On My Tail!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;One person, one ship -- and even odds on returning home. GURPS Spaceships 4: Fighters, Carriers, and Mecha provides the ships and game mechanics needed for space-fighter and carrier action. It offers GURPS Spaceships statistics and descriptions for dozens of combat spaceships for the near-future and beyond, from tiny-but-agile fighters and drop ships to enormous fleet and assault carriers. It also includes expanded rules for the basic space-combat system in GURPS Spaceships, adding options that simulate small-ship cinematic action. It's up-close and personal in heated space combat, with two combatants each wanting the other dead . . . and if they're not cunning and careful, they could both get what they want.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is the fourth volume in the GURPS Spaceships series by David Pulver (co-author of GURPS Fourth Edition). It requires only the GURPS Basic Set and GURPS Spaceships. GURPS Space is recommended for guidelines on stardrives, suitable character templates, and campaign settings; GURPS Spaceships 3: Warships and Space Pirates provides descriptions of military operations, tactical hex-based combat, and other warships.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
