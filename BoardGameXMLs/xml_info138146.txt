			<description>From the Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bombardment of Alexandria 1882 is an additional historical scenario for use with BoneGames game of late 19th century warfare Queen Victoria's Navy. This scenario is not a complete game. Ownership of Queen Victoria's Navy (and the Admiral On Deck expansion) is necessary in order to use this scenario. Visit the BoneGames website at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.bonegames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.bonegames.com&lt;/a&gt; for information about Queen Victoria's Navy, Admiral On Deck, and other games by BoneGames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early in 1882 the Egyptian Army forced the Khedive, Tewfik Pasha, to appoint Colonel Said Ahmed Arabi AKA Arabi Pasha as the new Minister of War. In this position, and with the backing of the army, Arabi was the de facto ruler of the country. Arabi was viewed with distrust in both Britain and France. This distrust was not without reason as he and his followers viewed the Khedive as a puppet of the Europeans, attacked Europeans in the streets, and threatened to nationalize the Suez Canal leaving the stockholders without a cent, and to repudiate Egypt's foreign loans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination of fear for the Canal, the shortest route to India after all, the outraged cries of the investors and a pinch of concern for the Europeans in Egypt, plus a heavy dose of Jingoism led the British government to prepare for war. France, for some very convoluted internal political reasons, reversed policy and refused to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While an Army was being assembled the British decided that their first step should be to neutralize the extensive coastal batteries defending Alexandria. On 10 July,Vice Admiral Sir B. P. Seymour demanded that the forts, then being strengthened, be surrendered. The navies of other nations and all commercial shipping quickly sailed out of port. The Egyptians refused this demand and Queen Victoria&amp;rsquo;s Navy cleared for action. On 11 July, 1882 the bombardment began at 0650 hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
