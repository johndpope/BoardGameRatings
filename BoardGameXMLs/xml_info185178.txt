			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FFRPS, the Free Fantasy Role Playing System, was developed with several design goals in mind.  Primarily, it was free, with rules that attempted to be intuitively simple.  A secondary goal to enable &amp;quot;paperless&amp;quot; play (via software) was not particularly successful.  The game is interesting inasmuch as it was intended only as a partial replacement for TSR's Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.  Major portions of FFRPS used the AD&amp;amp;D ruleset without modification.  Other portions of FFRPS were completely new material.  It can thus be viewed as either a large-scale &amp;quot;variant&amp;quot; rule set for AD&amp;amp;D or as an independent game that borrows heavily from AD&amp;amp;D.  Either interpretation is correct, depending upon focus.  An add-on component of science and technology was contemplated but not produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major ways in which FFRPS was innovative surrounded character and NPC creation and the implementation of magic within a campaign.  It is safe to say that in nearly all other respects it was a near-clone of AD&amp;amp;D.  Characters in FFRPS were required to be human.  They had two types of Characteristics--Primaries and Secondaries.  Six Primaries were defined:  Strength, Intelligence, Faith, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma--usually ranging from -2 to +2.  Primary ranks were purchased from a point pool.  Three Secondaries were defined:  Mana, To Hit Armor Class 0 (&amp;quot;THAC0&amp;quot;), and Hit Points.  Secondary ranks were derived values.  Characters' proficiency was noted in several &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot;:  Adventuring Level, Combat Level, Magic Level, and Piety Level.  Secondary Skills were deleted in favor of a narrative character background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic was reworked to use a mana point system, with spells placed in schools.  Some spell parameters (range, duration, area-of-effect) could be varied at casting time.  Spell Levels were somewhat dynamic based upon desired outcomes.  However, every spell cast had a potential of failure, determine using a complex formula.  Spell targets were allowed saving throws using a complex formula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
