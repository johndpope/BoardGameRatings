							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grenadier (IF)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grenadiers are individuals wholly devoted to explosions and destruction. They spend their days designing and crafting grenades of different types, with the overall goal of designing a grenade generally more destructive. Grenadiers are former soldiers, from where they got their first taste of explosives and grenades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having left the military, they were unable to also leave behind their taste for destruction. They soon acquire or build a Grenade Kit, and the rest is explosive. In the modern era, with vaporizers and plasma rays, there isn't much use for demolitions experts outside of the military&amp;mdash;except out on the frontier planets, that is, where someone who can blow up stuff real damn good never goes out of style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
