							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Painkiller: Recurring Evil</name>
									
			<description>Painkiller: Recurring Evil is an add-on featuring 5 new levels with about 4000 enemies. It was released digitally on February 29, 2012 by Nordic Games GmbH via Steam, and developed by Med-Art and Eggtooth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It continues the story of Resurrection and serves as a side story for Redemption. Bill Sherman becomes the ruler of Purgatory, blessed with power of the Sword of Seraphim. However, the fallen angel Samael (now wingless after his defeat at the hands of Belial in Overdose), who took the power of Hell from Eve, steals Bill's sword and sends him to Purgatory's unexplored locations, forcing the fight to start again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Painkiller (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
