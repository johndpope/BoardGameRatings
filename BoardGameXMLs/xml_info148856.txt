							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirty Cops</name>
									
			<description>from the Score:&lt;br/&gt;just a little taste...&lt;br/&gt;The cops in El Centro have a unique motto&amp;mdash;Bad Cop, Bad Cop.  Anyone whose ever been brought in for questioning here knows to tell the truth, or wake up in a cell with a criminal who is far worse than you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beatings are always an option too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not the worst of it. The worst is that the cops here are just as dirty as the criminals. They take bribes, sell information to pushers, and generally keep a close watch on the criminals doing them the most favors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which is great for the status quo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what happens when an investigation stumbles into territory other dirty cops are trying to cover up? Or maybe someone is ready to squeal to protect his ass? And let&amp;rsquo;s not forget about the ambitious prosecutor looking to nail someone&amp;rsquo;s ass to the wall?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What then?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
