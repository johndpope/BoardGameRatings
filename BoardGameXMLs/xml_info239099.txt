							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cube Words</name>
									
			<description>Cube Words is a print&amp;amp;play word game for 2 players. Earn points by forming words using adjacent letters. First player to earn exactly 30 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his turn, each player can form a 3+ letters word using orthogonally adjacent letters and earn points according to the number of letters. Longer words are considerably more valuable than short words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After forming a word, each player can use a cube to block a chosen letter. This letter can not be used by the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player can only pass through the 20 points mark if he has formad at least one 6+ letters word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make things a little more difficult, the winner is the player who reachs exactly 30 points. If you earn more than 30 points, you begin to reduce your scoring!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed for the 2017 9-Card Nanogame P&amp;amp;P Design Contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE COMPONENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you need to play Cube Words is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The cards fronts and backs (one A4 sheet for each)&lt;br/&gt;- 8 cubes, in 2 different colors (4 for each player)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
