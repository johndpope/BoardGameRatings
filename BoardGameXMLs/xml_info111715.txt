			<description>Contents&lt;br/&gt;2 Clamps.&lt;br/&gt;2 Wooden Poles.&lt;br/&gt;1 Ball.&lt;br/&gt;7 Wood Skittles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indoor game that lends itself to skittle games where you swing round a ball on a string, trying to knock down the skittles as it sweeps by. In England this type of game was always known as Bar Skittles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skittle-Tennis has a ball on a string but the string is longer and must be hit with a bat rather than out of the hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The skittles are rated for different point values. Obviously, you should try to knock over the higher scoring ones. The first player to score 100 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules &amp;quot;An interesting game that can produce an excellent method of training the eye for both Table Tennis and Tennis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are some game variants in the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
