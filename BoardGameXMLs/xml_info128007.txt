			<description>A press-your-luck game for two to four fearless poultry fans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by Shawn Storie and Jonathan A. Leistiko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: Draw as many points as you can without drawing more than one chicken foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A __Chicken__ deck (available on the website)&lt;br/&gt;    A way to keep score (ex: paper and pencil)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round is divided into two phases: Bid (you bid how many cards you will draw from the deck &amp;mdash; highest bid wins) and Draw (winner of the bid has to draw what he or she bid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When drawing, the drawing player gets to keep any number cards he or she drew face down in front of them.  If he or she draws any Chicken Feet, the chicken feet must go face up in front of the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the round, the drawing player tallies his or her score. If the player had no chicken feet, the player gets the sum of the points in front of him/her. If the drawing player had one chicken foot, he or she will add an extra 10 points to his/her score. Two or more chicken feet?  The player subtracts the points in front of him/her from his/her score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a round ends and at least one player has 50 points or more, the game ends. The player with the most points wins. If any players are tied, play another round with all players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
