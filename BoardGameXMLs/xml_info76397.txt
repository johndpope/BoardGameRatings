			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What this is: This is a generic game engine designed to run lots of different things without tying itself too particularly to any one genre. It attempts to be light on the rules because me (the writer) wants to make it as simple as possible to play. It attempts to give advice on how to model things using the mechanics. It also likes to work on the basis of a unified mechanic (non-modular mechanics need not apply).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What this is not: This is not a game where you will find sections on what an RPG is; I assume you know what an RPG is, how they generally work, and that you need somebody to run the game (called a Game Moderator or GM for short). This is not something that says &amp;quot;Your favorite game sucks!&amp;quot; because that's just rude and won't win friends. This is not something that inherently supports one playing-style over the other (at least it wasn't designed to be).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
