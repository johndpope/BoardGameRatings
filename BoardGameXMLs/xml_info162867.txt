							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warriors of Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>Warriors of Fantasy is a Wargaming system that will be aimed at large scale battles using 100&amp;rsquo;s of miniatures per side. It will hopefully remain fast to play while retaining the depth of individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Warriors of Fantasy system is geared towards representing medieval combat of all types, from realistic to high fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is designed so you can use any figures from any manufacturer, these rules are written assuming you are using the 28mm scale (Games Workshop or equivalent).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is designed to be rules-lite, with only about 10 or so pages of rules to learn to play. To retain depth the game will provide a structure for players to build their own rules around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
