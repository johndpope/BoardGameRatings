			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is now 2025 and on the newly colonized planet Esperanza our space devices have not just been approached by alien machines but attacked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls a squad of soldiers, light and heavy support combat vehicles, robots and air units located in a base on the planet Esperanza that had been colonized by the spaceship Magalhaes in the year 2023. This squad was brought together by the Esperanza government to face a threat that comes from deep space. In case the player succeeds in averting an alien impact on Esperanza, the story will continue on the planet Earth which has been subdued by alien forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title combines global strategy with small, squad-based tactical combat against an alien invasion. To repel the alien invasion the player must take full advantage of the terrain and his surrounding environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
