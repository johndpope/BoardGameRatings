			<description>Jag ringer is a quiz game. One player pretend to call his/her friends (the other players) at different times in their lives, as the other players gets one &amp;quot;year&amp;quot; card that tells what age they are. With questions, the players should empathize with &amp;quot;their past&amp;quot; - and remember how they thought and felt when you were, for example: 13, 17 or 25 years - and then answer so convincingly as possible. The most convincing player gets one point. The player with most points at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
