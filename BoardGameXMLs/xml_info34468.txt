							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Feud</name>
									
			<description>Feud is all about combat.  It is about warfare - the weaponry, the armor, the tactics, the respite, the strengths and weaknesses of participating warriors, and the suspense and mystery of an unknown outcome.  A typical game can last anywhere from ten minutes to two hours.  It is for two players, and, best of all, Feud is played with two standard decks of playing cards!  This makes Feud cheap!  And sometimes free, (the best kind of game), if you already have the cards lying around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feud is initially quite complex.  No one can master the concepts of Feud by playing just a few games, let alone the subtleties.  Once you have played it enough though, you will not only find it enjoyable, but rather simplistic and easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ease new players into the game, a set of Basic Rules is outlined first.  Play several games of Feud with the Basic Rules.  Once you have grasped them soundly, the Advanced Rules will bring the true excitement of Feud to light.  Though we have called them &amp;quot;Advanced&amp;quot; rules, they are just an extension of the Basic Rules, and complete the game's symmetry.  If you find yourself having fun with just the Basic Rules, or Basic Feud, no worries!  Many people enjoy Basic Feud more than Advanced Feud, or True Feud.  But we urge you to try out True Feud if you have enjoyed basic Feud, especially if you like games with higher degrees of skill and lesser degrees of chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
