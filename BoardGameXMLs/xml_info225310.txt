			<description>This is an 1884 trivia card game focused on American history. As with most such games, players are dealt an initial hand, and on their turn, ask a question of their neighbour to the left. If that person answers correctly, he keeps the card; if not, other players in turn have an opportunity, and if no one can answer, the questioning player keeps the card. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the 180 cards in this game bear one or more title words (names, places, things or events) followed by two or more related facts. For these cards, the questioner states a title word or phrase, and the other players must state one relevant fact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remaining cards have specific questions, which players must answer completely. (For example: &amp;quot;Name the features of the Omnibus Bill. The 5-part answer: California should be a free state; Utah and New Mexico should be formed into territories; Texas should be paid $10 million to give up its claim to New Mexico; the Slave Trade should be prohibited in the District of Columbia; and Fugitive slaves should be returned to their owners.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Annual Reports of the Department of the Interior, 1884 this game has 200 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
