			<description>from the back cover of the module:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Where did you get that Hat?  Where did you get that Tie?&lt;br/&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it a knobby One - It&amp;rsquo;s just the proper style.&lt;br/&gt;Where can I get One - Just the same as that?&lt;br/&gt;Well - Hello! Where did you get that Hat?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your evening of rest and recuperation in your favourite Tavern is interrupted as she enters. She looks at you with her bag of gold and entices you to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dare?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the module background:&lt;br/&gt;Clyde Caldwell, a Merchant likely known to the Adventurers has recently purchased a Keep and the acres of land on which it sits from the King. Having done this so many times before &amp;ndash; employing Adventurers to depopulate his properties of undesired tenants he decided to finally give it a go himself. Unfortunately he has run afoul of the occupants who proved far more alien to his ideas than any before had done. Merchant Cladwell found himself Abducted in the worse possible way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overdue &amp;ndash; his failure to return home has raised the attention of his young daughter &amp;ndash; Sylvia. Worried with grief she made immediately for the Keep and found her father&amp;rsquo;s horse being mutilated by things which can only be described as not in the slightest bit goblin-like with no sign of her father.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realizing that both she and her Father would have as much chance as a cheese sandwich on a plate in a place like this she returned home long enough to retrieve what she would need before heading to the nearest tavern with a sack of gold. This would take adventurers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
