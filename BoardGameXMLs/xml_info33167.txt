							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chaos Cruisers</name>
									
			<description>A Changing Landscapes game for the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the far future, ordinary racing has become obsolete. The fans have grown bored with driving around in loops at high speeds. So, a new genre of racing is born&amp;mdash;the Chaos Cruiser. These unique hover-vehicles are designed for pure speed and maneuverability. And they&amp;rsquo;ll need every bit of it because the racetrack is not what it seems. The track is made up of individual modules that shuffle about, ratcheting up the difficulty. Also, each driver has radio-controlled drones that can be placed as obstacles in their opponents&amp;rsquo; paths. In the midst of all this chaos, one wily cruiser will prove to be the fastest, most agile, and most crafty of them all. Who will earn the Chaos Cup?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The piecepack tiles are laid out, so as to create a racetrack. Each player controls one cruiser, represented by a piecepack die. The number that is face-up on the die designates the speed of that cruiser. The coins have two uses. The null and ace coins are placed on the track as impassible obstacles. The 2, 3, 4, and 5 coins are used as nitro-boosts or shock-breaks, which greatly increase or decrease your speed. The pawns stand for the gates along the course. When a cruiser enters the tile containing a gate, he checks that gate off on the race progress chart. When all the cruisers have reached a certain gate, a chaos round is initiated, in which each player can move the two obstacles of his color. Also, the player in last place can move 3 tiles of the racetrack to entirely new locations. The first player to complete the race by passing through each of the four gates twice in the correct sequence is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
