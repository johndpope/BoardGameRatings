			<description>The cards all show a couple of different animal types.  There are six different animals - donkey, frog, rooster, cat, cow and pig - on the cards and there are one, two or three of them on each card.   The cards are dealt, in his turn the player turns the top card of his stack and places in front of him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If somebody sees a series - i.e. one, two and three animals of same type on one card - it makes the noise of this animal and gets all the played cards. Player who calls 4 times first is the winner. Whomever calls wrong must give one card to other players as a penalty. Who has no cards left is eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
