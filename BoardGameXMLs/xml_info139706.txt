Try the new Bell 206B JetRanger III helicopter.&lt;br/&gt;     Blast off in the brand-new Learjet 45, a plane even the jet-setters are still waiting to fly.&lt;br/&gt;     Fly your favorites--the Cessna 182 Skylane, Extra 300S, Boeing 737-400, Schweizer sailplane, and Sopwith Camel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb into the pilot's seat. Take the controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     3-D acceleration and MMX technology snap scenery into an electrifying new dimension.&lt;br/&gt;     High-resolution instrument panels put you in today's technologically advanced cockpits.&lt;br/&gt;     Digitally sampled sounds bring each aircraft roaring to life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flight Simulator 98 gives you more of the globe than ever before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Take off from more than 3,000 airports worldwide. With 10 times more airports than before, you'll be in the traffic pattern at airline hubs and suburban airstrips.&lt;br/&gt;     Detailed scenery for 45 international metropolitan areas, including 20 new U.S. cities, lets you start your adventures almost anywhere--even from a skyscraper helipad! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experience crowded skies and G-force feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Multiplayer features put you in the sky with other pilots via Internet or network connections.&lt;br/&gt;     Free Internet matchmaking on the Internet Gaming Zone lets you enter international airshows and aerobatic competitions.&lt;br/&gt;     Force-feedback joystick support makes &amp;quot;pulling G's&amp;quot; more than just a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
