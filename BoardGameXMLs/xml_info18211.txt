As the game progresses, a player, during his turn, may take another ring rom the kitty as long as rings remain.  Players cannot take rings from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in turn, roll the die.  Players select the fractional piece that corresponds to the die roll and fits it to one of the two rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play rotates clockwise with each player rolling and placing pieces.  Play continues with players trying to complete a circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a fractional part rolled on the die cannot be used, or does not want to use it, the player does nothing and play passes to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player, during his turn, can move a fractional part from one uncompleted ring to another without penalty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all parts are used.  Game ends at this point and the player with the greatest number of completed circles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
