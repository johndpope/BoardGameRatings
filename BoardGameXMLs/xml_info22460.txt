			<description>You play a &amp;quot;trail boss&amp;quot; working for a ranching outfit and your job is to drive a herd of cattle to market and well them at the best price.  You start off with 12 cowboys, 500 head of cattle (and can hunt for more), and head north, driving your herd over the long, dusty miles to Kansas.  You'll have lots to deal with along the way, but with a bit of luck and cool judgment, you'll make a handsome profit at the end of the drive.&lt;br/&gt;      The game board shows Texas, the Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma) and Kansas, along with parts of other states and territories as the were in the early 1870's. Several cattle trails important in the early 1870's are shown, although many more trails, especially in south central Texas were used at different times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
