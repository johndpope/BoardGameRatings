			<description>Aladdin has lost the magic lamp!  You must help him and Princess Jasmine find it before Jafar does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Disney's Giant Board Game Book, Aladdin is a roll-and-move game where players must press the &amp;quot;electronic die&amp;quot; to move two markers representing Aladdin and Jasmine simultaneously along a track, trying to reach the end and recover the magic lamp.  Along the way, they may land on spaces that move them forward or backward or cause loss or gain of turns.  A small element of strategy is added by the ability to move either marker, offering the choice to move the marker that will land on an advantageous space or avoid a negative space.  The first player to reach the end of the track with both markers wins, and the other players must &amp;quot;grant three wishes&amp;quot; to the player by roaring like a genie, making a face like Abu and flying around the room like a magic carpet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
