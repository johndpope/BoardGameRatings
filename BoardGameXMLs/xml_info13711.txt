			<description>Chameleon is essentially a multi-player Reversi (Othello) game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of 69 squares arranged in staggered rows running 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.  The pieces are wooden cubes with a different color on each face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turns players either place a new cube or move an existing one with their color up (the latter is the main difference from Reversi, where pieces never move) and then turn all cubes sandwiched between the new/moved cube and others of their cubes to their colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1940 Milton Bradley published a new version which appears to have been for just 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
