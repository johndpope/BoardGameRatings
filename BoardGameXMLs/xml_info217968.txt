			<description>Bored Room is an easy-to-play, but hard-to-win party game pitting you against your co-workers in a series of challenges taking place during a work meeting! That's right, your company is going to be paying you while you play this game. That's definitely a win-win! *cough*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three dice are rolled before the meeting, comparing the results to the list of activities. All players attend the meeting and complete as many of the rolled challenges as possible to score points. After the meeting ends, players reconvene to tally up scores and declare a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With multiple modes of gameplay and included badges of honor, you'll be sure to liven up your stuffy work environment in no time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
