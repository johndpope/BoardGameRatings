							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">King of the Goblins</name>
									
			<description>Goblins are sneaky, cowardly, short-tempered creatures.  They are fearful to take up arms against anyone but can get vicious if their backs are against a wall.  They constantly feud with rival tribes for resources, land and title.  They are so devious and lazy that they would rather steal resources from a neighboring tribe than produce them on their own. They are so untrustworthy that they would rather stab someone in the back than look at them.  Welcome to the unpredictable world of King of the Goblins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King of the Goblins is a game for 2-5 players in which each player represents the leader of a tribe of Goblins vying for the title, King of the Goblins.  To acquire this title, players must collect as much Gold as possible.  To collect Gold, players must do a number of things. New land must be opened up in order to build trade houses that produce different types of resources.  Resources are used to build more trade houses or traded for Gold.  In addition, powerful cards can be played to turn the tables on the other players. The tribe with the most Gold at the end of the game is the winner and the tribal leader is declared King of the Goblins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
