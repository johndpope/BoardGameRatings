							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roman Civil Wars</name>
									
			<description>Roman Civil Wars focuses on the famous battles of the years 55 BC to 10 AD where legionary fought wild barbarian tribesmen, Parthian horse archers, and all too often, other legionaries. The era of the Roman Republic and early Empire was a time of great military conflict. This period saw the Civil Wars of Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, Augustus and Marc Antony, as well as Caesar's conquest of Gaul, Crassus' disastrous expedition against the Parthians, and Rome's push over the RhineRiver and into Germania.&lt;br/&gt; It was in these wars that the Imperial Roman army would be forged. The basic legionary unit was the cohort, supported by various auxiliary forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The First Triumvirate, 59 BC - 53 BC, saw Caesar, Pompey and Crassus divide the Roman world among themselves. But this fell apart with the death of Crassus at the battle of Carrhae against the Parthians. Caesar and Pompey then fought for supreme power, 49 BC - 44 BC. Caesar triumphed, but following his assassination the second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Anthony ruled the Republic from 43 - 33 BC.&lt;br/&gt; The Triumvirate soon fell out among themselves and another civil war was in the offing. The decisive battle of Actium in 31 BC saw Octavian defeat Mark Anthony and become the first of the emperors as Augustus. Octavian consolidated the frontiers and expanded Rome's domain in to Germania. In 9 AD the German disaster of Teutoburger Forest resulted in the destruction of three Roman Legions and temporarily halted Rome&amp;rsquo;s expansion.&lt;br/&gt; So ended a century of warfare, the momentous effects of which are still with us to the present day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Roman Civil Wars, you take command. You choose your army, your troop types, weapons and armor, then play them against the computer AI or a human opponent. The game combines history with playability to deliver an exciting tactical level conflict on Rome's battlefields.&lt;br/&gt; The game includes all of the previous series capabilities, including a Scenario Editor for editing and creating new scenarios and orders of battle. New features include &amp;ndash; unique unit types, competition style battles, limited missile supply, and morale impact. These additions make for a new and exciting game in HPS's Ancient Warfare series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
