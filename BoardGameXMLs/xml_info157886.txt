							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dhampir</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first and most important thing to remember about Dhampir is they are unwanted. Unloved. Unwelcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dhampir are the living children of vampires, one in a million anomalies created only by circumstance and tragedy. They share many of the vampire&amp;rsquo;s strengths, and lack many of the traditional vampire weaknesses. Able to walk in daylight and live among humans, they remain outsiders, both by choice and by circumstance. Most Dhampir share their undead parent&amp;rsquo;s predatory outlook. Those do don&amp;rsquo;t become thieves, killers and rogues might take up the time-honored but fundamentally shunned profession of vampire hunter, destroying their undead &amp;lsquo;siblings&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dhampir are a new race suitable for any gothic-flavored Pathfinder Roleplaying Game campaign. Dhampir are powerful, elegant, skillful and as dark as you want them to be. Dhampir can be dangerous villains or highly competent monster hunters, or both, as the situation demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
