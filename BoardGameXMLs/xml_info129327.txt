			<description>- From the publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative, highly-technological society in Earth&amp;rsquo;s distant future built a robotic Dyson Shell world where science was king, where reason was law, and where all the complexities of day-to-day living were made easy by a level of gadgets that would make modern humanity believe they were witnessing the true works of gods. Their cutting-edge world expanded rapidly and disconnected from the rest of humanity, rocketed out to the edge of the universe, and hurtled into the very fabric of space-time in order to discover new sources of untapped power to expand their knowledge of the universe itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then it happened: they found an energy source so powerful they were convinced it had to be the very glue that held the universe together. They tapped it deep, plunging into the distant beating heart of this new spark, causing their robotic world to nearly burst with inscrutable power. Feats of unimaginable prowess were discovered, manifesting objects and energy with only one&amp;rsquo;s thoughts became a reality&amp;mdash;even the control over life and death became as trivial as breathing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What they didn&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;mdash;couldn&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;mdash;was that their newly discovered source came with a dreadful price. At its heart was darkness, vast unfathomable evil from beyond the edge of reason and space-time&amp;mdash;shadowy, slithering horrors of such sinister potency that they infested the entire society from the inside out and not only tore it to pieces, but nearly sundered the world and sent every living thing spinning into a shattered, morose millennium of bedlam and anarchy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
