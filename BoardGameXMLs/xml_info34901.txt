							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mercenary Air Squadron World War II: Mediterranean Theater of Operations</name>
									
			<description>In 1936, as the Spanish Civil War heated up, representatives of Spanish Republicans began hiring American pilots to fight in the war.  The Yankee Squadron, led by Bert Acosta, fought Franco&amp;rsquo;s White planes. Each pilot was paid $1,500 a month and a bonus of $1,000 for each enemy plane shot down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In MAS-WWII:MTO, we take that idea and run with it.  You can form a squadron at anytime from just before the start of World War II to the end of 1943 and see if you can prosper from the chaos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We begin by focusing on the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.  With access to Commonwealth, French, German, and Italian aircraft, players can get their MAS up and running by fighting in one of the most turbulent theaters of action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAS-WWII:MTO is the first product in a series that takes the fun and excitement of Mercenary Air Squadron and transplants into the era of World War II.  Ownership of Mercenary Air Squadron is required to fully utilize MAS-WWII:MTO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Mercenary Air Squadron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
