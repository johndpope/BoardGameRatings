			<description>The object of the game is to be the first to get to your dream date in the center of the board. To get there, you need to prove you are worthy by scoring romance points in the outer ring and then collecting romantic gifts in the inner ring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll find yourself answering tricky questions, playing footsies and giving other players Eskimo kisses - just to win the points and gifts you need to be the first to get to your dream date!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tie-in game for the Australian magazine &amp;quot;That's Life!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
