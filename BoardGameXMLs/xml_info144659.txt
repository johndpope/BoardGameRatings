							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Save Our Ship</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cascadia Adventures 1: Save Our Ship is the first in a set of adventures by Gypsy Knights Games set in the Cascadia subsector of the Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;quot;whale ship&amp;quot;.  That's what the casinos on Chance call a starship sent to ferry back a wealthy gambler.  The Razz Casino dispatched their &amp;quot;whale ship&amp;quot;, Royal Flush, to pick up an influential politician on Roskilde.  However, something has gone wrong.  Now the casino has hired you to find out what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another casino horning in on the business?  Political enemies?  An accident?  It is up to you to find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cascadia Adventures 1: Save Our Ship comes with an exciting adventure, nine pre-generated characters, and tons of NPCs.  In addition, Save Our Ship features stats and deckplans for the Rucker-class ship, a common &amp;quot;oddjob&amp;quot; ship in the Clement Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Save Our Ship can be modified for use in any Traveller setting, it is recommended that Referees have access to Subsector Sourcebook 1: Cascadia and Hub Federation to make full use of this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like all our products, the main intention of this book is to provide an extra spark to the Referee's imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
