			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over a number of rounds, each representing a formal ball, with each ball divided into four phases: Invitation, Preparation, Encounter, and Resolution. After there have been a number of balls equal to one more than the number of players, the game ends and the player with the highest social status is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be played over social media where all responses are shared by all participants.  The game also is designed to handle large numbers of players - from five to fifteen being optimal.  Player characters take turns hosting balls in the virtual social media world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
