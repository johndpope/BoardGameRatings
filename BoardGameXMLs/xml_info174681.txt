			<description>Elliot Moose Counting Game is a game designed to teach numbers and test memory for young children. It can be played three different ways. The main game is called &amp;quot;Elliot Moose Counting Board Game.&amp;quot; In this game, players roll a die to move their pieces around a track around the outside edge of the board. When they land on a space, they take the tile depicting a number or objects. They must then choose a face-down tile from the middle with a number printed on it. If the number matches, they keep the pair. If it does not match, both tiles are returned to their places and the next player takes a turn. When all pairs are claimed, the game ends and the player with the most pairs wins. Players can also choose to play &amp;quot;Counting Memory,&amp;quot; which plays similarly but with the die and track removed. Players simply choose a tile from a stack and try to pick the face-down number tile that matches the number of items depicted on the card. Another option is &amp;quot;Guess Which Number!&amp;quot; where one number tile is hidden, the other are placed face-down and players take turns guessing which number is missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
