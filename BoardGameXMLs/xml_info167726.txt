			<description>&amp;quot;Hello! Welcome to our testing grounds! Today we will be testing something we like to call It. It was once a person like you, and he still is... sort of. Just remember that It will kill you if It finds you. So don't get found! Try to find your way out of here alive, and maybe we will reward you! Ha ha ha! Hope to speak to you soon!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to It, an intense survival horror game. Attempt to escape a strange laboratory while being chased by It, a humanoid creature who wishes to kill you. Find food, run, hide and explore in It, my very first text adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
