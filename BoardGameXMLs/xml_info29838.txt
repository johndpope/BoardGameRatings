			<description>SHA-EE is a path-building game. Players start at the edge of the board and place triangular tiles to extend their paths towards the center space. There are restrictions on when each section of the board can be entered. Some spaces must be occupied by the players' small guard pieces; occupying some of these spaces requires rolling the special die, and occupation of others can be challenged, which also requires rolling the die. The game ends when someone occupies the center space with their king, but the winner of the game is the one who scores the most points from their occupied spaces, not necessarily the player who reaches the center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
