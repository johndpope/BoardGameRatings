							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Knowledge Box</name>
									
			<description>This appears to be an c. 1870s card game that elaborates on the basic Authors/Go Fish mechanic (asking other players for cards that complete sets). The box features a dull-colored lithograph of Niagara Falls. The cards are not illustrated and are square with plain white backs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is undated and bears no copyright, patent or company name except a small white triangle containing the initials E.I.H. This suggests an early publication by E.I. Horsman, which started as a doll manufacturer in 1865 and by the mid-1880s was having a battle with Milton Bradley over the rights to Halma and was prominently displaying patents and copyrights on its boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card deck has 48 cards divided into 12 sets of four cards each. The 12 categories are: Great Poets; Great Dramatists; Great Historians; Great Painters; Great Musical Composers; Great Philosophers; Great Astronomers; Great Naval Commanders; Great Rulers; Great Pieces of Sculpture; Great Events; and Natural Wonders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main rules difference from Authors is that the sets are grouped into four trios. For instance, Poets, Dramatists and Historians form one of the trios. Winning two sets of a trio is worth three points instead of two, and winning all three is worth five points. Individual sets count a single point, but the person with the largest number of sets of any kind gets a two-point bonus. Most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
