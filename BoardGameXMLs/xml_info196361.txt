							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zip Wire Zoom</name>
									
			<description>Zip Wire Zoom is a 3D endless action game where the player takes control of a fearless zipwirer swooping over a picturesque beach, racing to get as far as possible before the sun sets. Collecting small suns keeps the day going for longer, allowing the player to outrun the setting sun as they hurtle towards the endless horizon. Skull and crossbones impede progress, as crashing into them causes a loss of momentum, so careful dexterity and quick reactions are essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With such a simple game mechanic in place we decided to enhance the experience with some features that would increase the game&amp;rsquo;s depth and longevity. A special power system whereby the player must collect three rare items (ice cream, a starfish and a musical note) gives a massive increase in speed and magnetic ability to attract suns to the player. Together with increasingly challenging patterns of suns and skulls, this provides tonnes of variety and moreish action to keep players coming back for more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
