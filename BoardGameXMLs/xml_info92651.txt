			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURE SCENARIO:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Awakening: A complete 32-page adventure for 4-6 characters of levels 7-8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stupid dwarves.  You visit their delve, and they announce that they are all off to belt the living daylights out of some troublesome goblins.  And can you go along? No chance, it's some sort of 'crusade', and they don't want outsiders along. So, all they are prepared to offer you is the honour of defending all the old dwarves and the kiddies and the others who haven't gone off on the goblin-bash. So, it looks like you'll just have to sit around and drink all the beer and be bored until they...&lt;br/&gt;Wait - what's this? A raid on a neighbouring delve; that's a stroke of luck. Now you can chase the raiders, beat themup, and then the dwarves will be grateful and you can drink some more of their beer. What could be simpler?&lt;br/&gt;Background information for the Pelinore campaign is presented on page 48.&lt;br/&gt;Inside front cover has a map for this adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OTHER FEATURES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race Relations: Non-human races in D&amp;amp;D and AD&amp;amp;D&lt;br/&gt; Pelinore Campaign World &lt;br/&gt;- The City League: The Old Wharf&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Red Swords: A Brief Encounter for Oriental Adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Letters, News, and Reviews&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
