							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Radar Rat Race</name>
									
			<description>Radar Rat Race was a 1981 game for the Commodore VIC-20, later converted to the Commodore 64. It was among thirty game titles marketed by Commodore on cartridges. It was a clone of the Namco arcade game Rally-X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player guides a mouse through a large maze. The camera follows the mouse and shows only a small portion of the maze at any given time. The player is pursued by at least three rats. The goal is to eat all of the pieces of cheese, shown for the entire maze on a radar screen, without getting caught by a rat or bumping into a stationary cat. By pressing the joystick button the mouse can disperse a limited amount of magical dust which confuses the rats for about five seconds.&lt;br/&gt;Once the round is complete, the game starts again, with more rats and faster play.&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay is accompanied by a frenetic, rhythmically altered version of a phrase from Three Blind Mice, which cycles endlessly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Radar Rat Race&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
