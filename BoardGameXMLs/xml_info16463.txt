							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sesame Street Number Puzzles Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's puzzle building game with a Sesame Street theme. Each piece in a puzzle has a number on it. To begin, you must spin a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Wild&amp;quot; on the spinner. You then take the #1 piece of a puzzle and place it in front of you. After that, you may collect pieces in any order, assembling them as you collect them. Each area on the spinner has two numbers. You may collect either numbered piece indicated (but not both). Spinning the Wild space let's you collect any piece. The first player to complete his or her puzzle wins. An advanced game requires players to build 2 puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
