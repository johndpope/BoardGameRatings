			<description>back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planet Ttam in the Galaxy of the Angels has slowly drifted into an asteroid belt, making in uninhabitable. You&amp;rsquo;ve been sent by the Space Bund to rescue the Ttamian settlers from their bombarded planet. You will need to maneuver your shuttle craft down through the asteroids into the narrow landing wells, load your refugees and head back up to the mother ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, among the many asteroids which have blasted into Ttam&amp;rsquo;s surface were several dragon eggs which have since hatched. The dragons seem to have developed a taste for Ttamians, and can be counted on to thwart your rescue efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
