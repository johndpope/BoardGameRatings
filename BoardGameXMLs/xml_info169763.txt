							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">QUALIA 3: Multi Agent</name>
									
			<description>In the unknown expanse of the deep sea, survival of the fittest is taken to a whole new level. The weak always perish and only the strong survive. To withstand the harshness of the depths, many creatures must evolve into exotic and dangerous beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Qualia 3, you play as one such creature, a &amp;quot;Multi Agent&amp;quot;, who is comprised of three different creature parts. To become stronger, you will need to gain access to more powerful creature parts. But the only way to do this is to kill other creatures, collect their energy, and obtain trophies. If you succeed at this, you will gain dominion over the deep sea, becoming its apex predator! But if you fail, you will become just another part of the food chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     26 Unique Body Parts: Collect energy balls from fallen sea creatures to obtain a variety of creature parts. Discover the right combination that best suits your play style!&lt;br/&gt;     8 Action-Packed Stages: Test your Multi Agent against the predators of the deep in 8 stages, each more challenging than the last. Conquer a powerful boss at the end of each level!&lt;br/&gt;     Meaningful Trophies: Each trophy offers a substantial reward in the form of energy, which is used to purchase creature parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
