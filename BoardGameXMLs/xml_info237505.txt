							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Pieces of Flotsam and Jetsam To Find On A Beach</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should characters be beside a body of water at some point, especially large ones such as seas and oceans, they may stumble across various bits of debris and other items that could be found on a beach, whether rocky or otherwise. These could be lost or discarded from ships or simply usually found in such locations. This list has 100 different such items, from scene dressing to useful to valuable to potential adventure hooks to potentially dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PDF supports Adobe layers and the page backgrounds and images can be disabled to make printing easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ivory-inlaid snuff box. It is worth 100 gold pieces, but a suitable skill check reveals that the crest of a boar smashing a ship belonged to the infamous privateer Sir Brutus Blackwater. To the right expert, such a piece of history could fetch as much as 1,000 gp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover, one the front matter and around half a page is the introduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is also available in a version for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The latter is a bit longer and includes Pathfinder stats for some items. You do not need to buy both versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
