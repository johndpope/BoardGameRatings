							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Judge Dredd Companion</name>
									
			<description>This hefty hardback is a companion to the wonderful Judge Dredd - The Roleplaying Game, and it's stuffed with all kinds of additions, articles, and adventures to spice up your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a start there are new rules, special abilities, and even a whole new branch of the Justice Department in the shape of (gulp!) Judge Exorcists. There are super-powered vigilantes, the rules for Shuggy, a guide to Brit Cit One, and a fully-detailed sector of the City! There's even a pull-out-and-play boardgame which recreates that infamous Mega City one pastime known as Block Out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then: the adventures! Ease your players gently into the swing of things with On the Beat, knock 'em for six with Channel Nine Crime Time Special, and then finish 'em off completely with Fear and Loathing in Mega City One.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
