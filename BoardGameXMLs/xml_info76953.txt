			<description>[From the manual]:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long, long ago, evil spirits appeared in the land of Hyrule and just as the world was about to be cast in the darkest of shadows... the tiny Picori descended from the skies and bestowed on a courageous human a shining golden light and a single sword.&lt;br/&gt;This bravest of men used his wisdom and courage, his golden light and his sword to fight off the demons and restore peace to the world.&lt;br/&gt;The people were so grateful to the Picori that they began to hold a Picori Festival once a year. And then, long after, when the Picori had passed into legend...&lt;br/&gt;Princess Zelda of the Kingdom of Hyrule comes to invite her childhood friend Link to go and see the Picori Festival with her. There is a legend in the land of Hyrule that goes...&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Just once in every 100 years, a secret door opens, and the Picori come to visit.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;This year is that year in 100, and the festival is unusually grand.&lt;br/&gt;A Sword-Fighting Tournament that calls to mind the heroes of legend is taking place at Hyrule Castle during the festival. This year's champion is a man by the name of Vaati. He wins the tournament with some ease, using dubious means that the brave men assembled there could not hope to match. And yet, not a single person knows this shadowy figure.&lt;br/&gt;Exactly who could Vaati be. And what is he really up to...?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
