							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3 Code Football</name>
									
			<description>The board features a Football (Soccer) pitch on 1 side and a Rugby League / Rugby Union pitch on the other, each being a 28 x 19 grid covered with symbols (letter pairs and crosses) which allow special movement and passing options. Rules are provided for each of the 3 codes. You place your team of men onto the board (ie 11, 13 or 15 counters) into standard starting positions and kick off. Generally a turn is to move one of your men 1 space (with the option of passing the ball), but trying to take advantage of the board's special options to progress down the field and score a goal / try, while your opponent moves their men into defensive positions to tackle (hop over) and regain the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
