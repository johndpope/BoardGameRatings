			<description>The game revolves around the changing patterns of sunspots during their approximately 11-year cycles. Each player has 11 wooden disks in one color. The circular board is divided into eleven sectors grouped into two areas: a 6-sector zone where players try to have as much sunspots as possible, and a 5-sector area, where the aim is to place as few sunspots as possible. Sunspots are represented by pips on dice faces. Each sector shows a rating number (5,8,9,10,13 or 15 in the 'max' sectors, and 9,10, 11, 13 or 17 in the 'min' sectors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three standard dice to roll and ca. 60 small dice used to represent sunspots. The 11 sectors are divided into two circular annuli (outer and inner ring), one for each player.&lt;br/&gt;Players alternate rolling three dice (1-3 dice can be rolled one additional time, if the player so wishes). The final three rolled values are added to produce a number of 'sunspots' that are then placed on any free sector in the player's ring. If the opponent has the same number of sunspots in the inner or outer adjacent ring, the sunspots from both sectors are removed. If both players have different number of sunspots in the two fields on a given sector, the player with the higher (in a 'max' sector) or lower (in a 'min' sector) number wins the sector, which changes the turn order so that it's now this player's turn again. At the end of the game, players add the rating values of the sectors they have won. The player with the highest rating is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
