							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1862: Pea Ridge</name>
									
			<description>(from wargamedownloads.com)&lt;br/&gt;1862  Pea Ridge (American Civil War in 3D)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D sees the Union army under General Samuel R Curtis is entrenched just south of Pea Ridge, Arkansas. Curtis is unaware that a numerically superior Confederate army lead by General Earl Von Dorn is converging on his position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Confederates make a dawn strike from the north around Pea Ridge having spent two days outflanking the entrenchments of the Union army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pea Ridge initially has a time limit of 12 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their objective. The game can be extended into a second day of conflict. Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 2-3 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
