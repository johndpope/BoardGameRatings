							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">After Zombies Adventure Locale 2: Solace Police Department</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome back! This is Adventure Locale #2: Solace Police Department. Each locale features a fully detailed sandbox location. Why the PCs are there is between them and the Game Master. Perhaps the PCs just saw the location and decided it would be worth investigating. Given the location we&amp;rsquo;ve picked this time that&amp;rsquo;s an especially likely outcome, as the area seems not to have been looted previously and likely has guns and ammunition in large quantities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s a reason the place hasn&amp;rsquo;t been looted and a frontal assault is quite a risky proposition. Clever PCs will try and see if there isn&amp;rsquo;t an alternate method of ingress. Brute force entry from the outside is going to require explosives and will draw zombies not only from the inside, but from a long way away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately for the PCs, the building was upgraded with a grant from Homeland Security just before the fall of civilization. Every window has bulletproof glass in front of stainless steel bars. A decision was made during the dark times to seal the building and let no one in. Whether this decision was taken independently by the police chief, or mandated from the outside is unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still, the local authorities were wrong in their belief that a self-imposed quarantine would save them. After a fire in the mechanical room caused the power to go out, one of the civilian employees made a break for it out the backdoor, determined to die with her family. In the crush to reseal the door amid a wave of zombies, several officers were bitten. From then on, it was a matter of time. The police were already, to a man, as armored as they could be and even with the wealth of firearms and training at their disposal, the forces inside were unable to stem the tide. They turned, one by one, until only death remained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
