							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Revenge</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your group of Player Characters has angered a powerful wizard, and now he wants revenge! Ravlis the Red now plots the downfall of your PCs. Exactly how they managed to anger Ravlis is up to the DM&amp;hellip; you can fit a good reason into almost any campaign. Perhaps the PCs have recently killed a villain who (as it turns out) was working for Ravlis. Or perhaps the last valuable treasure they found actually belonged to Ravlis. Or perhaps they have continually been thwarting the plans of a hidden mastermind who is now revealed to be Ravlis. The choice is up to you, but Ravlis is going to try to make the PCs pay for it! Revenge is an encounter designed to be played while the PCs are traveling. Ravlis will ambush them on the road at least a day&amp;rsquo;s travel from the nearest town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brief scenario for 9th level characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
