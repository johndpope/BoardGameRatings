			<description>Blood &amp;amp; Steel - Mythological Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic game is a 2-player match, although more players are allowed in battle mode. Each player controls a god or mythological character that fights in the arena. The player who manages to drop his opponent&amp;rsquo;s hit points to zero wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character card contains icons that represent his/her characteristics. The characteristics represented are: Initiative, Strength, Reflexes, Endurance, Vigor and Hit Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play Blood &amp;amp; Steel?: The game is fairly simple, and one match can last about 10 or 20 minutes. Each turn is conducted as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st Choosing your actions: Each player has a basic identical deck of 20 cards: some are meant for movement, some are meant for attack or defense and others for action. Each player has 3 special cards that are character specific: one for attack, one for defense and one for movement. That makes for a total deck of 23 cards per player. Each player chooses three cards for the turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2nd Players roll for initiative, to determine who will conduct his actions first for this turn. Each player rolls 1d10 and adds his character&amp;rsquo;s initiative modifier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3rd Both players show simultaneously their chosen cards, but he who won the initiative conducts his actions first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
