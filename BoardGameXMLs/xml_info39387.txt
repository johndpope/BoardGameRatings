			<description>In this game, players take turns reading the big card in front of them (&amp;quot;My mother sent me to the grocery store to get...&amp;quot;) and then drawing a slip from the pile in the center of the table.  If the object drawn would be available at the location read, they keep the slip.  Play continues around until every player has drawn for one location, and then a new location is pulled.  Once all the big cards have been used, the player with the most slips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
