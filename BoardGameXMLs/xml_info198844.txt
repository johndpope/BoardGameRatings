			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you enjoy THE BLACK HACK but wish you had races?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE RACE HACK presents two overall approaches for THE BLACK HACK OSR Compatible Clone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Part One, each race is presented with two options: bonuses and penalties to attributes or features to represent racial abilities. In both cases you simply choose your class, modify it with your choice of race, and start playing as you did with the First Edition of the Advanced Version of the Original 1970's Fantasy Roleplaying Game. The races detailed are drakes, dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, halfling, half-orcs, humans, and tieflings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Part Two, racial classes are introduced and are simply additional classes for you to select, like Conjuror or Monk, as you did with the Basic Version of the the Orginal 1970's Fantasy Roleplaying Game. The classes detailed are Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
