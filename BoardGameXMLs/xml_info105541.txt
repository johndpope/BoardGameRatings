							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Joe Montana&#039;s NFL Football</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NFL goes 3D on SEGA CD! With this CD-based version, you get new 3D views that let you scan the field and then follow the ball into your receiver's hands. In video footage featuring Joe Montana, you can learn to strategize with the NFL's greatest QB. With its big-time player control, power straight ahead, spin 360 degrees to find daylight, and watch helmets fly from punishing tackles. Get into the game with SEGA CD's real football sound effects. Get replays from four 3D camera angles, including SEGA's Helmet Cam. Battle your way through a full season and the play-offs with all 28 NFL teams -- then get ready for the Super Bowl! And with the Super Bowl Greats feature, take on history's 10 best teams, including the '72 Dolphins, '76 Raiders, '78 Steelers, '84 49ers, '85 Bears and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
