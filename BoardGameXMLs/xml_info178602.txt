							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Storm Of Steel</name>
									
			<description>A centuries long interstellar war leaves survivors of the two factions stranded on a planet, fighting each other as well as internal foes and the two indigenous people of the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storm of Steel is a sci fi skirmish miniatures game derived from Shieldbash. Each trooper has a simple profile but they fight quite differently from one another. The activation system used in Shieldbash and Shieldwall gives fast turns with unpredictable swings of initiative. Leaders, cavalry, skirmishers, medics, comms, area affect weapons, exotic melee weapons and more are included. The Shieldbash system means figures don't simply trade die rolls until someone runs out of hit points; instead troopers move around the battlefield as they are pushed back or dodge of weapons fire, and infiltrators appear seemingly out of nowhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four included scenarios give a variety of tactical objectives to fight over, and a campaign system allows linking scenarios into Tales, with fighter progression between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
