			<description>Why don&amp;rsquo;t you travel to a sentimental and beautiful story hidden in the puzzle?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a story that has come down since long ago. &lt;br/&gt;It is said a cursed moon keeper was keeping the flower and tree alone that bloomed in a blue crescent moon that emerged in the night sky from time to time.&lt;br/&gt;As if he was looking forward to something eagerly for a very long time...&lt;br/&gt;The fact there was a beautiful castle called Nobilrunia here longer ago has now become a forgotten story only the moon keeper remembers. &lt;br/&gt;Then one day, the flowers in the moon began withering. &lt;br/&gt;Please help the moon keeper. &lt;br/&gt;Please find the abundant figure that used to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This app is an implementation of nonograms that presents &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; versions.  The small versions are 5x5 to 20x20 standalone images.  The large versions are 10x10 grids of a single image, each of which is 10x10 by itself.  The resolved images tell the story (mentioned above).  Some images are in color; some are in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is traditional and simple, allowing both individual cell selection or a &amp;quot;drag&amp;quot; option to select multiple adjacent cells.  Both select and reject options are available for each square in the nonogram grid.  Each puzzle allows for a certain number of errors before the player's effort is rejected (the player simply starts again from scratch).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The app allows for puzzle saving, offers hints (if desired), and is configurable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
