							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Formula One 2001</name>
									
			<description>Formula One 2001 is a racing game in the Formula One series of computer and video games. It was released for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2. It was the first game to support the Logitech racing wheel (a.k.a GT Force) (PS2 only).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formula One 2001 was the last simulation Formula One game to appear on the PSone (as the PlayStation had become known by that point, to differentiate it from the PlayStation 2). It was also the last game in the series released in the United States/Canada region before the 2005 release of F1 Grand Prix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's &amp;quot;arcade&amp;quot; mode followed a similar line to that of Formula One 2000, although incentives were now offered in the form of upgrades to the player's car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new mode&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;Challenge&amp;quot; mode&amp;mdash;was introduced. In Challenge mode, players were given a lap around Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Jenson Button's Benetton. Players who achieved a fast lap time were given a verification code, and were given the opportunity to post their winning times on the Internet to compare their times to other people's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some editions, a DVD was given for free. The DVD offers a commentated review of the 2000 Formula One season, race by race, with the option to toggle between viewing the main stream, an on-board car camera, view the pitline or see on-screen data such as lap times and positions. These features were used in the former pay-per-view F1 Digital+'s interactive coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayStation version was once again developed by Studio 33, while the PlayStation 2 version was developed by Sony Studio Liverpool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is worth noting that throughout the game the Minardi driver Tarso Marques' name is not mentioned in the commentary. 'Minardi' is used instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formula One 2001 is the first game for PlayStation 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_2001_(video_game),&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_2001_(video_game),&amp;...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
