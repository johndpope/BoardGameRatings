							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hi-Ho! Santa Claus Game</name>
									
			<description>You use a spinner to go around the board, trimming the tree in this old Christmas holiday-themed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT: To be the first player to put his 8 colored balls and Santa Claus on the Christmas Tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players spin the spinner once each turn. If the spinner lands on his color, he may put one of his colored balls in the hole on the Christmas tree that shows the matching color. If the spinner lands on the tree, he must remove one of his colored balls from the tree. If a player spins Santa Claus before he has 8 balls on the tree, he can spin again. Once a player has all his 8 balls on the tree, he spins on his turn for Santa Claus. When he has all 8 balls and spins Santa Claus, he yells out &amp;quot;Hi Ho! Santa Claus!&amp;quot;, thus winning the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
