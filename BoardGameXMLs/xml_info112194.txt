			<description>The goal of the game was to drive the tank around the playfield, collecting ten flags by driving over them, while avoiding obstacles (including rotating windmills) and the shots of computer-generated enemy tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In single player mode, you can choose four kinds of tanks, which one having different stats for shields (it's like armor), speed and ammo: Balance, Speedy, Strong and Custom (you can freely distribute 15 stat points for this one). Each stage passed increases game's difficulty (quantity and speed of enemy tanks). Furthermore, from level 6 appear yellow tanks (which are faster and more resistant than normal enemy red tanks) and every 10 levels the shields of all enemy tanks are increased by 1. Also, you can throw grenades after level 9 passed, with a cost of 10 ammo, which damages all enemy tanks in his explosive range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game supported multiplayer operation over an AppleTalk network. Each player used a single Mac, but the other players were depicted as enemy tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Spectre is often confused with the 1994 Spectre VR, an enhanced network-oriented version of the game. It and Spectre Supreme were also available for PC-compatible computers, but only Spectre was available for the Nintendo Super NES video game console.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Spectre (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
