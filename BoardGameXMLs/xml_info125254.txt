			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hundred years ago, the first Sea Lords of Freeport (Drac and Francisco) took the combined fleet of the city on a three month long journey of pillage and plunger. Known as the Great Raid, this action netted the city more booty than it had ever seen, and established the reputation of the Sea Lords. Although Drac and Francisco were later to struggle bitterly for rulership of the city, the Great Raid is remembered proudly by the people of Freeport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pride manifests itself in a yearly holiday, marking the day that the fleet returned to harbor. Known as Swagfest, this celebration shuts the city down for the better part of two days (one day to party, one day to recover and clean up). Many special events are held during Swagfest, and local luminaries never miss the opportunity to butter up the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
