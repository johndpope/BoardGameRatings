			<description>&lt;br/&gt;The Situation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On December 9th, 1940, the British Western Desert Force launched their first offensive of World War Two, catching the Italian 10th Army completely off guard. Although greatly outnumbered, the British dominated by outmaneuvering the Italians with their superior armored vehicles. In the battles of Sidi Barani, Bardia, Tobruk, and Mechili, the Italian 10th Army had been soundly defeated but remained intact to defend the gates of Tripoli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this, the 58th day of the offensive, the remaining operational tanks of 7th British Armoured Division and a small advanced detachment of men, guns, and armored cars are attempting to block the last escape route for the Italians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Italians, yet unaware of the fast approaching Western Desert blocking force, will soon find themselves desperately racing against time to break through near the small village of Beda Fomm and escape into Tripolitania before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time is 1200 hrs, 5 February 1941&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete destruction of the remnants of the Italian 10th Army hangs in the balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beda Fomm marks the triumphant return of one of the truly classic gaming gems originally released in 1979 by Game Designers Workshop during what many consider the heyday of traditional conflict simulation gaming. This fast-playing, operational-level game of the Battle of Beda Fomm represents a classic blend of simple gaming mechanics with nail-biting action suitable for solitaire or competition play.&lt;br/&gt; Relive the drama as the British player, maneuvering your outnumbered but superior armored vehicles and supporting personnel and weapon units to cut-off and summarily destroy the retreating Italian forces. As the Italian player, you have strength in overall numbers, but your formations are brittle and are hampered by a lack of maneuverability in attempting to break through and escape complete destruction. Simple mechanics capture the flavor of desert warfare along with the unique qualities and characteristics of the opposing forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Consim Press edition represents a re-mastering of the original release by introducing many enhancements while remaining true to the original game design. This all-new edition features a full size game map, newly-designed counters with additional game markers, and updated rules presentation. You&amp;rsquo;re sure to enjoy this classic Frank Chadwick game design like never before!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Consim Press edition represents a re-mastering of the original release by introducing many enhancements while remaining true to the original game design.
