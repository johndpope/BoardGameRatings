			<description>The Classic Video Arcade Owners Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic video arcade in the golden age of gaming! Experience the lights, sounds &amp;amp; fun of the greatest arcade games on show and own them all! With players playing, buying &amp;amp; repairing cabinets the action heats up fast! Look out for power cuts, free plays, breakdowns and remember to empty your cabinets of all those shiny coins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Arcade-opoly is a 1(solo) to 4 player game where players dash around a classic video game arcade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to buy and setup arcade games and begin to earn quarters from them. Your opponents will have to insert coins to play your arcade games should they stop in front them. Popular games will earn you double but don&amp;rsquo;t let your games break as &amp;ldquo;Out Of Order&amp;rdquo; games will earn you nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the arcade clockwise by first throwing both a black and a white die. You may only move with either dice, choose wisely which of the dice to move with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay cards collected by landing on the Gameplay spaces can help or hinder you. Some cards will offer free games, free plays or free repairs. Other cards though will trigger power cuts, force you to play an opponents game, move with only with one die or even send you back to Level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you must be the first to collect enough coins from your arcade games coin box and reach the target money amount of 70 quarters. Be careful not to play or buy too many games because other costs may arise such as repair bills, loose change, power cuts and game crashes. Should a player lose all their startup money of 30 quarters the game ends. All the remaining players can then total up any coins left in their games with the highest being declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique features:&lt;br/&gt;Classic video game arcade theme.&lt;br/&gt;2 dice choice mechanic&lt;br/&gt;Money track scoring&lt;br/&gt;16 colour wooden arcade cabinets&lt;br/&gt;50 plastic coin Quarters to play &amp;amp; collect from the machines&lt;br/&gt;36 gameplay cards&lt;br/&gt;Power cuts, Free Plays, Free Repair and &amp;ldquo;Out Of Order&amp;rdquo; events&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Top Games&amp;rdquo; that earn double their price.&lt;br/&gt;45 minute playtime.&lt;br/&gt;3 lives per player for extended play.&lt;br/&gt;Solo play variant as you compete against three CPU players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
