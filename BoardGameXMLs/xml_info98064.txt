							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The World of Gaianar: Second Edition</name>
									
			<description>From &amp;quot;World Background&amp;quot; on website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was once a time when the world of Gaianar was a world of life, beauty and peace. But that was centuries ago. A time of technology it was, with ships of the sea, beneath the sea, upon the wind, and beyond the world. Great machines generated energy that powered technological devices; robots aided in man's chores and man's fighting. Computers let people speak across great distances. Medicine brought the sick and wounded back from the brink of death. Underground trains brought people across a continent in a handful of hours. But the world was shallow, corrupt, and devoid of inner strength. When the technological age came, the great nations forgot their faith in the spirit, and religion was abandoned, scoffed as an outdated superstition. With the exception of a few isolated areas, most notably the Isle of Gales, materialism and secular humanism became the only faith. This weakness of spirit would be Gaianar's downfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness fell upon the world, darkness in the form of Scaxathrom, Lord of Vipers. He wielded powers of the spirit, and used them to destroy the things of technology. The few Priests of Good that remained were powerless to stop the Viper Lord's reign. As the technological infrastructure collapsed on a global scale, millions perhaps even billions died, both from war and famine. Lord Scaxathrom was unstoppable. He ruled for fourteen decades, a time later called &amp;quot;The Wrath of Scaxathrom&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generations later, the Viper Lord was at last destroyed, by two holy warriors whom were later canonized: Saint Jareth, patron of warriors, and Saint Kyle, patron of unfair odds. They were empowered by the nearly forgotten God of Good with spiritual gifts to fight the incarnation of Evil. The Viper Lord was cast down, but not before he animated the millions of dead that lay scattered across the lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, Gaianar remains under populated, poor, and haunted. Broken, crumbling skyscrapers stand like dead sentinels against the sky. Deadly radiation belts hang over ruined nuclear power plants. And the people live by medieval standards, fighting with sticks, clubs, and swords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shambling dead still harass the living, and cultists still worship Scaxathrom as well as a host of other evil, bloodthirsty gods. They must be stopped, else the Viper Lord may yet return and destroy Gaianar forever. Gaianar is wounded, but not yet dead. In an age of unlikely heroes, there is still hope, like a candle against the darkness of night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From &amp;quot;Required Materials&amp;quot; on website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest requirements for playing this game are imagination and the desire to have fun. Beyond that, though, are a few materials that must be used:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dice - Beyond the Yatzee type dice, there are several other kinds of dice that one may buy in most hobby shops. The notation for die rolling is simple. The [qty]d[type] is used for all die rolls; thus a &amp;quot;1d4&amp;quot; means rolling a four-sided die one time, a &amp;quot;3d6&amp;quot; is thus rolling a six-sided three times. To play a character in the World of Gaianar system, the Player will need one of each of the following kinds of dice:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Four-sided die (1d4). Can be used as a 1d2 or odd/even die when result is divided by two. This die is primarily used for assessing combat damage from small weapons such as daggers.&lt;br/&gt;     Six-sided die (1d6). The d6 is frequently used for assessing combat damage from bowshot, small swords, and firearms. It can also be used as a 1d3 if the result is divided by two. This die is also used in determining combat initiative.&lt;br/&gt;     Eight-sided die (1d8). This kind of die is used in assessing healing points. It is used for assessing damage inflicted by many kinds of swords. It can also be used as a random compass rose directional generator.&lt;br/&gt;     Ten-sided die (1d10). This die can also be used as a 1d5 when the result is divided by two. Large swords and clubs inflict damage based on a 1d10. Two d10's rolled concurrently can be used as a percentile generator, i.e. rolling numbers between 1 and 100. The percentile is used in many resistance rolls as well as most thief and tracking skills.&lt;br/&gt;     Twelve-sided die (1d12). This kind of die is used for damage inflicted by powerful crossbows and large swords. It is also used for determining random encounters while the party of PC's travel.&lt;br/&gt;     Twenty-sided die (1d20). Only one die of this type is required. This die is used for determining the outcome for most forms of attacks, parries, saving throws, and ability checks. It can also be used to calculate the damage inflicted by shotguns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Record Sheets - A three-page form is provided that can be used to store all of the character's attributes, abilities, information, and possessions. The character record sheet template included with this gaming system may be photocopied as often as required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
