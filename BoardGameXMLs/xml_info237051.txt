			<description>A One-Round Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last few months have been an ordeal that you will not soon forget. Your group of famous and successful adventurers have fallen on hard times. For years you have enjoyed success in every endeavor. No mission was left uncompleted, no quest was failed and no element of danger enough to foil your plans. Your group worked together in a way that was almost legendary. Each of your comrades a seasoned professional, you pooled you skills and managed to pull off heroic deed after deed, moving onward like a well oiled machine. However, this all changed a few months ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
