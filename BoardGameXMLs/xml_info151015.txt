			<description>Card game from the Dubbel en dwars series. All cards are printed on both sides. During the game you need both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Shape Up everyone plays simultaneously. You try to play a card with an angle that corresponds (also in color) with a symbol at the top card of the discard pile. When you play a card with more equal angles, you may give a card to each other player. The first player that has played all his cards wins the game immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
