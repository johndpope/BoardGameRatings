							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadowfist: Combat In Kowloon</name>
									
			<description>The Combat In Kowloon set, from new publisher Inner Kingdom Games, saw a change in the venerable Shadowfist card game. First, it is no longer sold as randomised boosters. Instead it is a Dynamic Card Game: sets are sold as fifty card decks. Second, it removed the two-player option (dueling) for tournament play and is now focused on 3 to 4 player matches. Third, the factions of the Secret War are set to: the Ascended, Dragons, Eaters of the Lotus, Four Monarchs, Guiding Hand, and the Jammers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Combat In Kowloon boxed set included starter decks for the Ascended, Dragons, Eaters of the Lotus, and the Guiding Hand, play-mats, counters, as well as a new rulebook. (The Jammers and Four Monarchs factions would be included in the follow-up set Back For Seconds.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
