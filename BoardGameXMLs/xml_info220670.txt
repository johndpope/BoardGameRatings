							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Here There Be Spiders</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;rsquo;re a simple folk. Not like your lot, with the magical swords and impressive armor. All we have are farming tools, and while you can drive the occasional goblin away with them, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to do anything against a growing horde. And that&amp;rsquo;s the danger staring us down this very moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It started with a lone spider seen at the edge of town, approaching the children. Hideous thing, with spiked legs and a maw simply dripping with venom. Thankfully the lady-folk raised up a cry and we were able to scare it off. But that night Tommy Kerrigan spotted three at the village&amp;rsquo;s edge. And a few more the next, and so on. Now the torchlight shows far more spiders than road under your feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Some of the fool-minded among us think we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry, saying the spiders haven&amp;rsquo;t attacked yet and scatter at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice. Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to them &amp;ndash; we know sooner or later they&amp;rsquo;ll have enough numbers to overwhelm our town with nothing to fear. Which means they probably have a nest somewhere to the southeast, churning out their hellish spawn. Sure enough, Luc Unser came across such a nest the other day. We can mark it on your map if you&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is one of those imminent dangers you hear about from the larger towns, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have the strength to fix it ourselves. So we&amp;rsquo;ve put together a collection from the villagers and will give it to you for purging this menace once and for all. So what do you say? Will you help us?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2nd - 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
