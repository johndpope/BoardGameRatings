							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Renegade Dreams</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't hear the constant drone of the street, or the blaring ads of the video billboards. You don't notice the garish colors of the street vendors, hawking everything from slapcaps to pirated senso reels. You don't smell the oxides and sulfides from the factories every time the wind shifts. Even the occasional gunshot is hardly worth a glance. If you heard it, it wasn't meant for you. You don't notice, because you live here, and it all fades to the background. What you do notice is that your credit is starting to wear a little thin, and you could use some work...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So it begins. A simple interview from an electronic hiring board turns out to be more trouble than you expected, and you expected a lot, since the employer is AzBio, perhaps the most powerful megacorp on the planet. You should have guessed when you saw the reconstructive surgery option on the contract...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a bonus, Renegade Dreams also includes the full cyberspace rules for the SpaceTime universe, as well as background on how to intearate it into this and other adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
