							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Foursite 3D</name>
									
			<description>Players take turns placing blocks in a triangular grid. Each player aims to get more of their chosen symbol across the three outside playing surfaces of the pyramid. Foursite 3D is a fun way for students to develop their concentration and mathematical patterning abilities. You &amp;lsquo;scramble&amp;rsquo; the board each time you play so every game is different and a unique strategy is required. Taking only seconds to learn, Foursite 3D quickly becomes addictive as you grapple with the infinite combinations of game- play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
