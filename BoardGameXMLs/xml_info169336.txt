			<description>Gothic Line: The Campaign in Northern Italy &amp;ndash; AUGUST TO OCTOBER, 1944 is a simulation of the battles in the Northern Apennines mountains fought to cross the Po River and end the war in Italy by Christmas 1944. This game simulates the campaign at the battalion/division level. Each combat strength point of Divisions/brigades/regiments are represented by standard military unit symbols (with a few exceptions) and each combat strength point is equivalent to one combat maneuver battalion, while units represented by armoured vehicles consist primarily of battalions of tanks (or armoured cars, in the case of the cavalry/armoured car units)(armoured divisions, though having tanks, are still at least half infantry battalion units). The combat system is based on differential, rather than odds, as each combat unit fights one against one as opposed to a hex(es) unit aggregate vs unit aggregate. Corps/army artillery and air are separate components added to combat, as both played an important part in the struggle and really could not be factored into unit value. Gothic Line: The Campaign in Northern Italy &amp;ndash; AUGUST TO OCTOBER, 1944 is a desk top publishing type of game, with a self-sticking countersheet mountable on standard 1/2 inch counters, rulebook, charts, and full color map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
