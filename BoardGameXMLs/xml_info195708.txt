			<description>From the card pack:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;CAUTION: This pack will add 3 hours of fun and laughter to your next trip or party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why Sixes? Play six rounds, write down six things that fit the category, or write just one thing that fits into six different categories. Most points after six rounds (15 minutes of play time) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Match rounds, you are trying to match your Opponents' answers, and everyone is your opponent. In Unique rounds you search for answers uniquely yours. In Lightning rounds, you want six matches all in different  categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great for groups of folks who do not know each other! Terrific social get-togethers; family events; or game night fillers. This game takes only 15 minutes per session but you will want to play it over and over again for hours!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiXeS! Travel &amp;amp; Promo Pack is a promo pack for SiXeS! that provides rules and enough cards (6) to play the game. Great fun for gamers age 12 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiXeS is about things that are similar and different. Play six rounds, thinking of six things each round and trying to predict what you will write that will match &amp;mdash; or not match &amp;mdash; what the other players write, depending on whether you are in a &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; round or a &amp;quot;unique&amp;quot; round. The player with the most points after six rounds wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiXeS is #6 in the E&amp;bull;G&amp;bull;G Series from Eagle-Gryphon Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
