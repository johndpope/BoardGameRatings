							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myth: MERCS Recon Kickstarter Rewards</name>
									
			<description>This is a set of Kickstarter Exclusive rewards for Myth that was part of the MERCS: Recon Kickstarter. These were stretch goals that were unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign and were part of the &amp;quot;Myth Pledge Level&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Agent Pledge Level&amp;quot; (and higher pledge levels).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set includes the following miniatures with associated cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Inquisitor Alger (Agent)&lt;br/&gt;    Hunter (Hero; 2 figures: Male and Female)&lt;br/&gt;    X-3ONE (Mini-Boss)&lt;br/&gt;    Infected (4 figures)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agent Hero, X-3ONE Mini-Boss, and Infected may also be used with MERCS: Recon and include cards for both Myth and MERCS: Recon.  The Infected are the same as the Infected in the MERCS: Recon - Blood Contagion expansion (which is a Myth Crossover).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
