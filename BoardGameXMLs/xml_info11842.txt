			<description>Triple Flips 10 includes Outlaw and Stagecoach, Shark Attack, and Alien Invaders From Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Outlaw and Stagecoach is a 2-player game that simulates a Western chase scene, in which the outlaw tries to chase down and rob the stagecoach.  The stagecoach moves one or two spaces (determined by a die roll) along a fixed path toward East City.  The outlaw moves one or two spaces forward or backward, and may utilize the shortcuts.  Once the outlaw ends a move on the same space as the stagecoach, a gunfight occurs.  The gunfight consists of the outlaw winning three out of three rounds of &amp;quot;Who can roll a higher number on the die?&amp;quot; - re-rolling in the event of a tie.  If the stagecoach wins the gunfight, it escapes with a free move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Shark Attack sends 2-4 players diving for treasure in slightly shark-infested waters.  On your turn, you roll a die, then move in orthogonal steps, generally toward the treasure.  You may not swim through other pawns.  If you start your turn in the shark attack zone, which is 4/7 of the playfield, then you will also roll and move the shark.  The shark may swim through other pawns, but if it ends its movement on a player's pawn, that pawn goes back to the boat and starts over.  The goal is not only to get past the shark to reach the treasure, but also return through the shark's waters to the boat thereafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Alien Invaders From Space is a 1-player roll-and-move with a die-driven squad of aliens hunting you along the path.  A die roll indicates which 3-4 of six rooms are occupied by aliens.  For your attempted escape, each turn, you roll a die.  On an even roll, you move that many spaces; odd, the alien in the current room (if any) moves that many spaces, eventually getting into your path and threatening you.  One exception:  If you roll a 1, the aliens all get reset, and you roll again to determine their new three or four starting rooms.  You simply try to reach your &amp;quot;rocket ship to Earth&amp;quot; without a turn ending you and an alien on the same space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
