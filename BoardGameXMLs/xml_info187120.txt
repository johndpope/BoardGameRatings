			<description>A game of cutthroat miners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DangerMine is a PnP game which you assuming the role of a miner/ prospect which is trying to collect as much as valuable materials possible. The winner is the first person to get 55 points of minerals, however no one has said you need to dig the minerals yourself you could always try to steal it from the other unfortunate miners, will you be a honest hard-worker miner or you would choose the path of betrayal and deception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game mechanism:&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 49 mine shaft tiles, which on clear side has a mineral picture and a corresponding dice roll to extract that mineral on the collapsed side there is a die indication a +3 for dice roll for cleaning the rubble's. There are four different minerals; Diamond, gold, silver and bronze, each need a different dice rolls for successful extraction. Also there is only one tile with Diamond and it is always placed in the middle of the board.&lt;br/&gt;After placing the Diamond tile on the middle faced down, the other tiles goes randomly around that which will create a big square. Now the four entrances will be placed to the side of the fourth tile from each side. &lt;br/&gt;Players decides on which color they want to play and throw dice to see who goes first, the first player puts his token on any entrance he likes, clockwise the other do the same, they could pick an entrance which already has occupied by another player.  &lt;br/&gt;The first play will start the game, he would have two actions each round which could be; removing the rubbles (+3 dice), moving on tile (two for two actions), mining the tile for the valuable minerals (dice varies) and destroying the tile which he is on (+3 dice). &lt;br/&gt;The player could acquire the mineral depicted on the tile by a successful roll and take corresponding token from the pool, also after extraction a depleted sign is needed to be placed on the tile. Each mineral types has different winning score, whoever reaches 55 is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;Another strategic action is to destroy the tile which will force the occupant on the tile and adjusting tiles (no diagonally) to escape. Anyone except the person who caused the cave-in will drop the last mineral they have mined on effected tile and they also have two moves to escape to safety (open tile), if they failed to move to safety with in two moves than they would die and they could re-spawn from any tile they like. The destroyed tile will flip to collapse side and the depleted signs will be removed from those tiles. &lt;br/&gt;The game will proceeds until someone reaches 55 points by any means and he will be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
