			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuum was intended to be a generic/universal roleplaying game the balanced ease of play with realism.  Most of the development of Continuum was done under the name Omniverse and the Continuum rules set still contains numerous references to Omniverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in Continuum have nine Attributes (Strength, Agility, Health, Size, Reason, Will, Presence, Intuition, and Aura) than range in score from about 5 to 10.  Characters also have seven &amp;quot;Figured Attributes&amp;quot; (Base Carry, Reaction, Luck, Base Melee, Base Missile, Active Dodge, HTH Damage) which are mathematically derived from their Attributes.  Attribute scores are purchased in a point-buy system.  Characters may also have disadvantages or advantages of various impact.  Characters then select one or more skills.  Skill ranks are purchased from a point pool that is derived from Reason, Will, and age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When an opposed skill check (which includes combat) is called for, the player rolls two d6 but one is a positive result and the other is a negative result (thus, they may cancel each other).  The sum, positive or negative, is added to the Skill and Attribute score of the character and the target difficulty is subtracted from this to yield a negative number (failure) or a positive number (success).  Actions that take longer than a moment are called &amp;quot;Tasks&amp;quot; and use a series of skill checks to determine overall success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Damage in combat is derived from either the characters HTH Damage plus a weapon modifier (for e.g., swords), or simply by a weapon standard damage number (for e.g., firearms).  Damage is influenced by the recipient's size, so it's good to be big.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules also contain an extensive discussion of skills and skill resolutions, samples of things like animals and poisons, a chapter on magic and miracles, and a chapter on super powers and superheroes.  Thus, as published, the game covers standard Fantasy, Superhero, and Modern genres but does not have robust support for Science Fiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the game was initially developed prior to 1991 and evolved for about ten years before being put online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
