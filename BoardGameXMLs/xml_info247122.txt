			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you like dragons?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you like dragons to be more than just monster stat blocks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dragons Now is a collection of unique dragons to be used right away in any adventure. Here are dragons for dungeon, wilderness and urban settings, evil dragons and good, ancients and wyrmlings, living and undead. All true dragon types in the Monster Manual are covered, including the shadow dragon and the dracolich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each dragon is presented in a detailed context, often a full-blown adventure encounter with NPCs, places or magical items described as well. Some of these encounters include a map of the dragon&amp;rsquo;s lair. Each dragon is described in detail as an NPC, with appearance, personality, background and special features. The dragons also come with suggested hooks for how to use them in a campaign. In difficulty, the encounters go from lower level challenges to beyond level 20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
