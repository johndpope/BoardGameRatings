			<description>Mister Slime (known as Mr Slime in Australia and Mr. Slime Jr. in Europe) is a video game that was first released on May 2, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;The game was designed by Paul Cuisset, the former lead designer of Delphine Software International and the creator of the mega-hit Flashback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will play as the character &amp;quot;Mister Slime&amp;quot; in his adventure to protect the Slime Village from the evil enemy Axons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay of the game is based largely around the stylus and touch-screen capabilities of the Nintendo DS. The stylus is primarily used to pull Mister Slime's four elastic arms to different anchor points spread throughout the levels. On top of that, players are able to send Mister Slime flying on a gust of wind and provide him air bubbles underwater. Both functions are executed by the player blowing into the system's built-in microphone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mister Slime&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
