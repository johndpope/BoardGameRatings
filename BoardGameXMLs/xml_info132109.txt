			<description>Players use number combinations to decipher which words these combinations would produce on the keypad of a mobile phone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns rolling a six-sided die (numbers 1-4, x, &amp;quot;no reception&amp;quot;). The active player rolls the die. If he/she rolls &amp;quot;no reception&amp;quot;, the die is passed on to the next player. If a number is rolled, the red token is advanced the corresponding number of spaces on the board and all players try to work out the word marked with that number on the top card at the same time. The first player to correctly guess the word earns the number of chips specified on the card. An x on the die roll means that the active player chooses which of the four codes on the top card has to be deciphered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the red token passes the finish line. The player with the most chips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
