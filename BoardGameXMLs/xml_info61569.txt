			<description>Subtitle: A World of Steam and Sparks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Sweet Chariot 2nd Edition&amp;quot; is a self-contained StarCluster 2 RPG game. Sweet Chariot is set on the world Chariot, where most of the atmosphere is a deadly narcotic and the people live only on the tops of mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oldest Diasporan-settled world in StarCluster, Chariot was colonized when treachery was overcome by determination. Working within the limits of a hostile world, the Charioteers slowly overcame the natural obstacles in their path, and their culture now is based on steam and natural nuclear fission. The many scattered nations of Chariot are united only by the steam dirigibles that fly over the deadly Deathlands for trade and conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet Chariot is a single book containing everything needed to run a campaign on Chariot, and is interoperable with all StarCluster products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet Chariot 2nd Edition uses the StarCluster/StarPool dice pool system also used in Blood Games II. You can use Sweet Chariot 2nd Edition with the StarCluster 2 percentile system as well, if you prefer. We felt that the StarPool version gave a more &amp;quot;pulpy&amp;quot; feel to the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
