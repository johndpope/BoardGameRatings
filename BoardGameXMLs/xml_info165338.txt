			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demons can be so charming that you, Toys hero, are going to run the risk in #103 of being seduced by them. Take Oish, for instance. So wondrously constructed, so adept at unlayering the human psyche, so admiring of the staggering physical beauty of your home world. He understands you. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to free Oish just to watch his translucence flowingly manipulate his eye-pods over and around you. So stand strong. The Society of the Rose will help you resist. And keep your eye on the Hell Gate. See it opening? That&amp;rsquo;s really what it&amp;rsquo;s all about. Christmas and babies and curly haired kids - they&amp;rsquo;re all at stake. So dose up on discipline. This fight is about making the world safe for a truly dominant life form that&amp;rsquo;s smart and funny and righteous. Yup. You heard your name. You&amp;rsquo;re it. It&amp;rsquo;s your job. Do it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
