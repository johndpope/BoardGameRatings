			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher blurb:Friendship comes in many colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take your adventure far beyond Equestria&amp;rsquo;s borders with this: the first sourcebook for Tails of Equestria. Based on MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE, this book contains everything you need to bring new and exciting characters, locations, and stories to your Tails of Equestria game. With new player options and tons of Gamemaster info, The Official Movie Sourcebook is a fantastic way to expand the boundaries of your Tails of Equestria game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW LOCATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve left the comforts of Equestria behind &amp;mdash; ahead of you lies a mysterious realm of unknown adventure, hidden lore, and magical wonders! The Official Movie Sourcebook contains expanded details on the locations featured in MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE, in particular the bustling streets of Klugetown, the ancient citadel on Mount Aris, and the underwater realm of Seaquestria! As well as detailed descriptions, this book also contains advice for Gamemasters on how to incorporate these locations into a game in urban and underwater adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW NON-PONY CHARACTERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A parrot swings from a chandelier, flips in the air and lands with panache. A Lizardfolk explorer guides his friends through Klugetown. A Hippogriff soars through uncharted sky to deliver a vital message, and a Cat carefully disables an underwater ruin&amp;rsquo;s trapdoor. The Official Movie Sourcebook contains four new playable non-pony races:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Nimble, roguish Cats.&lt;br/&gt;    Swashbuckling Parrots, with striking plumage.&lt;br/&gt;    Brave and honourable Hippogriffs.&lt;br/&gt;    Shrewd and intelligent Lizardfolk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EXPANDED RULES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to bring more depth to your Tails of Equestria game, these rules are for you! Both within and beyond Equestria, adventurers often meet factions and organizations of many kinds. The faction and reputation rules presented within give a bit more context to these relationships and help keep track of who the players know, whether that reputation is good or&amp;hellip;not so good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional vehicle rules detail how players can obtain, customize, and use their own personal vehicles. Beyond Equestria, long distance travel becomes a lot more difficult, so having your own airship is a real advantage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A NEW ADVENTURE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Beasts of Black Skull Island&amp;rsquo; is the perfect way to kickstart your groups adventures outside Equestria. Join the crew of adventurous pirate Captain Rosella and hunt for the legendary treasure of Black Skull Island! But beware, somepony else might have gotten there first&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEW CHARACTERS &amp;amp; CREATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Official Movie Sourcebook contains loads of new stats for NPC characters from MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE. You&amp;rsquo;ll find everything from friendly faces like Capper and Princess Skystar, to the villainous Storm King, Tempest Shadow, and their minions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the new content and rules included in The Official Movie Sourcebook are, of course, 100% compatible with all other products in the Tails of Equestria range. So saddle up, take to the skies, and seek out adventure in the wide world ahead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
