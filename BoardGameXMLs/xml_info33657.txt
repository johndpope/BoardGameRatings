							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deep Space DrillerAce</name>
									
			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;Become a Deep Space DrillerAce. Oil and water are in short supply. The rulers of earth are becoming desperate. You and your opponent have been sent to the planet Arual where oil and water are abundant. Arual is inhabited by a superstitious race. The Arualians have agreed to allow you and your opponent to drill a maximum of 61 wells either for oil or water, but only at a strictly controlled rate. The Arualians are somewhat primitive and you have discovered that they revere a series of sacred symbols. When you place your Driller Domes in a pattern that resembles one of these symbols, the Arualians will allow you to drill wells at a faster rate. Your goal is to place more Driller Domes than your opponent and return home with the title of &amp;quot;Deep Space DrillerAce&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep Space DrillerAce is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. &lt;br/&gt;Players take turns placing glass Driller Domes on a hex board in an attempt to complete patterns that are shown on cards in their hand. When patterns are completed the player is allowed to immediately place more Driller Domes. The winner is the first player to place all 33 of his Driller Domes or the player with the most Domes on the board when it is completely filled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with: 1 game board, 66 glass Driller Domes, 40 pattern cards and 1 rules sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
