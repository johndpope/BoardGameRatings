			<description>Caribbean Pirates is a fast moving family dice game, from MM Games.&lt;br/&gt;Each turn you must decide whether to roll the treasure dice to hunt for gold pieces on Treasure Island or to roll the plunder dice and attempt to steal gold from another player. Players only roll one dice per turn.&lt;br/&gt;When rolling the treasure dice you will either gain a gold coin or you will be forced to walk the plank and one of your coins will be lost at sea.&lt;br/&gt;When trying to loot another player&amp;rsquo;s booty you must beware as they could defend against your attack or your ship might be hit by the dreaded tidal wave.&lt;br/&gt;When all the gold has been looted from Treasure Island, the pirate with the biggest stash wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caribbean Pirates is a Print and Play dice game for 2 to 5 players (age 6 and up).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
