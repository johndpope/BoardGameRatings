							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leo Christopherson TRS-80 Animated Game Disk</name>
							<name  sortindex="1">Leo&#039;s Greatest Hits</name>
									
			<description>Catalog Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the greatest values in games ever produced. Leo Christopherson wrote the very first animated game for the TRS-80 and the country went wild for it. Androd Nim will make everyone laugh to watch these life-like creatures as they shake their heads up and down or side to side and blink at your stupidly as they wait for you to make a move. Then Leo invented how to make the TRS-80 produce sound and added it to NIM. He then followed Android Nim with the other games, even getting Radio Shak to sell Dancing Demons, which is a real scream. It alone is well worth the price of this disk; but you get ALL of Leo's programs on one disk for one great low price. If you haven't yet bought this disk, do it now! It is a classic! Each one of these games originally sold for $9.95 - $19.95 EACH. The disk includes the famous games: ANDROID NIM, BEEWARY, DUELING DROIDS, DANCING DEMONS (once sold by Radio Shack for $14.95), SNAKE EGGS, and ANIMATED LIFE. All games feature full sound effects and some of them are even in 3-part harmony! You and your family will just love this disk! Dancing Demon even features saving your song and dance routines to disk and four of them are included! The possibilities are endless and it is always entertaining. A great way to &amp;quot;show off&amp;quot; what your computer can do and always fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
