			<description>Subtitled: 5000 years of dice and dicing&lt;br/&gt;This 192-page book covers the entire history of dice in many cultures.  It summarizes the many dice that have been found in sites of antiquity around the world.  The history then moves into various efforts to outlaw or tax gambling with dice.  There's also a chapter on dice cheating and another on modern dice.  The book is peppered with interesting stories and legends that revolve around dice.  If you ever wondered why many bone dice are hollow, it's explained.  If you want to know where the best museum exhibits of dice are, it's also covered.  The origins and evolution of many dice games are covered as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book is heavily illustrated with drawings and photographs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The copy I read was a complimentary copy published under the auspices of Dice &amp;amp; Games Ltd and translated from the original Dutch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
