							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blackout</name>
									
			<description>Blackout predates American involvement in, but not awareness of, World War II. In this game, players roll dice and cover (or &amp;quot;black out&amp;quot;) the matching spaces of their respective cities. The first player to fully cover his city announces &amp;quot;BLACKOUT&amp;quot; and wins the game. Counters are also provided in case the players wish to play a series of games, with each player losing one counter per uncovered space to the victor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the dice only passes from one player to another when he is unable to use his roll to cover spaces in his city (and another player *can* use that roll to do so), it is possible for a player to win on his first turn. In that case the, payout for the multi-game series is limited to five counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackout appeared in both the traditional narrow box (folded board) and wide box (unfolded board) formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
