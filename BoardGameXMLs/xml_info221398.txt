							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eternal Kings</name>
									
			<description>Eternal Kings is a two-player card game that combines the classic strategy of chess with the diverse combos of a card game! You control your experience in the game: first by constructing your own unique deck of cards, then by using their unique abilities to destroy your opponent on the  field of battle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are already familiar with chess, you will recognize many of the mechanics in Eternal Kings, but you will find the experience to be totally new and exciting! The abilities of the playing pieces, the special ability cards, and even the whim of chance will make every encounter on the board a tense and exciting turning point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player builds an &amp;quot;army&amp;quot; of 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, a queen and a king, and places those cards (creatures) on the board. When building your army, you can choose from over 48 unique types of creatures. Each type of creature has a unique move set and abilities that they can perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also an ability deck that each player constructs before playing. These &amp;quot;ability cards&amp;quot; are randomly drawn during the game that allow creatures to perform additional actions. There are over 40 unique ability cards to choose from. Ability cards are held in a player's &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; until used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving and developing one or more of their creatures in attempt to eliminate their opponent's king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
