			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exact name of this game is somewhat obscure - for this listing, I have used the name with which it was formally identified during the competition period (although this name does not occur in the document).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by race, attribute, and skill.  All resolution rolls are made on 3d6 - skilled characters take the highest pair of dice; unskilled characters take the lowest pair of dice.  The resulting pair are summed and compared to a target difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended to take place in a magical academy, the document provides very little definition of the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
