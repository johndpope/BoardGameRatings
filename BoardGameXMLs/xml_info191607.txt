			<description>After a boat tour, you crash on an uncharted island where you find five castaways willing to help you. The problem is that others on the island &amp;mdash; other players, that is &amp;mdash; are also using YOUR people, and they are not being honest about where they are or what they are doing. You might want to get them exiled to insure you fare the best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Marooned 5, use the five castaways to help build your raft and get off the island; lounge at the resort sipping drinks with a famous actress; gather and monetize water; or exile all the other players. The player with the most victory points or the last player standing wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt one worker and one location and use these two cards to create worker placement. You can be honest and safe, or get ahead by claiming the best roles, locations and combos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
