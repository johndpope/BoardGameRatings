			<description>A promotional game (subtitled &amp;quot;The Tea Game&amp;quot;) based on Alex Randolph's and Michael Matschoss' Enchanted Forest (this is not credited on the box or in the rules; it is obviously produced by Ravensburger though also uncredited).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dethlefsen &amp;amp; Balk is a tea merchant and so the players travel over a world map where 13 small cardboard tea trees with different symbols on their underside are placed on cities connected to the tea industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may look under trees and memorize their symbol to collect cards (lying in Hamburg) with the matching symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some spaces force a player to draw an event card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
