							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Consular Teacher</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Teacher has learned all they can and now seek to share that wisdom with others; bring out the full potential of your Consular and their students with the Teacher Specialization Deck for the Star Wars&amp;trade;: Force and Destiny&amp;trade; roleplaying game. Each Force and Destiny Specialization Deck includes twenty cards detailing the talents of a specialization. More than just quick reference cards for the gaming table, the Teacher Specialization Deck features thematic art on every card to help bring the Star Wars galaxy to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the dissolution of the Jedi Order, how might a Consular knowledgeable in the ways of the Force benefit the galaxy? The Teacher specialization encourages the learned scholar to do something proactive with that knowledge: pass it on to another. A skilled teacher does not simply impart their skills on their students; no, they work to enhance the innate abilities of all who would learn from them. When working with such a mentor, a student is able to attain far greater heights than they would alone. While some Teachers still use a more formal school, many will just as easily turn a bog or a freighter cargo hold into an impromptu classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Consular Teacher Specialization Deck contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 cover cards (including a reference guide for each deck)&lt;br/&gt;    20 standard sized talent cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
