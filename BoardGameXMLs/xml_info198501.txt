Our rebellion starts now. If we can destroy their steel foundry at the top of Mount Stakhia, then we strike a blow at their symbolic heart of fire and steel as well as hurt their steel production to continue making weapons, vehicles, walkers, and ships.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Wotez, Revolutionary of planet Pheria&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Steel Foundry is a single floor interior and exterior map of a steel manufacturing facility built on top of a volcanic mountain. The mouth of the volcano is underneath the foundry&amp;rsquo;s southeast corner. Either crucibles are dipped into the volcano&amp;rsquo;s mouth to harvest ore directly from the volcano&amp;rsquo;s magma or the heat and air currents from the volcano are used as a natural furnace and bellows to convert iron ore into steel. The steel is then poured into molds and turned into steel blocks. The steel blocks are placed into cargo containers and then removed via a carryall to a refinery for further processing or a factory for immediate use. The carryall returns with more workers, food, water, fuel, and raw materials as needed to keep the foundry running and personnel alive and working as well as replace any personnel that die from the harsh working conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Steel Foundry is intended for use in near or far-future science fiction settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The included One Sheet: The Raid on Mount Stakhia has Savage World NPC and vehicle statblocks made with the Savage Worlds Core Rules and Science Fiction Companion by Pinnacle Entertainment Group and includes printable stat cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Raid on Mount Stakhia: Wotez, a revolutionary of planet Pheria, wants to overthrow the Stakhijian Empire. Wotez, like many of the low classes, hates the draconian government and brutal working conditions worldwide from foundries to refineries to mines, where Human life is thrown away in the pursuit of raw materials and resources to continue to fuel the Stakhijian Empire&amp;rsquo;s expansion throughout the solar system.
