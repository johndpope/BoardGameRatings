							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Project UFO</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years, you've had unique telepathic conversations with an alien named Freedo, who you like and trust. When you're tapped by several high-powered organizations to work with them on top-secret UFO research projects, you know it won't be long until your secret is revealed. ... You've always been fascinated by the possibility of UFOs and space travel. Freedo has told you some things, but hardly enough to prepare you for the dangerous humans--and aliens!--you are about to encounter. Be prepared, and don't decide anything too quickly: not everyone is what they seem, or even who they appear to be--literally!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
