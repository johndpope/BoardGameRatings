							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sinclair ZX 16K RAM</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 16KB RAM pack extended the memory of the ZX80 and ZX81 computers from their in-built 1KB RAM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A memory expansion was required for many commercially released ZX81 games and RAM expansions were available from many third parties and in various sizes. However the Sinclair 16KB expansion was so common that game inlays often state &amp;quot;ZX81 16KB&amp;quot; or similar, even if the game actually only needs a smaller amount of memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
