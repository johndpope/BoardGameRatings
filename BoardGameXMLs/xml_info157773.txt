							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Switzerland must be Conquered!</name>
									
			<description>Switzerland must be Swallowed! was re-released in 2007 as Switzerland must be Conquered!, a downloadable PnP game. The rules were expanded (12 pages rather than the original 8), the combat resolution system changed (and slightly simplified), and the counter sheet re-organised &amp;amp; expanded (strength markers used by the old combat system were eliminated, while Fortification and additional unit counters were added).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Switzerland must be Conquered! is a hypothetical simulation of the planned assault on Switzerland by Nazi Germany during World War 2. Players represent the military high commands directing their forces during what was sure to be a trying fortnight for all concerned. Fortunately for the German player, Adolf Hitler is busy elsewhere and will not interfere with your battle plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
