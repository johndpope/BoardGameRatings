			<description>The goal is to advance your figure to the end of a 10 space track first. The board has a spinner in the middle with 22 yellow spaces showing a letter and a number, 4 red spaces showing a sad or angry face and a number and 2 green spaces showing a happy face. On a players turn he spins the spinner. If it stops on a letter he takes a card and reads out the category on it (eg &amp;quot;profession&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;funny birthday present&amp;quot;). The neighbor to his right has to say a word that starts with the given letter and fits the category in 10 seconds, if he does so he may advance 1 space on his track. The other players still have the chance to advance 1 space by rolling the number on the letter space of the spinner. If the spinner stops on a red space all players have to roll the die and go back 1 space if they roll the number on the spinner's space. If the spinner stops on a green space the player who spun may advance 2 spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
