			<description>Each player has a set of 9 wooden disks, 8 of them having numbers between 0 and 10, and the last is a jolly (or joker). During a turn, a player puts one of his disks face down on one of 9 hexagons that are on the board. As soon as the last player has put his last disk on the board, the game ends and the scores for the 9 hexagons are calculated. Depending on the presence of a jolly, the player with the highest or lowest total points on a single hexagon wins all disks on the hexagon. Winner is the player who reaches the highest total with his won disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
