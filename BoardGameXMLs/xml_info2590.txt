			<description>Sid Sackson's Temptation Poker is a variant of the card game Poker.  In this variant, players can purchase additional cards to improve their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives the same amount of credit to start the game.  After anteing 5 credits, they are dealt the standard 5-card hand, and taking turns, they can look at and purchase up to 6 cards at increasing costs, e.g. 1 for the first additional card, 3 for the second, and so on, to improve their hand.  The credits they used to purchase the cards go into the pot.  After everyone had their chance to improve their hands (or had quit the round by folding), they reveal their improved 5-card hands and the player with the best hand (according to standard poker rules) takes all of the pot.  The next round then starts, repeating the anteing-and-improving-hand process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game stops when one of the players cannot afford the ante; at that point, the player with the most credit is declared the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
