			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suppose you were the director of a movie or the writer of a story. Maybe Luke wouldn't have lost his hand, or maybe you would make Dracula a seven year old boy. Wouldn't it be fun if you could tell the hero what to do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Magic Carpet is a very special kind of story called Interactive Fiction. You get to take part in the story, by deciding where the story should go next. You tell David, the boy in the story, exactly what to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can read the story over and over again, each time making a different choice at different points. The story and the ending will be different each time, depending on how you chose. Some endings are happy, while other endings are tragic. You decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
