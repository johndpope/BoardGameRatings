			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information found here is a compilation of pre-established guidelines. However liberty has been taken with some of those guidelines to streamline them and make them more simple to use in the spirit of PFlite. Keep in mind these are all suggestions and guidelines for general circumstances. A DM may need to adjust anything here as necessary in order for these mechanics and guidelines to function properly within their game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wealth by Level: These are suggested amounts of wealth, represented in gold pieces, for a character based on their level. This is a rough estimate not optimized to any given campaign, setting, and especially to the specific game you play. Adjust these amounts higher for more high-power games and adjust them lower for more low-power games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
