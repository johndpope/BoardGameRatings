							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The University Game</name>
									
			<description>The University Game is designed to provide the high school student and/or their parents with insightful information concerning the pitfalls an undergraduate student may encounter. Specifically, the game looks at issues which can quickly take a student from their intended four year degree track to a longer six year degree track. As you may expect, there are more situations which will extend a students undergraduate program than reduce it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players upon completing the game will have encountered up to 80 situations which may extend or shorten a degree program. The players will be aware of situations involving courses, financial aid, grades and a category labeled fun stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to go around the board once and graduate wins the game. Please note that you do not have to land exactly on the &amp;quot;graduate&amp;quot; square to finish the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 Game board&lt;br/&gt;     1 Die&lt;br/&gt;     4 Plastic Students&lt;br/&gt;     8 Decks of 10 cards each labeled:&lt;br/&gt;     Financial Aid - 4 year track&lt;br/&gt;     Financial Aid - 6 year track&lt;br/&gt;     Course - 4 year track&lt;br/&gt;     Course - 6 year track&lt;br/&gt;     Grades - 4 year track&lt;br/&gt;     Grades - 6 year track&lt;br/&gt;     Fun Stuff - 4 year track&lt;br/&gt;     Fun Stuff - 6 year track&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
