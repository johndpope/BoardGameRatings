			<description>Micro League Baseball was a 1984 baseball simulation video game. It was developed by Micro League Sports Association and published by Micro League Multimedia Inc. It was released on Amiga, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and PC. It was one of the first video games to carry the Major League Baseball license, allowing the game to feature MLB teams. It also carried the Major League Baseball Players Association license, allowing the game to use real players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A general manager disk available separately allowed users to make trades with other teams or create their own players. A stat compiler disk allowed players to save the results of every played game and compile statistics for each player, allowing users to play an entire season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was unique for its time for its concentration on management. Things like batter stance and fielder placement were all possible for the first time in a licensed baseball game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original game came with a variety of all-time great teams, including the 1927 Yankees, 1955 Dodgers, 1961 Yankees, 1967 Cardinals, 1969 Mets, 1975 Red Sox, and 1980 Phillies. Additionally, the game included an AL All-Time Greats team as well as an NL All-Time Greats Team. Further, the game also included the 1984 AL and NL All-Star Game rosters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roster size for all teams was 15 hitters and 10 pitchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;MicroLeague Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
