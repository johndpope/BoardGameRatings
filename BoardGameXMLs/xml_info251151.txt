			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game will take you to a period 150 million years ago, to the time of the relentless battle among rabid predators, which defended their territory and attacked their enemies without remorse. &lt;br/&gt;Become one of them for a while and conquer the other dinosaurs. The game includes a game board, 1 dice, 4 figures, 4 colored stands and an instruction book. It is intended for 2, 3 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the dinosaur on a red stand starts the game. The player roll the die and moves forward towards the middle square (crossroads) by the corresponding number of squares. The players take turns to throw the die in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a player reaches the middle square, they must select which direction to go next. If a player's figure approaches an opponent during their move they must finish their roll by moving away from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player is removed from the game if his throw ends up on any of the start squares or when their move end beyond this start square. If a figure of any of the players lands between two other figures during the game and there are no free squares, it is removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player whose dinosaur is the last to remain on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
