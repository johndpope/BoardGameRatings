			<description>Blur: The Hand is Quicker than the Die is a generic roleplaying system that uses a single mechanic to resolve all opposed actions.  The mechanic is somewhat unique in that is uses a stripped standard deck of playing cards and a miniature &amp;quot;one hand&amp;quot; card game for resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character creation is very simple and primarily narrative.  Characters have only one type of statistic, called a Trait.  Traits represent things like skills, professions, or talents.  Sample traits would be:  hacking, fortune telling, investigator, assassin, clever, strong, or vicious).  Characters can have multiple traits with score ranging from 1 to 5 (2 is considered &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;).  Characters also have a &amp;quot;trump&amp;quot; suit, representing their best type of traits.  Optionally, characters have &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot; points that allow narrative revision when expended (a type of &amp;quot;safety net&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During resolution, each opponent identifies a relevant trait and draws a number of cards corresponding to that trait.  A card is then played (or a set or a straight, if drawn) and the opponent must counter each card by beating it.  Sets give &amp;quot;Slams&amp;quot; and straights give &amp;quot;Combos&amp;quot;, both yielding excellent results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from the mechanics, the site also provides a list of adventure hooks, an assortment of &amp;quot;goons&amp;quot; to thwart the players, a character sheet, an example of play, and an optional system of talents and flaws.  A character creation guide also is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
