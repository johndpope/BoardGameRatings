			<description>&amp;quot;Sailing Captains - Aspiring sailors learn sailboat handling, sailing basics and jargon.  Experienced sailors test their expertise with this game of skill and chance.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game contains 4 sailing course game boards, 4 &amp;quot;yacht&amp;quot; (green cubes), 1 d6, 24 playing cards with 240 plus questions and answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically a roll and move game.  Each Captain and/or 1st mate has to answer a sailing question.  If right, they get to roll the dice and move on their individual game boards.  There are a few special squres on the boards that can impact movement like lose a turn or move backwards because of some boat related events.  The winner is the team to make the journey on the board and get back to the marina first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
