							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outpost Para√≠so</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a handful of mysteries, the heroes must help Doctor Turnbull make rendezvous with his contact, investigate the origins of an alien artifact found in the jungles, and figure out how to fix their ship all before the Nazis attack.&lt;br/&gt; The Outpost is the largest settlement on Chaco and a crossroads of locals, native laborers, stranded expatriates, veterans of the Chaco War, and flotsam from across the Racimo Cluster.&lt;br/&gt; Totaling 10,000 souls at any given time, Para&amp;iacute;so is composed of a sprawling shantytown clustered around a small starport, a presidio and a massive, stinking swampworks and refining facility.&lt;br/&gt; This episode has three key scenes, as well as much roleplaying as the heroes can stomach. Key areas are detailed in this episode, though the rest of the Outpost is up to the GM&amp;rsquo;s design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
