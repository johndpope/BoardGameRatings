His fee: one million dollars. His signature: a golden bullet. His specialty: a single shot to kill his victim. Now Scaramanga is after a brilliant scientist and his Solex Agitator, and with it he will be able to create the ultimate firearm &amp;mdash; a solar gun that uses the energy of the sun as its projectile.

Even if you manage to find Scaramanga, you must confront him in the ultimate test of your skills inside his maze of death!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
