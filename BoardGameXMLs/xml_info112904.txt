							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Combat Mission: Campaigns</name>
									
			<description>Combat Mission Campaigns is an operational wargame where you command forces up to a Division in size during the bloody nightmare of WWII's Eastern Front from 1941-45.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By working in tandem with the award winning Combat Mission: Barbarossa to Berlin game engine, Combat Mission Campaigns allow you to command your troops at the operational level and then play out the resulting battles at the tactical level. CMBB and CMC actually share information back and forth so the disposition and status of troops, experience, fatigue, supply, terrain, weather, time of day and more are seamlessly integrated into both games. Plan your strategies, issue orders and deploy your maneuver units in a dynamic 3D isometric map and when units close to engagement ranges, CMC actually creates the battles (unit positions, status, weather, time of day etc...) to then be played in CMBB. Once the tactical battle is finished, CMBB then sends the results back to CMC and play is continued at the Operational level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
