			<description>An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triangulate is an abstract strategy board game that can be played with 'found objects.' In other words, it's a game, not unlike checkers or chess, but one that can be played with game pieces or other objects that you probably already have at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player decides which of their small pieces they would like to move first. In order to actually make the move, the player first takes one of their LARGE tokens and places it onto the square to which they intend to move a SMALL token. (The proposed square must be directly adjacent to the original square, touching on any side or corner) They then move their small token from its current position to the new square; placing it on top of the newly placed larger token. Then the next player takes his turn, etc. A player may move one of their small tokens onto a square already occupied by one of their own or one of their opponent's small token. In this case, the player does NOT place one of their large tokens in advance of the move, but simply places their small token on top of the other small token already in place. If this move is onto an opposing piece, that piece is not captured, but effectively blocked. Until the player on top moves their small token, the piece below may not move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues in this manner until one of the two players is able to Triangulate three of their own small pieces on a single square on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
