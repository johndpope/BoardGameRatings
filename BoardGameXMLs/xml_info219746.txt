							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hull Breach!: Bank of The Galaxy</name>
									
			<description>Originally released as part of Hull Breach!'s Corporate Wars box set, this individual deck has been revamped and improved for the current edition of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our enemies think their production and their weapons make them strong. We know better, Commander. A well-placed spy can be worth more than a fleet of warships and a well-placed bullet can defeat whole armies of Marines. You have the immense resource of the Bank of the Galaxy behind you. Use them wisely to divide them and turn them against one another. Profit from their stubborn attempts to rule the galaxy through force of arms. Then, when they have been suitably bled, deliver the finishing blow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
