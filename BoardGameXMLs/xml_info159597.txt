							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythic Efreeti</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of Fire and Magic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be no doubt that the efreeti are a powerful and fearsome race. They rule the Elemental Plane of Fire with a red-hot, molten iron fist. Their capital, the fabled City of Brass, is known throughout the multiverse as a great center of learning, culture, trade, and much more. Even the least among them is skilled in magic, by mortal standards, and their race was ancient when man and elf first came into being. They are also a proud race, and chafe at the thought of being forced to serve lesser beings, but the threat of fiery vengeance does little to dissuade the numerous spellcasters who nonetheless take it upon themselves to summon and bind efreet for their own mysterious purposes. It is rumored among these circles that there are some efreet who rival&amp;mdash;or even exceed&amp;mdash;the greatest efreeti nobles in power, and these are the mythic efreeti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents game statistics for a mythic efreeti, which has several unique abilities never seen elsewhere. A mythic efreeti can breathe clouds of thick black smoke on a whim to blind and disable their foes. They can also burn with much greater intensity than their lesser kin, and their ability to change the size of other creatures is enhanced as well. Perhaps their most notorious power is their ability to bind foes with golden shackles that impair their ability to fight, and also their ability to resist the mythic efreeti&amp;rsquo;s power. Finally, in addition to the mythic efreeti itself, the book contains rules for performing special rituals that can be enacted by characters of any class in order to summon a mythic efreeti, as well as two such rituals: the flame warrior&amp;rsquo;s calling, and the invocation of the chained sultan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
