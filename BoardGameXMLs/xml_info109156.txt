			<description>Party game.&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;18 Pirate cards&lt;br/&gt;12 Treasure Island maps&lt;br/&gt;The host places all the pirate cards (except card 1) around the room where they can be easily found and seen by the guests.He reads out the first Pirate card and players now look for the Pirate card next in sequence for their chosen route on their map card. When they find it they will be either right or wrong. If wrong, they must go back to their start position on the map. And play progresses like this until one player has discovered the exact location on their map card where the treasure is hidden. He or she wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
