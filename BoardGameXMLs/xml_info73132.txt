			<description>CAPTAIN SPECIAL OP&amp;rsquo;S (CSOP) Second World War game rules, that belong to the series of CAPITANGAMES CAPTAIN they are designed to play confrontations between small groups of specialized troops, such as airborne assaults, reconnaissance in enemy territory, intelligence missions, coup de main, special operations, commandos actions, patrol scouts, escorting convoys, attacks on villages, border incursions into enemy territory, armour clashes, and all those situations in which specific tasks entrusted to a few units.In most cases small combinations of infantry, armoured and support teams, are included, in what the important thing was the training and preparation of troops, in contrast to the great battles, where large groups of troops and impact of the strategy was crucial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSOP is a pure tactical game, the player has to know how to combine arms, infantry, armour and artillery. Our goal is &amp;ldquo;keep it simple &amp;amp; historically accurate&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
