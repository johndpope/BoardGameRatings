							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">NHL Strategy</name>
									
			<description>Coach your own NHL hockey team.  Make the starting lineups. Decide on substitutions.  Play a wide open game using your best shooters, passers and skaters - or choose a close checking defensive strategy.  The choice is yours and the fun is yours.  All teams and every player perform as they do in real NHL games.  Every player is rated for his individual passing, skating, and shooting skills.  Penalties, injuries, power plays, pulling the goalie, backchecking and forechecking all happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
