							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Noddy&#039;s Birthday Party Game</name>
									
			<description>A rather complicated board for the age group that would normally enjoy a Noddy related game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player chooses a character and the associated playing piece. There are 6 face-down counters and when you set off along the track you must take one. Turn it over and that tells you which present you are taking to Noddy's house (example present might be a cake).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first track to move along is the red one. If you land on white numbered squares, they will help you. If you land on black numbered squares then that will be a hazard. However the game at this point is a little different to normal Goose-type games. When arriving on a hazard square, refer to the list in the rules. Hazards relate to the presents. So, if you were carrying the cake, then a hazard for any other present would not apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reaching the end of the red track, you start moving along the letters that spell Noddy (located in the centre of the board). You must reach the end of the fifth letter Y and then set off on the return journey which will end on the letter N.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally you move a long the white circles to Noddy's house. However, on this path there are three circles that feature two colours. If you land on one of these and your counter is one of these two colours, then you have to wait until the player with other colour reaches this circle. That wait could be a long one which might well bore the player affected. I guess the designer wanted to make a game that allowed the back-markers to catch up, which is fair enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to arrive at Noddy's house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
