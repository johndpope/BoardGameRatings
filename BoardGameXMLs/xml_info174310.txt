			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His loyalty was unfathomable. He continued to serve her memory even after her untimely death caused by her exhaustion in helping the infected during the plague outbreak. He would often dream of her in his sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dreams were vivid and he felt at times that she was continuing her works and sharing her memories with him. It started to make him uneasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange things started to happen. He would wake up in his bed fully clothed, even if he had undressed before going to sleep. Random objects started to appear in his darkened shack of a house. First it was the scrubs he found in the bottom of the dirty laundry. He brushed this incident off as a simple one. He had many pairs from volunteering at the orphanage during his master&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then he started to receive thank you cards from patients at the local infirmary whom he had never met, followed by letters from the orphanage for donating his time as a night watchman. Letters from random strangers who sent him letters for protecting them from various incidents. Each one was addressed to someone named &amp;ldquo; Nightingale &amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As time went on, the down-trodden section of Wellmet appeared in the local print more often. His neighborhood specifically had stories of a cloaked vigilante of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One early morning he finally awoke during a realistic dream. He felt as though he was in his body, but in the distance of his mind, someone else took control of his husk. He recognized the voice as his own, but his speech pattern was of his deceased master. The details were hazy and started to fade, but he found himself standing and gazing at his reflection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He wore his masters old cloak, which to his recollection was buried with her. He noticed the broach and his eyes widened. For a brief moment he saw her. He saw the silhouette of his mistress standing behind him with a mischievous grin, guiding his movements as though a puppeteer would a marionette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During that moment his dreams aligned with the mounting evidence. Just as in the past, he would serve his master, and be the Nightingale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living vessels for beings that exist outside the normal limits of reality, mediums share their bodies with spirit companions whose abilities are drawn from one or more other classes. When not channeling these loyal companions, mediums receive guidance from various other spirits in the form of spell-like abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a medium, one&amp;rsquo;s role is secondary to that of her spirit companion&amp;rsquo;s. Her spirit companion has class levels of its own, and participates in adventures by inhabiting the medium&amp;rsquo;s body and acting on her behalf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 12 page PDF product includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 Medium base class&lt;br/&gt;    3 Pathfinder Compatible Archetypes: Legion Medium, Oracular Medium, and Physical Medium&lt;br/&gt;    1 Ultimate Psionics Compatible Archetype: Psychic Medium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
