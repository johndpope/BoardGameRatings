			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead your men through the largest, bloodiest battle of the century&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command a fire brigade of soldiers on the Russian Front in this real-time strategy game set in World War II featuring unequalled detail, realism, and scope.  Play as either the Soviets or Germans as you orchestrate your squads' attack, defense, and survival over four grueling years of the grandest and bloodiest war the world has ever seen.  To succeed, you must guide your men through the mortal dangers of war while physically and psychologically defeating your enemies.  Your soldiers are counting on you.  Don't let them down!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Command the same men throughout the entire four-year campaign&amp;mdash;from the initial German invasion of Operation Barbarossa, to the pivotal Russian victories at Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, and Berlin.  Or rewrite a chapter of history by rallying your German troops to take Red Square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 300 specialized squads&amp;mdash;100 weapons, 60 soldier types, and 80 different vehicles and antitank guns.  Includes 120-mm mortars, flame-throwers, rocket launchers, half-tracks, and off-map heavy artillery barrages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manage your squads by resting, refitting, and upgrading them between battles.  Follow each soldier as he progresses from green neophyte to seasoned veteran and advance in rank to command more units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create your own &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; scenarios with Close Combat III's enhanced Scenario Editor.  Craft single or multi-map battles with set deployment zones, objective locations, requisition points, and available units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
