			<description>Box has comic book style footballers. It doesn't say it is connected to the ultimate British comic book hero Roy of the Rovers, but it does look awfully close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is a soccer pitch and is enclosed within a plastic cover. The pitch has 10 indentations. To move the ball, each player has 10 buttons to press, each numbered to relate to one of the indentations. When a ball settles into an indentation, the first to press the lever, 'passes' the ball, with the intention of sendint it to another position. The cover on the pitch means that the ball cannot leave the board and roll on to the floor. The goalkeepers are worked by slides so that they can be moved sideways to save shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
