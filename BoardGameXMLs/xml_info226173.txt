			<description>You may not be able to see your Munchkin Imaginary Friend, but that doesn't mean he can't help you! Once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official Rule: You may tear the blister away from the backing to release your Munchkin Imaginary Friend whenever you are in combat. He will give you a +10 combat bonus for that fight, after which you can't find him again to put him back in his case. He's free! Free! FREE!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
