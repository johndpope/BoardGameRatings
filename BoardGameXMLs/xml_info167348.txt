							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TetMithra</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Mitra&amp;quot; is a symbol of light and truth in aryan myth, and &amp;quot;Mithra&amp;quot; is a angel divinity in Zoroastrianism. These beings come into conflict in TetMithra, a game in which you score by placing blocks on your own game board or cut down your opponent's score by placing blocks on his.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To set up the game, each player creates a grid of number tiles by drawing the tiles from a bag and placing them on his game board; these tiles contain four squares in a row, with the squares being red, green, yellow and blue and containing the numbers 3-6 in some order. On the first turn, the starting player draws three block tiles, which show the shape of the blocks available for this turn; the blocks are Tetris-style quadrominoes that have squares in four colors. The player chooses one of these pieces and places it on his board within one minute, scoring points for the like-colored squares touching this block. Thus, if a red 5 on his grid is adjacent to a red square on the block he just placed, he scores five points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next player then reveals a new block tile, reveals the new block, then places one of the three blocks in his grid. From a player's third turn on, he can choose to place a block in an opponent's grid, costing him points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when either only two blocks remain unplaced, no blocks can be placed in either grid, or one player has more than 180 points or less than -50 points. At this time, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
