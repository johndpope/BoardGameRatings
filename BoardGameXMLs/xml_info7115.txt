							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trade Wars: The Game of Global Commerce</name>
									
			<description>The Cold War is over! Now the Trade Wars begin. Trade Wars the board game is a microcosm of the real Trade Wars raging outside, driving global economic conflict home.&lt;br/&gt;The Trade Wars board simulates the globe, and is divided into four geographic regions that a player may control. Players move through the regions of the board purchasing corporations, forming Trusts and Cartels, and collecting license fees from opponents. Players risk making unsound investments, paying license fees to other players, and encounter trade and tariff barriers. Players seek to create transnational corporate empires and either buy-out other players or run them out of existence. Each region has its own currency and players must deal with rising and falling currency exchange rates. Market Force cards randomly effect the game. Players may buy and sell corporations to other players or the bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has a player pre-determined length of play with variable playing options. Also of note, this game comes complete with player aids and a Teacher&amp;amp;#039;s Guide for classroom play. Trade Wars is for ages 15+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
