			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interstate is a quick-playing family game in which each player is taking a vacation or road trip through the United States via the Interstate road system.  The first player to visit all of their destinations and return home is the winner.  The game has a deck of Interstate cards which allows for interactive card play as players can help their own cause or hinder other players' travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interstate is presented as an easy-to-learn basic game but also has several optional variants that can be used to spice up the basic game.  Because of the randomness and unpredictability inherent in the play of the game, as well as the variants, Interstate has excellent replay value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most games of Interstate are close; it is rare to have a runaway winner. The play of the cards helps to rein in anyone who gets too much of a lead over the other players.  There will always be unpleasant events that will hinder your game but basically the person who can most efficiently plan out the course of visiting their destinations will have the best chance of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
