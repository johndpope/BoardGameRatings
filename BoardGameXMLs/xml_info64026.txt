			<description>Object of the game:&lt;br/&gt;To be the first player to get rid of all cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Shuffle the cards and deal 6 to each player.Place the remaining cards face down as a &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; pile, within reach of all players for use throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Elect a player to start&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Player 1 starts by placing any one of their cards face up beside the &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; pile as a &amp;quot;Call card&amp;quot;. Cards placed on top of his in turn become the call card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The game continues in a clockwise direction with each placing one card from their hand onto the call card pile. The card played must be:&lt;br/&gt;(a) a card of any number but the same image as the call card OR&lt;br/&gt;(b) a card of any image but the same number as the call card&lt;br/&gt;OR&lt;br/&gt;(c) a GET OUT! card which can be played as any image&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. If a player cannot play a card onto the call card pile they must take the top card from the draw pile and add it ti their hand. That player's turn ends on drawing a card - they cannot play it on the same turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. GET OUT! cards can be played by any player, on their turn, on to any call card. The player may then declare the image to be represented by their GET OUT! card which dictates the next card to follow. The player may choose an image that will help himself or hinder their opponent. One GET OUT! card can be played on top of another GET OUT! card - to cancel a previous call or to keep it the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Players do not have to play a card even if they are able to, but they must pick up a card from the draw pile. This might happen when player is playing defensively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. If draw pile runs out, the last call card is left face up in the center of play and the rest of the cards are placed face down (without shuffling) and the game proceeds as before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. The game ends when one player runs out of cards - who is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play of GET OUT! may be extended by continuing as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10. When one player runs out of cards, all other players add uo the total value of the cards in their hands. GET OUT! cards count as 20 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11. Write the scores down by player on the sheet of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12. The player who wins the round deals for the next game and play continues round by round. The scores are accumulated after each round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13. If any player passes a total of, say, 100 points they are out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14. the game ends when only one player is left - the overall winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content:&lt;br/&gt;3 rule cards&lt;br/&gt;12 Geoff Tipps (Square) (values 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,14)&lt;br/&gt;12 Samantha Tipps (Pentagon)&lt;br/&gt;12 Kevin Tipps (Diamond)&lt;br/&gt;12 Shirley Tipps (Octagon)&lt;br/&gt;7 The Tea Picer (Oval) (count double when scoring)&lt;br/&gt;3 GET OUT! cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
