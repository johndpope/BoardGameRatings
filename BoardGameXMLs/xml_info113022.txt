							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dungeons and Dragons Chariot Racing</name>
									
			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;A chariot race is well in keeping with the atmosphere of any evil D&amp;amp;D empire, and is usually played out before the annual Banquet, as a celebration of the peace of the Imperium, or after the Emperor has won a war, in celebration of his power. Chariot races can be held at any point at the discretion of the game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using These Rules with D&amp;amp;D 3.5 or 4.0&lt;br/&gt;The chariot race rules were originally written for Original Edition D&amp;amp;D, and its many clones, and work well, as is, with AD&amp;amp;D 1st edition and second edition.  However, they can be used with editions 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 perfectly well, simply by making this adjustment:  Any saving throws or charioteering skill checks called for in these rules simply become Reflex saves made against a Difficulty Class of 15, and modified as listed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game master is, of course, free to allow a Chariot Driving skill in the game, and this should probably be done if the rules are going to be used on a regular basis. However, if such a skill is in play, the checks are made against a Difficulty Class of 20, instead of 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
