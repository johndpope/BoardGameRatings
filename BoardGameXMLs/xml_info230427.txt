							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DKT Salzkammergut: Das kaufmännische Talent</name>
									
			<description>A variant of the popular DKT game, which is a monopoly variant. Players roll dice to move on a board and visit locations in the Salzkammergut in &amp;Ouml;sterreich. Most of the locations are for sale, the moving player can buy them. If a player's pawn later enters an already owned location, the player must pay rent to the owner. When owning all locations of a site (two to four locations per site), the owner can build houses and later hotels on the locations to increase the rent for other players. The game ends after a fixed time, or if all players but one are bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version includes some major differences to the standard DKT game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In every region there are two souvenirs, priced 50 and 100. You can buy one of them when you stop in the region, the cheaper one is sold first. You can only own one souvenir per region. Whenever you pass start, you get 50 extra for each souvenir you own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field 21 is a Geb&amp;auml;ude (&amp;quot;building&amp;quot;) special field. It allows you to build up to 2 houses or 1 hotel (if you already have 4 houses) on each property you own, even if you do not own the whole region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no auction rules, only the person stopping on an unowned property can buy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can sell properties among players at all times for whatever prices you settle on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook includes a long section describing the various tourist attractions depicted in each region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
