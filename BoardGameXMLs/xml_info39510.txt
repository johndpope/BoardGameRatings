							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Raise The Ruins</name>
									
			<description>In Raise the Ruins, players are priests, fresh from their trials in the Temple of Favors.  Many of Azytecal's once great temples stand on the cusp of ruin, the voices of the faithful no longer echoing throughout their halls, and the altars lay barren.  Restoring these temples is the object of Raise the Ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players vie for the blessings of the three deities and send their followers to the forgotten altars bearing offerings.  Raise the Ruins is a card driven set collection game with easy to grasp mechanics and engaging game play decisions for 3-4 players, Ages 10 and up, and plays in 45-60 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;52 Offering Cards&lt;br/&gt;8 Trophy Cards&lt;br/&gt;12 Temple Cards&lt;br/&gt;3 Deity Cards and 3 Wooden Deity Markers&lt;br/&gt;2 Wooden Crest Markers&lt;br/&gt;4 Favor Cards&lt;br/&gt;24 Wooden Followers (6 in each color)&lt;br/&gt;4 Score Cards &amp;amp; Wooden Markers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raise The Ruins will be available later this month in standard Small Box Games limited print run.  Additionally, a add on pack will be available for those already owning TEMPLE.  A downloadable version of the board for TEMPLE will also be available for downloading, and, in conjunction with the rules already available online, playing TEMPLE will be possible with a copy of Raise The Ruins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
