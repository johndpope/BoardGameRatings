			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hold-up is a top-down view arcade game in which the goal is to steal money from an armoured van. The player controls a red car and must explore the town, find and stop the van (by crashing into it), and pick up any money bag left on the road. The player is also chased by several police cars; these can be slowed down by dropping oil on the road. The player must also manage the car's fuel level (there are several gas stations available in town). Once the van has been destroyed and all bags collected, the player moves to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
