			<description>Kobolds &amp;amp; Cobblestones is a skirmish wargame for rumbles between gangs in the city of Ordinsport's seedy underbelly. Players hire gangs of criminals, thugs and enforcers from a number of classic Fantasy races, and attempt to take control of the underworld and establish themselves as the city's kingpins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgoing dice and measuring sticks, the game instead relies on playing cards. All distances are measured in card lengths or widths, combat is resolved by poker hands, and magic by blackjack. Players alternate activating models. Game objectives are by scenario - the rulebook provides eight different ones, ranging from &amp;quot;Hide and Seek&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;All Out Brawl&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a strong emphasis on campaign play, with players recruiting their gang, pitting them against one another, and seeing them grow (or wither) from game to game. Interestingly, the money you use between games to recruit can also be used during games to encourage your fighters, or bribe the enemy's. Money can also be stolen from enemy gangers during a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game pits two players with their gangs against one another, but many players can participate in the same campaign, meeting various opponents across it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
