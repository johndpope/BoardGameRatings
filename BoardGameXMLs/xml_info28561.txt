							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Fleet Cards</name>
									
			<description>This is non-collectible card game of spaceship combat set in the Star Trek universe.  It is heavily inspired by the hex-and-counter game Star Fleet Battles.  It is limited to a duel between two ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a unique deck of cards that represents actions that their type of ship can make.  Each turn players play cards based on how much energy their ship can still produce.  At the point in the game when one players ship can no longer produce energy and therefore not play cards, that ship is considered defeated/destroyed and is considered the loser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
