			<description>In this Gold Rush game, your job is to make more money than the other players by prospecting new claims, mining their gold and selling it in town.  You can hire gunmen to help protect your claims, or use them to jump claims belonging to other players instead.  There are six different activities every turn (mine, claim jump, prospect, sell, hire, and draw), but you may only take three actions per turn.  There is some strategy involved, but also a little luck because you never know how much gold you will find in the mines or whether the dice will roll in your favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
