			<description>Ktizo is a 30 minute, easy to learn game that&amp;rsquo;s great for families and gamers. Players are looking to build up a new ecosystem on a new planet after Earth becomes uninhabitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have a hand of cards, a deck to draw from and a tableau where they will place different species and connect different food chains to earn points. Each species card must match what that species needs in order to survive, with the resources provided by a species that is lower on the foodchain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn you have 3 actions in which you can manipulate your hand by drawing and discarding cards in order to get the right species for your ecosystem.  The first to 100 points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a simple draw/play cards that challenge card management skills with a focus on nature and the beautiful diversity of species that we currently have on our own planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
