							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Stand Together</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Stand Together was made to be an ideal start-up adventure for a BASH! Ultimate Edition campaign. It adds some background history to the Heroes&amp;rsquo; world, brings in an ongoing adversary, and (most importantly) provides something that is usually very difficult to come up with in a roleplaying campaign: a reason to form a group and also to stay together as as a team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure can also be inserted into an ongoing campaign by using established or known occult groups from your game world and an older magical-based NPC. Game statistics and mechanics-related things are available at the end of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideally, this adventure works for a group of Street-Level Heroes.  It works well for a Silver or Bronze Age style campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: Once, there was a war between the Pit and Earth. Sumerian sorcerers battled against an otherworldly evil called Demonicus, who hungered to enter our dimension and devour its energies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sorcerers cast bindings in the form of an amulet, gambling their own life essences when &lt;br/&gt;the world&amp;rsquo;s mana was not enough. The amulet, known as the &amp;ldquo;Star of Ea&amp;rdquo;, was enchanted to &lt;br/&gt;prevent interdimensional rifts from opening, denying free access to our world by supernatural or otherworldly beings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seemingly random crimes began ocurring in the 1940s, and these were traced to a cult controlled by Demonicus. A group of heroes was formed, calling themselves &amp;quot;The Alliance&amp;quot;, each taking ownership of a piece of the Star of Ea... but that was over 60 years ago... and Demonicus is gathering his strength once again. Can the last surviving member of the Alliance find new Heroes worthy of the name in time... and will they be able To Stand Together to protect the world from it's greatest peril?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
