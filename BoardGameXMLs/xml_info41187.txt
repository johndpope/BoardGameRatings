							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlestations: Fleet Admiral</name>
									
			<description>On the heels of the very successful Battlestations Adventure Game, comes a new stand alone game in the Battlestations Universe. Instead of controlling one crew member in adventure style missions you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play Battlestations: Fleet Actions taking charge of multiple ships and crews. No referee is needed as players battle each other for mission objectives, all the while gaining prestige, leveling up their crews with new ship wide special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featured is a new sleek rule set that has all the familiar Battlestations feel, but built for quicker and faster resolution on a massive scale. The familiar power levels in the ships are there with a few minor tweaks. For starters, all ships have unlimited helm power allowing them to perform a number of actions a phase only limited by the number of pilots. As a drawback however, any ship that fails in a piloting maneuver loses the rest of it&amp;rsquo;s actions! Make sure those pilots go last! If you have to turn the ship to fire weapons make sure you make your skill check! Guns and shields work a little differently. The size of your ship determines the power that both guns and shields can have combined. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the player to decide how that power is split. So a size 9 ship has 9 points of power to split between guns and shields. Unlike Battlestations energy levels never drop and there&amp;rsquo;s no more power generation before a round begins. This means there&amp;rsquo;s only ever two times during the course of the game that you have to adjust power levels; if your engines go down or if you transfer power. No more power booking keeping between rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another new game mechanic is automatic actions. By activating crew some actions happen automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
