							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prototype: Galactic Space Ace</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Galactic Space Ace is a Pulp Era hero whose adventures carry her beyond the farthest frontiers of the little blue orb that mankind calls home. The Galactic Space Ace serves as humanity's ambassador to the alien civilizations that dwell amongst the stars. She is an explorer-scientist, representing the best Earth has to offer, proving her worth to more technologically advanced races through her courage, daring, and intelligence. She backs up her confidence with a keen mind and formidable fighting skills, allowing her to overcome the bizarre extraterrestrial creatures and otherworldly environments that she must face on a routine basis. While the Galactic Space Ace is often initially dismissed as a mere savage by the super-scientific extraterrestrials she encounters, her deeds soon prove her worth. In time the Galactic Space Ace creates a legend all her own, a member of technologically primitive race who nonetheless triumphs over every star-born menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New Feats: Jet Pack Operation and Advanced Jet Pack Operation&lt;br/&gt;     New Space-Faring Gear: Jetpack, Raygun, Space Suit &amp;amp; Spacecraft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 7 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: City of Bronze and Victory: War of Bronze.
