			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;How do the grapple rules work, again?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core grappling rules are somewhat unwieldy. These amended rules aim to make grappling in your game a little more fun! Grappling also includes unarmed strikes - kicks, punches, bites and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This short, 7-page supplement is not intended to provide a complete martial arts system with fancy moves; it is intended to replace the grappling rules in the core books with something a little more elegant. The d20 combat system is abstract in nature: you don't worry about hit locations or the exact specifics of an attack, and these rules adhere to that philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unarmed combat is divided into three basic moves: strike, hold and throw. The grappling rules are rewritten, some feats are changed and a couple more added to present a streamlined, easy to understand system which allows your characters to engage in unarmed combat without having to ask &amp;quot;How does grappling work again?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, your character can easily throw his opponent to the ground, hold him there and use his own dagger against him! It's easy to combine the three moves to represent almost any unarmed martial art style attacks without going into too much detail which slows down play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
