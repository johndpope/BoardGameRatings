							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Final Fantasy: Record Keeper</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Fantasy: Record Keeper is a streamlined mash-up of every main series Final Fantasy game. The player assembles a party of up to five characters, including many well known characters from the Final Fantasy series, and equips them with a variety of different weapons, armour and abilities. The player's party then challenges different dungeons based on various elements of different Final Fantasy games. Challenging a dungeon level requires the use of stamina - a limited resource which slowly regenerates over time. Completing all the levels of a dungeon provides access to new dungeons and potentially new party members, new equipment, and other resources, including an increase to maximum stamina through the collection of stamina shards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important resource obtained through the completion of dungeons is Mythril, which can be used to obtain rare equipment, regain all spent stamina, to heal between dungeon levels, to continue after defeat in battle, and to increase the inventory limit for equipment and for abilities. These effects can also be obtained through the expenditure of real-world money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle is real-time, and uses a simplified version of the ATB combat system. Sprites are in a 16-bit retro style, drawn either from other Final Fantasy games or created specifically for Final Fantasy: Record Keeper. Music is drawn from the various Final Fantasy games. Battles set in the Final Fantasy I setting, for example, use the original Final Fantasy's music that would be appropriate to the setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
