			<description>&amp;quot;Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is a video game for the PlayStation 3 system, released on November 19, 2006. The game was a PS3 launch title and is a hack and slash with RPG elements. It is the third game in the Untold Legends series, and the first for the PlayStation 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom there are three classes of fighters that the user chooses at the start of the adventure - The Warrior, who mainly uses strong melee attacks with a huge hammer, The Mage, who uses a combination of ranged magical attacks and close range strikes with his staff, and The Scout, who is the agile alternative of a warrior, landing multiple strikes in quick succession with her daggers. This selection of class is unchangeable throughout the game when playing as this character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When leveling up, the character is given predetermined additions to all attributes, and 2 extra points that can be added freely to any of these attributes. A skill point is also rewarded, which can be put into useful techniques that are dependent on each class, relative to the level requirements to learn these skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay consists of button mashing through hordes of enemies and bosses, without too much strategy involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is playable by 1-2 players on the same screen. Online play for up to four players is provided via the PlayStation Network.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Untold_Legends:_Dark_Kingdom,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
