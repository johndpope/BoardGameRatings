			<description>PHAROMYD is played on a triangular board using 16 four-sided &amp;quot;pyramids&amp;quot; (tetrahedrons) - each side has a different marker colour/symbol on it.  Players move pieces with the aim of preventing other players from moving, but can only move pieces with their symbol showing.  Each piece can be moved by 3 players - the three sides showing - but players can also convert pieces so that their own symbol shows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A move consists of rolling a &amp;quot;pyramid&amp;quot; in one of 3 directions, tipping it along an edge onto a new face.  There are patterns to form - such as sandwiching a &amp;quot;pyramid&amp;quot; between two other &amp;quot;pyramids&amp;quot; with identical faces showing toward each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any player unable to move on their turn is eliminated and the game ends when only 1 player is left in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
