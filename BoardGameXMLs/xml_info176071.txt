			<description>For the 10th year anniversary of Sitting Ducks Gallery a Deluxe Edition of the game has been designed, adding unique ducks, introducing hilarious new action cards and with new mechanics to modify the gameplay. These increase the ability to have more players and include all of these great additional cards to the game with hilarious references and images by Randy Martinez.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sitting Ducks Gallery is a hysterically fun, stick-it-to-your-neighbor, line manipulation game invented by Keith Meyers. Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible. Players move ducks and targets, take aim, and eventually eliminate other players&amp;rsquo; ducks using a variety of humorous Action Cards, while trying to keep their own safe.  The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, you&amp;rsquo;ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won&amp;rsquo;t win, you&amp;rsquo;ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game! The last player to have a duck in the water is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
