			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Final Confrontation with the Crimson Emperor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adamant Entertainment is proud to present the fifth and final chapter in our first Serial Adventure, Crimson Emperor. Part of the Thrilling Tales line of pulp products for modern D20, the Serial Adventure is a five-part extended campaign, written by Walt Ciechanowski, and intended for a group of 1 to 3 player-characters of 11th through 13th level. The five weekly chapters of the Crimson Emperor can be played as parts of a larger story arc, or as stand-alone adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;January 1937 - President-elect Stuart Morrison is preparing to take office, promising to end the economic depression. What the world does not know is that Morrison is not who he claims to be - the insidious Crimson Emperor who orchestrated Morrison's election has taken his place, and now plans to turn America into a Fascist Empire!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
