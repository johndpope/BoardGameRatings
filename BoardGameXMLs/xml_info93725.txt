			<description>Players take turns spinning the spinner and move according to the direction on the outer ring. As soon as a player has passed a space which says the small circle may be used, a player can announce which ring of the spinner they will use prior to spinning. The outer ring is slower and safer, the inner ring is faster - if you are lucky.  There are special spaces on the board that you follow the instructions when you land on them. First player to reach the finish space wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
