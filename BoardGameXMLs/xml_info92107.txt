			<description>In a time long past, the mystical energies of Stonehenge were incredibly strong. The concentrated magic attracted demons from another plane of existence. The priests of an ancient people wished to protect their sacred place and devised a way to create a barrier that, once completed, would keep the demons at large. They also summoned spirits of Nature to help in their fight. The priest who worked best to protect Stonehenge was destined to rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number of players: 3&amp;ndash;4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game: Score the most points by defeating demons and surrounding Stonehenge with a magical barrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment: The board, the trilithons, the card deck, the neutral figure (dark priest), the player figures (priests), disks and bars. Required extra material: six spirits of Nature in each player color, twelve demons in a neutral color, and six demon appearance markers (use pawns and wooden cubes from other games, for example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last moving demon is defeated or successfully attacks a trilithon or the altar stone. A final scoring takes place. First, each player loses 3 points per demon at their respective trilithons. The single player with most defeated demons scores 3 points. Each wall segment on the board is worth 1 point for the respective players. The player with most points wins. If there is a tie, the winner is the tied player with most spirits on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
