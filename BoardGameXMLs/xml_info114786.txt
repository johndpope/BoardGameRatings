							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LocoRoco Midnight Carnival</name>
									
			<description>LocoRoco Midnight Carnival is the last game in the LocoRoco series for the PlayStation Portable. The game is a spin-off that continues the story of LocoRoco 2 and features a new move called &amp;quot;Boing!&amp;quot;. This was released for Halloween.&lt;br/&gt;LocoRoco Midnight Carnival is based on a secret carnival-like base, created by the BuiBui, a red, mischievous version of the MuiMui. The title shows that the LocoRoco were quietly sleeping, while in the background, a BuiBui pulls on a nearby star (cleverly designed to just look like a star), opening a trapdoor under the LocoRoco, sending them into a chute, taking them into a cannon, which shows the LocoRoco &amp;quot;Boing!&amp;quot; power. The cannon sends the LocoRoco into the BuiBui's secret base, the midnight carnival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;LocoRoco Midnight Carnival&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
