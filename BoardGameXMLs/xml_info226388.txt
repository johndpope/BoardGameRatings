							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blood Bowl (2016 edition): Bright Crusaders</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bright Crusaders could be a truly great Blood Bowl team, if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for one serious handicap &amp;ndash; they never, ever, cheat! While other teams are preparing for the match by bribing referees, the Bright Crusaders are performing charity matches &amp;ndash; a fact that will stop them winning a major tournament until they shape up and learn to play dirty!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you be feeling a little less killtacular than most Blood Bowl coaches, and just want to play for the love of the game, this is the Human team for you! You&amp;rsquo;ll receive 12 plastic Human Blood Bowl players &amp;ndash; 2 Throwers, 2 Catchers, 2 Blitzers and 6 Linesmen &amp;ndash; with a set of resin head and torso parts used to upgrade them to the Bright Crusaders. The kit includes the options for 2 helmetless Linesmen, a helmetless Blitzer and a helmetless Thrower, as well as a pair of Bright Crusaders coins and 2 turn markers. Sadly, the kit does not include a participation medal&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 72-component kit comes as 40 plastic and 32 resin parts supplied with 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases and the Bright Crusaders team roster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
