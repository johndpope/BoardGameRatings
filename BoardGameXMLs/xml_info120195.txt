			<description>Creator's Description:&lt;br/&gt;A Funny Thing Happened is a game designed to fill in the blanks in journeys. To detail the intereactions and minor foibles that whilst not central to an epic plot can still occur on any journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also intended to be playable whilst on a journey. Players take it in turns to describe the story with a dice based bidding mechanism to control conflict resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play A Funny Thing Happened as a stand alone game or as a filler for your ongoing campaign to explain what acutally happened in the 2 week long trip that your GM glossed over in a sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
