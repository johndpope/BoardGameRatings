			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the surface of every world lies another world... one cloaked in darkness and hidden from view.  The Lady's Rock is no different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of Eristonia thought they had found and mastered this secret world when the dark elves and the dwarves came to dwell on the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They were wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn about the organizations that exist in the shadowy underbelly of the Empire...  Assassins, thieves, and secret cults bent on world domination...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book you will find all that we know about those secretive groups that exist in the strange world found...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNDER THE ROSE&lt;br/&gt; No game would be complete with out clandestine cabals trying to impose their will upon the average citizen.  Some of these groups are fronts for religious zealots.  Other groups are filled with people drunk on power and lusting for more.  And others still are filled with those who desperately want to belong to one of those two groups, but are too inept to achieve their dreams.  And there are others still who secretly work to make the world a better place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any... or all... of these groups can find a home on your campaign world.  They can plague... or aid... your players drawing them into a world of subterfuge and intrigue.  With more than 40 unique organizations, and ways to bring each of them into your campaign, Under the Rose is a treasure trove for anyone running a role-playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
