							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fantasy Occupations &amp; Signs</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The d20 Modern game introduced an occupation system that adds minor advantages to characters while providing a lot depth. Characters have a background, and they gain benefits from their occupation past making a simple skill roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the occupations are very specific to the modern setting, as most reference skills and feats that don't translate well to the fantasy setting. This profession system is the Fantasy version of the modern occupation system. It fleshes out the things a character's profession skill stands for, and gives the character's life before she became an adventurer a little more meaning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The occupations presented in this PDF include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Academic Wizard&lt;br/&gt;Adventurer&lt;br/&gt;City Guard&lt;br/&gt;Clergy&lt;br/&gt;Farmer&lt;br/&gt;Hedge Wizard&lt;br/&gt;Hospitality Worker&lt;br/&gt;Noble&lt;br/&gt;Pickpocket&lt;br/&gt;Sailor&lt;br/&gt;Samanera &lt;br/&gt;Squire&lt;br/&gt;Troubadour&lt;br/&gt;And&lt;br/&gt;Woodsman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second section of this PDF deals with Astrological signs and a way to introduce them into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sign under which a person was born can be very significant. The fact that practically every newspaper published in the US has a horoscope section speaks to the fact that even if we don't believe that the position of the stars effects us, we'd very much like to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanism for including astrology into your games is simple by design. Two moons, Luna and Io, travel through the thirteen zodiac houses. The moon Luna grants a minor bonus when it is in a character's house, and the moon Io bestows a minor penalty. Several methods of tracking the moon's location during a given adventure are also presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
