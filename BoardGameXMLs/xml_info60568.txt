			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel the Pony Power! On a faraway magical world, in the heart of Glitter Valley, there lives a tribe of beautiful creatures known as the Laser Ponies. These ponies romp, frolic, and play. And, when they need to, they shoot lasers out of their eyes. Only the Laser Ponies can defend their valley, and all the creatures in it, from the evil Chasm Queen and her army of monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser Ponies is the Saturday morning cartoon you always wanted to see, filled with magic, wonder, and adventure, without the cheap animation or commercial breaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser Ponies is for girls and boys alike, and is the first all-ages role-playing game from Hex Games. It uses the QAGS system, but you do not have to own the QAGS rulebook - the QAGS Qik Start rules, which tell you everything you need to know to play the game, are included in the back of the book. Also included are rules for Pony Power, 40 story ideas, sample characters, illustrations by up-and-coming young artist Katie Staffiera, and a character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
