			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derstahl has been a region of unprecedented prosperity in recent years. It is no wonder that you have decided to make your way through this small city before arriving at your next destination. Things in Derstahl are not as peaceful and prosperous as people think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Reginald Khobar has received a tormenting letter. It states that his only daughter, Lorilen, has been kidnapped and only an absurd amount of currency can assuage the villains from sending her back in pieces to the distraught father.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It falls to you, brave adventurers! Locate the whereabouts of these brigands. Find little Lorilen and bring her back safely to her father. The consequences of failure would be both horrible and grisly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second in a series of adventures by gimmearoll.com. Designed for a group of 4 adventurer's levels 2-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
