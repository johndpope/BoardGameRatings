			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Book About People Who Use Stuff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a book about creation, crafting, and items. However, like most of the Little Red library we&amp;rsquo;ve taken this concept in a different direction than what would be traditionally found in such a book. We didn&amp;rsquo;t include a mad scientist class or an artificer, there are no huge list of redundant items to fill out page count, and there is no convoluted new crafting subsystem; this is a book about &amp;ldquo;creation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;items&amp;rdquo; as concepts rather than a book about crafting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this book you&amp;rsquo;ll see three classes presented. The first is the collector, followed by the sacred smith, and it will end with the magician. Each play on these themes in different ways. The collector is a class that is magically bound (by destiny, pact, etc) to certain items. This might be something as thematically traditional as King Arthur with his legendary equipment that he was destined to wield or something as exotic as alien technology bound to a person in a fantasy world. The sacred smith is the avatar of creation- able to use &amp;ldquo;matter&amp;rdquo;, granted to them by the Engines of Creation, to create anything their hearts desire. This magical &amp;ldquo;instant crafting&amp;rdquo; affords them a great many options and carves out a new niche for them in the wider world of gameplay (they can be the &amp;ldquo;equiper&amp;rdquo; of the party). Finally, the magician can &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; magical items through deception and utilize equipment in new and unique ways (via equipment tricks and their &amp;ldquo;magicians secrets&amp;rdquo;). If the collector is the special arrangement of items, the sacred smith is the special creation of items, and the magician is the special utilization of those items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Collector Base Class!&lt;br/&gt;    The Wandering Knight Hybrid Class (Collector / Fighting Man or Fighter)&lt;br/&gt;    The Sacred Smith Base Class!&lt;br/&gt;    The Heartforger Sacred Smith Archetype!&lt;br/&gt;    The Magacian Base Class!&lt;br/&gt;    New Feats!&lt;br/&gt;    New Equipment Tricks!&lt;br/&gt;    New Talents for Rogue and Magus!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
