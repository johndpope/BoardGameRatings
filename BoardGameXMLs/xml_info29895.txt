			<description>From the Rules &lt;br/&gt;Self-esteem is something everyone wants for their children. We assume that when children value themselves they will not only be happier, but will develop a strong sense of self. A strong identity will in turn be a resource for them to draw on as they meet the many challenges of growing up. Mental health professionals almost universally agree that lack of self-esteem can be a significant factor in a host of childhood disorder from depression to under-achievement to anti-social behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dinosaur's Journey to High Self-Esteem reflects this multi-dimensional understanding of self-esteem. As children advance along the game board they draw cards which ask them to think about their values, friendships. ability to understand themselves and others, and their resources in meeting life's common problems. Each card presents a unique opportunity for a child to think and experience the building blocks of self-esteem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
