			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motocross Madness is a motorcycle off-road racing game for Windows 95. The game includes a number of different play modes to race &amp;ndash; and crash &amp;ndash; the vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game modes include races (National Race, Supercross, and Baja) and the Stunt Quarry. National Race and Supercross are standard motocross races against a number of opponents, while Baja is an endurance-style race on an outdoor track. The Stunt Quarry pits the player against several competitors in a terrain park with large hills, valleys, and jumps. The goal is to achieve the highest score by performing tricks in a set period of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title has an extensive tuning system that players can use to adjust their bikes to optimize performance in the different races. In addition, the physics engine stretches the boundary of realism, allowing players to get huge air and perform outlandish tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up to 8 players can compete online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
