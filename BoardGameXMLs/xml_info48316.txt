							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alamo</name>
									
			<description>Alamo is a game that is played with only standard decks of cards.  The game mixes &amp;quot;Texas Hold 'Em&amp;quot; and the child's game, &amp;quot;War&amp;quot; to create a simple strategic bidding and bluffing experience that takes up little space, making it easy to set up and play in almost any situation.  The game is essentially a 2 card poker game where you bid with the other cards in your deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials needed:&lt;br/&gt;1 standard deck of cards with different backs per player&lt;br/&gt;1 standard deck of cards for the &amp;quot;Alamo deck&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;1 hand odds/rankings sheet per player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Each player has his or her own deck of cards and there is also one main deck, which is referred to as the Alamo deck.  At the beginning of the game each player will shuffle their deck of cards and place them face down in front of themselves like if you were going to play War.  Then shuffle the Alamo deck and place it face down in the middle of the table.  The game play consists of 5 main steps per round, which are similar to the steps in a Texas Hold 'em game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
