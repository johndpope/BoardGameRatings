							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ace Handicap Golf</name>
									
			<description>Ace Handicap Golf game comes with two large double sided boards depicting 18 golf holes and a practice hole. Each hole may contain some of the various golf hazards: bunkers, water, rough, trees etc. Three different games are described in the rules: novice, standard and handicap. For each golf hole, players select from several possible routes marked on the boards, study a club/distance chart to determine which club best suits the chosen route then roll a 14 sided dice to determine the accuracy of the shot (accurate, good, poor, hook/slice, fault). This repeats until the green is reached. Once on the green, separate charts manage the process of putting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The handicap version of the game allows chips to be won for good shots which can be played at various times during the hole eg to avoid bad rolls, negotiate hazards or make small advancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not so much an edit as an addition to the information. The designer and artist of this game was Eddie Solomons,not Eric as stated. He was assisted by his family who have happy memories of researching and dry running the game. One daughter, who was just 18 at the time was sent off to the patents office in London, England, to research the design of the then innovotive multisided dice based on a golf ball.How do I know all this? I am that daughter! Sadly, Eddie passed away on the 9th September 2011 aged 86. It was kinda nice to see his game remebered on the internet. Unfortunately, when his grandson arrived at his hospital bed to show him, he was already starting to slip away. Thank you,all the BoardGameGeeks, for immortalising part of the eccentric late Eddie Solomons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
