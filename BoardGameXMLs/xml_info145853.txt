			<description>Crime does not pay. In this game you are one of Beagle Boys. Goal is to perform the most burglaries in Duckburg as possible, before you are captured by coppers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game components are 2 dices (one with 2 red, 2 yellow, and 2 blue sides and normal d6), mission deck, tool deck, pawns for players (1 Beagle boy for each player) and coppers (numbered from 1 to 4).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a roll and move game, to complete a mission you need to be a right place with right tool and assignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After each round last player move copper, every time one player is eliminated one copper is added to board. Instead of a Beagle Boy (who is in jail), the eliminated player moves a copper.&lt;br/&gt; The player with most points after all Beagle Boys are captured win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
