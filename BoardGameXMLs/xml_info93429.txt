			<description>This game collection comes in an gatefold sleeve like for vinyl records. It contains 3 games:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) Dallas-Dominoe: a standard domino game but instead of numbers the two sides of the tiles have the portraits of some Dallas characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.) Dallas-Memo: a standard memory game with pairs of portraits of some Dallas characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.) Dallas-Bluff: the 32 cards are dealt between the players. The first player puts one of his cards face down on the table in front of him and says wich of the Ewings that is. The next player either believes him and puts a different Ewing card face down in front of him or he doesn&amp;acute;t believe him and says so. If he was right the player that lied about his card receives a card from each player. If he was wrong he gets the cards himself. The first player to get rid of all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cards for the games have portrait pictures of the main characters of the the TV-series &amp;quot;Dallas&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
