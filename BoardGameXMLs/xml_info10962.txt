			<description>Dodging battlecruisers, escaping space monsters, and blasting bounty hunters are all in a day&amp;rsquo;s work for you, as captain of your own space freighter. Trade goods on the space lanes, work for crime lords, or engage in your own piracy&amp;mdash;the big bucks are for those who can smuggle past orbital customs stations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your credits to upgrade your space freighter and find other special equipment. Freedom of movement and diversity of choice don't keep Smugglers of the Galaxy from being a simple and easy play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the many options for players include: Space Trading, Smuggling, Piracy, Bounty Hunting, and Starship Upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPACE TRADING&lt;br/&gt;Every planet has different demands for Food, Robots, Weapons, Luxuries, and Medical Supplies. Buy low on one world and sell high on another. Expand your ship&amp;rsquo;s cargo capacity and upgrade your Lightspeed to make credits quick&amp;mdash;but watch out for pirates on the space lanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SMUGGLING&lt;br/&gt;Some goods are illegal on some worlds&amp;mdash;but that means big bucks for those who can smuggle them past customs! Larger worlds generally have larger starports&amp;mdash;which means better security but also better profits. Crime Bosses offer the biggest payoffs but you&amp;rsquo;ll regret it if you fail them. Find friends and technology that will help you smuggle because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to get caught with a shipload of illegal goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIRACY&lt;br/&gt;Become a space pirate yourself by arming your ship and blasting unsuspecting merchant ships (and other players) for their cargo. Be careful though&amp;mdash;as your bounty stacks up, tougher bounty hunters will become interested in you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BOUNTY HUNTING&lt;br/&gt;So other players have bounties on their heads? Go after them and collect! But making powerful enemies in the galaxy may be your undoing. A good bounty hunter must know when and where to strike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPGRADE YOUR SPACESHIP&lt;br/&gt;Whether peaceful merchant, shifty smuggler, or ruthless warrior&amp;mdash;everyone could use a better ship. Upgrade your Lasers, Engines, Lightspeed, Shields, and Cargo Pods and keep your enemies off your back and increase your money-making potential. In addition to these standard upgrades, be on the lookout for unusual technology, such as cloaking devices, secret compartments, telepathic orbs, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FREE EXPANSION : Alpha Expansion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from the announcement : A free expansion called &amp;quot;Alpha Expansion&amp;quot; is available as a PDF download at dtstrain.com/smugglers. This expansion features custom character creation rules and additional optional rules which alter, improve, or add different aspects of the game. The expansion also includes an expanded strategy guide, solo-play rules, clarifications &amp;amp; errata, and a series printouts for improved spaceship sheets, character sheets, money, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES 2.0 AVAILABLE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new and improved rules are available as a free download from dtstrain.com/smugglers. See also Total rules on one sheet of paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE&lt;br/&gt;Ownership of Smugglers of the Galaxy has passed from Playus Maximus to designer Daniel Strain, and is now available to individuals, merchants, and distributors at: dtstrain.com/smugglers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
