							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Underground Railroad</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's 1853 in the newly founded town of Randolph,  Vermont. They've just built railroad tracks right  through the center of Main Street. Each time a  train churns through, it makes the whole town shudder  and leaves a trail of heavy black smoke. But  there's another train, too. One you can't see. It's the  Underground Railroad, and when it makes a detour  through Randolph, it will tear your new town  apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bounty hunters from the South have  arrived, looking for escaped slaves. Some folks  think they have no business in the North, and some  think they should get what they came for and leave.  But when you discover where they're hiding the two  fugitive slaves they've just captured, you have to  decide for yourself how to help&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
