			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A French graphical text adventure. The back of the box says (translated from French):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;You're a young and daring journalist, and you answer a call from your friend, professor MAC DOWELL. You must join him quickly, but... Be careful as soon as you arrive at the airport! The road to the city is dangerous. You made it? Congratulations! The real adventure is about to begin: cross the forest, visit underground caves, find the proper gear and climb the mountain, discover the subterranean river, dive into the syphon...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you're still alive, enter the LOST CITY. You have a very special mission to accomplish there. What mission? We'll let you find out for yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
