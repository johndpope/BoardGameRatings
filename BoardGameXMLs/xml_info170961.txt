							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Castle Dice: More Castles! â€“ Kickstarter Stretch Goal Rewards</name>
									
			<description>These items were unlocked as part of Castle Dice: More Castles! stretch goals. They will not be included in the retail version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Scout (x4)&lt;br/&gt;All 4 cards are the same.&lt;br/&gt;Text says: Play after you gather an animal. Add any card from your Castle deck discard pile to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;Note: One Super Scout can be added to each of the Castle Decks in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Villagers (x4)&lt;br/&gt;4 different cards (Super Farmer, Super Worker, Super Guard, and Super Merchant)&lt;br/&gt;Note: These will be totally optional to use. You can choose to put the matching one into your Castle Deck or not. And if you do put them in your deck, you can choose to remove any one other card from the deck before the game starts (or not, again it&amp;rsquo;s up to you). In fact, if you use card sleeves, your group could even put these into your Village deck for variety!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
