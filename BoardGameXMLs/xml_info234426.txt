			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scratch Golf is revolutionary game whereby players can play a round of golf anywhere and anytime using a pen or pencil on a beautifully designed paper golf course.  Players start from the 'tee box' shooting a pen or pencil by holding it by its tip and gently pushing the pen or pencil forward and letting it fall creating a 'scratch mark' which is your shot.  Object is to go from tee box to hole in the number of shots required (PAR) for that hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scratch Golf consists of 18 different designed holes (par 3, 4 and 5) a driving range, a putting green, a fold down score card, instructions and game rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scratch Golf can virtually be played anywhere since the game booklet can be placed on any flat surface or even your lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
