							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Torin&#039;s Passage</name>
									
			<description>Torin's Passage is a graphic adventure game developed and released by Sierra On-Line, designed by Al Lowe. The game holds the distinction of being a family friendly game by Lowe, designer of the adult-oriented Leisure Suit Larry series of games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The protagonist of the game is Torin, the son of a farming family on the planet of Strata. An evil sorceress named Lycentia captures his family with a magic spell and he embarks on a quest to find her and free his parents. He travels to the &amp;quot;lands below&amp;quot; to worlds beneath the surface of the nested planet, through colossus crystal columns called phenocrysts. These phenocrysts transfer life-giving sunlight to the lower worlds and people too with &amp;quot;Aerodski&amp;quot; powder. He is aided by a purple cat-like creature called Boogle, who is able to change itself into a variety of shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Torin's Passage&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
