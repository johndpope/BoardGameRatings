							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Scalplock (a game of Indian Fighting)</name>
									
			<description>Found in issue #9 of Little Wars magazine, April 1978.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) published a total of twelve issues of Little Wars magazine from 1976 to 1978 before folding it into The Dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction to the game:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Scalplock is a game designed to take in to account one of the more romantic and exciting elements of the Revolutionary War Period, yet one which has been little simulated; Indian Fighting and Buck-skinned Guerilla Skirmishing. The game is designed to incorporate rapidity of play to the point where time limits are set for any written orders to be made.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This miniature rules set includes scenarios set during the French and Indian War through the Post-Revolutionary War period. Each player controls small squads (ideally composed of 4-6 members). Rules seem to suggest 2 or more players, so team play is possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amusing side note:&lt;br/&gt;There's an additional scenario that pits a group of Tories and Indians vs. the Fellowship without Gandalf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Required for play:&lt;br/&gt;Appropriately-themed 20-25mm miniatures&lt;br/&gt;Metric Rule&lt;br/&gt;Percentile Dice and 6-sided Dice&lt;br/&gt;A hex or square-divided game board&lt;br/&gt;Terrain elements&lt;br/&gt;Blank counters or anything else to indicate contour elevations&lt;br/&gt;Poker chips (red, white, blue)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
