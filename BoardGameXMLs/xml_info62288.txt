			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Confucius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term heroic bloodshed was originally coined to describe a film genre that was born out of Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s new wave cinema. So what is heroic bloodshed? Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down. The heroism in the title manifests itself as a sense of duty, a code of honor, and a feeling of brotherhood to those who also live by these outmoded concepts. The bloodshed in the title comes as the result of attempts at redemption when the world is against you, the relentless pursuit of vengeance, and highly stylized violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Bloodshed: The Basics is a supplement for Modern d20/OGL that presents an overview of the heroic bloodshed genre and genre conventions and a variety of rules tweaks that bring the existing rules more into line with the over the top qualities of the genre. Heroic Bloodshed: The Basics includes tweaks to the existing occupations, guidelines for adding trust to the Allegiance system, an alternate base class (a variant that is simply stronger, tougher, faster and so forth), a few new uses for action points, and several high impact feats designed to add more &amp;ldquo;oompf&amp;rdquo; to gunplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
