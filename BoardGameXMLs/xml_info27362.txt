			<description>From the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Crime Club Party Game&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Test Your Power of Observation&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Photographic Clues - for the solution of each problem&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 cards are included, three copies of four types. Each card bears a photograph of a crime scene and a description of Inspector Cameron interviewing a suspect.  Something in the picture reveals the suspect to be lying, and this is for the player (or team) to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably this game is from the 1950s, though there is no date on the box or answer sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box is marked 'Series 3' and it seems there were at least this number of editions containing different puzzles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
