							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadows of Brimstone: Orphan Hero Pack</name>
									
			<description>The cold, hard realities of life on the frontier can sometimes leave children alone in the world.  Growing up fast is the only way to survive, and though many will fail, those Orphans that are wiley and fast enough can not only survive, but thrive, as they grow into the life of a Hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orphan is a new Hero Class that can be added to your games of Shadows of Brimstone. She is quick and agile, darting between Enemies, and constantly on the move. Though she does not have a lot of Health or Defense, the Orphan can quickly bounce back from damage and has a high tolerance for the horrors found out in the world.  Includes Male and Female Orphan miniatures in high-detail resin, two 30mm plastic bases, Orphan Double-Sided Hero Character Sheet, Rulesheet, Orphan Upgrade Chart, Starting Upgrade Cards, Starting Gear, and Orphan Mission Deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
