			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;For years the CloneMasters have ruled the world. Their only foes are the Terminators -- Trained from birth in the martial arts. Now you are a Terminator. Your mission: smash your way into the CloneMaster's fortress...chop through his defenses...to destroy him forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But his guards are many and loyal. Like you, they can kill with a single blow. And time is against you...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The situation is that a cloning expert bent on personal perpetuity has set up a lab defended by guards and martial artists. Meanwhile three fanatical kung fu experts are determined to break in and destroy the lab. Combat is largely deterministic, being mostly resolved by play of known combat chits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally published in Space Gamer Issue #30.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-Implemented By:&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Martial Arts Adventures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
