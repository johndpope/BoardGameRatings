			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation:Max rulebook contains all rules needed to create and play characters in a modern setting. Due to the simple game mechanics, the rules could also be adapted to other genres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also includes a sample adventure and minimalistic reviews of movies, computer games and comics that reflect the style of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The print edition of the rulebook was available in limited quantities. 100 copies (the silver edition) was sold at the Spiel 2002 game fair in Essen and via the game's website. 23 copies (the gold edition) were personal gifts by the author. Both editions were numbered and signed by the author in the respective color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
