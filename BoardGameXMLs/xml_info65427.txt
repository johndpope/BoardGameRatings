			<description>Welcome to Battlefield! The players will be able to memorize the names of officers, battles, and features which correspond to five wars that are taught in the course of study. In the affective domain, the learner will enjoy learning by viewing visual images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to get as many runs as possible which represent three categorized components of particular wars. Cards are first sorted into stacks according to: wars, generals, battles, and features. The cards are not named but contain a brief description. To begin, each player draws a war card and the top card from any of the remaining three stacks. As each player reads the brief description on the card drawn, any player who needs that card to make a run with his war card can claim it by correctly identifying the battle, general or feature and by placing one discard into its corresponding stack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;77 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
