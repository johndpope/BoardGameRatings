			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sarutobi Sasuke was a legendary ninja; his name, &amp;quot;Sarutobi&amp;quot;, means &amp;quot;Monkey Jump&amp;quot;, and he was famous for his agility and speed. Orphaned as a child, and raised by a tribe of monkeys, Sasuke developed incredibly acrobatic skills, able to climb and jump like his adopted monkey siblings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later in life, Sasuke became leader of the infamous Sanada Ten Braves, a group of ten Koga ninjas who assisted the warlord Sanada Yukimara in many great battles. His arch-rival was the Iga ninja Kirigakure Saizo, an elegant man accomplished in the arts of magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A master ninja, Sasuke was accomplished in all of the techniques of the art of ninjutsu. He was able to walk on water, turn invisible, disappear in a cloud of smoke, survive falls from great heights, and was expert in the use of the ninja-to short sword and the metsubishi blinding-powder. He was a master of stealth, endurance, and acrobatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sasuke fell in battle during the Siege of Osaka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
