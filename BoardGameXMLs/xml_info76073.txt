			<description>From the Game's Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the Operation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation is an international espionage agency that acts independently from any world power or government. It exists to ensure the safety and security of the public without falling into the manipulations and backroom dealings that are part of the daily routine of government s and global corporations. Its Operatives are culled from the best and brightest of the world's military, intelligence and academic communities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other intelligence agencies throughout the world like the British MI-5 and MI-6 and the American CIA, the Operation is a completely unknown entity to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What It Takes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation chooses its Operatives from the best and brightest of the world's Intelligence, Military and Academic communities. The Operation headhunts within these groups, looking for people that have skills that the Operation would find useful. Candidates must also be psychologically stable enough to be considered for engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation wants operatives that will think &amp;quot;outside of the box&amp;quot;. It has been found that candidates with a certain amount of dissatisfaction with their government or employer are easier to approach about becoming Operatives. As such, most candidates could be thought of as a little rebellious by their previous employers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operation does not do much in the way of training its Operatives, as most Operatives are both already trained and brought into the fold for skills that they already possess. If necessary, newly acquired Operatives will be given basic training in martial skills, including hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms.T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
