			<description>You play as one of the heads of a three-headed dragon named&lt;br/&gt;Josh who has captured the Princess. You and the other&lt;br/&gt;players, i.e. the dragon&amp;rsquo;s other heads, will have to deal with&lt;br/&gt;endless daring knights, a horde of the Princess&amp;rsquo; defenders&lt;br/&gt;and loads of other challenges, all while flirting with a lovely&lt;br/&gt;Princess. Try not to let the dragon down and do your best to&lt;br/&gt;stick with him until the end. That means not spending all your&lt;br/&gt;money, or charming the capricious damsel more than the&lt;br/&gt;other heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: there is an event every turn that requires the attention of a dragon (for example, if you are attacked by a knight, or there is a thunderstorm, or if something like that happens). Each player-head suggests a solution (basically, it all boils down to an auction to minimize the resources needed). Those who can solve the problem with the least effort win the favor of the princess. If the problem appears insoluble, the entire dragon suffers &amp;ndash; for example, a knight hits it hard with a sword. A few turns &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; this way end the game. In the end, this is a balance between the cooperative part (benefits the entire dragon) and the individual one (to become the most efficient manager among other heads). And, of course, the princess herself occasionally assigns tasks &amp;ndash; and the princess&amp;rsquo;s card additionally defines which methods she likes most.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 9 player cards (dragon heads);&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 3 two-sided princess cards&lt;br/&gt;(six beauties in all);&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 30 dragonfire cards;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 15 spell cards;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 8 defense cards;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 7 gift cards;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 18 cards with daring adventurers&lt;br/&gt;to defeat;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 6 unexpected move or&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;force majeure&amp;rdquo; cards;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 6 tokens representing&lt;br/&gt;Gosha&amp;rsquo;s health;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 24 coins;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
