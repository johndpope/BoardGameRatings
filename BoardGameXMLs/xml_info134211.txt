			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strike Legion is a science fiction roleplaying game set in the future where the mighty Imperium fights the Star Republic for domination of the universe. The Imperium is a xenophobic star empire that encompasses millions of worlds of uncountable subjugated humans. The Star Republic is a union of different sentient species that fight for their right to peace and progress. The Imperium swarms its enemies with endless hordes of ships while the Republic is defended by the Fleet with its small fleets of powerful and advanced battleships. The Imperium seems unstoppable as each new wave of Imperial ships depletes Fleet resources to the breaking point. In comes the Strike Legion. Each Legionnaire is equal to an army of regular soldiers and it is their job to enter Imperial space and destroy the Imperial war machine from within. They can do what an entire fleet of ships could never accomplish. To win the war, the Legion will have to prevail but the Imperium creates new ways to defeat them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play the role of a Legionnaire. (A superhuman fighting machine designed to be perfect.)&lt;br/&gt;     Fight the Imperium that wants to destroy everything that you believe in and love.&lt;br/&gt;     Win at all costs.&lt;br/&gt;     If you lose, all is lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
