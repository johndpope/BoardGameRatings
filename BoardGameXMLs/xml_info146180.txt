			<description>(From the Publisher's website):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your fame and glory!&lt;br/&gt;Viziers is a game of foresight set in a land of trade, combat and discovery. As a Vizier to the Sultan of Arpeya, you govern an Oasis on his behalf. With some planning, adaptability, and a good record of service, you're certain to become the next Grand Vizier!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gain the Sultan's favor by developing a prosperous Oasis. Entice the trade caravans to your domain with livestock, weapons, food and artifacts but beware the raiders and conquerors who will surely seek to steal your wealth! Build academies to make discoveries, strongholds to protect your Oasis and palaces to curry favor with the nobility. Every once in a while make an effort to set a rival back - but take care that you don't suffer the same fate!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have the foresight to lay a successful path to victory, or the creativity to adapt to the changing needs of your Oasis? Can you stay a step ahead of your rivals as you jostle for ultimate power and the title of Grand Vizier?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personal Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viziers is played over rounds, as players race to first gain 10 victory points, winning them the game. Each round, cards to be auctioned are passed out to players who secretly study them before they are called to commit to purchasing the different resources necessary to win (or avoid winning) the cards in their possession and everyone else's during the upcoming auctions. The cards are then returned and resolved in the order of their numbers. Both lucrative trade and strong enemies are acquired by the player with the highest of the relevant resource, along with global events and technologies. After the cards (and their rewards and punishments) are assigned to the players, a new round begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
