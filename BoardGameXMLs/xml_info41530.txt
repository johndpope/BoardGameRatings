			<description>From the introduction in the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Make or Break is a rapidly moving game based on the fascinating stock market.  Two to six people may play.  Stock prices and dividends vary.  The player's aim is to buy and sell stocks for profits and dividends.  The richest player at the end of an agreed period of time wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this lone offering from 1960s publisher Spiegel Reid, players buy and sell stocks in four companies -- Yukon Gold, Star Oil, Marc Missile, and C&amp;amp;O Railroad, as well as a Mutual Fund.  The success or failure of these stocks is determined by a deck of &amp;quot;market cards,&amp;quot; which are revealed at the start of every turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
