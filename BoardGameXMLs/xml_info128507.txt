							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ratz Fatz in das Märchenland</name>
									
			<description>Like the other games in the Ratz Fatz series, this is a collection of games that can be played with the same material. This particular game focuses on fairytales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central idea: A story or poem is being read, the kids listen, guess, rhyme and grab an object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 3 wooden fairy tale figurines (frog prince, dwarf, puss in boots), 12 cards (showing objects from fairytales, like an enchanted mirror, a witch's broom, gingerbread house etc.), one symbol die, one booklet with rules, stories, riddles and poems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games that can be played:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Group and name: The players name the figurines and things on the cards and explain what fairytales they are from, or who else is part of that fairytale. They also look for objects that fit a certain criterion (something valuable, something in which one can live...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Grab it: The figurines or cards mentioned in one of the texts from the booklet have to be touched as quick as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Memory game: Only six figurines and/or cards are laid out on the table, the others stay in the box. When a character or object is mentioned that is on the table, nothing happens. If one that is inside the box is mentioned, the players shout that word to gain one of the pieces from the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Memory and storytelling game: The players use the cards and figurines to tell a story. 4 cards are used for the first figurine, the next 4 for the second, and the last 4 for the third. Then the symbol die is rolled. The symbol decides which of the three stories the players have to re-tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. What can you do with this: One player secretly decides on one of the cards. He/she then says what can be done with that object (e.g. &amp;quot;You can use it to make a rabbit appear from a hat&amp;quot; when they have chosen the magic wand). The other players try to guess the object. The first player to touch the correct card wins that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
