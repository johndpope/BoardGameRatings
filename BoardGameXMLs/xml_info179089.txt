			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an unfortunate confluence of events, the Outlaws have found themselves out of means in a little town farther to the east (thus, closer to civilization and the Law) than they'd ever like to be. But, thing is, they do have a possible way out of their jam, 'cause they've got themselves something along the lines of a treasure map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regrettably, though, the treasure seems likely to be lying somewhere inside the home of an old widow woman who has no idea that she's sitting on a fortune. If the Outlaws want that money (and they sure &amp;lsquo;nough do), then they'll need some time to search out that treasure while keeping the poor widow woman none the wiser&amp;hellip;not to mention all of them other folk who've come sniffing around for the money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
