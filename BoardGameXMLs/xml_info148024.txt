							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Beckoning</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The The Beckoning is a full-color, 24 x 20 inch, floor plan of a mystical chamber, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Minion fires a gun. The minion&amp;rsquo;s boss guts him personally in one quick motion.] &amp;ldquo;You fool! You&amp;rsquo;ll damage the book! Its power will be mine! Use your fists and your blades men!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beckoning is a single room map where study of a book from ancient times is being performed in a universe guided by science. This map mixes fantasy with science fiction.  This product includes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Beckoning. The room is open to the stars above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beckoning is intended for use in science fiction games that mix in fantasy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beckoning is a great set up for a puzzle/investigation for the Player Characters. They could be playing the part of the research team to figure out the tome and the strange glowing orbs. The Player Characters must translate the book to figure out how the room works. It is up to the Game Master what exactly happens when they do figure it out. Could this room&amp;rsquo;s four portals lead to other worlds under certain conditions such as a proper alignment of the stars? Can the globes be used to project a star pattern above with the appropriate alignment? Are the globes themselves maps of stars that could lead to a science fiction adventure trying to find out what happened to the culture that created the room?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A slightly different adventure is one in which the Player Characters are hired by the research team as mercenaries to be their security. In this scenario, enemies who want the tome and artifacts lie in wait for them to figure out their secrets, and then attack when they discovery how the room works. Game Masters might want to keep the Player Characters on their toes by sending scouts to watch their progress, giving them a chance to notice someone is watching and spying on them. When they finally do attack, the Player Characters need to keep the research team protected and defeat the enemies who want to steal the tome and the artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
