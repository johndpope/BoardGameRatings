							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sprung</name>
									
			<description>Sprung is a video game for the Nintendo DS. It was released in North America on December 7, 2004. Sprung puts players in the shoes of either Becky or Brett who try to get an NPC of the opposite sex to fall in love with them. Players &amp;quot;flirt&amp;quot; their way through conversations; player responses influence the resulting NPC dialogue. Sprung can be regarded as a dating sim, though the linearity and variety in the game (as well as its humor) lend it more to being an adventure game. The working title for Sprung was Crush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sprung was met with cold reception by most video game critics and generally received low ratings and yielded poor sales. Many video game outlets sell the game at a budget price as a result. Also, it appears that the game cannot be completed 100%, as one of the artworks is not unlockable due to a bug.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sprung,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
