			<description>The Blue &amp;amp; The Grey is a Civil War card game which pits two players against one another in a battle between the United States of America and the Confederate States of America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two players choose and play as one of four famous Generals who possess their own special bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both sides have in their arsenal Conscripts, Career Infantrymen, Cavalry, Cannons, and Gatling Guns.  Additionally, each deck has Research &amp;amp; Development cards which allow for certain advantages over the other player. Some of these include: Balloon Reconnaissance, rifling, and the hiring of mercenary Native Americans!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your battle change history for the Confederacy or follow history and reunite the Union?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
