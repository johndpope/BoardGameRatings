							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horizon Riders</name>
									
			<description>Horizon Riders allows players to control any of the four squad members on their mission to defeat Thau-Phi, dashing at high-speed through the surface of planet Zethos on powerful hoverboards while destroying the renegade cybernetic army with their futuristic arsenal. Each character carries two weapons, each with different rates of fire, damage and bullet spread and these weapons can be upgraded through use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hoverboard can be controlled with a Wii Balance Board, allowing players to turn left and right to avoid enemy fire using their own bodies. The game also supports the use of the Wii Zapper for aiming and firing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A demo version of the Horizon Riders is available today and for four weeks. This demo version features three levels and one of the four Riders that are available in the full version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horizon Riders is the first WiiWare game both created and published by Sabarasa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
