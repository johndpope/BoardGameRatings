			<description>&amp;quot;What is this game all about?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's about combat! The vision is to create an immensely fun, competitive, skillful and, at times, infuriating game of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a design standpoint, I want to keep the game focused, performance-minded and minimalistic at heart - so it can do what it does as well as it can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very general list of hopes for the game are as follows...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a game where..&lt;br/&gt;...there are no builds, classes, choices or restrictions aside from ones self-imposed.&lt;br/&gt;...practice makes perfect, and competition is fierce - even among friends!&lt;br/&gt;...a player's ability won't be limited by the number of abilities they can chose.&lt;br/&gt;...not only high skill and precision players are rewarded, but also smart and intuitive ones.&lt;br/&gt;...players are not bombarded with unnecessary and over-complicated game mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;...emphasis is on combat first and foremost.&lt;br/&gt;...every victory is as satisfying as every defeat is crushing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
