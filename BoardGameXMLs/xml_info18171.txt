			<description>WHO DARES? is a game of courage, bluff and perspicacity.  It all revolves around a set of 'dares' and the individual decisions of players.  Dare they dare, or dare they not!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once each dare is read out, each player has to decide &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; whilst taking account of the following two factors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-  whether or not they can carry out the dare.&lt;br/&gt;-  how they think the other players will answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the voting pattern, and their own vote, players can work out (by reference to the appropriate chart) whether or not they have to carry out the proposed dare and their scores (positive or negative).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And don't forget ... it is possible to win and never to have to do anything if you can successfully guess your opponents' responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player (or team) to score 20 points (though different target scores can be agreed on depending on the time available).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
