			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon takes a common spell and shows you ways to add excitement and useful options that can be added to the spell in question.  Each issue of Avalon Spell books will focus on a new spell, adding new version of the spell, different components that can be used to alter the way the spell works and even feats and new magical items linked to the spell in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This month we have the Arcane Mark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across many lands and magic traditions, spellcasters keep using the arcane mark spell, one of the most basic cantrips.  But a few of them wonder whether such a personal thing, magically linked to its owner and remarkably unique, should have more powers and more applications than just shining on one's front door. After all, the instant summons spell provides a good example of such cantrip use. Eventually researchers have discovered new ways to use these personal marks, both by manipulating the basic cantrip energies and designing more powerful spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
