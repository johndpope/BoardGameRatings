			<description>Mr.M&amp;rsquo;s Code of Murder：The Byzantine Assassin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the still of the night, Mr M sneaks into the decadent palace of nobles to exact his vengeance under his mask.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sharp call fills the air, waking the depraved nobles from their dreams of avarice and greed. The duchess has fallen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A murder note written on lamb skin lays at the side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;God's Judgement is at Hand, and the guilty will be purged!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The queen stares in shock at the brutal murder, the duke watches his companions with suspicion. The bard is playing his lute on the balcony. The old scholar strokes his beard. The maid is trembling in the corner and a mysterious smile hangs on the corner of the jester's face. Mr M remains hidden amongst them, poised to exact his justice...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is cooperative deduction game that pits 1 player against the remaining players who seeks to deduce the identity after 5 rounds or characters have been eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 13 characters are placed in the palace and the player playing Mr M receives 10 Murder cards. Mr M takes the top 2 cards from the Suspects deck and picks 1 as his character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn continues with Character cards laid out (exact number based on players) in a row. The other players take turns activating 1 of the laid out Character card (the activated character then moves and activate his/her ability if necessary)each in order to deduce Mr M's identity and/or limit his killing options. Lastly, Mr M either activates the 2 remaining unused characters or 1 of the used characters. He finishes off his turn by playing a Murder card that kills one of the other characters in the palace, following all the rules and limitations listed on the murder card. The other players know which character died - but they do not know how. The used Murder card is then placed over the Character card of the murdered character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 5 rounds or 5 characters have been killed, whichever is earlier, players would have to deduce the identity of Mr M.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a character is moved into a murdered character's location, the players can reveal the Murder card and use the information to isolate their suspect. For example, the Murder card:Death by Hanging might read; use to kill any one character in a room that is in the same column of rooms as Mr M. Another Murder card:Gunpowder Plot, would say; kill all characters in a room adjacent to Mr M.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
