							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Friendship Island</name>
									
			<description>This game focuses on making friends, being a good friend, and resolving disagreements in a win-win way. The game is designed so that players cooperate and help each other as well as answer questions about friendship to win points for themselves. The game also helps shy and socially delayed students explore friendship issues. Features two different games that use the same board but have separate questions. The second game involves more strategy, harder questions, more advanced vocabulary, and more opportunities for negotiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;ldquo;Teachers Guide&amp;rdquo; with complete lesson plans for both versions of the game is included. Students practice reading skills (reading the cards) and math skills (handling the point certificates). Students are challenged to use critical thinking in answering questions and in forming their strategies for playing the game. During the post-game discussion students link their experience in the game with real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes game board, six game tokens, one die, Making-a-Friend cards, Good Times cards, Solving Problems cards, and instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
