							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Drumbeat</name>
									
			<description>Following Japan&amp;rsquo;s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Germany swiftly joined its Axis partner and declared war on the United States on Dec. 11, 1941. Admiral Karl D&amp;ouml;nitz, commander of Germany&amp;rsquo;s much-feared u-boat fleet, altered his strategy to bring the maritime war to America&amp;rsquo;s east coast. Where once he relied on German submarines preying on supply convoys on the open Atlantic Ocean, now he deployed long-range Type-IX u-boats to prowl the American coastal waters along which freighters and tankers sailed to convoy assembly points in the Canadian maritime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially u-boat commanders took advantage of America&amp;rsquo;s unprepared defenses, hunting easy targets with few patrols and even coastal cities lit up, ignoring wartime blackout precautions; but the Americans quickly mustered their forces for war, increasing their patrols by aircraft and destroyers and ultimately chasing the German u-boats from the East Coast and back into wolf pack formations to prowl the North Atlantic once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operation Drumbeat is a solitaire game in which a player assumes the role of a u-boat commander sent to hunt shipping along America&amp;rsquo;s East Coast in early 1942. The player plots a course on a grid map like the ones used by German submarine captains to travel to the patrol area and hunt targets. A series of charts helps simulate the chances of running into American patrols, encountering freighters and tankers, and attacking them with torpedoes and deck guns. Each turn equals one day; the player tracks the u-boat&amp;rsquo;s progress in a log much like actual German submarine captains used. How many ships can a captain sink before his u-boat runs out of torpedoes&amp;hellip;or luck?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
