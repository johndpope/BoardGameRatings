			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due Vigilance: Black Chapter is a new supplement that introduces The Library, an Organization ready to drop into your Mutants and Masterminds (Third Edition) campaign. The Library is fully detailed with staff and equipment for your characters to use should they decide to join this august and mysterious group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joining them might be a good idea, too, because The Library has special teams to deal with those who cross their path or impede their investigations. Teams like Black Chapter, a group of the most dangerous mystic agents your players are likely to meet! They may be allies, should your players play by the Library&amp;rsquo;s rules, but they will not hesitate to confront even the most popular heroes if they stand between the Library and their mysterious goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written by Jack Norris, with artwork by Alex Williamson, Denise Jones, Jesse Justice, and James Dawsey, Black Chapter is a great addition to any superhero setting in need of a little Supernatural spice. Black Chapter features vampires, literary mages, immortal oracles, mad monks, kung-fu commando yetis, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
