			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you survived Galaforce then you may have the necessary skill and daring to succeed in Galaforce 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aliens attack in precise preconceived formations, with each Galaxy comprising several such formations. There are a total of 16 Galaxies. You must pilot your spaceship, carefully avoiding the aliens, or shooting them whenever possible. Some aliens need to be hit more than once to destroy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for the alien Capsules. You collect a capsule by colliding with it or by shooting it twice. You will then gain a special feature. Some features are helpful, e.g. extra laser power, extra life; others are harmful, e.g. no firepower, slow ship movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaforce 2 was originally released as a new title on Superior's Play It Again Sam 6 compilation.
