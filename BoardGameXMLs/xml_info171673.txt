			<description>Three robbers took a treasure and hid it in their castle. This castle is on the island in the middle of the deep lake in robbers forest. Each player tries to conquer the treasure, the fastest player wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, each player has the get hold of the necessary attributes to make the crossing to the castle: a hat as a disguise, a boat as transport and a key to get in. These attributes are available on special fields in the robbers forest. A simple dice game helps the players with that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When someone has collected the necessary cards, he may try his luck in the castle. In his turn, this player may choose one of the seven cards face down (three robbers, three neutral cards and the treasure). Either he won immediately (treasure map), he may try again in his next turn (neutral card), or he must begin again (robber card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With beautifully illustrated game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
