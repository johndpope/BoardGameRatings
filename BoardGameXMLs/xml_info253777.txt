			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the kingdom of Aruanda, there is an untamed land. It is a place where witches walk, where goblins cavort, where the borders between the realms of man and fey grow thin. For some, it is a place of unspeakable wonder; for others, only madness and death lie within its trackless depths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the Runewild, and it is both beautiful and cruel. Here, only one thing is certain: if you wish to survive, you must be twisted by the Runewild&amp;rsquo;s weird and wicked magic&amp;mdash;or you die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of its ties to the Feywild, the Runewild is a place steeped in powerful fey magic. Centuries of study allowed the Aosidhe elves to harness some of that power, but the elves were always quick to warn against the careless use of the Runewild&amp;rsquo;s magic. The wizards of Aruanda&amp;rsquo;s Council Arcane often failed to heed these warnings, with disastrous results. The two magic items featured in this preview, the Highvale Blades and The Twisted Tome, illustrate both the might and the dangers inherent in the magic of the Runewild.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
