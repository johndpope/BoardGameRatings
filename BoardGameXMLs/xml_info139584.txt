			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Windows capable re-release of the DOS flight sim AH-64D Longbow is &amp;quot;limited&amp;quot; by virtue of having the Campaign option removed - something that is not made evident by the description on the box (which is the same as used on the DOS release, with the exception of a few words about the campaign missions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed By Experts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced by critically acclaimed combat sim designer Andy Hollis (Gunship, F-15 Strike Eagle III, F-19 Stealth Fighter), AH-64D Longbow represents over 40 man-years of development effort, almost a century of Jane's expertise, and has been fully tested by U.S. Army combat pilots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real Terrain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly nap-of-the-earth across 20,000 KM^2 of fully-textured rolling terrain, all modeled on real U.S. Geological Survey digital elevation maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;True Flight Modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced aerospace engineering makes the AH-64D Longbow dynamics the most realistic ever. Experience the sensation of helicopter flight like never before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 Ways To Fly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive flight training, authentic historical missions, instant action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully customizable interface and controls let you tailor physics and gameplay to your personal flying style.
