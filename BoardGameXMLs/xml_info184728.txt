			<description>For hundreds of years, humanity has been traveling through far galaxies. Many centuries ago humans encountered other sentient &amp;ndash; yet alien &amp;ndash; races, but only Kalmians were as aggressive and as technologically advanced as the descendants of the inhabitants of Earth. In the remote outer rim of the universe Tellurians and Kalmians keep fighting in their spaceships for domination. In those fierce and deadly skirmishes only a few things really count: commanders&amp;rsquo; skills to maneuver huge astral vessels, the ability to foresee your opponent&amp;rsquo;s next move as well as wise management of energy in different ship sectors and proper assignment of power to shields and laser cannons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one ship shall leave this accursed vastness of space, while the burnt-out wreck of its rival shall remain here as a warning to all enemies or a prized loot for lucky scrappers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outer Rim is a simple and quick, science-fiction battle game for two players. One player commands the starship of Tellurians, while the other player becomes the captain of the star vessel belonging to the alien race of Kalmians. Players wage a deadly duel in the cosmic space. Victory depends on proper allocation of energy around the starship, a little luck when rolling dice and smart use of special abilities of modules and crews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle ends when one of the starships has two sectors destroyed. The commander of such vessel loses and his opponent wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
