							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Robbin&#039; Eggs</name>
									
			<description>The robin has placed positive and negative numbers on the bottom of the 18 eggs in his nest.  On your turn, turn over a card and follow the sometimes silly instructions.  Usually this means roll the 24-sided die and then turn over eggs as instructed to try to try to get the sum of the eggs as close to the number rolled as possible.    The difference between the sum of the eggs turned over and the roll of the die results in penalty points.  And you might get to rob eggs from an opponent who is doing well or scramble the eggs to make it hard for the your opponents to remember where certain numbers are.  It's a game of math, memory, and luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
