			<description>GAMES of the WORLD has been Chris's pet project at Acorn Games for years. Acorn Games has always wanted to produce a game with a solid wood board and playing pieces that allow you to play a multitude of games. They have gathered together four classic games from around the world and have designed four of their own games that can all be played on a classic &amp;quot;Alquerque&amp;quot; board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They found some games which use 12 or less pieces of each color that can all be played on the same board. Next they set out to design a series of new games which use the same pieces and board but have either more modern moves or conditions of victory to make them appeal to today&amp;rsquo;s game players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic games that you will find in the book are;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alquerque(&amp;quot;Alquerque&amp;quot; is a Checkers variant) from Spain&lt;br/&gt;Seega(&amp;quot;Seega&amp;quot;) from Africa and Egypt&lt;br/&gt;Cercar La Liebre(similar to &amp;quot;Catch the Hare&amp;quot;) also from Spain&lt;br/&gt;Five Field Kono(&amp;quot;Five Field Kono&amp;quot;) from Korea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new games from Acorn Games in the book are;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Fortress&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot; game&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Centaurs&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;replacement&amp;quot; game&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Troop&amp;quot;, another replacement game&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Neutrino&amp;quot;, another condition game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a &amp;quot;Replacement Game&amp;quot; the players are each trying to get from&lt;br/&gt;their starting point to where their opponent started out from.&lt;br/&gt;Sort of like in &amp;quot;Chinese Checkers&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a &amp;quot;Condition Game&amp;quot; the players&lt;br/&gt;are trying to be the first player to DO something. This may be to&lt;br/&gt;get something like getting 3-in-a-row as in TicTacToe but not&lt;br/&gt;mattering WHERE on the board you achieve this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid wood construction and pieces as well as a clearly written rule book with diagrams make this a sure bet with teachers and game players alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not described but playable with the included board of the board game collection as well: &amp;quot;Bagh Bandi&amp;quot;, Bagh Chal from Nepal, and Fanorona Dimy (a Fanorona variant on a five times five board) from Madagascar. Rules available in BGG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
