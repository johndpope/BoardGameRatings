							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Deepwood Catacombs</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deepwood, the huge forest that hugs the side of the Greybark Hills, has many secrets. Travellers and locals speak of ancient ruins, abandoned for hundreds of years, and treasures for those willing to brave the wilderness. One such location is known as the Deepwood Catacombs. Once a grand structure, this tomb is now overgrown and flooded. Grave robbers and adventurers have ransacked the upper chambers for most of their treasures, but the inner region of the catacombs is flooded and thus far this has prevented the looting of the ancient tombs. Who knows what lies in wait for those willing to brave the dark waters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Need a quick map for an encounter?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A printable battlemap compatible with any RPG/Dungeon-Crawl game. Use as a standalone gameboard, or combine with any same-scale tileset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: A 20 x 30 map depiciting an ancient and overgrown tomb complex, located in a forest. Trees and roots grow over the ancient stones, with chambers and corridors leading deeper into the hillside. The lower levels are flooded at various depths, although some chambers have survived so far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
