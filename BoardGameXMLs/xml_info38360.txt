			<description>(From the box cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Concept:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game designed to allow Players to learn or teach business concepts and strategies in an enjoyable, competitive environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players match wits with the business logic of the game's creators.  While discussions of questions and disagreements can ensue, the creators provide the logic behind their answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may have to &amp;quot;agree to disagree&amp;quot; to win - but no one &amp;quot;loses&amp;quot; if they enjoy learning the realities of the business world that have worked for the game's creators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
