			<description>In Halloween, each player is a monster trying to be the first to capture a human in the center of the board. The game uses a simple roll and move mechanic to advance along the track, but if you hit a space with a dot in it, you will have to draw a card - which could send you a certain number of spaces forward or backward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has instructions for each monster on it. You will just read the instruction relevant to you. If you run out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the center of the board is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
