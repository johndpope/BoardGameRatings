			<description>Quiz of the Decade series from Noris publisher attributes the players in the 70s. Each participant tries to get through right answer as many questions of quiz cards. Who has the most cards at the end in his possession wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quiz cards are shuffled and placed in a pile in the middle of the table. There are six categories: 1) History &amp;amp; Politics, 2) literature and film, 3) Sports &amp;amp; Games, 4) Technology &amp;amp; Cars, 5) music and 6) Misc. &lt;br/&gt;The active player rolls the dice and one player takes the bottom card from the pile and reads the corresponding question. Now the player must choose one of four answer choices, because only one of the answers is correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
