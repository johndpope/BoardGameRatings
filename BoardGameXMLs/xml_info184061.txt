			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARM is an adaptable generic RPG, designed by a minimalist author.  This means that details are often left up to the GM and the players - I prefer that room for my imagination to work, and I dislike getting bogged down in complex rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARM uses a unique logarithmic resolution table to determine target difficulty.  Character stats are also based on logarithmic values adjusted by situational modifiers and a die roll.  This resolution process is used for everything in the game.  The game is copyright but distributed freely and exists in ASCII text form only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
