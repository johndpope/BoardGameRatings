			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In WordChance, players can easily make large words using the 16 tiles in their hand.  The score for the word is based on the product of the number of letters in the word played and the value on a multiplier chance card selected during the player turn.  The multiplier cards have values of 0 to 10, -5 and -10.  Hence playing a large word may be a good thing, or a bad thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has 676 spaces for word forming (26x26 spaces).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also other types of chance cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Bonus word cards that allows the player to play a second word during their turn.&lt;br/&gt;     A swap tiles card which causes the players to switch their game tiles with that of the player to their left.&lt;br/&gt;     A bankrupt card which sets the total score of the player to zero.  If chosen early in the game, the player can recover.  This card is only put in the card deck if there are three or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We think that the ability to make larger words and the addition of chance makes WordChance lots fun to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
