							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tigress Exploration Vehicle</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly two centuries ago, the Miodellian Army concluded that the militarized civilian trucks in use no longer satisfied their requirements. A requirement was posted for a versatile light transport unit. Mioakima Training Asteroid was the main testing grounds of the Tigress VLTU-A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tigress became the vehicular backbone of the Miodellian Army as it defended its resource-rich, small moons. The Tigress was designed primarily for personnel and light cargo transport behind front lines, not as a front line fighting vehicle. It has since been replaced by much more advanced grav propulsion vehicles in military service, but is still often encountered in use by mercenaries and civilian forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Including stats, tactical maps and front, rear and side elevations for both the civilian and militarized version. The perfect runabout for a group of sci-fi characters who like to ride into action in style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
