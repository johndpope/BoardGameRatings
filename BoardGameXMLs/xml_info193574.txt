			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Microsoft Flight Simulator X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepar3D is Lockheed Martin's continuation of the Microsoft Flight Simulator family of games. It is based on the Microsoft ESP simulator, which is the commercial-user version of Microsoft Flight Simulator X. While Prepar3D is fully licensed and authorized by Microsoft, the limitations of that license prevent it being sold for &amp;quot;personal computer entertainment&amp;quot;. It is however seen by many members of the flight sim community as the natural continuation of the series, and the licensing constraints that it is sold under are not seen as a limitation to the end user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;v2 introduced a substantial number of changes to the underlying code of the software. This includes multi-core CPU support, and most notably the transition from DirectX 9 to DirectX 11.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;v2 also includes additional aircraft created by third party developers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     F-22 (IRIS Flight Simulation Software)&lt;br/&gt;     F-35A (India India Alpha Foxtrot Echo)&lt;br/&gt;     Bonanza A-36 (Carenado)&lt;br/&gt;     Extra 300s (Alabeo)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While retaining the same name as its predecessor, it is sold as a separate product, much like an annual edition of a sports video game franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
