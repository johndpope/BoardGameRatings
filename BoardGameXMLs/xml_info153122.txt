			<description>Marschall Vorw&amp;auml;rts! is the thirteenth game in the Pocket Battle Games series from LPS, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coalition forces under Blucher attacked here in an attempt to take control of the vital supply routes feeding into the city of Leipzig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marschall Vorw&amp;auml;rts! is a mini-game, postcard sized. Rules at the back, map front and 17 double sided counters along the sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a hex and counter game where troops are activated though a standard deck of cards: black activates French units, red Coalition. How many and all is determined by the specific card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is resolved by comparing combat strengths of the units and drawing cards from that same deck. Whenever a joker is drawn, the turn is over, the deck is reshuffled and a new turn begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game is to occupy a certain hex on the map at the end of 6 turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
