			<description>Politicks is a fun, tongue-in-cheek card game for 2&amp;ndash;4 players featuring Maltese politicians and events from Maltese politics. Not that you need to know anything about Maltese politics or even understand Maltese to enjoy the game. The game was designed by Gordon Pace and illustrated by Mark Scicluna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have just been appointed as a political party&amp;rsquo;s strategist with the task of winning the upcoming election. You know that the best way to win votes is to gain the support of organisations and lobby groups by sending your best politicians to convince them and by directing the course of events to be in your favour. Will you lead your party to electoral victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, each player represents a political party. The game is played over a number of rounds, in each of which a faction (a lobby group or organisation) is willing to meet up with the parties to decide who to support in the upcoming election. Players play politician cards to convince the faction to support them, and event cards to affect politicians and the faction. At the end of the round, the votes represented by the faction are gained by the player whose politician is most influential. The first player to gain 9 votes wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
