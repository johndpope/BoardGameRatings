			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights Acolyte of the Infinite Balance&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Time is a dream &amp;ndash;or a nightmare- from which there is no waking. We who travel in Time are dreamers who occasionally share a common experience.&amp;rdquo; -Michael Moorcock, The Dreamers at the End of Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are those who are born to be tools of the multiverse-not chosen, but simply pieces in the machine of Time and Space to aid in its grinding out the motions of eternity. Those that are born thinking themselves ordinary mortals and become Knights Acolyte of the Infinite Balance, or &amp;ldquo;Infinytes&amp;rdquo; soon come to the realization that there is something&amp;hellip; selected about them, that there are purposes in play that may take their destinies to places they know not of. Ordinary peasants are rarely infinytes, and it is often the inborn distinctness of an infinyte that guides the multiverse into creating them- last of a tribe, orphan son of a lost king, a would-be wizard awakening from a coma. Infinytes soon learn of their different-ness and turn their efforts to understanding and using their powers to struggle against the cosmic plans that have involuntarily included them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purple Duck Note: Access to the Hero Point rules system is essential for using the infinyte, and familiarity with hero points and their uses and methods of recovery is a must for GMs and players involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 20-level class for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
