			<description>From the instructions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This superb simulation offers all the thrills and heartbreaks of the real thing - from cup glory to nerve-wracking battles against relegation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SETTING UP&lt;br/&gt;Up to eight players can join the fun, each taking charge of one of the 80 teams featured, which are split into four leagues of 20 teams each. Before starting, you can select two or three points for a win. All players begin with a squad of 16 players, working for a team in the fourth division, and the aim is to get to the top of the pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SEASON&lt;br/&gt;Each team plays 38 league games and takes part in both the League Cup and FA Cup competitions. League Cup games are played over two legs, the result being decided on the aggregate score from both legs. Cup matches cause some league games to be postponed until after the season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
