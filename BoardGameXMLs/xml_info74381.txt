			<description>&amp;quot;The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a video game released by Ocean in 1993. It was based on the second Addams Family animated series and was considered to be one of the toughest platformers on the SNES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released on all three of Nintendo's systems at the time:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super NES in February, 1993&lt;br/&gt;Game Boy in July, 1993&lt;br/&gt;NES in August, 1993&lt;br/&gt;The Game Boy version was ported for the system by Enigma Variations Ltd.&lt;br/&gt; Story&lt;br/&gt;The plot of Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt centered around Pugsley's attempts to win a scavenger hunt challenge proposed by his sister, Wednesday. His hunt takes him to the bedrooms of each member of the Addams family in order to find one item from each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The game is a side scrolling platformer adventure game that plays in a very similar way to the previous Addams Family title. The game plays in a non-linear way in so much that the player can choose which level to attempt by entering whichever door they choose in the Addams house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Versions&lt;br/&gt;It's interesting to note that the NES version was not a direct port of the SNES version. The NES version was actually based on the previous Addams Family game released for Super NES, Mega Drive and Amiga, showing the same levels, enemies, items and gameplay but with Pugsley as main character instead of Gomez.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reception&lt;br/&gt;A major source of criticism for the SNES version was the lack of a password feature, despite the game being very difficult. A password feature is present on both the NES and Game Boy versions. Super Play Magazine UK praised the graphics as they were more colourful than in the previous title, saying that &amp;quot;This is one of those games that it's fun just to sit and watch, not only to play.&amp;quot;[12] Review scores for the SNES version are generally higher than for either the NES or Game Boy versions.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Addams_Family:_Pugsley's_Scavenger_Hunt,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
