							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warrior</name>
									
			<description>Warrior was one of the pioneers in the fighting game genre. It was an early one-on-one fighting game, a type that would not blossom until the early '90s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game featured an overhead view of two dueling knights rendered in monochrome vector graphics. Due to the limitations of the hardware used, the processor could not render the characters and gaming environment (pits and stairs) at the same time, so a printed background was used to display the &amp;quot;terrain&amp;quot; elements, with the characters projected on the top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was developed by Tim Skelly while working at Cinematronics, but it was released under the Vectorbeam company name. Originally Skelly planned for a two-player system with each player using two joysticks, one to control the movement of the player and the other controlling the player's weapon. However, financial constraints restricted the cabinet to one stick for each player and a button to switch between character and weapon modes. The sticks were produced in house and installed in cabinets in a way that players found unresponsive and difficult to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Warrior (arcade game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License, with additional User Summary content added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
