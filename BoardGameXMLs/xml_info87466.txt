			<description>User Summary: This game is designed to help parents communicate and find new ways to think about their relationships with their children. Using a deck of cards, the game has various kinds of techniques to challenge a parent's view, and to help them see the world differently. For example, you might be asked to role-play a scenario, but with a specific attitude alien to your normal thinking. Or the card may ask a moral question, but you have to answer from the view of different ages. There are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers, and gamers may not consider Alles Paletti?! to be a game in the normal sense. But it is designed to use methods of play to bring out changes in people, without accusations and finger-pointing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
