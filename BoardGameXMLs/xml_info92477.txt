							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golden Tee Golf</name>
									
			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first of the storied Golden Tee Golf game series. It starts with humble roots. This version is 2d. Only looking from behind the golfer. It still features 3 courses with varying tee shots. Games are played through 18 holes if you put in the quarters (1 for 3 holes of golf). Graphics were lackluster (very blocky).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the normal rules for golf play. All scoring is done for stroke play (hazards, water penalties etc.) You are provided with a standard set of clubs. 2-9 irons, 3 and 5 woods and a driver. Sand and pitch wedge and a putter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the swing you can turn left or right. By rolling the roller ball (controller) back in a certain direction (for backswing) then foward in a certain direction, you can accomplish different shots including slices, hooks, fades and knock down shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
