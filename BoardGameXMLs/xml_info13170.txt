			<description>This game is basically Scrabble. It might even be a precursor to the game or a take off on the original game. I'm not sure because on top of having no Publisher or Designer listed on the box, there is no year of publication listed either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is for each player to play out his letters by forming words to the crossword layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some differences from Scrabble are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    When you place a word on a square with a star you throw a die and then receive a bonus of 5 or 10 times the die roll. &lt;br/&gt;    There are no plurals allowed. &lt;br/&gt;    There are four blank tiles. &lt;br/&gt;    Words are scored at 5 points per letter. &lt;br/&gt;    Challenges to words cost 25 points to either player depending on if the challenge was successful or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
