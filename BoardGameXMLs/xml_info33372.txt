							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Evacuation of KÃ¶nigsberg</name>
									
			<description>The Evacuation of K&amp;ouml;nigsberg is a 2-player game simulating the Russian assault on the East Prussian city of K&amp;ouml;nigsberg and the German defense and evacuation of the city and surrounding areas in early 1945.  While the eventual fall of the city is a foregone conclusion, the goal of the German player is to accumulate victory points by evacuating civilians and military personnel before the fall.  The goal of the Russian player is to prevent this by capturing the city as soon as possible. (From the intro to the game in Panzer Digest #2.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
