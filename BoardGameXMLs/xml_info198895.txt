			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is minimal and free-form.  Play always begins (and presumably nearly always ends) as a solitaire live-action endeavor.  The only way to enlist additional players is to have them ask to join during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A character in the game is not well defined; instead, various aspects of a physical location should be characterized verbally.  The concept of the game is to select some location and then imagine it after it has experienced some type of catastrophe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
