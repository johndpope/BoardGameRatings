			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qivittoq: Fell Walker is about four people and their hunt for a polar bear that has been seen in the fjord north of Jakobshavn.  They track it, but as the scenario progresses it becomes obvious that this is no ordinary polar bear, it is a qivittoq, a fell walker with magical abilities, who has transformed into a polar bear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fell walker is the brother of one of the primary characters, who fled into the fells because of the guilt and shame after their mother's murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the journey proceeds, the group enter into an altered reality with talking animals, moon men, helper spirits, and Mother of the Seas; in fact nature acting as both an opponent and a team-player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Qivittoq: Fell Walker is a scenario about the pursuit of one's destiny, of forgiveness and possible redemption, but first and foremost a scenario about the pursuit itself.  The pursuit or hunt is deeply rooted in the Greenlandic culture.  The hunting men, the animals and the eternal struggle with/against nature and the elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an exceptional game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
