			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requires all previous chapters of War of the Dead&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survivors of the Pinnacle cruise ship have traveled half-way across the country and survived impossible odds. From confronting the Living Dead, to facing cannibals, to escaping Edward Russo and his army of thousands of Living Dead, the characters have become legends to those aware of their exploits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently trapped inside the Federal Correctional Facility hidden away near the Citizen Relocation Zone in Colorado, the characters must once again perform the impossible if they are to survive. Forced to flee and seek refuge, they are poorly equipped and ill prepared for the array of threats that confront them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The saga continues in War of the Dead: Chapter Four (To Reign in Hell). War of the Dead brings the zombie apocalypse to the award winning Savage Worlds role-playing game, broken down into 4 chapters of 13 adventures each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chapter Four concludes the saga as the characters uncover the secrets of the government shadow war, the history of the Living Dead, and of an insane experiment that could once again change the entire world. Forced into a final confrontation with a secretive government agency, as well as the outlaws that control Helltown, the characters find themselves in a position to affect the future of the human race&amp;mdash; or die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book contains all 13 adventures of Chapter Four, bringing your War of the Dead campaign to its conclusion!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
