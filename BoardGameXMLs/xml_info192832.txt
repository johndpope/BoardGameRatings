			<description>The year is 2XXX. A city is on the verge of rioting, and your country is on the brink of war. You are a free-lance detective agency/guns for hire, recruited as a desperate attempt to help escort a heavily armored vehicle carrying a foreign diplomat through town. You must attempt to investigate and lock down each building the convoy passes in the city core, being careful not to get caught in the blast of an exploding building, or trapped in it's rubble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play involves players using dice mitigation to do various actions and help find safe passage through the city game board. As the buildings are destroyed, players make educated guesses on what buildings blow up next based on the patterns that form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
