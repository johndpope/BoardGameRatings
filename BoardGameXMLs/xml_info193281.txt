			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Rules present character creation rules and action resolution rules.  The game describes itself as &amp;quot;crunchy&amp;quot; and action--especially combat--is numerically intensive.  Characters have backgrounds, Abilities (Attributes), and Skills.  Attributes and Skills have numeric ratings that are used to build dice pools of d10 for action resolution.  As the game focuses on combat theaters in war, the combat rules are extensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Core Rules were published with two cover varieties--a soldier and a Light Armored Vehicle; and a soldier against an orange sunset.  The contents of these versions are identical except for the cover art.  The Core Rules development was funded through a Kickstarter campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
