			<description>Dead Sprint is a tile based board game that tasks 2-5 players with outrunning a horde of undead throughout the game while also avoiding/combating the undead in front of them. Players will utilize special items to help them along the way including: first aid kits to survive attacks, weapons to improve their attacks and action cards they can draw that changes up the strategy for every player.&lt;br/&gt;â€‹&lt;br/&gt;The game features special types of undead that will force the players to decide how to deal with them based on their inventory. The horde will consume any undead left behind to catch up to the players. The first person to find the exit or the last person to not die is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
