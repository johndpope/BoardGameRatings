			<description>The game is something like the better-known game &amp;quot;Battleship.&amp;quot; In this game the players mark three squares (of four places) that the other playing is trying to find by guessing. The boards are plastic coated on particle board and marked with a grease pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was also released as a pad of sheets to be used with a regular pencil (or possibly two pads in a box), which were more professionally produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
