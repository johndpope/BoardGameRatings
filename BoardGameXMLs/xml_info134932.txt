			<description>This game is in 'The Children's Book of Games, Puzzles and Pastimes'. Here are the brief rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exciting game, for two or more people, is played with ordinary playing cards. Deal a hand to each player. The first player now turns up a card, which is left on the table, and proceeds according to the instructions on the Key to 'Moves' chart. If he turns up, say, a seven, then he &amp;ldquo;goes forward&amp;rdquo; four by taking four cards from the next player, Should he turn up a card which tells him to &amp;ldquo;go back,&amp;rdquo; then he has to give that number of cards to the following player. The game proceeds until each player but one has run out of cards. The remaining player is the winner of this gruelling race. It is more exciting if several people play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
