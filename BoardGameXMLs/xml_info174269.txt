							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Staff of the Last Hill Chief</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended for low level play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Staff known as The Wyreaus, was a symbol of leadership and guidance amongst the Hill people, and the tribes bickered over it. He who held the Staff also held sway over the lands, but the Staff was equally coveted by others and rivals came and went and the Staff changed hands many times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a few hundred years, the internal tribal conflicts had caused fracturing of the Hillfolk and death held sway over the lands surrounding the hills. That was until a wise and just Hill Chief named Skaeus Blackwyr claimed the Staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was however too late to nurture the tribes back to their centuries- old heights of power and he died protecting the tribe from an aged Mountain Wyvern, whilst also mortally wounding the beast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hillfolk, forever in his debt, constructed a huge mound with a hidden mausoleum, and laid him to rest with the Staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds more years passed, the Hillfolk moved on, and the Hill Tomb became a plundered relic. All that is, except for the hidden mausoleum which was said to have never been discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A band of Orcs have now taken over the Hill Tomb and use it to mount raids on passing trade caravans. They have not discovered the hidden mausoleum either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
