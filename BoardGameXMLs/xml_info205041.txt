			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As much as our technology advanced, it didn't prevent us from ruining our own planet; probably it just made our job easier at that. As much as we seek refuge in virtual realities, our real bodies need to be sustained in physical means, and we cannot cut all of our ties to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We live in space stations, in the most advanced and artificial living environments that humans have ever built. At least, the lucky of us do. Space stations provide us with food through advanced zero-g farming, water and oxygen from the ice of comets older than our Solar System, captured through advanced engineering. Space stations also provide us a half-g of artificial gravity, energy thanks to solar panels, and mobility via solar sails. We even have work, real jobs, and entertainment, both virtual and real.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below us, Earth is an apocalyptic landscape that looks little like the green and blue and white globe of ancient orbital photos. We dug, and still dig, for precious metal and resources; we still try to cultivate the dry soil and we do our best to restore the planet. We need Earth: we need it for its precious resources impossible to find in space, for its products and animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We need it because it's our hope to go back, one day.&lt;br/&gt;But who wants to risk their lives on a planet infested by mutants, by killer drones, by angry savages? Who wants to go down on a planet battered by hurricanes, sandstorms, tsunamis and earthquakes, hit daily by hi-speed killer winds and acid rains? You guessed: nobody does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's why we send cyborgs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game usually is distributed as a ZIP archive containing three files:&lt;br/&gt;- 23-page PDF rules document&lt;br/&gt;- 5-page PDF Cyborg Sheet (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;- 6-page PDF Player Sheet (print-and-play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
