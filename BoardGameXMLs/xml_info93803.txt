							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Morningstar</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nine Empires of Morningstar stand at the height of their power, but are balanced on the edge of disaster. The Dark Prophecy called the Canticle of the Morning Star reveals the fates that await them, for those who have eyes to see. These mysteries drive many of the factions of the known world to work with or against one another. Discovering who &amp;ndash; or what &amp;ndash; is behind the grim voice of the Canticle is the reason these groups exist, and may hold the key to salvation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your adventurers enter this power struggle equipped with the questions, but bereft of answers. Whether they find them in time may depend on the allies they keep, or the enemies they make. Here, then, are ten intriguing NPCs, each of whom has a part to play as the Canticle&amp;rsquo;s story begins to unfold. These characters hail from all known parts of Thraxis, but have come to Brendir&lt;br/&gt;for their own reasons. They may be encountered in Brendir, or their native lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
