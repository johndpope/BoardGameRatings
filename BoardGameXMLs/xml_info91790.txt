			<description>A card game in which players hunt for dinosaurs and mammoths to feed their Neanderthal crew. They catch animals and later turn them into steaks, or they rob them off other players by using fighting cards. Special action cards allow other actions, e.g. releasing another player's animal into the wild or taking an animal without a fight. The first player to collect 10 steaks (plastic chips) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
