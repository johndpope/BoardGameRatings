							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Descender: Dropship</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Descender-Class Light Dropship is a versatile dropship with a wide ramp and space for infantry, cargo or even a small vehicle, such as a Tigress armored personnel carrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The landing possibilities of the Descender-class are almost unlimited, and where landing is impossible, for example densely packed jungle, the ability of the spaceship to &amp;lsquo;hover&amp;rsquo; on its grav motors allows troops to deploy by abseiling or grav belt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Descender has a heavy turret mounted on its back and also a flexible mount below the 'chin' of the cockpit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dorsal turret often mounts a missile launcher and the 'chin' mount often contains twin blaster cannon, but armaments vary according to mission and the level of resistance that is expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the assault role, Descender's are generally more heavily armed for self-protection, both in transit and for suppression of the landing zone. This extra armament may be in the form of door gunners, or the modification of the stub-wing heat vanes with hard points for the carriage of missiles and rocket pods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These deckplans include.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Spaceship statistics&lt;br/&gt;     Area descriptions&lt;br/&gt;     Color deckplans with legend and key, and printer-friendly monochrome maps&lt;br/&gt;     Background sections on, design, operators and typical missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a quick-start version of the Spaceward Ho! vehicle combat system as an added bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short adventure hook is also included to show how this design can serve as a platform for unique planetary-assault adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
