			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayStation Portable (PSP) is the first handheld game console made by Sony and is the predecessor to the PlayStation Vita. Development of the console was announced during E3 2003 and the system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in the PAL region on September 1, 2005. A remodeled version of the PlayStation Portable that was both slimmer and lighter called the PSP-2000/Slim &amp;amp; Lite was released in early September 2007. This model was later replaced by the PSP-3000 which featured a new screen and an inbuilt microphone. In 2011 a budget model called the PSP-E1000 was released with several features removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the only handheld video game console to use Universal Media Disc (UMD) as its primary storage medium. It also features robust multi-media capabilities and connectivity with the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, other PlayStation Portables, and the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
