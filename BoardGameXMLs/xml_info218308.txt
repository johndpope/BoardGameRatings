							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Middle East</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creatures from the Cradle of Civilization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Middle East brings you an awesome array of creatures malevolent and benign from the cradle of civilization, with creatures drawn from the mythology and lore of Persia, Mesopotamia, Israel, and Arabia. These incredible creatures range from CR 1 to CR 23, from seemingly the harmless horned almiraj to the hulking warlord humbaba and the soaring two-headed rukh. You will find savage and destructive divs seeking to ruin all that mortals create, from the staring evil eye of the aghash to the sinister whispers of the doru and the unbridled lust of the pairaka. Some Middle Eastern monsters would simply rather be left to their own devices but their wrath kindles hot and their vengeance is fierce, whether they appear to mortals as beautiful godlike nephilim or hideous scorpion-centaur girtablilu. There are spirits of the dead lurking in the shadows, embodying the power of absolute shadow like the owb or possessing mortals and driving them to madness and murder like the dybbuk. You will find guardians of good like the albino peri with their wings of fire, and at the opposite extreme the draconic embodiment of death and decay in the pestilential taniniver. As if a dozen mythic monsters were not enough, we also bring you the rainbow-plumed buraq, a skyfaring steed sent by the powers of heaven to bear the truly worth across the endless night sky. In addition, we present an array of rules for the desolate and deadly desert sands that are ever encroaching on the fertile crescent, bringing nature's fury and supernatural menace to the dust lands beyond life and hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
