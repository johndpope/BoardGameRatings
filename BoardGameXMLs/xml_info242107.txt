							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fifth Business: Faer√ªn Faction Quests</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faction politics are rife in the Sword Coast, with organisations crossing and double crossing each other faster than anyone can keep up with. Chief amongst these are the five best known factions: The Harpers, The Order of the Gauntlet, the Zhentarim, The Emerald Enclave and the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Alliance. You can find out more about these factions and their goals on the Wizards of the Coast website, and they are often featured in the official campaign settings and adventure paths. Presented here are adventure seeds of various levels for each of these factions. You might wish to use them as standalone one-shots, as part of an ongoing narrative or simply to cannibalise the concept. You might even print out this document and use it as kindling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
