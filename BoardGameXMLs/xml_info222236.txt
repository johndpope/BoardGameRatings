			<description>Each player starts with 5 buttons.When it&amp;rsquo;s your turn, place a button on the thread if you have one that is the same colour, shape or size, as the last button and one oh the adjacent buttons, when you reach the buttonholes with arrows. If you manage to place a button, then you draw a new one from the bag; otherwise you have to discard one.&lt;br/&gt;Extra buttons can be won during the game as prizes.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who gets out of the maze with the most buttons!&lt;br/&gt;Younger players can play Tower, a game that helps them learn colours and recognize shapes and sizes through touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
