			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juliette is the ultimate messenger, a woman able to become one with her leaders and transmit any command to their subordinates as an extension of themselves. Even if she works for the Azur Alliance, her heart only serves the High Arbiter Arkeid, who she considers her big sister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutral Azur Alliance Prowler &amp;mdash; Lv. 25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control Nexus: At the beginning of the game, choose an arbiter in your party, to whom Juliette is allocated.&lt;br/&gt; As long as Juliette's in play, this arbiter receives one additional Order Point per turn. Furthermore, as long as the arbiter has Line of Sight to Juliette, they can use her control area as an extension of their Influence Zone.&lt;br/&gt; Extension of Will: Juliette can, if desired, be activated simultaneously with her Arbiter. This ability doesn't allow her to activate twice per turn.&lt;br/&gt; oo &amp;mdash; Stealth (Subterfuge, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; Juliette becomes Hidden. Upkeep: o&lt;br/&gt; oo &amp;mdash; Reign of Chaos (Subterfuge, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; An enemy Unit inside Juliette's Control Zone loses one Action Point. Effect 16.&lt;br/&gt; oo &amp;mdash; Whisper (Subterfuge, Effect, Reactive)&lt;br/&gt; A friendly Unit inside Juliette's Control Zone gets +1 Attack and +1 Defense until end of turn. This ability can only be used if Juliette is hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
