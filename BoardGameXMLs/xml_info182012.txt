			<description>Game Over: Remix is the sequel to last year's successfully funded Game Over. It's a card game that mixes fast paced battles with dozens of video game inspired characters and items. Accommodating 2 - 6 players, rounds last 30 minutes each with gameplay specifically designed around replay value. The 198 card game is a mix between random chance and thought provoking strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game protagonists are simple creatures. They're programmed to either kill, collect points, or find treasure. So when the TV goes OFF and they're left to their own devices, they continue trying to do just that. The characters refer to these achievements simply as &amp;quot;Wins&amp;quot;, and their thirst for them is insatiable. In Game Over, each player will take control of three characters to compete for a win in 1 of 3 ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Last Man Standing: Player's are knocked out of the game once all 3 of their characters have died. Be the last to survive for this win scenario.&lt;br/&gt;     High Score: Gems can be collected throughout the game for bonus points. Be the first to accumulate 25 or more points to win this way.&lt;br/&gt;     Quest Complete: There are 3 enchanted golden items hiding within the deck. The first player to find all of them has completed their quest and won the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
