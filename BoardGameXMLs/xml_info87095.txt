			<description>User Summary: Game Chef 2010 Design Competition Submission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;You could have chosen comfort, you could have chosen easy. At anytime you wanted you could have made the journey from the desert to the south. There you could have joined those who have forgot what was and indulged in mindless pleasures. But you didn&amp;rsquo;t, and instead you fight the harsh desert land everyday, spending your free time creating songs about what came before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You mark your skin with glyphs that evoke the memories of what was, and call these the marks of yesterday. These protect you from the harsh mind-bending nature of your new world, and give you power to hold your own against the beasts that hunt you. You have pooled all your power into the sacred stone and ink, and it in turn becomes your armor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now your tribal leader has called you to the task. A young one has run off with the sacred ink into the badlands of the north. You and your companions are charged with finding them and returning the ink. Failure is not an option, without the ink there will be no more marks of yesterday and all will be lost. Under the guidance of the sacred stone, you head out into the badlands of the north, the place that lies between the edge of the what is and what may be, and begin a journey through... the Broken Dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game of the journey into a fuzzy land of what is and what may be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
