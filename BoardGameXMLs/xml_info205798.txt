			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summoner is a one-player mission-based board game inspired by &amp;ldquo;count-and-capture&amp;rdquo; mechanics of Mancala along with some random card draws. Instead of using a number to represent mana (magical points), this game introduces a new concept of using mana token to form patterns on the board. When the mana pattern on the board matches the mana pattern of a monster, you can capture that monster.  Each monster captured along the way will give you more power and higher chance to complete the mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective is to complete all 3 missions assigned by the Elders. Through the course of your adventure, you will encounter various monsters in different lands. Each land has a special environment that will weakens your life and power. You need to endure through these environments and complete all the missions to achieve the title of Master Summoner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
