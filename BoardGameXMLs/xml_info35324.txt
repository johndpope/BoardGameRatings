			<description>TZAP Rummy is a fast-paced game. Like all rummy games, it involves creation of 3-card RUNS (sequences) and SETS (3 of a kind). And, like the Rummikub tile rummy game, it involves rearranging already-melded cards on the table to the best of your advantage. The deck of standard cards also includes six special TZAP cards which have both strategic and laugh-generating functions that provide twists not found in other rummy games. The game is for ages 8 and up, 2 to 8 players, and can be played individually or as partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TZAP Rummy claims to set itself apart from other rummy games by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIRST, it involves manipulation of melded cards on the table to help get rid of cards from hand, i.e., to &amp;quot;go out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SECOND, it involves manipulation of opponents by strategically &amp;quot;zapping&amp;quot; the right opponent at the right time to improve your chances of going out, while at the same time inhibiting others from going out. This requires some tough decisions on whether to use TZAP cards for melding or for penalizing an opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.tzaprummy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.tzaprummy.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
