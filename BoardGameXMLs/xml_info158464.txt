			<description>Complete grocery shopping lists in this race for the most groceries you can get into your shopping bag, basket or cart.  Be quick to finish them before your opponents steal your groceries!   Very fast paced game for everyone 8-80 to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 52 shopping cards with point values from 1 - 8.  68 grocery cards with matching pictures and point values.  4 Robber cards and 2 \&amp;quot;Buy one - Get one\&amp;quot; coupons. The shopping lists are randomly placed in piles of 3,4,5 in front of the players.  The storeroom is setup with 2 of each grocery. Players get 5 cards each and one bag, basket and cart to fill.  The bag holds max 3 items, the basket 4 and the cart 5.  Match the cards in your hand to the shopping lists and collect the points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can move one item between bag, basket or cart once per turn. You can discard one card per turn.  Lastly, you can go to the storeroom to make one trade per turn.  This works with a equal number trade mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fill the shopping lists before your opponents to collect the points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
