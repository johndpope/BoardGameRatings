			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Portal 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thinking with Time Machine is a Portal 2 modification featuring a new gameplay element known as the &amp;quot;Time Machine&amp;quot; which allows the player to record and play back their actions in the game world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story continues from the end of Portal 2 where Chell successfully escapes the facility. However, a crow accidentally flies into the &amp;quot;sky&amp;quot;, breaking the illusion of a wide open field created by giant screens. After Chell reawakens, she is revealed to be in the underground portion of the facility, where an elevator leads to new test chambers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing a tutorial, Chell runs across an unsolvable test, until you press a button and a record player falls out, followed by a Borealis hologram, which cracks a hole in the wall. Chell discovers the two co-op bots, saying that they shut down GLaDOS. They say they will keep tabs on Chell, and the new &amp;quot;Time Machine&amp;quot;. GLaDOS tells Chell to go back in time, and the chamber opens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She is then tasked with completing 9 highly challenging test chambers. After their completion, Chell reaches a white spherical room. It transports her back in time to Portal 2's ending, at which point GLaDOS tells her that she is 'free'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Portal Wiki, &amp;quot;Thinking with Time Machine&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
