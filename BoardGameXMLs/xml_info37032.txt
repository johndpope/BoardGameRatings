							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Osiron</name>
									
			<description>Osiron is a game inspired by the graphic, the &amp;quot;Flower of Life&amp;quot;.  Each turn, players swap colored triangles in order to fill in a full circle on the board.  The Designer, David Huffman, creates earthenware Osiron sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameboard is comprised of seven perfectly interlocked circles. Through this interlocking, twenty four concave triangle playing spaces emerge.  Each of the seven interlocked circles contains six of these playing spaces.&lt;br/&gt;There are twenty four playing pieces that correspond to the gameboard&amp;rsquo;s twenty four playing spaces. Twelve playing pieces are light colored for one player and twelve being dark for the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player chooses the players&amp;rsquo; colors, the other chooses who will move first. Players alternate taking turns exchanging playing pieces on the gameboard with one &lt;br/&gt;another until the object of the game is achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With six of their twelve playing pieces, the first player to fully occupy one of the gameboard&amp;rsquo;s seven circles before their opponent does is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
