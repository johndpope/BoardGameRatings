			<description>Lucid9 is a noncommercial visual novel by the group Fallen Snow Studios, and will be available free of charge under the Creative Commons BY-NC-ND License. It is published by Sekai Project, and will be available on the Steam distribution platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What genre is Lucid9? The first part we are releasing, called &amp;quot;Inciting Incident&amp;quot; and corresponding to the common route of the whole visual novel, is mainly a Mystery that will make you investigate the recent killings of students in the Isamu Imperial Boarding Academy. Inciting Incident also has it fair share of interactions between characters, so expect a bit of comedy and school life activities as well. The rest of the story will center more on the thriller genre, with romance and drama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What engine will you use? We're now planning on using Ren'Py. If you aren't familiar with the engine, you can always visit the site here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How long will Lucid9 be? So far the common route should average around 10 hours in reading time. We can't specifically predict how long the full game will be since we're still in the development phase. At the end of the day, we'll make Lucid9 as long as needed for us to tell our story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
