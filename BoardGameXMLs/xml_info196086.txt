			<description>In this work, which was announced as a sequel of &amp;quot;SuperDepth&amp;quot;, Battleship mountain Bok starting the fighter from (Yamaboku) &amp;quot;Finalty&amp;quot; has become a leading role, mission that reject the hostile forces that have been turned to fight back. And a capsule-type power-up system that has been inherited from the previous work, while leveraging the bomb with the invincible time, so that the aim of the excitement of the ending again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is completely changed with the rattle, because the reborn as a side-scrolling shooter orthodox, rather than a handy play in spare time, while remember the enemy's appearance pattern and the boss of the attack pattern, sit down carefully attitude to challenge the play on is desirable. So to speak, because it was less likely to depend on the luck of the element, it is that his own reflexes than ever in previous work began to say things. But as the genuine gamer, I wonder more of these shooting is not the more the blood fuss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
