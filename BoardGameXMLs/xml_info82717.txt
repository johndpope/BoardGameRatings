			<description>Eight cards are dealt to each player. The other cards are placed face down in the centre of the table.&lt;br/&gt;The first player draws a card from the pile and discards a card from his hand. When any player holds five connecting cards of a figure, they must be placed face up on the table.&lt;br/&gt;The other players try to connect their cards to that figure. &lt;br/&gt;When any player has disposed of all his cards, the other players count ten for each card left in hand.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when any player loses 500 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
