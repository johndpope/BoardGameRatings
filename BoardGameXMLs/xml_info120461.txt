			<description>Spanic (SP+Panic) is a Shibumi game for 3 to 6 players. It uses 10 balls on each colour (white, black, red), a 4x4 Shibumi board and one bowl for each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empty board. In 4 player games, 2 balls are picked up randomly from the supply and placed randomly on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player then picks random balls from the supply (bag):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 players: 15 balls each&lt;br/&gt;3 players: 10 balls each&lt;br/&gt;4 players: 7 balls each&lt;br/&gt;5 players: 6 balls each&lt;br/&gt;6 players: 5 balls each&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... and places them in his bowl so the other players cannot see them during the game (variant: balls are visible).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get rid of your balls before your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players in turn either:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- place one of their balls on any empty hole or on top of a platform that has at least 2 balls of the same colour as the ball being placed or...&lt;br/&gt;- pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one of the players places his last ball, thus reaching the victory condition. If all players pass in a single round (rare), the player with less balls in his bowl wins. In case of a tie, play again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in the Shibumi Rule Book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soft cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downloadable PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
