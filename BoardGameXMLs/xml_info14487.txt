			<description>This is one of a series of games put out by The Nomad Company that comes in a thick, cardboard cube that holds the contents and unfolds to provide a board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: Board (which is also the game box), 3 special D6 dice and chips. The board has a treasure map pictured on it. There is a treasure chest in the center and 4 'betting corners' - one with a picture of a pistol, another with a picture of a cannon, another a trumpet and the last a sword. The chips come in white (worth 1 pt.), black (2 pts.) and gold (3 pts.). The die faces for each die show one each of the 4 betting corner items, a treasure chest and a map (which acts as a joker).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To be the last player with chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distribute the chips evenly among the players. Before each player's turn, all players place 1 chip (value 1) on each betting corner. Player keeps rolling until she wins chips or passes. On your turn: Roll the dice. If all three are treasure chests, take all chips on the treasure chest. (This only applies to 3 treasure chests thrown on the first roll.) If all three are the same betting item, take all chips from the corresponding betting corner and your turn is over. If the roll has different betting items, you can set aside one kind and re-roll the rest. You must put one chip (value 1) on each betting corner that corresponds to the face of a die you will re-roll. (ex: You roll a cannon, a sword and a trumpet. You choose to keep the sword, pay 1 pt to the cannon corner, pay 1 pt to the trumpet corner and re-roll.) As long as you don't win, you can continue to pay 1 point to the appropriate corner(s) for each die re-rolled. Once you have three of the same betting item, take all chips on that item and your turn is over. For each treasure chest rolled, every player (including you) puts 1 point on the treasure chest. You can stop rolling and pass at any time. A player who runs out of chips is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
