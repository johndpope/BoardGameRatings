							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bridge &amp; Toll House</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The river has dug in deep into the soft ground of the plains. And even although it is not terribly deep the sheer drop of its banks makes crossing it difficult. Thankfully a sturdy wooden bridge has been built to allow travellers and traders alike to cross it with dry feet. Of course such comfort does not come free of charge and a small but sturdy house has been built near the bridge for the toll collectors on duty. Most travellers pay their tolls without complaint though, knowing that the funds collected go directly into maintaining the bridge. That the armed toll collectors provide an additional measure of safety against bandits is only a small bonus on top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
