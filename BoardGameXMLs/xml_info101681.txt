							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stalking the Snow Beast</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end came fast for your world. The grand empires, which once promised peace and comfort, have disappeared under the ice and snow. What is left of civilization now is pitiful, tiny villages clinging for life to the leeward edges of mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your home of Agoura is one such place. For years, your people have struggled endlessly to survive the never-ending winter. Not to mention the random attacks of the evil wizard Specules who wanders the landscape manically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A famous healer of older times, Specules went mad along with the world. Now his existence is the singular goal of eliminating all remaining life, namely your town. With such an irrational enemy, it is no wonder the leaders called a meeting when a powerful artefact turned up in a snowdrift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stepping past the village elders to catch a view of the metallic sphere, you hear them converse nervously. Jeff, the eldest elder, calls the crowd to order then begins to speak, &amp;quot;This find could be either a great gift, or a great curse. I believe that, with its power, we could slow, and maybe even reverse the advance of the cold.&amp;quot; The mob cheers at the sound of such good news, though when he speaks again, the joy rapidly subsides, &amp;quot;That said, this power will no doubt attract Specules. We must take every precaution to ensure that it does not fall into his hands.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With that, the crowd goes to murmuring. The question on everyone's mind is, of course, who should guard the priceless treasure. Being the strongest warrior in Agoura, not to mention one of the few who has not lost any digits to frostbite, you are quickly chosen. Along with a small contingent of other warriors, you take the shining, silver orb into the town cave, which Elder Jeff judged to be the most secure spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
