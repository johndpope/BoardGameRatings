			<description>&amp;ldquo;This simulation uses a combination of map movement and matrix arguments to give the students a sense of the battle that took place in the Eastern Theater in 1862. The students should be divided into seven groups and assigned one of the commanders in the order of battle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each team should be given a copy of the map and their commander's information. The teacher should also track the location of the armies on a map that the whole class can see, and should also keep track of the Fighting Spirit and Supply of each side. After the simulation the students should be asked to discuss their strategy. Compare and contrast their decisions to the real historical events.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;This simulation makes use of matrix arguments. Matrix games were invented by Chris Engle, and you can learn more about them on his website: Hamster Press - Engle Matrix Games. Chris helped with the design of this simulation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
