							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">What If? Bruce Banner was a prisoner at The Raft?</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb: (from the PDF)&lt;br/&gt;The Breakout Mini-Event in the Marvel Heroic Roleplaying Basic Game has the New Avengers assembling to stop a prison break at the Raft, followed by an excursion to the Savage Land. In the Raft's lowest levels, locked away and forgotten, is a mysterious man named Bob Reynolds AKA The Sentry. A prisoner of his own volition, the Sentry had history with many of the Marvel Universe's greatest heroes, but used his tremendous power to cause the world to forget about him to save them from his dark side. But what if the Raft held another powerful inmate, one who also has a destructive alter ego? In the mainstream Earth-616, Banner had been launched far across the galaxy by the Illuminati after one Hulk rampage too many. This bonus content asks the question: What if the Hulk was a prisoner of the Raft instead of the Sentry? This bonus content for the Basic Game mini-event Breakout includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A new Action Scene, with unlockables for Bruce Banner and the Hulk&lt;br/&gt;    A new hero datafile for the Hulk&lt;br/&gt;    Villain datafiles for the U-Foes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
