							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Midas Touch</name>
									
			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Legend tells that the king of ancient Phrygia, when told all his wishes could come true, chose to turn all he touched to gold.  You too can be Midas, and gamble for gold in this fast moving dice game. Place your stake and throw the dice.  With luck and skill you could gain the highest score to win the round. And here's the golden twist - when any player throws a treble, they instantly become Midas and all they touch will turn to gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, you might have the most cards - but it's only the glittering gold that counts!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
