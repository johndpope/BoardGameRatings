			<description>Puigcardener is a game by Oriol Comas for the exhibition Cinc mil anys jugant (&amp;quot;Five thousand years playing games&amp;quot;) organized by Caixa Manresa and the Toy Museum of Catalonia in Figueres. It is an abstract game freely based on the first populations established around the hill that nowadays is the city of Manresa, about 2,500 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five counters of each of the four colors are placed initially along the four sides of the board. In a 4-player game each player controls a color; in a 2-player game each player controls two colors. The objective is to lead all the counters of your color to the opposite side of the board. By turn each player moves one of his counter one space ahead or captures an enemy counter diagonally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
