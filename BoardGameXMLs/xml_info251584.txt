							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Disneyland Electric Tours</name>
									
			<description>This electric game is based on Walt Disney's Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California and weekly television show of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A playing board sheet is laid over the base and the players move along the trail. The base has a circuit selector, wire connector with a metal tip that is touched to spots on the board and red light that allows or hinders the player's progress; underneath the base is a place for a battery to be installed to power the light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game has a trail going over the points of interest and the player reaching the goal first wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the traveler and opponent are decided, the traveler spins the spinner to determine how many steps to travel along the trail. The traveler determines whether to continue his trip by placing the contact tip on the station. If the light signal goes on, he continues traveling, otherwise he places his Disney character on the station as a marker and remains there and waits for his next turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opponent can confuse and obstruct the traveler by operating the rotary switch occasionally, to change the circuit so that the signal light will not light up and delay the traveler's progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a traveler is not careful and picks the trail up wrong and heads back towards the starting point, he loses all previous plays and starts his travel all over again.  The winner of the game is the first traveler reaching the goal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 4 playing boards in full color (Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Frontierland, &amp;amp; Adventureland), 4 character players, spinner, electric circuit complete with flashlight-type battery (Requires 1 D battery for the light).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Produced sometime in the 1950s&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
