			<description>A fun &amp;amp; challenging game with a messy room &amp;amp; chaos of night and day. Look out the window, is it sunny outside? Is your messy room full of lights and colors? If so, hurry up and find the COLOR that appears the most. But if it&amp;rsquo;s night then everything changes! The room is dark and full of shadows, no colors can be seen, only the shapes of the objects. This time try and spot the OBJECT that appearS the most. Hey! Pay attention! Two more objects might be hiding among your mess! a Flashlight and a curtain. They switch things around and turn day into night and night into day creating a FUN MESS OF A CHALLENGE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play?&lt;br/&gt;1The youngest player starts by flipping the first card of the deck and placing it next to it so that the objects side of the card is face up. Now there is the deck of cards with a window card on top and an objects card next to it. If the window card shows day then the players must try and spot the COLOR that appears the most on the card. &lt;br/&gt;2If the window card shows night then the players must try and spot the object that appears the most on the card. Then another card is flipped from the pile by the next player and the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3&lt;br/&gt;Beware! There are two special objects that change things around. When they appear it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether its night or day in the window because they switch things around! The winner of the game is the player who collected the most cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
