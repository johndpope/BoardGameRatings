			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Saints and Gentiles alike know of the myriad of labyrinthine canyons of Deseret. While the Mormon Church uses the more frequently travelled ones for road tolls, there are plenty of valleys and gorges unfit for human life. They contain such hazards as sudden drops, sharp and unsteady rocks, and constantly brutal temperatures. Water is also scarce. Even if explorers can see a body of water, there is no guarantee that the infuriatingly rough terrain will allow them access to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone who has spent time in the Weird West knows of another class of dangers. The dark corners of Deseret hold nosferatu, wall crawlers, and the dread of the salt flats- the horrendous and insidiously intelligent rattlers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the canyonlands, a few miles outside of the new settlement of Moab, there is a maze of gorges that has not felt the influence of the Reckoning. In fact, it has not seen many huge changes since the Mesozoic Era. Within wait many otherwise long extinct creatures, named only a couple of decades ago by British paleontologist Sir Richard Owen. This wilderness region holds the last of the creatures known as dinosaurs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinosaurs were devoured everywhere else by the rattlers in Earth&amp;rsquo;s past, but the creatures within this hidden wilderness have survived because almost the entire region is made of virtually impenetrable rock. Sure, there is soil and plant life, but rock remains underneath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a Mormon professor named Uriah Vernon has returned from the canyonlands, making preposterous claims that ultimately cost him his chair at the newly created Brigham Young University. He says he has seen dinosaurs living in the gorges near Moab. The rough conditions of the Utah wilderness and an untimely rattler ambush ultimately killed off the rest of his expedition party, so no one lives who can verify his claim. Vernon has returned with no records of his expedition either and this coupled with his vehement claims have been enough to destroy his reputation as an honest scientist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vernon is now in Salt Lake City trying to gather another expedition, in order to bring live dinosaurs back to civilization and silence his critics. He has sold most everything he has, and now has enough money to travel back to the canyonlands of Moab. Now, all he needs is a strong posse stupid or brave enough to join him&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
