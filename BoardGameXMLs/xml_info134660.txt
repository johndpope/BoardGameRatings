							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Famous Battles</name>
									
			<description>Three Famous Battles contains three short wargames covering (as the name suggests) three famous battles. The scenarios included are Lee at Gettysburg, Senlac: Hastings 1066, and The Emperor Strikes Back: Waterloo. The scenarios all use a common rule set but are meant to build on each other. Each scenario adds rules from the previous scenario (Gettysburg is the simplest scenario and The Emperor Strikes Back: Waterloo is the most complicated.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turns in each scenario are played in the following sequence:&lt;br/&gt;Gettysburg: Player A = Confederate, Player B = Union&lt;br/&gt;Senlac: Player A = Saxon, Player B = Norman&lt;br/&gt;Waterloo: Player A = British, Player B = French&lt;br/&gt;1. Reinforcements for both players&lt;br/&gt;2. Player A Movement&lt;br/&gt;3. Player B Defensive Fire/Combat&lt;br/&gt;4. Player A Offensive Fire/Combat&lt;br/&gt;5. Player B Movement&lt;br/&gt;6. Player A Defensive Fire/Combat&lt;br/&gt;7. Player B Offensive Fire/Combat&lt;br/&gt;8. Victory Check&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory in each scenario is determined by a set number of unit losses. For example, in the Gettysburg scenario, the first player to eliminate five of his/her opponent's pieces is the winner. The victory rules for the other games are slightly more complicated but are still based on number of unit losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules for each scenario are under two pages. The game is designed to introduce people to wargaming but also be complex enough to be enjoyed by experienced wargamers looking for a fast playing game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
