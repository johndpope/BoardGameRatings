							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Arthur&#039;s Get Together Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a co-operative children's game for Ages 3 - 6.  The object of the game is for the players to work together to 'solve' various problems on Arthur's Street.  at the beginning of the game one of the 12 Problem Tiles is flipped face up.  Each of the tiles illustrates a different problem, such as a baby crying, and that problem corresponds to a location on the board where the problem is solved.  In this case, it would be the space with the happy baby with a pacifier.  The players all try to move to the solution space, and when two players are on that space at the same time they have solved the problem and then turn over a new problem tile.  The game continues until all 12 of the problems have been solved and everyone wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
