			<description>A collectible card game that features Major League Baseball players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays much like Top Trumps.  Each card has ratings in three categories: Fastball, Changeup, and Specialty.  The pitching team selects one of his pitchers, then the hitting team places down one of his hitters, face-down.  The pitching team then chooses one of the three categories, the hitter's card is revealed, and the higher total in the selected category wins.  Each team gets to play 9 hitters, and the team with the most hitters' victories wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, additional rules were added to form the &amp;quot;Major League&amp;quot; rules, and the original ruleset was dubbed the &amp;quot;Home Run Derby&amp;quot;; cards were designed with additional information for the new rules. Under the Major League rules, the game takes place on a &amp;quot;baseball field&amp;quot; poster provided in the starter set. One pitcher pitches for an entire inning, but may not throw the same pitch twice in a row. Hits are no longer automatically home runs, but the batter moves a number of bases as indicated on his card. Players have offensive and defensive abilities that allow them to change the effects of hits, pitches, runs, and outs. Ball fields and mascots were added to the card set, and can affect the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the starter box back:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introducing Topps Attax, the new card game that puts you in charge of the action!  Manage your team, call your pitches and battle against your friends.  Or take the action online!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
