			<description>Nintendo's Virtual Boy (バーチャルボーイ, Bācharu Bōi)  (also known as the VR-32 and Virtual Utopia Experience during development) was the first video game console capable of displaying &amp;quot;true 3D graphics&amp;quot; out of the box. Whereas most video games use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, the Virtual Boy creates an illusion of depth through the effect known as parallax. In a manner similar to using a head-mounted display, the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Nintendo discontinued it the following year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Virtual boy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
