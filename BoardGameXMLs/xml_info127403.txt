							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Career Book 3</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Career Book 3 is the third and final volume in Spica Publishing&amp;rsquo;s highly successful Career Book series. Career Book 3 brings Referees and players 14 completely new career options for Traveller character generation. Inside Career Book 3 you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Alternative Benefits Tables - Tired of having your characters muster out with an equal number of starships and blades? These alternative benefit tables weight the benefit away from high-credit options, providing a more realistic benefit distribution. Tables are included for all careers in the Traveller core rulebook as well as all three Career Books from Spica Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;     Physical Features - Need to know if your character is too tall to make it through that hull breach? Career Book 3 gives you rules for determining a characters height, mass, skin tone, hair and eye colour, allowing anyone to quickly determine what their character looks like.&lt;br/&gt;     Family Background - Everyone comes from somewhere, and this system provides details of a character&amp;rsquo;s family, including parents and siblings, as well as how their Social Standing affects their livelihood. A Family Events table is included to help fill in what happened to a character before they turned 18.&lt;br/&gt;     New Careers - Fourteen new careers are presented including:&lt;br/&gt;         Inheritor - The survivors of the end of the world fight their way back to the stars.&lt;br/&gt;         Mariner - Mariners are sea-going people, making a living working in, on, or under the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;         Privateer - Private companies and planetary governments need to protect their assets; with a Letter of Marque, privateers are mercenaries with space ships.&lt;br/&gt;         Wastelander - You live and work in the dangerous places where most people fear to go.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;     Pre-Generated Characters - 54 pre-generated characters, created using the careers in Career Books 1, 2, 3 and the Traveller core rulebook, are presented for when you need non-player characters in a hurry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
