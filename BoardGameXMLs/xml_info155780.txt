							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steampunked Time Machine</name>
									
			<description>Steampunked is a game of strategy, subtlety, and sabotage. Players work against one another to be the first to assemble a time machine using turn of the century &amp;quot;Steam Punk&amp;quot; inspired components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to assemble their 9-part time machine and end their turn wins the game. However, this is easier said than done. This is the point in the game where the fur really starts to fly! Action cards are played in rapid succession as your opponents attempt to break and disassemble your machine in order to get parts for their own creation. The only way to assure your victory is to employ a multitude of strategies including, hording parts, conserving energy, forming alliances, and, of course, breaking said alliances at the most opportune moment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steampunked Time Machine is a card game with a core set made for 2 players. The game can however be expanded via additional expansion cards and 'booster packs' to play with up to 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
