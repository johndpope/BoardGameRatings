			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ptolus Sketchbook line is a great resource for players and DMs to &amp;quot;See&amp;quot; more of the City by the Spire. Created by the artists who set the architectural tone for the Ptolus book, every sketchbook focuses on a different district. Together they expand Ptolus with illustrations of buildings not pictured in the core book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's in a Ptolus Sketchbook? -Building illustrations inspired by Monte's descriptions. - Illustrations of details which could be found in the featured buildings (signs, furniture, typical items). - Blank handouts of letters, advertisements, etc. which can be easily customized to your needs. Every Ptolus Sketchbook from The Forge Studios consists of two parts. The first one is stylized and consists of illustrations made on a parchment background. The second part is a set of black and white illustrations which can be easily printed or presented to players during a session, in order to enrich the locale's description and create a more precise presentation. Ptolus Sketchbook vol. 5:Below the City is the fifth part of a series illustrating Monte Cook's City by the Spire. The supplement focuses on the realm below the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ptolus Sketchbook vol. 5:Below the City consists of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 19 visualizations including: Ghul's Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Ruined Chamber and Bluesteel Doors Ghul's Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Abandoned Lab and Glass and Bronze Doors Ghul's Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Fortress of the Redeemed Ghul's Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Halls of Cordaris Ghul's Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Prison of the Blessed Children Ghul's Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Ravenstroke Ghul's Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Slave City Ghul's Labyrinth - Storamere's Palace Ghul's Labyrinth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Temple of Destor Undercity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Sample chamber Undercity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Scenes from the Undercity Market Undercity Market&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Delver's Guild Office Undercity Market&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Potions and Elixirs Undercity Makret&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Scouts, Guides and Porters Undercity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Dark Market Undercity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Longfingers Guild Headquarters Undercity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Mirror Maze Undercity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Prison Scenes from The Sewers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- 36 detail illustrations - and 5 handouts including :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three sample signs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A map&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An announcement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
