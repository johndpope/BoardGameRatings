			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a FAE (of Fate) hack, and inherits from [those] rules...Characters are notably more complex than usual for FAE...and so character creation and advancement is very different as well.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;Look, my child. There, hanging in the sky, was our first home. A planet, blue and red and beautiful, now torn with gleaming scars a testament to the power, and the danger, of unbalanced magics.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;When our ancestors learned to call forth power from the Six Dreams, they channelled that power through their whole mind, opening themselves to those alien dreamscapes. They called themselves Magi, Kings, and brought a new age of power and prosperity to the nations of the Conatus. They forged dreams and souls into the magical materials Cloudstone, Lenseflow, Siren Pearl, Adamant, Blood Amber, Loadstone and from those materials forged the first Colosi. Their might warped the world, and their connections to the Dreams warped their bodies and souls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note this game was submitted after the challenge deadline and was not considered in the final voting (but was enumerated as an entry on the challenge web site).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
