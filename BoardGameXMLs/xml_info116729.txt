							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Know Your States</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to make the names of the states, building each name, syllable by syllable, beginning with the first syllable.  There are two decks of cards, one for the states east of the Mississippi River, and one for the states west.  The decks contain one card for each syllable in each state name (the card backs show a picture of the state). One deck is used in a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, one deck is split into six piles with the word side up.  The first player takes a card with the first syllable of a state.  Only one first syllable can be taken, and only four states can be started at a time.  A player may then take as many additional syllable cards that are available in the open piles for the states they are building, including from uncovered cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player cannot use any of the top cards or no first syllables are available, the player turns up a new set by putting each top card face down next to each pile.  If the player still cannot use any of these newly turned cards, play goes to the next player, who can then turn up a new set if necessary.  When all word side facing cards have been used, the next player may turn back over the covered card and use it if they can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completed states are set aside and a player can then start a new state, up to four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all states are built, the game is over and the largest number of states wins.  Alternatively, the largest number of cards may win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An alternate rule set is included to use the picture side, building up to six states, by matching pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
