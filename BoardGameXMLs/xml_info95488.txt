							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space: 1889</name>
									
			<description>Space: 1889 a science-fiction role-playing adventure based on the Space: 1889 role-playing game by Game Designers' Workshop. The game is set in the 19th-century Victorian era, a world where interplanetary travel was already accomplished, and discoveries have taken place such as liftwood on Mars in 1870 &amp;ndash; a wood with antigravitational effects &amp;ndash; and hydrogen-lifted airships. Great Britain is a constitutional monarchy, more interested in making her colonies profitable than with expanding her empire. The player creates five characters and endows each with skills and attributes. The game's scenario finds the lead character having been invited to a museum opening in London, to unveil several new Egyptian artifacts. During the evening, the player characters discover their first quest: to discover King Tut&amp;rsquo;s tomb. There are several other quests involved, taking the character from London to San Francisco to the Far East, but also to Mars, Mercury, and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space: 1889 (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
