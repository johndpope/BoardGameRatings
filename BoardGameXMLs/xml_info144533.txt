							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Condottieri Conflicts</name>
									
			<description>Since the time before the plague swept Europe to the final days of the Napoleonic Campaign, bands of soldiers were contracted to protect the interests of the small city states of Europe.These soldiers for hire came to be known as Condottieri. But these soldiers were not just Italian arms for hire, soldiers flooded into the northern Italian city states from all over Europe. German Landsknechte fought alongside Welsh Longbows; Moorish Cavalry rode alongside Albanian Stratioti; Swiss Reisl&amp;auml;ufer and Scottish Highlander Kerns shared in their profits; knights of many noble backgrounds and nationalities toured alongside each other for wealth and glory. Most Famously &amp;ldquo;Sir&amp;rdquo; John Hawkwood, Albertico da Barbiano, Cesare Borgia and Cosimo de&amp;rsquo; Medici all fought as condottiere in various Italian Wars. Conflicts ranged from skirmishes to large scale battles of thousands of heavily armored soldiers fighting to fulfill their contracted duties. This was the dawn of the modern era, the birth of contractual agreement released men from serfdom, and the rise of the first full time professional armies along with their experienced leaders since the fall of Rome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condottieri Conflicts is a game which lets players explore the nature of uneasy alliances, allows players to wage battle and negotiate victory conditions in search of riches, glory, and honor. Challenge your friends and family to conflict at its rawest and most cutthroat level. Command your army, form alliances, and backstab your rivals to vanquish the strongest enemies and wage war unlike any other war game you have played before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game that plays just as well with 2 players as it does with 8. You recieve fully customizable armies ready for medieval warfare, and you also receive Sterritt Strategy&amp;rsquo;s unique terrain system. Great for any gamer who thinks chess could use more realism, Diplomacy&amp;copy; and Risk&amp;copy; lack tactical skill, or might not have the time or space for classic War Games with miniatures. This is for gamers who want a strategic platform that they can tailor to their an hour of leisure time, the rainy afternoon or their multiple weekend long campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
