							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Maestro Ensemble &amp; Symphony</name>
									
			<description>The gamebox contains two Maestro games based on the theme of classical music. You don&amp;rsquo;t need basic knowledge to play, but can acquire it during these games! You will get to know the instruments of the orchestra, learn the names of famous composers and experience the sound of their music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maestro Ensemble is the simple variant of the game Maestro Symphony. The players must walk around a circle of 60 minutes. That means they need to collect 60 minutes playing time of tracks and ' play '.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn one gets the chance to tackle a piece of music, a tool to buy or a kanskaart. The turn can also be used to ' perform a piece of music. To do so, you need to have the right music instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the map of the music piece which instruments are required and what the playing time of the piece is. Knocking out the map also provides money and/or a change cart, which offers opportunities to buy new instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Musical instruments that you don't own, you can rent another player, who earns money again. At each played music piece you go forward one or two sizes on the staff. First at the end, the Maestro!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chance cards bring tension in the game. They provide unexpected with it-or setbacks. You can also disturb other players. Each player possesses also a Maestro card. This you can bet once for an extra turn. Convenient to just before the end of the game a fellow player to pass through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play this game, you don't need knowledge of classical music. You just learn a lot of knowledge. The players are introduced to various instruments in all sorts of compositions. They learn names of composers and music pieces. By a QR-code on the piece of music-map, you can listen to the track directly on your smartphone or tablet. Because the money is running in 'notes' is that a playful way to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the version Sympony, you have to earn points. Now it's nog only the time that counts. You need also collect differtent intstruments, soloists and make extra money. Also you get three job tickets to collect extra points. You need to play stategic, like Agricola and Rail Baron. The player with the most points will be the Maestro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
