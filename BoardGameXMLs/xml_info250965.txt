							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dirt Track Saturday Night</name>
									
			<description>Play the role of the owner and driver of a 900 horsepower engine in a 1200 pound chassis on dirt ovals from one quarter to one mile in length. Conduct a series of races for the Season Championship. Stand on the gas and turn right to go left. If that's not a recipe for excitement and danger, I don't know what is. Dirt Track Saturday Night is the game of Sprint Car, Supermodified and Stock Racing on dirt ovals which take place all over America. You set up your car to be tuned for the track conditions. Tracks can be wet and mushy all the way to dry and abrasive with other conditions in between. Choose your gear ratios, suspension setting and tire selection and your wing angle if the car has one; then go like hell. The playing surface is a three foot by four foot rectangle. You can buy and print pre-made tracks or make your own living diorama with the information provided in the rules. Included in the rules are all the charts you'll need to run a single race or, one night of racing where you have to do well in order to make it into the feature event, or run a full season of events to determine the winner of the season championship. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players roll two d6, which determines how far they can move. They can move one more space beyond what they are entitled to move, but doing so carries a chance of spinning out and/or crashing. Maneuvers can be performed to pass other racers, but the more fancy the maneuver, the more likely the car will not successfully execute it. Players must fight to gain and maintain the lead for 6 laps, after which the winner is determined. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
