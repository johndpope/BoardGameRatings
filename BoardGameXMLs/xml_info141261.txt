							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Serpent&#039;s Tooth</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Serpent's Tooth is a tabletop game of collaborative storytelling. In it, we choose a King, create a Kingdom to rule, then play out a series of scenes to discover what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game the King possesses three Regalia: a crown, castle, and sword, that give them authority over the characters, places, and threats in the kingdom. Like a Game Master in a traditional role-playing game, the king wields vast power over their Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest of us play members of the Kings Court. We might begin as subservient nobles, losers, jocks, or lowly dish-dogs at a fast food restaurant, but through play, when we seize the King's Regalia, we seize the Narrative Authority that goes with it. Serpent's Tooth is fun, fast, and a little profound. It is both a love letter to the golden age of RPGs, an an exploration of what it means to rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
