			<description>A ski race game for the fun of it!  A game of skill, steady hands, and fast competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 Racing Slopes&lt;br/&gt;2 Racing Balls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object - To be the first player to roll his Racing Ball through the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start - Each player selects a Slope and Ball. The balls are placed in the number 1 holes on each Slope. The race begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race Procedure - Each player flips his ball into the air and catches it on the Slope. The Ball is then rolled over the Slope to Hole #2. From there is is rolled to Holes #3 and #4. The first player to reach Hole #4 wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hands - A player may reposition his hand(s) at any time during the race. However at no time can the Ball touch a hand. If this occurs the Ball must be placed in the last corner hole reached before the player can continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Ball Falls Off Slope - If the Ball falls through a hole or off the Slope it must be returned to the last corner hole occupied. For example, if the Ball falls off the Slope while on its way from Hole #3 to Hole #4 it must be placed back in #3 before the player can proceed. The Ball must come to a complete rest in each corner hole before it can be flipped out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Course - A player does not have to follow a prescribed course. He may flip, bounce or roll the Ball between corners in any manner that suits his temperament.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
