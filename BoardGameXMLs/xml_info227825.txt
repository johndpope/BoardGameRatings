							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3rd Edict</name>
									
			<description>Two worlds collide as the magically rich Taethys collides with the technology driven Valkja.  Utilize state of the art technology and powerful spells to establish dominance over all who oppose you.  3rd Edict is designed for 3-6 players and takes around 30-60 minutes per game. Players draw from a central deck and use unique abilities to shape their play style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throw a fireball to Scorch your enemies or Redirect and turn their attacks back on them.  Take what you desire with Pickpocket.  Barrier protects a player from all sources, including themselves.  Equipment like Drone Guardian forces your opponents to deal with it before they can attack you.  The Bag of Many Things means you will have more options than everyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With eight game types, players will find a battle that works for them.  In First Blood the first player to get a kill wins the game, just make sure you don't overextend.  Recruitment has you destroy each other but instead of being eliminated that player joins your team instead.  Secret Win Conditions is just that.  Each player draws a mission at random and whoever completes it first wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
