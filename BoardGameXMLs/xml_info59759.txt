			<description>From the Introdution:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Into the Crucible, a campaign setting for the Babylon 5 RPG! This campaign is designed to operate throughout Babylon 5&amp;rsquo;s second season, covering events both large and small. As a storm gathers on the horizon, the people aboard the &amp;lsquo;last, best hope for peace&amp;rsquo; struggle against all sorts of challenges. With this book, your players can take part in side scenarios tied into the individual episodes, or major events leading to a final showdown aboard a doomed ship behind enemy lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Season Two of Babylon 5 was dominated by what the Narns call the &amp;lsquo;War of Retribution,&amp;rsquo; which the rest of the Galaxy knew simply as the Narn-Centauri War. This period often threw the station in chaos. Narn and Centauri agents were everywhere, spying on each other. Peace efforts were attempted, stalled, and begun again. War material and refugees were funnelled through the station, sometimes leading to retaliation from the other side. Through it all, other beings were at work behind the scenes, watching and advising...and sometimes, when the moment was right, taking direct action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is set amidst the events leading up to the Narn-Centauri War. The players, based on Babylon 5, will eventually find themselves involved in the war one way or another. Yet even as they make their way through the various scenarios presented herein, they will discover that they aren&amp;rsquo;t simply participating in a few unconnected missions. The events that occur take the form of a season-long story arc, culminating in a final battle deep within contested space. In the end, they learn that the Narn-Centauri War is not, in fact, the true conflict...the greatest threat is still to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
