			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Proprietary, ultra-high speed 3-D polygon-based rendering engine provides an exceptional sense of motion and detail--up to 20 FPS in high-resolution, 1024 x 768! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Extensive rolling 3D terrain. Atmospheric effects like sun glare, haze, cloud-layers, dynamic sky illumination and even an accurate celestial sphere at night, create uncanny realism simply unlike any other flight simulator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Accurate flight dynamics closely simulate the Naval and Marine F/A-18 Hornet strike-fighter aircraft. Exceptionally detailed avionics are closely modeled to provide accurate reproduction of actual F/A-18 Hornet flight systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Sophisticated enemy pilot AI provides a constant challenge. They fly simulated aircraft just as you do. You must hone your pilot skills to survive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Choose from twenty-eight combat missions in the Persian Gulf. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Exclusive multimedia training classroom provides over 90 minutes of flight and combat instruction. Includes six training missions in scenic Hawaii. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Connect up to four computers via network for multiple-player action. Includes six network missions in Arizona. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Ordnance includes the heat-seeking AIM-9L &amp;quot;Sidewinder,&amp;quot; the active radar guided AIM-120 AMRAAM, the TV guided AGM-65E &amp;quot;Maverick,&amp;quot; and a host of other mud-moving weaponry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Radio voice messages from the ground and air keep you constantly aware. The tower clears you for takeoff and landing. Your wingman relays crucial battle information during aerial combat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Perform carrier &amp;quot;traps&amp;quot; just like naval aviators. A working &amp;quot;Meatball&amp;quot; and an Instrument Landing System (ILS) help you bring it home after a successful mission. Contact the &amp;quot;LSO&amp;quot; and he'll talk you down to the &amp;quot;three-wire&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
