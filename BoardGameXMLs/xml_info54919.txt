			<description>A free Print and Play fantasy labyrinth fighting game with RPG elements for 1-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls one character of one of eight different classes, which respawns if killed.  Players take turns moving and taking two different actions such as Attacking a monster or another player, Casting a spell (either from a spellbook or as a one-shot from a scroll), Picking up an object, Exchanging items in town, or Upgrading stats and Equipping items and skills.  After a player's turn, any nearby monsters move toward that player and attack if able.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to collect 5 points by picking up Flags and delivering them to the entrance and/or killing the Dragon.  Each time a player picks up a flag, more powerful monsters, a free item, and a flag are placed in the labyrinth.  The Dragon, by far the deadliest monster, spawns after a player collects 4 flags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is &amp;quot;beta&amp;quot;; it has no art and the rules and rulebook are unrefined.  However, it is in a playable state, and the author will accept any feedback and incorporate suggestions into new versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains-&lt;br/&gt;8 Characters&lt;br/&gt;149 Tokens (flags, treasure, wounds, upgrades, mana, experience)&lt;br/&gt;9 Dungeon tiles&lt;br/&gt;235 Cards in two decks (113 weapons, armor, shields, headgear, boots, rings, mounts; 122 spells, skills, special actions, and minor items)&lt;br/&gt;32 monster chits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
