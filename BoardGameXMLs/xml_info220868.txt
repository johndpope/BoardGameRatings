							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Death Knight</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You woke up to a battlefield that was devoid of anyone standing and pulled the spear out of your stomach, watching the wound close after. The bodies of your fallen comrades all around you stare to the ground as if looking for the answer to the question of why you have arisen. You once knew their names in addition to your own, but no longer.. You once had a family, a home, and other details that gave you purpose, but those memories were all taken away prior to your rebirth. Now, you wander Dungeon World trying to rediscover your old purpose or to discover what your new one is. Where you may have once brandished the virtues of honor, justice, and mercy, they have now been replaced with slaughter, unrighteousness, and bitter cold. Arise, Death Knight!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Death Knight For Dungeon World: We&amp;rsquo;re going to cut to it..we set out to create the Death Knight class in the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular MMO video game for use in Dungeon World. Although the class in said MMO has changed over time (for the worst, in our opinion) we tried to faithfully represent the class abilities when the class was first rolled out almost ten years ago using Dungeon World mechanics. If you are looking to add a little darkness to your class selection, pick this supplement up today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
