			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello and welcome, adventurers and Game Masters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to third issue of my webzine: Cavalier Attitude. As the masthead says, this zine will focus on the Old School Revival (OSR) in fantasy role-playing. The Oldschool System Reference and Index Compilation&amp;trade; (OSRIC) is my personal retro-clone of choice, but I will cover other games systems as well, as interest and time permit. The zine is publishing quarterly. The first issue was published in September 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third issue&amp;rsquo;s contents include the following highlights:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    An Epic Horde: an article on collecting old RPG materials with one avid collector.&lt;br/&gt;    Deep Dwarves: an article detailing an evil sub-race of dwarves, driven mad by treasure lust by an evil extra-planar entity, who dwell in the Under-Realm and prize wealth above all else!&lt;br/&gt;    6 pre-generated player characters: a group of PCs ready to take on whatever your GM&amp;rsquo;s campaign can dish out.&lt;br/&gt;    Adventure: an exclusive one-page OSR adventure, &amp;ldquo;SEA HAG&amp;rsquo;S FOLLY&amp;rdquo;. Can your players take on the aquatic horde that has attacked their seaside village? Designed for 4 to 6 PCs of 2nd to 4th level.&lt;br/&gt;    Old School art: a showcase of art, by myself and others, which are features in my published books;&lt;br/&gt;    Market Square: synopses and information on my recently published books; and&lt;br/&gt;    The Inn: a roundup of role-playing social media posts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
