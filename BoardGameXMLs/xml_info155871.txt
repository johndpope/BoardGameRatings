			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guidebook to the City of Dolmvay is a Labyrinth Lord supplement that details the people, layout, and government of the City of Dolmvay. The city is presented in broad strokes and is open to customization. It was specifically designed to give Labyrinth Lords a convenient and familiar city setting to place their adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guidebook to the City of Dolmvay is largely open content. Small Niche Games would like to encourage professional and amateur publishers to use the Guidebook as a shared city setting and set their commercial adventures within the City of Dolmvay.
