			<description>Free translation from back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you dream about becoming a successful show jumping star just like Malin Baryard? In Malin&amp;rsquo;s own game WORLD CUP you get to test your talent in exciting jumping competitions. Initially you compete on a borrowed horse and try to collect enough prices to get all necessary equipment and a horse of your own. With that accomplished you just have to win one final competition to become the World Cup champion. All you need is luck, a bit of tactics and some horse knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event cards and trivia questions make the game full of action and lots of fun. You also get to ride different horses and the better you perform the better horses you get to ride. Many of the available horses are &amp;quot;celebrities&amp;quot; and if you are really good you might even get to jump Butterfly Flip!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malin Baryard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
