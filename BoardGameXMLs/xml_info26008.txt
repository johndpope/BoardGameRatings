			<description>This card game consists of a huge deck of 132 cards and 25 letter chips.&lt;br/&gt;100 of the 132 cards are coupons, showing a letter and a value of 10 or 50. The rest of the deck has 32 cards of 11 different types, such as gold-barrels, bank robbers, guards, policemen and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts, 3 letter chips are drawn; they form the combination, which is needed to open the bank safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, the players play cards on 3 different places of the table: their own playing area, the bank-safe or around the bank-safe (to protect the safe).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when the bank safe is either opened with the correct combination or successfully robbed by a bank robber.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Points are calculated to determine the winner - the bank safe is likely to give the most points, but cards on the playing areas and cards still in the hands are calculated also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
