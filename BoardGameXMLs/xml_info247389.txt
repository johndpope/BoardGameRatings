			<description>Portal Games created an 2018 event kit with promo-cards for each faction of the base game. If you participate in the event, you can keep the 3 promo-cards of the faction you've played with at the event. For each faction you get 3 copies of the same card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Romans get a card called 'Administration' and has a feature: each time you build a faction building, gain 1 gold and 1 star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards are alternate artwork cards and replace the Administration cards found in Roman's deck in the base game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained in:&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Settlers: In-store Event Kit 2018&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
