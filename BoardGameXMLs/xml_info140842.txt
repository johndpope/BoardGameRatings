							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Stealer of Children</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tired of throwing hordes of kobolds, giant rats, and skeletons against your low-level characters? Leandras Row is a peaceful farming village that lies on the border of a mystical forest known as the Tanglewood. The villagers pay homage to St. Leandra the Lady of Blossoms and the village is famous for its ripe cherry orchards and religious festivals. When an ancient evil awakens and children start to disappear, the village is thrown into an uproar. Can the PCs enter a crumbling ruin, deal with the faerie creatures of the Tanglewood, and solve the mystery in time to stop the Stealer of Children?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stealer of Children is a Labyrinth Lord adventure designed for 3-6 characters of 1st level. A diverse range of classes is recommended, with the typical 1st level party having limited or no access to magical items or weapons. The adventure is set in the small village of Leandras Row in the Duchy of Valnwall, but the Labyrinth Lord is free to substitute any small frontier village from his own campaign world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stealer of Children involves a mixture of roleplaying, investigation, and wilderness exploration, with combat encounters spaced out to accommodate the party's low level. The adventure pits the characters against a creature that cannot be easily overcome by brute force, so characters who rely too much on their combat abilities may be in for a tough time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Tips for scaling the adventure for higher-level characters are also included with this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product comes with a detailed map of Leandras Row, stats and descriptions for the villagers, and plot hooks for further adventures in the surrounding area, making Leandras Row an ideal starting base for low-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
