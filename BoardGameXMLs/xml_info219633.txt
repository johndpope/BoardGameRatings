							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Irminsul of Aphrodite-Ammut</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Labyrinth Lord/Mutant Future AD&amp;amp;D free retro-clone. This adventure takes place around an enormous Irminsul-Yggdrasil World Oak Tree in an impenetrable forest. Around the tree is wound an enormous wurm (worm) which spiritually imbues the Land of this region. The maps contained below of the tree are cross-sections of the hollow tree (containing passages and rooms) at various height points up its trunk above ground (consider the tree had been laterally sawn in half and felled to reveal this view at its various floor heights about ground level). The main focus of this adventure is the lordess of the Irminsul Tree, Lady Fata Aphrodite-Ammut, an avatar of Eris Discordia &amp;ndash; the Greek goddess of Primordial Chaos. She resides within the tree and controls the surrounding forest. She is served by various denizen within the rooms of the hollow tree such as the Vegepygmies. This adventure scenario is designed for 4-6 player characters of class levels 10th to 15th. The adventuring party should include a cleric, a magic user and a thief. Also compatible with AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
