							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Evil Genius #1: World Domination</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evil Genius #1: World Domination is a collection of five adventures, each with a different mastermind plot to conquer the world. Or just destroy it. Sometimes with these evil geniuses it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell the difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later issues of Evil Genius will feature other collections, all designed to give you, the GM, tools to put the game on the table. Because the real evil genius isn&amp;rsquo;t the criminal mastermind, it&amp;rsquo;s the person behind the screen. And we love you for it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five scenarios in this issue are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     High Noon&amp;ndash;Beams of light focused by orbiting crystal clouds cut massive trenches across the countryside.&lt;br/&gt;     The Cornfields&amp;ndash;Genetically altered seeds spawn towering mutant plant-giants, striding out of the farmlands and towards the cities.&lt;br/&gt;     The Brain-Taker&amp;ndash;Disgraced scientist Gordon Bockhurst builds a device to drain the mental energy from whole cities and take it for himself, giving him superhuman intelligence and deadly telepathic powers.&lt;br/&gt;     Luck Be A Lady&amp;ndash;The infamous Crimson Claw uses Shang-gong mysticism to steal luck from gamblers to give himself the power of the celestial gods.&lt;br/&gt;     Ice Age&amp;ndash;In a final stroke of revenge, Dr Null uses the Earth&amp;rsquo;s own gravity to push the planet out of orbit, sending it farther from the Sun and plunging the whole world into a new ice age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though these scenarios are written using a particular villain (Dr Null, the Crimson Claw, Gorbok the Overmind, etc.), the crux is really the mastermind&amp;rsquo;s plot. You can take these scenarios and easily swap in any mastermind you prefer. Don&amp;rsquo;t want to use Dr Null? Replace him with any other scientific supervillain, or even a non-scientific villain who has kidnapped the world&amp;rsquo;s foremost scientists and secretly put them to work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each adventure outlines the main action, but you can expand or compress the pacing as you see fit. A single scenario could be drawn out across multiple game sessions or finished all in one sitting. The scenarios are also peppered with new Action Shticks (Crowd Control, Evacuation Montage, etc.) that you can lift and use in your other games, and there are also Variants to give you alternate ways to run each one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have Day of Dr Null, Death of Dr Null or Zodiac Ring, there are places where you can use Action Shticks or other material from those adventures in these scenarios, but they are not necessary for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
