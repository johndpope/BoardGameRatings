							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DragonElves</name>
									
			<description>DragonElves was a short lived foray into developing an E-card game by Fast Forward Enterprises in 2000. This was an unusual design in that players could design and customize their cards and then print out the decks themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is a mix of standard CCG cardplay and some aspects of a wargame. DragonElves depicts the battle between the armies of the DragonElves and the BronzeMen.Players arrange their armies in 4 columns and striving to eliminate the units in the enemy ranks by direct combat and boosting attacks by playing various effect cards over a 4-Phase skirmish turn. Players attempt to better their opponents attacks with spells and skills, then augmented by a random draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As characters are eliminated then new warriors are exposed to attack until one side or the other has been totally wiped out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
