							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">House of Horiku</name>
									
			<description>The curtain rises on this role playing game as Japan's feudal era comes to an end. Play in a micro society of outcast women (and maybe some men) who were thrown out of their homes because they did not fit Normal Life, did not fit their gender roles. At the House of Horiku, they are schooled in various skills... one of which is assassination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using traditional ideas of masculine/feminine/androgyny players will juggle skill sets and direct their character through the struggle... feminine enough to return to domestic service, masculine enough to join the army, or to pursue the ideal of walking the line between them, an esoteric... NINJA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
