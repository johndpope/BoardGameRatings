			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the twisted, dark future of 24th century America, heroes are needed more than ever.  Do you have what it takes to rise up and answer the plea for help of hard pressed humanity?  In this adventure, the characters are recruited to investigate the disappearance and whereabouts of missing townsfolk beneath the recently re-inhabited farm-fortress of Walsave.  Through a series of underground expeditions, they soon discover that there is more to these kidnappings than meets the eye, and that these explorations under the Earth aren't just a ruin-crawl into the crumbling, artifact rich confines of an ancient shopping complex.  Besides the pitfalls and nightmares of the subterranean hell, they must contend with conflicting interests among the villagers as well, including raiders, a bizzare cult, and the ruling founders of this fortified settlement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can your characters survive the challenges that await them, or will they meet their end someplace deep below the rubble and junk of a besiged post-apocalyptic village?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
