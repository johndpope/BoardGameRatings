							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stonkers</name>
									
			<description>Stonkers is one of the earliest real-time strategy games. It was designed and programmed by John Gibson with graphics by Paul Lindale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stonkers is controlled either using keyboard or joystick. In the game, the player controls infantry, artillery, tanks, and supply truck units. Moving combat units uses up energy, and to replenish it, the player must keep the supply units in close proximity. Supply units are replenished every time a ship enters the port. Information about ongoing events is displayed in a ticker tape on the bottom of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was plagued with bugs and early versions crashed after a few minutes of play. Despite this, it was awarded the title &amp;quot;Best Wargame&amp;quot; by CRASH in 1984.   Stonkers is the subject of a running gag on the comp.sys.sinclair usenet group and the World Of Spectrum forums, where a person asking for help in naming an unknown game will invariably receive a reply with the observation &amp;quot;It's definitely not Stonkers&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Stonkers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
