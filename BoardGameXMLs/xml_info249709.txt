			<description>2 Games In One. The Most Hilarious Game of the Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going Hollywood may be played in two different ways. In one game, the players create the atmosphere and color of Hollywood as they know it, or as they imagine it to be, by imitating the stars of screen and radio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second game, each player comes to Hollywood with $3,500 in script money. He may increase this amount by working at one of the four big studios on the board, or by leasing one of the popular nightclubs or restaurants and charging the other players a good price for every stop they make there. When one player has made enough by clever plays to purchase the Santa Anita Race Track, he can operate it at a pace that will quickly make him winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
