			<description>No longer in beta, released 13 October 2017&lt;br/&gt;Heliborne is a multi-player game of helicopter combat in either co-op or PVP modes but a single-player campaign is also available. The developers describe the gameplay as a &amp;quot;simu-lite/arcade hybrid&amp;quot; where players fly one of three helicopter classes - Attack, Air-Assault or Reconnaissance - in four tiers representing the development generations of helicopter design. Players can unlock the next tier of helicopters, offensive and defensive equipment and also skins (paintjobs) for each helicopter in the same manner as games such as World Of Tanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will have the ability to fly a number of helicopters across a wide range of maps and in a wide range of mission scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Steam store page, November 2017:&lt;br/&gt;Get behind the cockpits of the best helicopters in the world &amp;ndash; from the classic machines of the 1950s to the modern gunships of the 21st century. Play missions with your friends and compete with players from all around the world in various multiplayer modes!You will be able to take part in a dynamic battlefield where you'll support the movement of ground forces that fortify positions and create supply lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE RETURN OF HELICOPTER COMBAT GAMES&lt;br/&gt;Heliborne marks the great return of a nearly forgotten genre - helicopter action games! Here you'll get to dive into historical conflicts, explore maps inspired by real-world locations and engage in ruthless air-to-air and air-to-ground combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By flying over 40 helicopters distributed over 3 different classes you'll fight other pilots as well as tanks, troops, and anti-aircraft artillery. You will test your skill in multiplayer modes, such as Skirmish (King-of-the-Hill style mode) or Frontline (as bases are captured by players, ground vehicles spawn in convoys and move across the map to fortify bases and positions), or play alone the new single player missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
