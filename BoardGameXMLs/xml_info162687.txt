			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Song of Shadows and Dust is a standalone miniatures wargame based on the award winning Song of Blades and Heroes rules engine. The rules reflect the gritty reality of urban violence while preserving the keep-it-simple, play-as-you-want, no-book-keeping-required spirit of the Ganesha Games family.&lt;br/&gt; Easy to learn: The elegant core rules are easy to learn in just one game.&lt;br/&gt; Fast to play: Games are designed to be finished in under an hour allowing small campaigns to be completed in a single sitting.&lt;br/&gt; Flexible: Inspired by the break down in civil order which plagued the great cities of the Mediterranean in the first century BC, these rules are suitable for any pre-modern setting from Babylon to Bruges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expansive: Includes 57 unique character profiles with whom to populate your faction or guild &amp;ndash; from henchmen, assassins and punch-drunk boxers, to street urchins, elder statesmen and courtesans. Players are also free to create their own custom characters choosing from among 46 defining special rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variable: Eleven different faction objectives allow for 121 different tabletop scenarios.&lt;br/&gt; Expandable: Easily supplemented by special rules and scenarios drawn from the other rule books produced by Ganesha Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
