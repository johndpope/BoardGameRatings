							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Luckiest Day of Your Life</name>
									
			<description>From back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you luck out, or run out of luck?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your friends are at a traveling carnival, playing games of chance and skill. After winning a seemingly impossible game, you are offered a choice of two prizes by a mysterious attendant. You can choose either a blue-green crystal or a book entitled How to Get Lucky. Neither seems very exciting, but the attendant assures you that these prizes could change your life! Which will you choose?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you pick the crystal, turn to page 7. If you take the book, turn to page 67. Choose carefully! Your good luck could bring you wealth and adventure. But if you misuse your good fortune, you could lose everything--even your life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens next in the story? It all depends on the choices you make. How does the story end? Only you can find out! And the best part is that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not one but many incredibly daring experiences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
