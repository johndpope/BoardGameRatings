			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Spectacular Enhancement to the Skill System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Skills introduces a system of skill exploits that take the basic tasks your skills allow you to perform and dials them up to amazing levels. In addition, every skill in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook also gets brand-new skill exploits, as well as greater exploits that only the most skilled masters would even attempt. This book contains rules for using these enhanced skills with mythic characters but also provides an alternative system for use in non-mythic Pathfinder campaigns!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This system allows your characters to focus on their skills as a key part of their character construction and to invest more of their character's abilities in their character itself, rather than the character&amp;rsaquo;s gear or magical tools. You can use these rules generally with mythic characters, allowing them to attempt all manner of skill-based exploits, or you can limit the ability to pull off these amazing skill stunts to those mythic characters that have really invested in making their skills a key part of their character's identity. The mythic rules offer an opportunity to magnify what makes a character special, and the skills they choose to hone as part of their background narrative and throughout the course of the campaign should be just as important in defining them as their marvelous magic and fabulous feats. With Mythic Skills in your hands, your skills will be just as spectacular!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
