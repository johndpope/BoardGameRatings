			<description>&amp;quot;Monstrum&amp;quot; (Monster) is a quite easy fantasy quest type game. Game objectives which players have to achieve to win are: 1) to reach place called &amp;quot;Kopalnia Zezere&amp;quot; (Zezere Mine) after: 2) killing at least one Monster, 3) gaining 30 points of strenght.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game players have to fight with hostile creatures. They can sometimes find special objects and gain spells which can be used in further fights or help in achieving game goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is almost no interaction between players - which can be recognized as a big minus in gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origins of the game are dated in 1984 when Jacek Ciesielski published its rules, cards and board in magazine &amp;quot;Razem&amp;quot; (Together). Rules and board for this earlier version were different. Graphics on game cards were simpler, but almost every player who had opportunity to play 1984 and 1990 versions claims that older version is better looking. Changes in 1990 probably gone too far ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphic design came from Polish comics artist - Witold Parzyd≈Ço.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
