							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rituals of the Deep Ones</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfathomable Secrets of the Deep&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occult rituals, from Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Occult Adventures, bring magic to the masses, with lengthy and difficult to perform magical rites which can be performed even by non-spellcasters, but which come with a cost, as well as the risk for terrible backlash to occur for those who meddle in things they do not understand. Unlike traditional spells, only a handful of occult rituals made it into that book however, which begs the question of what other strange and unknowable rituals might be lurking about in obscure tomes lost to history and memory. Tomes like this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents a collection of 10 brand new occult rituals for use in your game, all of which are thematically linked to the watery depths, and the strange and enigmatic underwater race referred to only as the deep ones. Presented in the guise of a fictitious tome that player characters might stumble across, the book also includes a flavorful introductory section that can be read aloud or handed out to players, and suggestions for how to incorporate the book into your game. The rituals in this book allow players (or nefarious NPCs) to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Magically commune with deep ones, and other denizens of the deep, such as aboleths and krakens.&lt;br/&gt;    Create doorways of the deep, massive whirlpools that act as magical gateways to travel instantaneously across entire oceans.&lt;br/&gt;    Drag lost treasure up from the depths.&lt;br/&gt;    Conjure powerful storms that are devastating on land, and have a chance of sinking ships at sea.&lt;br/&gt;    And much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
