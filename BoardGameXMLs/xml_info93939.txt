			<description>Jagged Alliance 2: Gold Pack was published by Strategy First on August 6, 2002 and adds the improvements of Unfinished Business to the final release of Jagged Alliance 2. The Unfinished Business and a scenario editor are also included in the package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold Pack introduces notable changes to the difficulty setting. The player choosing an advanced difficulty level may also decide to make the player turns timed and whether to disallow saving during combat, as opposed to the original Jagged Alliance 2, which set these settings automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of July 2006 it is available via the Steam content delivery system, as well as Turner Broadcasting's GameTap. This version has a bug which causes the player to have infinite money rendering financial strategy irrelevant. Unfinished Business contains a bug which results in the player being unable to save his or her progress. Strategy First has acknowledged the issues but has failed to provide a fix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jagged Alliance 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
