			<description>Battles Before Time is a prehistoric fantasy miniatures skirmish game for 28mm figures (as well as plastic dinosaurs &amp;amp; giant mammals that more or less fit with 28mm cavemen). The game is set in an alternate prehistory where our Human ancestors &amp;ndash; the Early Modern Humans, or Emohs for short &amp;ndash; rub elbows with Neanderthals, Dino sapiens (dinosaur men), Florz (small Emohs), &amp;amp; other species. Dinosaurs, huge mammals, &amp;amp; monsters also roam the Earth, &amp;amp; shamans can use powerful magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of two parts. Part One is 24 pages long; it contains the rules (the core rules are only seven pages long) as well as a guide to the cavemen &amp;amp; creatures that will make up your warband. Warbands include cavemen or dinosaur men who can purchase special abilities, weapons, armor, cavepunk items, &amp;amp; spells. Warbands can also include heroes, dinosaurs, mammals, prehistoric &amp;ldquo;birds&amp;rdquo;, aquatic beasts, &amp;amp; prehistoric monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Two contains detailed instructions on how to create your warband. Players can use one of the pre-made warbands provided, or can create their own balanced warbands using a simple point build system. Part Two is 63 pages long &amp;amp; includes templates, more than 100 unit cards, all the tokens you&amp;rsquo;ll need (though it is strongly recommended that you purchase cheap glass beads for the simple &amp;ldquo;stone draw&amp;rdquo; system that&amp;rsquo;s used to resolve actions), a terrain placement guide, &amp;amp; measuring sticks. You supply the cavemen, dinosaurs, &amp;amp; other prehistoric figures, &amp;amp; we'll give you a fun excuse to play with them on a tabletop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, stop shaving! Stop bathing! Grab a club, and let&amp;rsquo;s rock &amp;amp; roll!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
