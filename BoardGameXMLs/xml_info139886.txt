			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book Two of the Yojimbo Trilogy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omega Thule, the world-wide villainous face of the Fourth Reich, is always looking to improve their game.  Not satisfied with their Kette Truppen, otherwise known as the Chainsaw Ninjas of the SS, they have set aside a research facility in the United States to improve upon their fearsome shadow troopers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a young operative finds the Aryan ideal holding him back, he triggers a series of events that threaten not only the nearby city, but potentially, the whole world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As if Chainsaw Ninjas weren't enough, someone had to go and throw demonic magic items and radioactive space aliens into the mix.  Oh yes, an Omega Renegade is bad... but not nearly as bad as it's going to get!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a supplement for Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game, you will need the core rulebook in order to play.  Herein, we update characters from The Chainsaw Ninjas of the SS!, and re-visit some equipment from the Nostrum Arms 2016 Arms and Armor Catalog, you may want to look at those books for reference.  There will also be references to material from Librum Enchantus, Mechaphisto: The Demon Lord of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
