							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Land of the Lost Game</name>
									
			<description>Land of the Lost Game is based on a 1970s television series that featured a modern family thrown into a world of dinosaurs and other pre-historic creatures.  The premise of the game is that the players are out in the open and must make their way back to their caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a token and places it at its starting point (as indicated by its color).  To win the game, he or she must move the token to its designated Cave across the network printed on the board.  Going in turns, each player flicks the spinner and moves his or her token one space according to direction indicated by the spinner.  If a token ends up in the middle region of the board, the Pit, it is put back at its starting point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a winner has been decided: first player to land his or her token on his or her Cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
