			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zen-Nippon Pro Wrestling: Ouja no Kon is a 3D Japanese wrestling game released in 1999 for the PlayStation. It was published by Human Entertainment (and later Spike) and developed by Human Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main game features is the Powerball system. This system provides each wrestler with two to four Powerballs that can be used in a match in several different ways. Powerballs allow each wrestler to use a special move that is specifically assigned to them, they can be used to give regular moves extra power, or they can be used to kick out of a pin attempt when your wrestler would not normally have the strength to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features 25 wrestlers (including one hidden wrestler) from the All Japan Pro Wrestling promotion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seven modes of play available in the game: One Night Match, Champion Carnival, Real World Tag League, Battle Royal, Create Edit (Create-a-Wrestler), MVP Season Mode, and Defend Title (hidden mode).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
