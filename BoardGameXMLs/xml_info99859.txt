			<description>Wings 2: Aces High (also sold in Britain as Blazing Skies) is the sequel to the Amiga game Wings that takes place during World War I (though the developer is Namco, rather than Cinemaware). As the leader of a squadron of American/British warplanes, the player must bomb German buildings viable to Kaiser Wilhelm II's war effort. If he fails, one of his pilots gets fired (dishonorably discharged). If he dies in the line of duty, then the player gets a cemetery scene with the game taking place in the year 1917.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between bombings, the player must also use guns to blast down German biplanes. Eventually, you will get to face off with the Red Baron (formally known as Manfred von Richthofen). There is also a cheat code for radar which, unusually, was included in a small section of the manual (although radar was not invented until World War II).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Wings 2: Aces High&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
