			<description>Experience the game that will have you bubbling with desire! Lovin' Tub is a foreplay game for lovers to be entirely enjoyed in the bathtub! True Lovin' Tub foreplay means rubbing your partner down from head to toe while indulging in a little pampering of your own. However, it also involves performing stimulating challenging tasks that are far from watered down on the excitability scale! Let chance guide you through a series of voluptuous caresses, sensual kisses and other pleasurable treats that are sure to arouse your senses! The Lovin' Tub game has deliberately decided upon an odd number of total cards to avoid a tie and have a clear winner declared. The player with the most playing cards at the end of the game wins their choice of two vouchers from the Afterbath Rewards booklet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: bottle of foam bath, game board with arrow, 11 plastic cards (avoid peeking for maximum surprise effect), and hourglass&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
