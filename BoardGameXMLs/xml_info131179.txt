			<description>The year is 1988 and Robin, an 11-year-old boy with an unusual psychic gift, has awoken from a long sleep among the ruins of his former home in Southampton, England, which has been devastated by a nuclear war. The last thing he remembers is falling asleep as normal in his room. His family and friends are missing and Britain has become an ultra-rightist state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In reality, Robin is living in 1987 and this is a vision of the future. Robin has fallen into a trance from which he cannot wake. He must somehow discover the causes of the disaster that will befall the world, and awake to warn his contemporaries of their possible fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a text adventure with basic graphics to set the scene. The package includes a 160-page book, Mindfighter by Anna Popkess, which lays out the background of the story, and provides hints for play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must guide Robin through the hazardous environment of post-apocalyptic Southampton, surviving famine, desperate mobs, radiation sickness, and the violent agents of the &amp;quot;The System&amp;quot;, the dictatorial government which now governs Britain. Robin must survive and somehow prevent the war from happening.&lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the game is a prophecy by Nostradamus that at the end of the 20th century there would be a major world war, beginning somewhere in the Middle East. The game was produced at a time of escalating violence in the Persian Gulf due to the Iran-Iraq War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mindfighter&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
