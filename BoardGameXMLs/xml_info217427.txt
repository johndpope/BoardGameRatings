			<description>World War II Strategy Wargame For 6mm Scale Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These war-game rules for Second World War battles are designed for re-creating historical battles with miniatures in 1/300 or 1/285 scale. The size of forces on each side are typically a combat command or brigade. Such battles were frequently commanded by Brigadier Generals, hence the name of the rules. Some of the most interesting battles you can play with these rules have a number of commands on each side, each directed by a different player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These wargame rules were written primarily for play with two or more players, however the rules were specifically designed for the possibility of solo play. Starting from a historical set up, if you play alone, you will find the command rules make it easy to be logical about what orders should be given to each side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes the rules book, two summary rule sheets, armor penetration table sheet, ready to cut order chits and unit identification markers. Optional extra time and event cards can be purchased separately, which facilitate play and speed the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
