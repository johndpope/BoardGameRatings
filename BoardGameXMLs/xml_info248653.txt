							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Lovely Daughter</name>
									
			<description>The dark and twisted themes of My Lovely Daughter are a commentary on child labor, abusive parenting, and ignorant societies. This game is intended to make people sad and uneasy but there is a deeper meaning behind the horror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Lovely Daughter is inspired by the hardships experienced by members of our team growing up. The game is designed to upset and disturb you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Lovely Daughter is a game about overcoming the loss of a loved one through forbidden alchemy experiments ... and murder. You are Faust, an amnesiac alchemist and father, who wakes up alone and confused only to discover that your lovely daughter has died. As you enter the first stages of grief, you do what everyone wishes they could do but can&amp;rsquo;t: bring back the dead with the power of alchemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
