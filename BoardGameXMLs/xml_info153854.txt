			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Station is a story roleplaying game in which players take on the roles of world leaders with access to unfathomable fuel sources, while neighboring nations covet their power. Set in a near-future world, Power Station asks questions of responsibility and power. Will hubris be your nation&amp;rsquo;s undoing? Or will you use the power responsibly and usher in a new era of human achievement?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just one year ago, power stations appeared &amp;mdash; mysteriously &amp;mdash; across the globe, providing free energy to nearly 300 million people. Each. As the leaders of nations with access to this power, the players assume the command of nations with unlimited fuel. They must parcel out this power and determine who are their allies&amp;hellip; and who are their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power Station is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
