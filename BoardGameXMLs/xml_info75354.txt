			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shining Wisdom differs from its predecessors in the Shining series in that it was the first to employ an Action-adventure style of gameplay. Players control one character whose attacks rely on speed and skill, rather than controlling a group of characters who engage in turn-based combat sequences and increase their stats as the game progresses. The gameplay of Shining Wisdom has often been likened to that of The Legend of Zelda series. Shining Wisdom's originality comes from the unique system of attacks based on a combination of acquired items and &amp;quot;orbs.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
