							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Five Line Poker</name>
									
			<description>This game involves players alternating turns placing a card from their hand into one of five lines on their side (each will have 5 cards in them, and drawing a replacement card (game uses standard deck of playing cards).  Object of the game is to try to have at least 3 out of 5 better poker hands than their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar to Schotten Totten or Battlelines, but was developed before the developer actually saw the rules to either of these games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
