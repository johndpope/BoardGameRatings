			<description>From the Paizo website:&lt;br/&gt;Divine your future! Lose your shirt! All in one box!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting, the Harrow deck has long been a sacred tool of Varisian fortunetellers. In skilled hands, the Harrow deck can predict crop results, divine the gender of your unborn child, or give hints about your immediate future. In unskilled hands, the Harrow deck is a sacrilegious gambling game&amp;mdash;a cutthroat diversion for ruffians in every port to lose their hard-earned fortunes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harrow will be featured throughout the second Pathfinder Adventure Path, Curse of the Crimson Throne. At least once in each installment, players may divine their futures with the Harrow deck, and Pathfinder #7 contains an in-depth article about the history of Harrow and its in-game use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harrow is also a standalone card game designed by Jason Bulmahn, Mike Selinker, and Teeuwynn Woodruff for use inside or outside the Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting. Harrow is lavishly illustrated by Kyle Hunter, the artist behind Downer: Wandering Monster and Downer: Fool's Errand, the Paizo Comics compilations of Kyle's original Downer comics from Dungeon magazine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This item also has an entry on RPGG: Harrow Deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
