							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Antioch</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antioch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antioch is a heavily settled colony world. Famous for its single, asteroid-impact continent, the planet has been heavily exploited for the incredible mineral wealth of platinum, petroleum and Carbon 60 fullerite found at the impact site. Today, this most wealthy and prosperous of colonial ventures is wracked by guerrilla war and civil strife. Where mining companies once flocked to make a killing, now mercenary groups drop out of orbit to make their own type of killing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems as if Antioch hates humans: micro-organisms play havoc with delicate circuitry, desert dust cripple grav craft, thick jungles prove impenetrable by vehicles and aircraft, prolific, almost sentient vine growths somehow interfere with radio transmissions and seem to intentionally sabotage any machinery they encounter, alien insect and animal life infest settlements and ruin equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few places on Antioch enjoy peace and stability anymore - this is a tinderbox world, with guerrilla wars, insurgencies and corporate sponsored mercenary activity. Nothing short of complete independence for the nations of Antioch will bring peace to the troubled world, but the corporations are still hungry for the riches of the planet, and they want a return on their investments....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This world is ripe for Traveller mercenary campaigns, with a score of plots, mercenary-orientated NPCs and opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Planetary Tool Kit is double-length, featuring five maps, colour art and sustainable play ideas!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
