			<description>&amp;quot;A Game Of Family Discovery&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a board game designed to help family members get to know each other in new and different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move around the board and respond to provocative or silly questions depending on the color-coded shape of the space where they land. There are two decks of cards, one for adults and one for children. The questions are structured to provide an open environment for discussion without confrontation. Some cards prompt a player to create a story, which the other contestants judge for creativity and originality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach the end of the vacation pathway with all six &amp;quot;Lucky Symbols&amp;quot; is declared the winner. That family member gets a free wish, like a special dinner of their choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes a colorful board, six pewter tokens, one die, two decks of cards in a &amp;quot;suitcase&amp;quot; card holder, the rules, and a large cloth carrying bag. There is no outer box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for kids age 5-12 to play with parents or grandparents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
