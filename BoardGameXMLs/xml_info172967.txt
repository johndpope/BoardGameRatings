							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle Crusaders</name>
									
			<description>Battle Crusaders is a card game consisting of 110 fighter character cards with stats on and 50 magic cards which can change the state of play at any time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game starts the players can choose how many hands they play in multiples of the number of players. This means that the game can be played for short periods (e.g. 1/2 hour or a few hours). The winner is the player who has won the most hands at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dealer rotates clockwise round the table and after shuffling the cards, starting with their self, deals out seven cards to each player but also finishing with their self, so they will have eight cards. The reason being that they will go first as will every dealer in turn which makes the game fair. The rest of the pack is then put into the centre of the table and the top card is turned over and laid face up on the table next to the pack. If this is a fighter card the player can either then go against that fighter or, choose to go against the next player in turn with the stats and if the card wins that card is laid down on top of the other one for the next player to fight. If the first card down is a magic card it is ignored and they must go against the next player with a fighter card or lay down a magic card and so on.The winner of the hand is the first person (or persons,which it can be with one of the magic cards)to get rid of all their cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The more the game is played the more skilled the players can become, especially with the magic cards,and reading the play ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
