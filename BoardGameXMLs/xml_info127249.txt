							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steamfunk</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine if all the most interesting parts of the 1800s were slammed together. Early industrialism blends with Gilded Age monopolies. H.G. Wells mixes with Edgar Allen Poe. Tesla, Edison, and Babbage merge with the Pinkertons and colonial politics. All of it maintains an outer facade of Victorian sensibilities, but on any deeper investigation it is as rotten as the worst parts of Jack the Ripper's Whitechapel London. Now take it all, make a civilization out of it, and run that civilization off city-sized power plants that are on the verge of absolute failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steamfunk is everything that might be considered &amp;quot;steampunk,&amp;quot; set in a dystopian world that is as much smog as it is steam and as much disease as it is discovery. It is a place of almost-panicked desperation, barely hidden by the thin shell of a &amp;quot;polite&amp;quot; society in decline. It is a universe decidedly in need of heroes, if you happen to know of any...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steamfunk is a completely new, self-contained campaign setting that is rules neutral. It is ripe and ready to be rifled through for ideas to incorporate into your home brewed game, pre-published setting, or used whole cloth as your new game world! AND, for the Untold player, the setting naturally works with all our released Untold cards! No pesky mechanics changes needed. No conversions or instructions! Just download, read, and play - that's it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
