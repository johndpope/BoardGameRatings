							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rocca Monster</name>
									
			<description>A snowbound small village. It quietly approaches and sneaks into the innermost part of a villager's heart. When the night has come and everyone else is sleeping, it quietly wakes up. The brutal murderer wanders around the village and preys on honest villagers. Who is the heinous monster?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rocca Monster is a hidden role/social deduction game for 3-6 players. Each player is dealt three villagers which are placed on the table in front of them. One of the villagers in the game is secretly the monster. All players close there eyes and count to ten, during which time the player with the monster card places a six sided die on a villager of their choice. After the count is finished all players open their eyes and see who was attacked in the night. That player rolls the die, and on a roll of 1-4 the villager on whom the die was placed is killed. On a roll of 5 or 6 the villager survives the attack. After the murder (or attempted murder) the players discuss who they think the monster is, and then use their voting cards to vote for which villager they want to accuse of being the monster. Once a single villager has the majority of votes their card is turned over and it is revealed whether they were the monster or not. If they were the monster then the other players win! If they were not the monster then their card is removed from the game and play continues. Another night attack occurs, followed by another round of discussion and voting. This cycle continues until either the monster successfully kills half the villagers (at which point the monster player wins the game), or until the players successfully identify the monster (at which point the monster player loses and everyone else wins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
