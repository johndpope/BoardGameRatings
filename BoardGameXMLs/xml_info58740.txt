							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of High Favor: Dwarves</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Deep within their mountain fortresses, the dwarves toil away at their craft, turning precious ore into works of priceless beauty. Yet these are not mere artisans, for they are the masters of yet another skill: the art of warfare. For every gold coin that flows into the halls of the dwarven lords, there stands at the ready a grim-faced dwarven warrior prepared to defend it with his very life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each book in the HEROES OF HIGH FAVOR series contains a toolkit of additional feats, skills, concepts, and prestige classes to encourage the exploration of your race's favored class. DWARVES features background information and role-playing tips for ten unique dwarven prestige classes, as well as new feats, fighting styles, and dwarven runes. Of course, you will also find an extensive section on dwarven craftsmanship, including weapon and armorsmithing rules. You can create entirely new kinds of masterwork weapons and armor, crafted from the finest dwarven steel, mithral, and adamantine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
