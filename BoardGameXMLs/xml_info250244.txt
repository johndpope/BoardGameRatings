							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Switchblade City 01: Randy&#039;s Pool Hall</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Randy's Pool Hall is located in a neglected looking building that is part of a rundown shopping center area.  Originally the location of a small grocery store, the business was deemed a failure after a couple of decades of operation. The grocery store was shut down and the building was abandoned. Around ten years ago local resident Randy Widener purchased the empty building and turned it into a pool hall complete with serving bar and small arcade room. Since opening up, Randy's Pool Hall has earned an unsavory reputation for illegal, &amp;quot;under the table&amp;quot; billiards gambling and its drunken, rowdy patrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
