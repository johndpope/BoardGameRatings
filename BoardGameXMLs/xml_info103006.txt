			<description>Also known as &amp;quot;American Mega-People&amp;quot;, this is the combination mega-game of American Megafauna and Origins: How We Became Human.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Origins terms, much of the play of American Megafauna is relegated to Era 0, predating the play in Origins: How We Became Human.  Play commences on the American Megafauna map as players evolve their species.  Upon reaching Era 1, their species is some form of &amp;quot;human&amp;quot;- perhaps of reptilian descent, and must focus on evolving their brain as in Origins: How We Became Human.  Once their brain is fully evolved, players continue through the subsequent eras, working towards unique victory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal Farm is an epic abstracted simulation that spans the intervening millenia between the Mesozoic Era to the rise of modern humans.  Players will take on the roles of species, language groups, cultures, and, finally, ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features two new brain maps representing humanoids descending from reptiles and humanoid descendants of mastodons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
