			<description>From the front page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A D&amp;amp;D Living Kingdoms of Kalamar Adventure&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for 1st- to 13th-Level Characters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aftermath of the battles back in Pekal continue to unfold as the consequences of the Battle of Bet Seder continue to unfold. However the PCs have a chance to continue their pursuit of the Sword of Kings in this fourth event in the series Strike to the Heart. It will be helpful if the players have played the first three events in the series A is for Assassin and B is for Brothers and C is for Civilization prior to playing this. It can be played out of order however the most enjoyment may be found if all three have already been played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
