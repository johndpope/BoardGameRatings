			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Chinese Dominoes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chinese Dominoes is a family of domino games played with &amp;quot;Chinese Dominoes&amp;quot; (or also called Asian Dominoes,  as there are Chinese, Korean, Burmese, and Thai games played with these sets of Dominoes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Origins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chinese name for 'Chinese Dominoes' is K'wat P'ai (meaning &amp;quot;bone tablets&amp;quot;) or sometimes U P'ai (&amp;quot;Barbarian tablets)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with a number of other Chinese games these dominoes made their way to Korea. The Korean version of dominoes are called kol-hpai (meaning &amp;quot;bone tablets&amp;quot;) or sometimes ho-hpai (&amp;quot;Barbarian tablets&amp;quot;) - possibly linked to the attitude of the korean nobility towards the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chinese Dominoes  differ from Western Dominoes in the number and distribution of the tiles, as well as the games that are traditionally played with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set consists of 32 tiles of a double-six pattern, distributed as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Two copies of 1-1, 1-3, 1-5, 1-6, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 4-6, 5-5, 5-6 and 6-6.&lt;br/&gt;One copy of 1-2, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6 and 4-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These differ from Western Dominoes in that they have no blanks.  The tiles are made up of the 21 different combinations of two six-sided dice thrown, plus the 11 &amp;quot;duplicate copies&amp;quot; listed above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pips for one and four are colored red.  All other numbers are white, with the exception of six, which is half-and-half.  These colors have significance in the Chinese games.  Asian Dice have the one and four pips colored red as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pai Gow and Tien Gow are popular games played with Chinese Dominoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
