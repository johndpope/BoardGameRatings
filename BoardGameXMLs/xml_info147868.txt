			<description>Sque-e-e-eze Play is played on a 7x7 square grid. Players begin by each making a (different) mark in any space. On each subsequent turn, a player begins at their last mark, moves any number of empty spaces in any straight line, and places a new mark in the end space. (The previous mark is crossed out.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to end on your opponent's last mark (an exception to the rule about only moving in empty spaces) or prevent your opponent from playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published in the May 1983 issue of GAMES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
