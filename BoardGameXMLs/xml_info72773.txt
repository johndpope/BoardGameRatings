			<description>&amp;quot;Night Trap is a survival horror interactive movie video game that was released in North America on October 15, 1992 originally for the Sega CD. It was filmed over a three-week period in 1987 for an unreleased game entitled &amp;quot;Scene of the Crime&amp;quot;. The footage was placed into archive when that game failed to materialize, but the footage was later used to create a game by Digital Pictures which in total reportedly cost US$1.5 million to produce. This game became Night Trap, which was originally developed for Hasbro's NEMO system, which used VHS tapes instead of ROM cartridges. However, when Hasbro scrapped production on the NEMO, Night Trap was moved to the Sega CD and later brought to the Sega 32X, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, and PC platforms with higher-quality video. The game utilized full-motion video scenes entirely and is notorious for the controversy it brewed in 1993, resulting in US Senate hearings and withdrawal of the game from the market and the creation of the ESRB.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Night_Trap,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
