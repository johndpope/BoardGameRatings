							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombie Mall: Brains on the Brain</name>
									
			<description>Zombie Mall Brains on the Brain is the first expansion to Zombie Mall and features integrating Zombie Players into the existing rules of Zombie Mall.  Now players can find themselves reborn as part of the zombie horde after dying, and continue play while attacking the remaining Human Players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same map tiles and tokens included with Zombie Mall are used with this expansion along with the addition of a few Zombie Player specific tokens - these tokens are the Zombie Player token used for tracking where in the mall the Zombie Player is located, as well as the new Dead Again marker for those times that the Zombie Player is beaten down by the human folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Mall Brains on the Brain is an expansion and is not a complete game.  The Zombie Mall Basic Rules, available for free Print &amp;amp; Play download, are required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;In addition to adding Zombie Players to the A Call For Help scenario in the basic game, Expansion 1 also includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New Tokens needed by the Zombie Players&lt;br/&gt;     Updated Quick Reference Sheet usable by both Human Players and Zombie Players&lt;br/&gt;     New Player Stat Card usable by both Human Players and Zombie Players. This Stat Card also implements a Scoring Track for player stats and Victory Points which drastically reduces the number of printed tokens needed per player: the 90 tokens/player on page 4 of the Zombie Mall Basic Rules Tokens PDF can be reduced to 7.&lt;br/&gt;     2 new scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
