			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Referee&amp;rsquo;s Aid 8: Traders &amp;amp; Raiders explores the options open to starship captains willing to operate on both sides of the law. Smuggling, blockade running, and outright piracy offer additional revenue streams to the cash-strapped merchant, but careers are short for all but the most cunning. Smart operators vary their methods, swapping from piracy to planetary raiding or hijacking when necessary, engaging in gunrunning and smuggling where there is a profit to be made&amp;hellip; and some will even take the occasional legitimate cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways to make money with a starship, even without counting profitable activities undertaken somewhere that requires a ship to get to, but which do not involve the actual ship. Some of these activities are perfectly legal and are generally considered beneficial to interstellar society. Others&amp;hellip; not so much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
