			<description>Pop'n TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventures, released in Japan as TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventure, is a video game published and developed by Konami, released for the Super Famicom/Super NES. Released first in Japan, it later appeared in Europe. Rainbow Bell Adventures is a side-scrolling platform game, the first departure in a series of mostly vertically scrolling shooter games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rainbow Bell Adventures is a typical side-scrolling platformer, in which either Twinbee, Winbee or Gwinbee must get to the end of a stage. All characters use their punch to attack, which can be charged to unleash a punch wave. They have two sets of weapons, one of them is either a short or long-ranged weapon (a hammer for Twinbee, a lasso for Winbee, and throwing rattles for Gwinbee), and the other one is a gun, which is a reference to Detana!! Twinbee's cutscene, in which Twinbee is shown with two guns on each hand. All three can temporally fly in eight directions by propelling via a rocket pack that must be charged, as well as hover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from their weapons, the major difference between the characters is the time they require to fully charge their punch wave or their rocket propeller: Twinbee has an average charging time; Winbee charges her rocket propeller the fastest, but takes the most to charge a punch wave; Gwinbee, on the other hand, fills charges his punch quickly, but takes a while to charge his propeller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bell power-up from the rest of the series also appears here, and it allows any of the characters to obtain various kinds of power-ups, depending of the color of the bell, such as the sets of weapons, the gun, speed, options and invincibility. Unlike other Twinbee games, the bells are obtained by defeating enemies instead of shooting clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features a versus mode, in which players must defeat their opponents for three rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
