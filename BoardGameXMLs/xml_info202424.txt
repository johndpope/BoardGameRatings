							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Zombie Shamble</name>
									
			<description>The zombie apocalypse happened and the zombies won. Now what? There aren't any more people to eat and the rotting eternity is down-right boring. So, the zombies came up with the idea (if that's even possible) that foot-races would be neat. They certainly can be exciting &amp;ndash; especially when pieces of the contestants fall off along the way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zombie Shamble is a fast-paced card game where players take on the roles of zombies trying to do their best to get across the finish line. It's not all that far away, but remember that you're an animated rotting corpse and all kind of craziness can happen in just a few steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to 25 steps wins. Deal out 6 cards each, then draw a card, play a card. The cards are Steps (move towards finish line), Calamities (eg a leg falls off; fixed by Duct Tape card), Fortune (usually cancels a Calamity), a Trump card (eg Steely Eyed, so cannot be distracted). Oh, and that's exactly 25 steps, not more. Else the Zombie Judges won't be happy. But might be hungry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
