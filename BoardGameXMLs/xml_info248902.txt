			<description>HOW TO PLAY&lt;br/&gt;Elemasters is a 2 player card game that pits creatures based on the periodic table against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw an even number of whatever size deck you have time for up to 60 each. Recommend 15 each for a short (but not too short) game. The general rule of thumb is a little under 1 minute per card dealt. Each of you places the top three cards in front of you face up as your &amp;lsquo;rack&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player order is determined by one player rolling a die and the other calling &amp;ldquo;Plus&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Minus&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player puts a card forward as their active, then the second player does the same. Now, you both roll your game die and place on the square between the two numbers. Based on what you rolled, add or subtract those numbers left to right to get your rounds score (highest # wins round). *IF you rolled a circle + or circle -, you can swap out one of the numbers on your active card with one on any of your rack cards to give yourself a higher round score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High number remains active. Losing card is discarded and that player draws another for their rack, then chooses which to play next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    In the event of a tied round, both players discard, and draw a new one to their deck. Re-roll die for player order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WIN CONDITION&lt;br/&gt;Simple elimination. Whoever has at least one card left wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PHASE VARIABLES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The game can be played without the Phase modifier for younger ages, but this part of the main game. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Paper, Rock, Scissors, we use the &amp;ldquo;Gas, Liquid, Solid&amp;rdquo; idea to offer players a chance at a +1 to their round score. The Phase Modifier card is placed between players to the side of the active area (like a Tennis referee). The modifier card shows the current hierarchy for which phase type gets an automatic +1 when played against another phase type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a color on the bottom Red(Gas), Green(Liquid), and Blue(Solid) that lets you know what phase it is in for this game (The elements actual natural &amp;lsquo;found on Earth&amp;rsquo; phase is also noted on the card as &amp;lsquo;base phase&amp;rsquo; as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you run into a tied round roll, you flip the phase modifier which changes the hierarchy order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    CONTINUE GAME OPTION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re having fun and want a game to go longer, you can extend the gameplay with both players dealing an even number of cards into each others player deck. Similarly, you can reduce the game time by each of you removing an even number of cards from your player deck. This feature caters to people with busy/flexible schedules and kids with unpredictable focus levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
