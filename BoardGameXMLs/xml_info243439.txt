							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Command: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of the game is to secure the bases of the star with your missiles and defense shields. A base is secured when you land your missile on a base and when you play your defensive shield on the spot in front of it. The game is won when a player secures three bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, Star Command: The Board Game is a roll-and-move game where each player is trying to move to the bases before the other player. A couple of rules allow players to attempt knocking out their opponents' missiles and secured bases as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
