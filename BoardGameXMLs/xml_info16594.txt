							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mapping the Town</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Mapping the Town is a simple, fun game that introduces the concept of map reading.  Understanding the relationships of numbers and letters, logical thinking and attention to detail are skills players will develop during play.  One side of the board can be played as a simple lotto game of matching picture cards to identical but smaller pictures on the board.  The flip side of the board is also a lotto game that requires matching the grid coordinate on the card to the grid references on the board.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
