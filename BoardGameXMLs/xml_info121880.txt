			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spaceship Rasterscan is damaged and adrift, you must take control of the only functional repair droid aboard and fix the ship. The player controls a bouncing ball, which can pick up and drop items. Dropping an item in the right place will restore some of the ship's functions, giving access to more areas or activating additional ship functions. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game takes place aboard a large spaceship, the Rasterscan. After a skirmish the Rasterscan is badly crippled and drifting helplessly towards a star.&lt;br/&gt;   The player takes the role of a small robot by the name of M.S.B. Unfortunately M.S.B.'s only remaining program is how to repair toasters and it hasn't a clue how to operate the spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;   The object of the game is to repair and control the Rasterscan preferably before it collides with the star!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
