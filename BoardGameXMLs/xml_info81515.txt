			<description>Near the center of the Vasteel Solar System lies the planet Belose. Since the beginning of recorded history, Belose (and it's outposts on neighboring planets) has been ruled by a succession of emperors from the Faracia lineage. But this generation will be different. The people of Belose have grown discontent with their system of rulership, and the current emperor, Rodriguez Faracia, has been proven ineffective. Rodriguez has two sons. Faliall, his eldest son, is in line to become the next emperor of Belose. Stefan, the idealistic younger brother, wants desperately to change Belose for the better, but sees little opportunity to make his dream a reality. But cries of the people cannot be ignored. Change will come to Belose in unexpected ways. Here begins the bloodiest chapter in the history of the Vasteel System...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside instruction manual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a turn based strategy/war game. You have a number of military units you can choose between to buy from fighting robots to larger battleships as well as cities and factories to defend. The landscape varies as well. The battles are fought as an arcade style fighting/shooter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
