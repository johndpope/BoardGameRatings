			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Gu&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;&amp;quot;, a small uncharted archipelago in the Western Atlantic.  Ship-wrecked seafarers wash ashore in droves to the small rocky island chain.  These scared islanders cling together in small groups, drinking rain water and hunting for any food they can find on the islands.  Something is in the water however, and  after only a few days a paranoia hijacks the islanders.  Compelled by a blinding bloodlust, the islanders begin to butcher one another.  Day after day the pale sun rises to watch these islanders hunt each other in a demented fury.  And day after day, more islanders wash ashore this forlorn archipelago only to be tainted by a toxic curse that festers in these waters&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forlorn is a &amp;lsquo;Survival, Team Strategy Game&amp;rsquo;. There are several different game modes that are played using &amp;lsquo;Islanders&amp;rsquo;.  There are 31 Islanders that each function differently. Use your Islanders to compliment one another to defeat your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forlorn is typically played with 2-4 players, however Last Man standing can be played with 8. The game modes are Capture the Flagon, King of the Hill, Regicide, and Last Man Standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game mode has a different objective, winning the objective earns a player 5 victory points and ends the game. Additionally each islander kill is worth 2 Victory points, and a sailor (a minion) is wort 1 Victory point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This way a player that engages strategically and racks up kills can beat a player that camps and wins the game objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forlorn has been tested for nearly 2 years and has come to a version that favors strategy, decisive thinking and psychology.  Forlorn ultimately is a bloody strategy game with 4,495 possible different team combinations, 4 different game modes and 2-8 possible players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
