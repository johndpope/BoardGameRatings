			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the cosmos, ten years after the most horrific era it has ever known, the Fourth Age. Now, the multiverse is in the Fifth Age and attempting to rebuild what was lost. Explore the multiverse at your own risk and discover marvels that the ancient the Kin have left behind. Explore ruins of the now Martyred Gods. Meet fantastic races capable of warping time and space to their will.&lt;br/&gt;This is ADASTRA, where anything can, and has, happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This setting is an exercise in contradictions. It is a place where high magic meets super science and becomes something wholly new. It is a place where gods and mortals have both suffered much in the course of the Fourth Age, yet all move on for the promise of a brighter future for all.&lt;br/&gt;ADASTRA has a little of something for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the cosmos. Welcome to ADASTRA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contained within this book is everything you need to play in the&lt;br/&gt;ADASTRA setting, except for the 4e Core Rule Books by Wizards of the Coast.&lt;br/&gt;This book is filled with story and flavor information that will allow you to begin adventuring in this unique and imaginative setting. There is also a toolbox chapter to allow the DM to incorporate ADASTRA to their current games, or to start a game straight from here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
