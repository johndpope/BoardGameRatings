							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Pirate Island</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toys for the Sandbox is not a module, it is not a campaign setting, instead it is a framework for GMs to use to reinforce their own imaginations. Sometimes players zig when you expect them to zag, other times they take your plot point into a back alley and leave it penniless and bleeding. Each week we present a new location with a map and some flavor text. In addition we add 4 NPCs with a bit of history and a few simple thoughts on how to stat them for whatever game you are playing. There are also 6 plot hooks each with 3 ways to twist them. Added to that there is usually a table or two filled with rumors and encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a place where the water is warm and the sands white a small chain of islands, sand bars and coral reefs shelter an atoll that in turn shelters those pirates who agree to live by the rules of the Doge. This pirate island is a safe haven for almost every kind of sea-faring thug from privateers to freebooters. The pirates are not the first to lay claim to the island, those that have come and gone have all left their mark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
