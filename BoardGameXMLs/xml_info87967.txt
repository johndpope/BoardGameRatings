							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Memo Fantasy</name>
									
			<description>This is a memory-game for the very young.  10 stars cover 5 picture pairs in the sky. The first player picks up two stars and if the pictures underneath are the same the stars are kept.  If not, the stars go back into the sky.  Then the second player picks up two stars, etc.  Who will collect the most stars?  To play a NEW game there is the possibility to change the picture-plates underneath, fitting the colors, around the holes in the corners, to the same colors of the pegs.  There are two plates, printed on both sides, that give four different possibilities.  To add even more playing possibilities, there are 5 papers included for drawing, or gluing pictures or photos.  &lt;br/&gt;To practice before playing memo, you can start with a simple game, where you look for each pair.  One picture is covered with a star, who will find the same picture?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
