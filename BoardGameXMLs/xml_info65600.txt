							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blocks City</name>
									
			<description>You would think being a real-estate developer in this city would be easy, since there are only three building codes in the city. But nooo, you have to deal with the other real-estate developers trying to take over your buildings, an Arsonist that would love to see one of your buildings burn to the ground and that pesky Building Inspector that just seems to either waste your time or make you redo the work you have already done. But despite all that, it is worth it once you get that nice tall building overlooking the park completed. Blocks City is a three dimensional game. Players use their blocks to build the city, your goal is to score the most prestige points at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
