			<description>On 3 May 2007, an expansion named &amp;quot;Napoleon's Ambition&amp;quot; was announced by Paradox. It was officially released on 22 August 2007, on GamersGate. The Windows version of the expansion is available as a download from GamersGate or as part of the Europa Universalis III Complete retail package, and aims to expand on EUIII, with an improved interface, enhanced trade system, expanded options, and greater content to cover the extended time period.  Virtual Programming published the Napoleon's Ambition expansion pack for Mac OS X on 7 December 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the features of Napoleon's Ambition include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The timeline has been expanded by 33 years to 1820, encompassing the French Revolution and Napoleon.&lt;br/&gt;    * New leaders, rulers, advisor wars, countries and national ideas have been added as well as dozens of new units to give more tactical choices.&lt;br/&gt;    * In addition to hundreds of new events, players will be able to see their rulers, leaders and advisors appear on the accurate historical dates.&lt;br/&gt;    * A ledger has been added displaying information on colonies and leaders, and a detailed trade map for each province has been added.&lt;br/&gt;    * The new option to move capitals enables the player to focus more on certain areas of his nation. Also, centres of trade can now be added or removed.&lt;br/&gt;    * Players are able to select a trading centre to be concentrated on; the game will then automatically focus on the centre. Also, players must now engage in diplomacy or war to send merchants to overseas markets.&lt;br/&gt;    * More options have been added, enabling customisation of gameplay. Players now have options for &amp;quot;No Inflation&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Free Colonization&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;AI Aggressiveness&amp;quot; and many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Europa Universalis III&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
