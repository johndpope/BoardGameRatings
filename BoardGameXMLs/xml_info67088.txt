			<description>From the Back of the Box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join your friends in a thrilling, exciting and fun race through Rock'n Reptiles.  Simplified play for young children with easy to follow instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns spinning a coloured spinner and moving their playing piece to the closest space with the colour shown (very much like Candyland).  When a player first passes one of the eight marked locations, they take the corresponding location card.  There is only one card for each location.  The player with the most location cards by the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
