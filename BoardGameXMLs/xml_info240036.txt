							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1366: A Medieval Oddity (2nd Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1366 is a medieval genre role-playing game. It is by no means intended to be an authentic recreation of medieval life, but could be said to have some of the flavour of realism, whilst still very much being a fantasy game.! 1366 doesn't have many of the typical features of a fantasy role playing game, such as elves, orcs, or wizards hurling spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Likewise, 1366 is not about the usual subject matter of medieval games, the knights, nobles and so on. However, readers will hopefully appreciate that the game contains a unique perspective, in that some of its' focus is on the grotesque, strange and disquieting aspects of medieval life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
