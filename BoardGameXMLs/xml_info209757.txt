							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">You are standing in a cave...</name>
									
			<description>Author Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... you do not know how you got here. The last thing you remember is going out to eat at a fancy restaurant. Perhaps you were drugged. Perhaps you had a bad case of food poisoning and wandered off, feverish, into the outskirts of town. Whatever the case may be, you are here now. Wherever here is. And you want to leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game started as a VGG PbF game, which can be found here: You are standing in a cave... and was later turned into a true IF game for the 2016 IF Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
