			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This kid-friendly on-rails &amp;quot;shooter&amp;quot; is all about taking pictures of cartoony underwater creatures. The gamer controls an aspiring underwater photographer who is assisting a professor. You must follow the path laid out by the professor and take pictures of all the creatures that you come across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is single player only. There are 5 levels that take place in a coral reef, a ship graveyard, the deep sea, the &amp;quot;abyss,&amp;quot; and an underwater volcano. Each area features 12 creatures to locate and photograph. Your objective is to take pictures that score a &amp;quot;three star&amp;quot; rating. To achieve this rating the animal must be centered, zoomed in to show detail, and displaying its personality. You can elicit a display by throwing a &amp;quot;gizmo&amp;quot; at the creature. The gamer will need to play through each level multiple times because certain creatures only come out at specific times of the day, three play-throughs of a level unlocks a &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; creature, and there are hidden Golden Seashells to discover in each level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
