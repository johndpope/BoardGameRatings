							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Great Starship Names</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great Starship Names is a resource for referees and players of sci-fi roleplaying games and wargames. Many scenarios will involve a sudden encounter with a starship, perhaps a military patrol cruiser, a cargo hauler or a scout ship ... naming these ships off-the-cuff can prove problematic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here we present ten random tables each using d66, that is two six-sided dice, one rolled as &amp;lsquo;tens&amp;rsquo; the other as &amp;lsquo;units&amp;rsquo;. The tables break down ship names neatly into commercial, private or military. Military ship names come in two flavours, traditional, taking a cue from naval vessels of modern Earth, while &amp;lsquo;epic&amp;rsquo; names conjure up the imperial battleships and fighting craft of Warhammer 40K, Dune and Fading Suns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial starship names also come in two flavours, those of the large commercial carriers, the freight liners and passenger ships, as well as the ubiquitous free traders whose naming conventions tend to the unorthodox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally we have two tables presenting private starships such as yachts, personal cruisers, interplanetary shuttles and so on, and we present a table of names for exploration and scout ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Page 3: Military/Traditional (1 &amp;amp; 2)&lt;br/&gt;Page 4: Military/Epic (1 &amp;amp; 2)&lt;br/&gt;Page 5: Commercial/Corporate (1 &amp;amp; 2)&lt;br/&gt;Page 6: Commercial/Free Traders and Exploration&lt;br/&gt;Page 7: Private (1 &amp;amp; 2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
