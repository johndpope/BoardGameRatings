			<description>Like Charades combined with Trivial Pursuit, in Minute Mime 2-4 teams compete to guess quotes, movie titles, book titles etc acted out by a person on each team, before the one-minute sand-timer runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like Trivial Pursuit, teams throw a dice and move around a board and land on squares that indicate which category of action they'll have to perform. They draw a card, select an actor and the timer is started!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Categories include Sayings, Books, Movies, Songs ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the defunct board-game arm of the Australian greeting card company John Sands, this game appears to be long since out of print, and many of the popular culture references in the game are dated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
