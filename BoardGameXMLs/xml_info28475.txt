							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vegas Nite Bingo</name>
									
			<description>Vegas Nite Bingo is played with a 56 card deck.  Each card has a bingo letter and three numbers.  The object is to play cards in front of you that spell BINGO.  All players are dealt five cards.  One player begins as the caller and turns over the top card in the deck.  She then choses one of the three numbers on that card and &amp;quot;calls&amp;quot; that number.  For instance O-43.  Any players who have cards that match that number can play them in front of them and draw a new card.  The caller does have a hand and can choose the number to call based on their cards.  Play proceeds until a FREE card is drawn.  When this happens the caller plays it as her own and any other FREE card is discarded, the deck then moves to the player on the left and they become the caller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
