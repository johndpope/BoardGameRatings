			<description>From the publishers description: Who wouldnt own a really nice farm. With cow and horse, tractor, house and barn etc. Everyone can win these in this game. Guessing and luck with the dice will lead to victory. Who first gets a farm by dice rolls wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a roll and move game. Twelve cards for each player are shuffled and put on the board. Clockwise the players roll and move their pawns according the die roll. Sometimes they get to take a card, sometimes they must get rid of a card, and sometimes they challenge the other player. Challenging means putting the die in one hand and then the player guesses which hand. Correct guesses give the player a card, false guesses make him lose a card. The first player to have 7 (out of 12 per player) cards has a full farm and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
