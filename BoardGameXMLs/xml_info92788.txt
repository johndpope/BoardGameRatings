			<description>author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highlander: The Gathering, often referred to as H:tG, is a net.supplement which incorporates Highlander-style Immortals into White Wolf's World of Darkness. It was first released by Hank Driskill in September 1993, and a Second Edition, developed by John Gavigan in conjunction with Hank, was published in June 1994. It is generally acknowledged as the best and most successful net.supplement ever produced, having been downloaded by thousands of users, and even translated into French! The internet roleplaying community now generally accepts Immortals as a part of the World of Darkness, even if White Wolf does not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the moment, we are working on a Third Edition of the rules, which will update the rules to reflect new developments in both Highlander and the World of Darkness, and will add a wealth of new material which, we hope, will add greatly to the playability of Immortals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
