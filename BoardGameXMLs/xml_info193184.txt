			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpellForge was a community-build electronic character sheet for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 3.5 Edition.  The product received regular updates, particularly as new errata, updates, and source books were released for the game.  The product was released as an XLS and, later, XLSX workbook for Microsoft Excel.  Versions were also released for Open Office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product allowed spell-casting and psionic characters of all classes to create and print a spell listing including significant play data such as saving throws, ranges, damage, and so forth.  The final release of the product was version 4.5.0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
