							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Leben in Paderborn</name>
									
			<description>A simple game published by the German City of Paderborn. By playing the players get to know a little bit about the city and its shops.&lt;br/&gt;During each players' turn they roll a six-sided dice to move along a game-board depicting a map of Paderborn. At certain spaces players can acquire cards of the shops or they can go sightseeing by following the instructions on the back of the card. Sometimes there is only information written, sometimes you have to pay an amount of money or at other times you may earn some cash.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last player reaches the finish space with his playing piece. The winner is the person who has acquired the most sightseeing and/or shop cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
