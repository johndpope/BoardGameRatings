							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ITN News at Ten: the Game</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The aim of the game is to be the first player to travel the world and put together the ITN News at Ten Program  by collecting stories in each of six categories and returning to ITN House in London. The categories are Current Affairs Home, Current Affairs Abroad, Royal, Human Interest, Sports and &amp;quot;...And Finally&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To collect a story players have to collect a headline card, a picture card and a story card which the majority of other players consider satisfies the category. But beware, other players can stop your story with a &amp;quot;Commercial Break&amp;quot; or a story can be stolen with an &amp;quot;Editor Card&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: It's actually spin-and-move, not roll-and-move, but they're functionally identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
