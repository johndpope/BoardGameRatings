							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Unnaturals</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're everywhere, and nowhere. They're the shadows that come with the sunset, and that funny feeling you get when you know someone's watching, but see nothing when you turn around. They're the things that hide from you - and the things you bolt your door against. They're everything your mother warned you about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They're the Unnaturals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meet the 'Monsters' of Marl, and learn a lesson in fear. Hear them tell you in their own words what it means to be other, adn hear from experts on the deadly and the demonic. From the heart of the cities to the depths of the Wilderness, meet the 'Shifters, the Breeds, the Demons, the Undead and the things so alien no one knows just what to call them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each entry includes statisitics and descriptions for these creatures, who can be the enmies of your characters - or the unlives of the adventuring party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Unnaturals is a supplement intended for use with the Bloodshadows game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
