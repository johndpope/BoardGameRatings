			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Fane - a 3.5 OGL fantasy adventure for 5th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Fane has stood as a brooding monument overlooking the old mountain path between the village of Mazula and Olthorn for a thousand years. Once home to Fane, a powerful wizard who made war on the people of south and wreaked his terror upon them, he was eventually defeated and trapped in his tower. A terrible curse was put upon that place - that he should never again walk upon the lands of Arrasia and would remain locked in his tower for all eternity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mount Fane looms, its snow covered, treacherous peak rearing ominously into the sky above. At last, the fabled Tower of Fane is near and the final showdown with whatever lurks within is now at hand. Now is the time to put the ancient stories to the test and discover the truth behind the myth of Fane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tower of Fane is part 3 in The Last Mage of Mount Fane trilogy, though can be played as an independent, stand alone adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- a 3.5 OGL fantasy adventure for 5th level characters by Keith Robinson&lt;br/&gt;- illustrated by Gillian Pearce and Danilo Moretti&lt;br/&gt;- cover art by Anne Stokes&lt;br/&gt;- cartography by Keith Robinson&lt;br/&gt;- 66 pages, including 20 illustrations, 10 maps, and a bonus trilogy map!&lt;br/&gt;- fully bookmarked PDF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
