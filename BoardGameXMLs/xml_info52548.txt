			<description>A campaign for the RPG Capes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back:&lt;br/&gt;The time has come to INVADE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super-Heroes have their undeniable dark side.  they are, after all, enforcing virtue through delivering savage beatings to law-breakers.  It would take only the least step further to become the worst sorts of dictators: Unbeatable ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine a world where the greatest superheroes decided to stop asking people to live up to their example, and to start insisting...a world in which villians were not bound for comfy jail cells, but for shallow graves, and in which all the ravages of totalitarianism were wrapped in gaily-colored skin-tight spandex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stop imagining:  It's not our world, but it's the one right next door and it's dropped by for a not-so-neighborly visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasion from Earth Prime is a supplement providing characters and a setting with which to weave scenarios for the Capes super rolep[laying system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
