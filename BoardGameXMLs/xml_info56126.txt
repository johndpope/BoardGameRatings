			<description>Based on the game concept of Circulus, in this game players use 9 dice to form a kind of snake. With this they wiggle around on the game board, taking away one or multiple dice on one and and adding them to the other. Then they try to circle the trophies which are placed on the board beforehand. &lt;br/&gt;The players roll six (neutral) dice and can use them for their movements. They can use a die result to move a corresponding snake die, add two dice to move a snake die or divide a result to move two snake dice (but not use two results to move two snake dice with the same sum). Every time they claim a trophy, they can reduce their snake by one die, making it faster and more flexible that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
