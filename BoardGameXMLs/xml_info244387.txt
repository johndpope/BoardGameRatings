			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While inspecting his prize pumpkin patch, Mr. Greensleeves becomes aware of a flock of strange critters hovering in the sky above.  Without warning small groups begin to leave the formation and dive in order to knock him down and steal the fruits of his labour.  Armed only with a revolver, he must now defend his crop against this new blight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will guide Greensleves in his courageous effort to save the patch.  Run or crouch in order to avoid the swooping menace, and attempts to exterminate the critters before they can loot the entire crop.  Most important, once a pumpkin is stolen, destroy the thief before he can reach the flock - or his prize will be your loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critters requires a minimum of 8K memory expansion and is controlled with your VIC-20 joystick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
