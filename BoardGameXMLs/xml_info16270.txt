			<description>Aoste-Gare-de-l&amp;rsquo;Est, December 31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While waking up (at about 8pm), Lulu and D&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute; decide to go to the party in the village hall of Saint-Andre-le-Gaz. They intend to get there before Nono and Kiki, who also go out only at 8pm because they were playing Playstation all the afternoon&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4 characters go through the countryside, at feet or by train, trying to get to the village hall but on the way long, they may meet pals. Those never fail to invite our guys to drink a glass of beer, or to smoke weed. They never refuse an invitation (they&amp;rsquo;re no beasts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, each one will be careful not to arrive too drunk at the festival in order to have a chance of getting chicks&amp;hellip; It would also be better to bring flowers but as all the florists are closed down at this time, it will be necessary to find some on the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
