			<description>Sport pilots compete in various disciplines. They take off from the start (base) airport and fly to the target airport. On their way they can land on 3 auxiliary airfields. On each of the airfield they can take a cargo: flyers, paratroopers or chemicals. They transport the load to a certain place and drop it from the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every successful delivered load brings one point. Each player has 3 aircraft. Every plane that successfully reach airport also brings one point. The winner is the player who ends up with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. Vertices of these triangles are points at which the players hold position and move figurines by the number rolled on dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
