			<description>For Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the PDF introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further Information Regarding Abyssal Topics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loremasters and other scholarly folk always seek information to fill the gaps of their knowledge. With luck and skill, they can discover knowledge that some find useful, but they sometimes find that others believe that the lore they pursue would be best forgotten eternally. The passages below fall into the former category for many who must deal with Abyssal topics in their research and their journeys. Why not take a look and make your own decision on the subjects discussed, though? What harm could it do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With great pride, we present the &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; sections of the Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss. Use the knowledge contained within these entries in good health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Laghathti&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; The Woeful Escarand&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; Additional Layers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document consisted of three separate hyper-linked webpage documents. These documents could be downloaded as a set of three PDFs titled; Laghathi, The Woeful Escarand and Additional Layers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
