			<description>French Rails is a Print and Play map in the crayon rails series of games.  Players receive demand cards where cities want different goods.  These goods and cities are scattered across the map, and the players must construct track by drawing on the board to connect the cities with the goods they demand.  Each demand card has three different deliveries on it, and players much decide which demands work best together so they can optimize both movement and track building.  Money is very tight at the beginning of the game as the payouts do not completely cover the cost of track, so players must slowly build a network that they can use repeatedly to generate enough cash to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
