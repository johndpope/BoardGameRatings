			<description>Check out the new look and feel of Microsoft Solitaire Collection on Windows 10!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Klondike This version is the timeless classic that many people just call &amp;quot;Solitaire.&amp;quot; Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spider Eight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FreeCell Use four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TriPeaks Select cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pyramid Pair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daily Challenges Players receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Club Even more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose Your Theme The Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot; to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xbox Live Integration Sign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.
