			<description>The realm is defended, but the sword of protection is broken!  The king has called on the best Swordcrafters to forge a replacement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Swordcrafters, players compete to forge the best sword scoring based on length, quality, and magic.  Each round each player makes one cut in a grid of sword tiles to create a separation.  After separations phase, each player selects one grouping of sword tiles and assembles them into their sword.   When there are not enough sword tiles to form a new grid, scoring occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players hold their swords in the center of the table to score based on length.  Sword quality scoring is based on the highest number of adjacent matching gems on one side of the sword.  Sword magic scoring is based on the highest sum of two gem types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A innovative 3D sword-building game where the player builds and holds their sword as they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
