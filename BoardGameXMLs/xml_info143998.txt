							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hobgoblins: Blood, Iron and Honor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of races of savage humanoids that populate the lower echelons of the challenge rating scale, each of which have their own small twist of flavor. Sadly, due to underdevelopment, most of these racial designs end up falling flat, a study in culture and story design with little in the way of crunch and game mechanics to back them up. The hobgoblins are no exception to this. As such the intent of this product is to give them the archetypes and design options required to make them mechanically distinct from other races and give them a characteristic feel that brings about racial recognition from a gameplay standpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proud and militaristic, hobgoblin society functions on the concept of obligation intermingled with fear. No hobgoblin truly trusts the other and knows that even his lowliest subordinate is likely harboring dreams of assassination and appropriation of privileges, but the race as a whole is hardwired to work faithfully for those of higher station even with such a menace in society's background. Given the absolute lowest of the low is the ranks of slaves taken by the hobgoblins as they raid and pillage, the system works simply because every hobgoblin always has somebody to vent on and a dead slave really isn't a big deal. There's always tomorrow's raid, after all. This raises the first point that has been worked into Hobgoblins: Blood, Iron, and Honor. Hobgoblins take slaves; as such, hobgoblins specialized in the acquisition and direction of slaves need to be present. The following archetypes fill the roles of slave acquisition and direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
