			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness in the Heart of the Forest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generations ago, a fearful battle between raged in the depths of the Westwood. An entire tribe of forest elves gave up its very existence to turn back the rising tide of evil. Despite their noble sacrifice, a fragment of evil remained, and has now begun to awaken, drawing allies both old and new and transforming the Westwood into a place of fear and darkness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Wrongs to be Righted&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the past lies forgotten and a settlement of innocent humans has sprung up near the old battleground. Little do the inhabitants of Tanner's Green suspect that a remnant of the old enemy has returned, and that its followers plot their downfall. Creatures of unspeakable evil lurk in the dark shadows of the forest, and only a small band of adventurers can find and stop them before the enemy rises once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demonheart is mini-campaign for 3-5 player characters, beginning at levels 6-8 and rising to levels 10-12, with adventures that range from intrigue in the town of Tanner's Green to a life-or-death contest in the court of the king of the dark fey, all leading to a final confrontation with the ancient enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terror grows with each beat of the Demonheart. Can the adventurers stop it in time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
