			<description>A 2 or more player card game where players discuss who is &amp;quot;The One&amp;quot; that bests fits the personality trait on top most card.  All players must agree as no one card can be shared.  This process of revealing a card and then discussing which player best fits that personality trait is repeated until the stack is emptied.  Scores are added and the player with the most points is the winner or &amp;quot;The One&amp;quot;.  There is no limit as to the amount of cards any one player can receive and cards are assigned positive and negative values depending on the personality trait depicted.   The game itself is the size of regular deck of cards with cartoon images depicting the various personality traits.   It is best played with 4 or more players to an average time of 30-45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
