			<description>from the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONCE YOU PASS THE GATE, THERE'S NO TURNING BACK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cities of the Kingdoms of Kalamar campaign setting are filled with wonder, beauty, luxury, delights, danger and intrigue.  In them, you can buy and sell wares, learn necessary skills to further your chances of survival, and perhaps even delve into the deepest mysteries of faith or magic.  Here too, you can explore the wildest of fantasies or be confronted by the most unthinkable of nightmares.  Yes, a city sojourn can be one of solace, comfort and pleasurable luxuries, or it may hold great treachery and cunning deceit.  In the cities, life is cheap, and a few coins may buy, sell or mercilessly destroy a life.  Remember to keep alert, think and act fast, and always watch your back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is loaded with various city maps perfect for any fantasy campaign, and each includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Easy-To-Use Quick Reference Demographics!  Whether you need the geographical location, population, races, religious tendencies or mode of government, each city gives you all the basic information you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Vast metropolises, colonies, city-states, cities and towns of all shapes and sizes!  No matter if you're looking for an isolated country town or a huge, thriving city, it exists here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Nonhuman cities!  Visit an elven city of the deep forest, a mountainous dwarven citadel, the religious and political capitals of a hobgoblin empire, and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Open-ended city construction!  Each city functions as a blank template for a DM's campaign, or a cartographer's rendering for player handouts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although usable in any campaign, the maps in this book are especially suited for the Kingdoms of Kalamar - a realistic, dynamic world where complex political alliances mix with marauding bands of humanoids, and medieval technology and culture come face to face with magic and the fantastic.  Whatever type of adventure you seek, you can find it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
