							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BLOCKCHAIN: The Cryptocurrency Game</name>
									
			<description>A high-risk, underground movement has started a new economy free from corruption and manipulation. This new world uses cryptocurrency, a financial system based on secure, anonymous exchange and decentralization. This is where you are at the center of your money &amp;ndash; mining, trading, and storing digital coins. But where there is hope, there is hacking. How will you protect your fortune on the blockchain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BLOCKCHAIN is a 2-4 player strategic action-based card game featuring some of the most captivating aspects of cryptocurrency. You&amp;rsquo;ll mine for opportunities, trade coins based on changing exchange values, and store coins based on your powerful Block cards. The goal is to collect 10 of each type of coin (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, and Peercoin) in cold storage, but the challenge requires some mischievous maneuvers. Learn how to hack or be hacked during every player&amp;rsquo;s turn, disrupting the entire game strategy. Demonstrate how your clever planning, good timing, and modish moxie will fill your Vault first!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
