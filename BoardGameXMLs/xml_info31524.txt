							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Insel der Piraten</name>
									
			<description>As a pirate, it is your objective to capture enemy or neutral vessels and islands, thus obtaining gold to outfit or improve your own ship. The ultimate goal is to conquer the &amp;quot;Island of Pirates&amp;quot;, which gives this game its name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the goal, the players can explore the seas surrounding the fabled island, always having at least one watchful eye of the look out at the opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, every ship is outfitted with five cannons of a given firepower. Both numbers can be increased using upgrades. However, not only the equipment is deciding a battle, the proficiency and luck of the crew manning the guns is important, too. This is represented by the dice rolls being made in combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains:&lt;br/&gt; -  1 map, the board&lt;br/&gt; -  7 leaves of gaming money&lt;br/&gt; -  1 die&lt;br/&gt; - 16 figurines&lt;br/&gt; -  1 rulebook&lt;br/&gt; - 20 combat resolution sheets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
