			<description>From the inlay (Play It Again Sam 7 version):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many have tried to rescue the power jewels from the creepy mansion on top of the hill. None has lived to tell the tale. Now it's up to you to try to wrest the treasure from the mansion's deadly inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Run through the Spectres' Lair, Horrid Hall, the Spider's Parlour and Death Tower. Leap over the poison-smeared spikes, scamper along the moving platforms and contracting floorboards, run past bouncing spiders, and use the powerful springs to propel you onto overhanging platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghouls is an unusual mix of Pac-Man and a Manic Miner style platformer played over four screens. The player controls what looks like Pac Man on legs, and has to avoid various enemies on single-screen platform levels. Like Pac-Man, points are scored by collecting yellow pellets. Also reminiscent of Pac-Man, eating a power-pellet causes the ghosts to disappear for a short time, but they cannot be eaten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first BBC Model B release was published under the Program Power name. All other releases were under the Micro Power name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits (BBC Micro / Electron release):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Author: David J. Hoskins&lt;br/&gt;Loading Screen Design: Michael Hutchison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
