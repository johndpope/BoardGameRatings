							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Anno Domini: Gesundheit und Ern√§hrung</name>
									
			<description>Each Anno Domini set consists of 336 cards, with a description of a historical event on one side of the card, and the year (and sometimes specific date) in which it happened on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&lt;br/&gt;If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&amp;rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&amp;rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Set &amp;quot;Anno Domini - Gesundheit und Ern&amp;auml;hrung &amp;quot; contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Anno Domini series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
