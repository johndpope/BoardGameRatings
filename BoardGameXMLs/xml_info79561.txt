			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Take charge of Charlie and Smiley as they set out to stop Captain Pincock from taking over Wani Wani World - the world of crocodiles. The games is a vertically scrolling platformer in the vein of Rainbow Islands. Your crocodile is armed with a hammer with which he can destroy and re-create the blocks that make up the platforms of the levels. Make your way safely to the top of the level destroying the many enemies, by trapping them in holes you create and knocking them through, as you go. There are various power ups available such as speed ups, bowling balls and the all important hammer power up which allows you to destroy more blocks in a row.&lt;br/&gt;In two player mode you can also trap/ beat up your fellow player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
