							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vile Witch</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the fringes of the civilized world lie things wishing for the way things were... before. In the dark days prior to the dawn of the humanoid races, it was kill or be killed. And survival of the fittest was the only rule of law. Back then, the shadows swelled with terrifying beasts using anything they could to spread the taint of fear to every dark corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those things are still out there. Plotting. Planning. Scheming. Struggling to find a foothold in the light of day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From that darkness, Vile Witches have emerged to spread their particularly nasty form of corruption to the world. And they have come to stay... They may live in the refuse of a civilized world, but they are far from powerless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vile Witch is the first new class for Mazes &amp;amp; Perils - a nasty new spellcaster out to spread their particular brand of sickness to those who cross their paths. Vile Witches or Warlocks have the power to make your PCs want to see their local healer and bathe regularly!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 14-page supplement (9 pages of content) offers a fully formed class you can play as a PC or NPC in a Mazes &amp;amp; Perils campaign - complete with new abilities, nearly 20 spells, and rules for Familiars you can use with other wizard classes as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She is only the first of a few new classes we have planned for M&amp;amp;P, so keep an eye out to see what else we have in store for you to play with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
