							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wings of Glory: World War 2 â€“ Nakajima Ki-84 Hayate</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nakajima Ki-84 &amp;ldquo;Hayate&amp;rdquo; was a single-seat fighter used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force during World War II. Nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Frank&amp;rdquo; by the Allies, the Ki-84 had excellent performance and high maneuverability, and was considered to be the best Japanese fighter to see large scale operations during World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was able to match any Allied fighter, and to intercept the high-flying B-29 Superfortresses, and its powerful armament increased its lethality. Great pilots that gloriously piloted this aircraft included Kenji Fujimoto and Takeshi Imoto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. Larger maneuver cards (63 x 88 mm) are included with this model, to handle the fast movement of this airplane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
