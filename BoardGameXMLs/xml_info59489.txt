							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Friend &amp; Foe: The Gnomes and Kobolds of Tellene</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gnomes and kobolds have hated each other for ages &amp;ndash; now learn why. This 160-page PDF supplement contains detailed information on the kobolds and gnomes of Tellene, including history, culture, religion, social structure, subraces, and more! Designed for D&amp;amp;D&amp;reg; v3.5, this supplement is an invaluable resource on all things gnome and kobold, and usable by players and Dungeon Masters&amp;reg; in any campaign setting. Remember, being small doesn't mean you can't think big!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GNOMES: This section is nothing short of a player&amp;rsquo;s guide to gnomes, providing everything you wanted to know about their culture, as well as providing an in-depth look at playing a gnome. For those of you interested more in the game mechanics of this race, there are new feats and prestige classes. For others, the wealth of background information will enable them to bring their characters to life in a unique culture.&lt;br/&gt;The gnome section is broken down into three key chapters, one for each sub-race. Certain aspects of gnomes are very similar to all the sub-races. As such, rock gnomes are treated as the base race, with only the differences highlighted in the forest and deep gnome chapters. Each chapter in turn is broken down into several sections, with each section covering a single aspect of gnome daily life.&lt;br/&gt;Section One explores the physical and mental make-up of gnomes.&lt;br/&gt;Section Two explains gnome social structure, detailing the social strata and providing a close look at how gnome communities function.&lt;br/&gt;Section Three covers gnome culture, looking at every aspect of their wondrous society.&lt;br/&gt;Section Four is dedicated to warfare and details unit organization, weapons and armor, and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;Section Five expands on the gnome religious beliefs, detailing their deities, ceremonies, and beliefs.&lt;br/&gt;Section Six looks at misconceptions of gnomes and the truth behind some of the more common fables.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the gnome book are two sections covering the crunchy bits. The first section gives the player everything he needs to know about playing a gnome, as well as new feats and prestige classes suited to the race. The second provides the DM with ready-to-use statistics for a variety of gnome archetypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KOBOLDS: As a sourcebook, this section is designed for both players and DMs alike. Players will find a wealth of information for playing kobold characters, with new feats, prestige classes, spells, and magic items for their characters to wield &amp;ndash; enough information to give them as much depth as any of the standard races. DMs can use the same information to move kobolds up the ladder from &amp;ldquo;cute little monsters&amp;rdquo; to major threat, giving players a chance to learn the truth about these long neglected creatures through role-playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Section One details the history of the kobolds, from their origins to the present day.&lt;br/&gt;Section Two explores the physical and mental make-up of kobolds.&lt;br/&gt;Section Three explains kobold social structure, looking at how a clan is governed, and the dynamics of the tribe.&lt;br/&gt;Section Four covers the kobold culture, looking at every aspect of this unique and often neglected aspect of kobolds, including their use of alchemy.&lt;br/&gt;Section Five is dedicated to warfare and details unit organization, weapons and armor, and tactics.&lt;br/&gt;Section Six expands on the kobold religious beliefs, detailing their belief in ancestor worship and their ceremonies and beliefs.&lt;br/&gt;Section Seven looks at misconceptions of kobolds and the truth behind some of the more common beliefs.&lt;br/&gt;Section Eight gives the player everything he needs to know about playing a kobold, as well as new feats, spells, and prestige classes. &lt;br/&gt;Section Nine is a bestiary, providing a list of standard kobold adversaries ready for instant use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
