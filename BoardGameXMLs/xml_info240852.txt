			<description>Goal of the game: You are a Political Party trying to control the 3 Branches of the Government. First control the States (Legislature). Next control the Supreme Court (Judicial). Then control the Presidency (Executive).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll and move to collect (purchase) States which increase the number of votes you receive towards the 280 required to win the game. When you control all the States of a Territory, you can start to add Support which will increase the income level for any State in that Territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control the Supreme Court by appointing 5 of the 9 Supreme Court Justices. Appointment is scaled with the first requiring 50 votes and $500K, the 2nd 100 votes, 3rd 150 votes, 4th 200 votes and the 5th and final 250 or more votes. $500k must be paid in each case. Justices can be removed if your vote total drops below the required amount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controlling the Presidency requires 280 votes, 5 Justices and pay  Five Million dollars to the bank. This is how you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
