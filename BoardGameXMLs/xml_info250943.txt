			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Double Team: Anaconda VS Prophet provides two characters for your Super-Powered by M&amp;amp;M games: a villain, Anaconda, and a hero, Prophet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anaconda was a brilliant scientist in the employ of A.E.G.I.S. until an encounter with a rampaging experiment gone wrong transformed him into a snake man. He now seeks to wipe out or transform humanity so that reptiles may rule the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prophet was once a well-known hero, now homeless and anonymously living on the streets. No matter how he tries to hide from the horrors of his past (and future), trouble always seems to find him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character is accompanied by three adventure ideas to make it easier to work them into your game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
