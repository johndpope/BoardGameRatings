			<description>In Journey's End, players take on the persona of an adventurer traveling in search of Glory and Treasure.  The players journey together along the road, but vie for valor and the recognition of their peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey's End uses a system of skills collected from different decks, each represented by the back of a card.  Meanwhile, the card fronts represent locations along the road traveled, detailing the Quests, Places, and Events the adventurers encounter.  Only a portion of these cards are used each game, providing Journey's End with a multitude of game scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game hinges on how players allocate their skills during each round of play.  Chief among them are several types of bidding wars, where the adventurer who shows the most skill can complete a Quest or take advantage of an Event.  Players who feel like they're falling behind can gain new skills or compete over the game's namesake, the Journey's End card.  Ultimately, the adventurer with the most Valor at the end of the game can claim victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey's End provides the genesis of play popular in a deck-builder, but dispenses with the solitary nature of these games.  With healthy doses of resource management, bidding, and planning, players can enjoy a quick game with all the complexities of larger and longer games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
