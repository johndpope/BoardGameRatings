			<description>Go Oink or moo, or cock-a-doodle-doo. You make the sound of the animal pictured on your card in order to ask other players if they have the animal you are requesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player has the animal you are requesting, they must give you all of those cards. Otherwise, that player says Go Oink and you take the top card from the draw pile. If you draw the card you asked for, take another turn. Otherwise, play passes to the left.  Whenever you have three matching animal cards, place them in a pile in front of you. These cards are safe from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when any player gets rid of all card in their hands or when the draw pile runs out. The player with the most sets (3 of the same animal) wins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's like Go Fish, but a little sillier and louder. If you enjoy acting like an animal, you'll go wild over this card game. The cards come in a big pig storage case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
