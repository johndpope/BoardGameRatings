							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Epistolary Rules</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;This is the full ruleset for the free RPG &amp;quot;Epistolary.&amp;quot; Epistolary is a narrative RPG that is designed to be played by 2 or 3 people using email, play-by-forum, or any other medium that is asynchronous and turn-based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play is based on creating a work of fiction in the style of an Epistolary novel...which is a story that is created through the collection of various 1st-person notes, letters, and journal entries, combined with other historical research. There is no sense of an omniscient narrator, or explaining what your character is doing. Instead, you create journal entries in the voice of your character, re-telling the events of the day through his or her eyes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
