							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Advanced V.G. 2</name>
									
			<description>Variable Geo (ヴァリアブル・ジオ?), also known as V.G., is a Japanese 2D fighting game series developed and published by Giga for home computers. It was also developed and published by Technical Group Labroratory (TGL) for home game consoles. It focuses on an all-female martial arts competition where participants are required to promote various family restaurants by acting as waitresses when not fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced V.G 2 introduces the following characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Tamao Mitsurugi (御剣珠緒, Mitsurugi Tamao?) is a young girl who dreams of one day being like her idol, Yuka Takeuchi. To that end, she has tirelessly spent her spare time practicing amateur Karate and attempting to copy Yuka's various techniques. She somehow gained the ability to control her energy before her fourteenth birthday. Much like Yuka, Tamao is hard working, honest, and generally outgoing, which allows her to make friends easily. However, she is clumsy, forgetful, and tends to act before thinking things through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Kyoko Kirishima is a member of one of the Masuda clan's branch families and Chiho's distant cousin. She is sent to compete under orders to either force Chiho back into the clan or kill her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Variable Geo&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
