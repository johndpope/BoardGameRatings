							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bindle Rails Expansion #3: Eastern Canada, Denver and Rio Grande and Emerald Isle</name>
									
			<description>From the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available Now For Print and Play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is now available for Bindle Rails and combines elements from the original Bindle Rails with some of the map building aspects of the first expansion.  Resources and Engines are new to the mix.  Research the latest locomotive designs to reach deposits of iron ore or carry grain and lumber to build your empire in the Great White North!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three maps are included with this expansion.  Eastern Canada will have you building routes out from Toronto and choosing to cross the border or building west to Thunder Bay for precious iron deposits.  If you are looking for a challenge, try the Denver and Rio Grande map - the distance between destinations is great and the terrain is difficult.  For a more relaxed railroad experience, try your skill at Ireland where you can build ports and bring in goods from other countries.  Build your rails across the island to victory! &lt;br/&gt;In addition to downloading and printing the PDF's, you will need 27 Event Cards from the original Bindle Rails game as well as most of the cubes.  If you need to print out cards for the expansion, please refer to the main game page to direct you to the PDF that will allow you to print the cards.  The Goal Cards and Manager cards are not used in this variant.  Mats are included for tracking your company worth, resource values and engine roster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future versions will include upgrades for artwork to mats and rule changes if required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
