			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The top sports stars receive many income opportunities. Players sign deals, receive awards, and lead their sports in categories that help and hurt their earning potential. Poor performance in their sport reduces the next contract offer sheet. The wrong endorsement deal can ruin an image and cause a player to miss out on millions of dollars. Now, the average fan has the opportunity to make money like the best athletes around today. Play Billion Dollar Player to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;             From the games website, doesn't look like this game is in print anymore. (March 2007)&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
