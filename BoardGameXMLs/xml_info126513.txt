							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Villager</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon World is full of kings and armies, beasts and monsters, mystery and magic. Of course that&amp;rsquo;s all far away from here, where you had the ill luck to be born. Here, life is plain and only the seasons change. Here, everyone knows you and you know everyone. Here you work hard, get into trouble, and share in both the bounty and the hardships of a simple, boring life. But unlike everyone else, you have dreams&amp;mdash;big dreams. After all, those kings need to shower riches upon somebody, and those monsters aren&amp;rsquo;t going to slay themselves! Maybe this year, after the turnip harvest, you&amp;rsquo;ll finally answer the call to adventure&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to Use This Playbook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Villager is a &amp;ldquo;level zero&amp;rdquo; playbook, depicting very inexperienced teens about to have transformative adventures that will catapult them into a life of heroism and riches. You can use this playbook in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;     For a low-powered one-shot, where the most mundane threats become epic.&lt;br/&gt;     As a way to build an adventuring party from the ground up, with organic Bonds with one another.&lt;br/&gt;     As an avenue for a new character to join an established adventuring party (in the village recuperating from some daring exploit, no doubt) as a bumpkin, servant, or parasite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
