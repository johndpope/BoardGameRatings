			<description>At the beginning the game board is filled with all 9 pegs.  Now one player after the other takes his turn and rolls the dice.  The player throwing the highest number starts.  Each turn the player rolls the dice and removes the peg corresponding to the number on the dice.  If the hole relevant to the rolled dice number is empty, the player must return a peg.  The game ends when there are no more pegs on the board.  The player who has won the most pegs is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
