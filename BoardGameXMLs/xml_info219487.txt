			<description>Filling a gap in the Allied armoured arsenal between the M3A2 Mickey (Light) and the M3C Pounder, the M3G2 Barking Dog (Light) is an excellent anti-tank walker and can serve as a close support vehicle. Its six M40 recoilless guns fire in sequence, aimed at the same point thanks to a very advanced targeting system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sound of the guns firing a couple of seconds apart resembles a loud dog barking, hence the nickname of &amp;lsquo;Barking Dog&amp;rsquo;. This dog&amp;rsquo;s bite is far worse than its bark! Its 106mm rounds will easily destroy enemy fortified positions or blast tanks into smouldering heaps of metal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The downside is the reload time needed to make this magic happen. All six guns need to be loaded from the outside of the vehicle, one at a time. That&amp;rsquo;s why you&amp;rsquo;ll rarely see a Barking Dog alone on the battlefield. It behaves more like a wolf than a dog, either traveling in pack of its own, or with other walkers that complement its role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Marines&amp;rsquo; Light Barking Dog is similar to the prototype tested by the Army, but has an open-topped turret for better vision and cross-country performance. It is probably the most popular walker in the Marine Corps&amp;rsquo; arsenal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
