			<description>This game is based on a story from the Book of Mormon. In the book, Nephi built a ship and traveled from the Middle East to the Americas. In the game the players prepare for the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 70 cards. Sixty of the cards are blue backed and represent different items needed for a journey across the sea. There are six of each supply: fruits, seeds, animals, honey, tools, Liahona, meat, Laban's sword, tent, brass plates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other ten cards are Crate cards and show the pictures of five different items, one of which you need two cards. One card, for example, shows two seeds and one each of tools, animals, Laban's sword, and fruit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt one crate card and six supply cards. The rest of the supply cards form a draw pile and the top card is turned over to form a discard pile. Each player in turn draws either the top card of the draw or discard pile then they discard a card. A player wins if after their discard their six supply cards match those shown on the crate card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
