							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Muchik Pocket Edition</name>
									
			<description>This is the pocket edition of Muchik Spondylus Princeps, using only cards.&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, a player must be the one controlling the Mochica card allowing its owner to win the game. In order to be in control of that card, players will battle with other cards (pallares &amp;amp; fierras cards).&lt;br/&gt;Mochica cards are trump cards that give a specific power to the player who owns one. One of the cards allow to win the game, another to draw more cards, etc.&lt;br/&gt;When a player attacks another, he can play Fierras or Pallares cards. Fierras are played first. The target player discards as many cards as the attacking player's Fierras cards values.&lt;br/&gt;Pallares are played little by little : the attacking player plays some, the defender can counter by equalling the value, the attacking adds more, etc. If the attacker wins, he/she picks one card in the target player's hand at random for himself.&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to pass a turn to draw more cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
