							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shaarizad</name>
									
			<description>From deity &amp;quot;Description:&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shaarizad is a malevolent god of pure, unadulterated evil. There is no single physical description that fits him , as Shaarizad is portrayed differently by the various cultures and races that know of him, and even his own cults disagree on what their god&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; form is. The most common descriptions lean toward either a shadowy, incorporeal being or a tentacled, abominable horror. Shaarizad seeks nothing less than to cover the entire world in a cloak of shadows and to allow evil to spread unchecked. His priests, the Shadarans, dedicate their lives to furthering this objective, believing they will be rewarded when this time comes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shaarizad&amp;rsquo;s realm is a sprawling city in the center of Maledicium known as Necropolis. Necropolis is both above and below ground; on the surface, it covers a huge area with crypts, mausoleums, broken towers, and ruined temples. Underneath the city are extensive tombs, graves, and catacombs. Legions of Undead fill Necropolis, and they constantly clash with the devils and demons that roam the plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
