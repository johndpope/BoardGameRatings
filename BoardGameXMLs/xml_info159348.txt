			<description>from the adventure summary:&lt;br/&gt;Our heroes are charged with protecting an aging Dracomancer as he travels to confront 3 troublesome Dragons. As the party arrives at the Ash Mountains, they discover a Nazi Kampfgruppe division in heated combat with the dragons near a swirling porthole. Urged by the wizard to restore balance to the universe, the party rushes through the portal, are transformed, and have to negotiate the dangers of a German prisoner of war camp. Along the way, they discover that the thief that stole the artifact is trapped in the camp transformed into a cat. With Nazis, hungry prisoners, the mad commander , the crazy cook, and the thief cat, the players are in for a run for the bunny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Games in Play:&lt;br/&gt;We recently fell in love with the Narrative Game System, and its unique focus on story over gameplay, which in this case is beneficial considering the big twist that takes place partway through the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Adventure, we incorporated the idea of a portal game design using the Old School Renaissance (OSR) rules. The first part of the game could be played with normal Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons rules, then transition to NGS once the party travels through the portal. NGS is a highly versatile storytelling system, and could be used for the entire adventure if you choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, the OSR rules have been in use for decades, and if you would like to use them for the entire adventure, Mike Stewart (of the Save or Die Podcast and Wild Games Productions) has kindly included rules for playing animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;from Episode 11 - Hassenpfeffer in Jackboots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
