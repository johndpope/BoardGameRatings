			<description>In Skirmish! The Scramble, players need to use their monsters to grab treasure that's been dropped by adventurers who fled the area.  Claim more than the other player &amp;ndash; or any four treasures &amp;ndash; and you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a small deck of numbered (1-9) monster cards, five spells and two dummy cards. (For players of uneven skill, the more experienced player can shuffle additional low-valued &amp;quot;newb&amp;quot; monsters into his deck.) Each player shuffles his deck, takes the two dummy cards in hand, then fills his hand to six cards. Players shuffle the seven-card treasure deck (valued 1-7), then lay out five cards face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A round starts with the players revealing the value of the treasure. Each player first lays out a single card face down, then they reveal these scout monsters and refill their hands. They then lay down two cards face down, then reveal them. A player can include one spell in this pair of cards, and the spell might, say, steal an opponent's weakest monster or kill all monsters other than the undead. Whoever now has the highest monster total claims the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to win two treasures valued 1-4 claims a crown card worth 7 points. If a player claims four of the five treasures, he wins instantly; otherwise players tally their points after the end of five rounds to see who wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
