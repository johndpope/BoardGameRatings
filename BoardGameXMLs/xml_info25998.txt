			<description>In ancient Greece (Hellas) there was a very popular dice game with the name Cosmic Dice. &lt;br/&gt;At first at the Orpheus period was only three cosmic dice. &lt;br/&gt;At the Homeric period there were four dice. &lt;br/&gt;At last there were totally twelve dice, one for each one of the 12 Greek Gods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with 12 cosmic dices and the explanation for predicting your future according to the ancient Greek philosophers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic Dice has the following items:&lt;br/&gt;1. A colorful grid.&lt;br/&gt;2. 12 dice, each with ancient Greek scripts on each side.&lt;br/&gt;3. A small book.&lt;br/&gt;4. Many other items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full game which will be issued in the next version will have 25 &amp;quot;cosmic dice&amp;quot; and much more information about the ancient philosophy of fortune telling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new version will have 200 cosmic dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is another game also Cosmic Runar Dice which is different and has the runic lettering and numbering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
