			<description>119 cards + a rules card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card game, intended to break the ice at a party. Each party-goer is given a number of cards, say, 4 blue, 4 red and 4 green. How many cards is decided by the host and his or her decision will be made after seeing how many party-goers there are.&lt;br/&gt;Each player walks around chatting to the party-goers and tries to find two cards that 'go' with the card she or he already has. You need to trade your card with another, to make a set of three. In case you can't remember what to do, the cards are in three colours (and you need one of each to complete your set), and they are numbered 1, 2 or 3 (you need one of each to make a sentence. The sentence starts with the blue card text, then the red card text and, finally, the green card text. The sillier the sentence, the more chance you have of winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have one sentence of nonsense, then you start collecting another sentence. At some point during the party, an end to the game is called and the collected sentences are read out. The winner is the one who colloected the most absurd sentence (in a show of hands by the party-goers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title means 'Never laughed so much' and the box says 'For adults; An Advertising Salad - Well seasoned'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
