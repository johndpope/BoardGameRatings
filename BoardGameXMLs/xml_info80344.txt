			<description>Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F/A-18 Interceptor&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F/A-18 Interceptor is a combat flight simulator released for the Commodore Amiga in 1988. It is widely known for its use of 3D graphics and arcade-style gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player mainly flies the F/A-18 Hornet, but the F-16 Fighting Falcon is also available for aerobatics, free flight and the first mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in the San Francisco Bay Area. Notable landmarks include the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge and Alcatraz Island. The Electronic Arts headquarters in San Mateo are also depicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can also take off and land from the following airfields:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco International Airport &lt;br/&gt;Oakland International Airport &lt;br/&gt;Moffett Field NAS &lt;br/&gt;USS Enterprise, anchored approximately 20 miles offshore.&lt;br/&gt; Finally, when selecting a location to start a free flight, pressing the [0] key starts the player on uninhabited ground far away from the main game area. This is in fact supposed to be Edwards Air Force Base, a location that was not actually implemented in the final game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
