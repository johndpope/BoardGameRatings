			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Todd, Tony, Richard and Heather are four students who share a house in modern-day Arkham, Massachusetts. They all are currently enrolled at Miskatonic University (also in Arkham). As is standard for most universities in the United States, as part of the requirements for their degrees all four undertook a compulsory course in American History. They all agreed to take the same course believing that by doing so they could help each other study &amp;ndash; buy one quarter the number of books and share their notes when it came time for exams. What it really meant is that each one of them assumed that one of the others was doing the assignments, going to the lectures, and writing the essays. In fact what each of them did was procrastinate. They all did that quite well, just about as well as they made excuses to get extensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally presented as a tournament module at Conquest 1992, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the Delta Green setting is optional, but recommended.  This is a revised and expanded version of Devil's Children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
