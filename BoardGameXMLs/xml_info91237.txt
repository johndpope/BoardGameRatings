			<description>Arthur's Knights: Tales of Chivalry is a keyboard-operated PC game whose story revolves around the mythic Medieval era of which the legendary King Arthur is a contemporary. The player can choose to play either of two unique storylines: that of Bradwen the Celt or that of Christian Bradwen. In both storylines, he is the illegitimate son of the dying King Cadfanan, leader of the Atrebates tribe shortly following the Roman occupation. Bradwen's goal is to foil the evil attempts of his half-brother Morganor (heir to the throne) at securing a malevolent kingship for himself through which enactment of his evil intentions will be made possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arthur's Knights: Tales of Chivalry&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
