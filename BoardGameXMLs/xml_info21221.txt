			<description>This game is another in a line of square-box molded-plastic board releases favored by Ideal Toy Corp. during this period.  It incorporates several elements seen either alone or in combination in other action/dexterity games produced around this time - marbles, gravity, a spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start the game with ten marbles.  Marbles must be placed on a large, plastic centrally-located daisy, which has vague depressions on each 'petal' for the marbles to rest in.  The stem of the daisy is a strong spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 16 cards, all of which direct the holder to either 'put' or 'take' a given number of marbles from the daisy each turn.  Four are dealt to each player; a turn consists of playing a card &amp;amp; following the directions.  If either the placing or removal of marbles causes the daisy to tip over, the player causing the incident must take all the marbles that fall from the daisy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all four cards are used (i.e. when each player has had four turns) the pack is reshuffled and a fresh set of four cards is dealt to each player.  Play continues in this manner until a player is able to place their final marble on one of the daisy's petals without causing any to fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who achieves this is the winner of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
