							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Historical Loto</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A Highly Amusing and Instructive Round Game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Loto is a Bingo type game where the Loto cards have  historical dates marked on them. Each date lists an associated event and reigning monarch. A set of numbered Tickets matching the dates and numbers on the cards are drawn from a bag by a Teller. A player holding a Loto card with a square having a matching date calls it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player receives a pool of 36 counters at the start of the game. Six counters are paid into a pool for each Loto card played. A player must pay two more counters to the pool any time an improper claim is made on a Ticket. The first player to fill up six squares on any one card claims the pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaques also published a version of the game with dates from French history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
