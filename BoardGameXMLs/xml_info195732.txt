			<description>Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fortified is an explosive strategy shooter where players will defend the Earth against a menacing Martian invasion in the 1950s. Play as one-of-four pulp inspired heroes as they fight swarms of terrifying robots with an arsenal of Cold War era weapons and experimental technology. Protect the city by building a network of defensive structures, commanding an army, and jumping into battle against dangerous sky scraping attackers. Fight for Earth alone or with up to four players for the ultimate co-op defense experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genre-Bending Gameplay &amp;ndash; Fortified combines third-person shooter, real-time strategy, and tower defense mechanics in an exciting new way!&lt;br/&gt;Retro Sci-Fi Flare &amp;ndash; Go back in time and experience an alternate history, where planet Earth is assaulted by an unstoppable Martian menace. Be immersed in a world that&amp;rsquo;s straight out of a 1950&amp;rsquo;s comic book.&lt;br/&gt;Construct the Ultimate Defense &amp;ndash; Players will fortify their base by strategically building a network of defensive structures to thwart the oncoming waves of mechanical invaders.&lt;br/&gt;Pulp Inspired Character Classes &amp;ndash; Fortified features four classes based on prominent pulp character archetypes, including a jetpack piloting heroine, a shotgun wielding space cowboy, a secret government agent, and a battle hardened Marine captain.&lt;br/&gt;Four-Player Co-Op &amp;ndash; It can be difficult to face the Martian machines alone. Fortified offers diverse co-op gameplay that requires team coordination and strategy. There&amp;rsquo;s power in numbers, but victory only comes to those who work together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
