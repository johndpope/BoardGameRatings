			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME &amp;ndash; VAPORWARE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is stuck in the development limbo known as Vaporware. Few to no details have been released about its gameplay, plot, or release date since its announcement many years ago. It may or may not be in active development, but neither has it been cancelled officially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The worlds first dumping simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your suitor is a rich ouji who obsesses about you constantly and thinks that he can buy and own you. There is no wooing here. There will be branching dialogue where you are trying to &amp;lsquo;scare away the anti-love interest&amp;rsquo; and your choices will effect if you are successful or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
