							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battlestrike: Call to Victory</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A classic FPS, this game was developed in 2004 by Canadian studio Jarhead Games and released in North America as World War II Sniper: Call to Victory. It was repackaged as a Battlestrike title by City Interactive in most European markets. In Poland however, the game is known as Rajd na Berlin: Oddzia≈Çy Specjalne. The player takes the role of the U.S. Airborne Sniper Hawkins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of ten missions divided among three campaigns, the first set in the Netherlands for Operation Market Garden with three missions, the second set in Luxembourg for Battle of the Bulge with four missions and the last set in Germany for the Battle of the Rhineland with the remaining three missions. The player's health is indicated by a health meter. Most of the time, the player will heavily rely on the Springfield Sniper Rifle to successfully complete objectives throughout the missions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestrike%23Battlestrike%3A_Call_to_Victory Battlestrike]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
