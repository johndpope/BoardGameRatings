							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jul i Valhall: Jakten på Loke</name>
									
			<description>(Translated from the box, in Norwegian)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Christmas in Valhall: the Hunt for Loke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come to Asgard and Valhall where Thor, Odin and the rest of the Nordic Gods rule&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loke has disappeared from the cave where the Gods chained him as punishment for the death of Balder. You fear that Loke will take his revenge and release Ragnarokk, so you must catch him as soon as possible with 3 chains and bring him back to the cave. Loke is as fast as the wind and not easy to catch, but follow and get help from the Gods in the hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are really lucky, you find Lokes' key to Hel and may release Balder. Then you immediately may put two of your chains on Loke and get a good lead on your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Loke is cunning, and you can not be safe with his capture. He may be stealing the magical apples in Valhall that gives him enough strength to free himself from the chains you have put on him. Are you the one to capture Loke and bring him all the way back to the cave?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
