							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Street Fighter III New Generation</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;The first entry in Capcom's Street Fighter III series. Initially released to arcades and also included in Street Fighter III: Double Impact on Sega Dreamcast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with earlier Street Fighter games, Street Fighter III features one-on-one combat. Notable changes include the &amp;quot;parry&amp;quot; system, which allows players to deflect incoming attacks without taking damage. The new meter system requires players to select a single &amp;quot;super art&amp;quot; before the match, which will also determine how large the player's meter is. A full meter enables use of the Super Art, and smaller portions can be used for so-called EX moves which are improved versions of basic special moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was notable for its vast increase in the number of frames used in character animations, and for introducing an all-new cast of characters, except for Ken and Ryu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
