			<description>Higurashi Daybreak is a Japanese doujin third person shooter developed by Twilight Frontier, first released on August 13, 2006 and is based on the popular visual novel Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. The game is Twilight Frontier's first attempt in making a 3D game. 07th Expansion, the creators of the original franchise, assisted in making the game - most notably, Ryukishi07, the writer of the original game, provided the script for Higurashi Daybreak. In April 2008, Alchemist announced that they would be porting Higurashi Daybreak to the PlayStation Portable, and released the port on November 27, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PSP port was developed by Cavia, with the assistance from the original makers, Twilight Frontier and 07th Expansion. The port boasts revamped character graphics to match Alchemist's previous Higurashi ports, new storylines for Hanyuu and Natsumi, new costumes and weapons, a new opening animation with a theme song, as well as a &amp;quot;shop&amp;quot; feature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Higurashi Daybreak&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
