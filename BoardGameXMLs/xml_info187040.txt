			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended for young players.  The introductory sections explain role-playing concepts and dice mechanics.  The game is run by a Guide, and the players are referred to as Storytellers.  Players may select one of the characters from the television series upon which the game is based (the major characters are pre-generated in the rules), or they may create a character and background of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have four Attributes (Vitality, Insight, Daring, and Charm) and one or more Talents (Skills), including:  Seafaring, Manipulation, and Athletic.  Characters may also have Gifts (special properties) or use magic.  Task resolution is straightforward and fairly simple, suitable for younger players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
