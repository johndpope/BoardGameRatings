			<description>A set collecting game. Cards are traded noisily until one player has at least five of one team. The first to do so cries &amp;quot;Piktee&amp;quot; and scores 50 points and claims the Free Kick card, and a new deal starts (the Free Kick card has no purpose at all so I do not know why it was included in the game).&lt;br/&gt;If a player dares, he may not call out his 5 card team but he can wait to get a six card team. If he is still the first to call &amp;quot;Piktee&amp;quot; he will score double points but, of course, by waiting, someone else might call a team before him and he will not score.&lt;br/&gt;The Penalty card is exactly that, a penalty card. If you are caught with it in your hand when &amp;quot;Piktee&amp;quot; is called, you lose 25 points.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to score 500 points after several deals, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
