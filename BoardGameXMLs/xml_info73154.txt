			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hoppin' Mad is an arcade-style game from 1988, made by Elite Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player guides a group of bouncing balls from the right edge of the level to the left edge. The balls are constantly bouncing, and the player can only alter their travel speed (by moving the joystick left or right) or make them bounce higher (by pressing the fire button).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Various different dangers appear on the levels, including sharp rocks, venus flytraps, hedgehogs and flying birds. The balls can also collect flying balloons for bonus points. The game starts with four balls, and each time the balls collide with a danger object, one ball bursts. If all four balls are burst, the player loses a life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: This game had an alternate name at some point or in some area. This submitter knows for sure he has seen one version of the game with a totally different name, though can't remember or find what that name was)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hoppin'_Mad,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
