			<description>Complexity level 3 on Tsukada's 1-6 scale (1=easiest)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only released in Japan, this is a Star Wars themed hex-based wargame is based on the rebels attacking the Death Star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the box says 2-8 players, like many of Tsukada's games, over two players means &amp;quot;get on one of the two teams and share the counters&amp;quot;; it's really a 2 player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tsukada could've paid more attention to their box.. Two things of note on the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) On the front, it has the &amp;quot;Empire Strikes Back&amp;quot; logo on it, even though the game is based off the Death Star attack from the first movie. Most likely it's just because it came out after Empire Strikes Back, but..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) On the back of the box, in says in English &amp;quot;May the forth be with you!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
