			<description>The game is played by acquiring counters and goods in the cities of the Roman Empire. The counters and goods can be sold between players and sold to the bank. The rich players will be able to increase their profits by paying for the services of a robber who will ransom his adversaries. The winner will be the one who has eliminated the other players and increased their capital, their goods and their counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
