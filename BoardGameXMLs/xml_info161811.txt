			<description>Final Fantasy Type-0 was first released on PlayStation Portable in Japan. A western release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One titled Final Fantasy Type-0 HD was confirmed. Type-0 is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, a set of games sharing a common mythos which includes Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XV. The gameplay is reminiscent of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, with the player taking direct control of characters and taking them on missions and large-scale battles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally announced as a title for mobile phones called Final Fantasy Agito XIII. It is directed by Hajime Tabata, who also directed Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII. It was designed to provide players with easy access to the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. The game was eventually moved onto the PSP and its title was changed to distance it from Final Fantasy XIII, the subseries' flagship title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Final Fantasy Type-0,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
