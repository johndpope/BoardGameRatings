			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1980, Daystar West Media planned and advertised a series of three scenarios as the NightVentures line.  The first two scenarios were produced and sold in 1980.  The third scenario, Eye of the Dragon, was planned, named, and received at least cursory development but was not completed.  Several dozen covers were printed, however, and eventually ended up in the hands of an avid collector.  The scenario notes and maps were retained by the author.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In early 2014 a private group of collectors approached Tracy Hickman with a proposal to complete Eye of the Dragon as a privately funded venture with a limited edition run.  The scenario was completed in a manner that retained the original &amp;quot;look and feel&amp;quot; of the series, insofar as was possible - everything from the typeface to the binding was made as nearly identical to the 1980s scenarios as possible.  The author produced a total of thirty-eight copies of the scenario, each bearing an original cover, and each hand-bound by the author.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most copies were sold for the fixed advanced price of $1,250 per unit; is is possible that a few copies were auctioned or gifted.  The author has stated that the scenario will not be subsequently produced or re-published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
