			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Matrix: Path of Neo is the third video game based on the Matrix series and the second developed by Shiny Entertainment. Players control the character Neo, participating in scenes from the films. It was released on November 8, 2005 in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Shiny Entertainment's first licensed Matrix game, Enter The Matrix, only sideline characters were playable. It did not feature the series' main protagonist Neo, and due to its nature as an extension of the films' storyline, had few recreations of scenes in the film trilogy. David Perry, president of Shiny Entertainment Inc, has stated that Path of Neo is &amp;quot;basically the game that gamers wanted first time around...
