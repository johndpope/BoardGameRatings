			<description>The Ophidian Legends is a 25-card expansion special mini-set and has as the main theme the Legendary Ophidian League Gladiators. And there&amp;rsquo;s more, much more as we also showcase in a 5 cards subset focusing the most brutal war that happened in the Ophidian Universe, the Demon Wars!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And as if that is not enough the set also brings back the Reindeer's Minions that were seen last year in the Holiday 2004 set, after all we&amp;rsquo;re on Christmas Season, and although we don&amp;rsquo;t have the return of Arkon Klaus, this set also includes a 5 cards subset with many cards for him (or any other Gladiator) to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion also features two brand new mechanisms:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legendary Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Set include Gladiators, Minions and Pumps with a  keyword that indicate that they are Legendary Characters, this keyword is currently seen in two Gladiators cards Arkon Klaus (from Holiday 2004 set) &amp;amp; Pestilence (from WOF set). The Legendary Characters are Ophidian League Gladiators, they may be included in any Team, and they act like any regular Gladiator. When a Legendary Gladiator is destroyed he is placed in the Funeral Pyre, and your opponent&amp;rsquo;s gains the double of the VP of the Legendary Gladiator. The Legendary cards are also unique cards, and even though they don&amp;rsquo;t have the  keyword written on them, they automatically count as unique cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minions that act like Gladiator Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Set include Minions with the following text &amp;ldquo;CARD NAME counts as a XVP {DISCIPLINE}{DISCIPLINE} Gladiator&amp;rdquo;. Currently only one Minion cards has this Mechanism, Doombringer (from The OutWorlds Revelations set). The Minion can use Pumps that apply for the stated Disciplines and VP, but for all the purposes the card is still a Minion card. It also mean that when the Minion is destroyed he also is Placed in the Funeral Pyre alongside the Gladiators cards, and as that the&lt;br/&gt;opponent will gain the VP mentioned on the Minion card. If the Minion card has also the Legend  keyword, the VP that the opponent will gain when the minion is destroyed is determinate by the Legendary Cards Mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
