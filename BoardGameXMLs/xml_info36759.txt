							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twin Flip</name>
									
			<description>Twin Flip is a large-format dexterity game produced by Eliott Games that borrows heavily from pinball.  Each player simultaneously mans a set of flippers and defends a goal on their side of the board.  The winner is the player who scores the most goals and hits the most targets.  Additionally, the game may be split into two sections for individual play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
