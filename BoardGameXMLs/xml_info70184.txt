			<description>Operational wargame about the last month of WWII in Italy. One player is the German with some Fascist allies trying to delay allied advance toward the Po river. The other player has the composite forces of the Allies (American, British, Commonwealth, Polish, Jewish, Brazilian and Italian) with the objective to pierce enemy lines, catch significant cities and block retreat roads to the river and to Germany. Allies have a mighty airpower, while German has multiple defence lines with improved positions and a plenty of minor rivers. Rules reflect initial Hitler's strategy to hold until last man and, for the Allies, logistic problems to launch two main offensives at once; so German has initial movement limits and Allies must wait some game turns for their attacks: first the British Army,then the American Army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
