			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This horror supplement for the StickGuy RPG is set in the woods just outside of Sticktown. There is only one way into the woods outside of Sticktown and that is across an old wooden bridge that is falling apart. The bridge is so bad that only one car can make it across and back out before all the planks fall off and tumble the 400 feet to the ranging river below. The river and canyon encircles the woods on three sides. Mountains close off the fourth side of the woods, which makes the bridge the only way in and out of the woods. The characters in this game have rented the cabin for a weekend getaway, but little did they know that they would unleash the evil of the NecroSticknomicon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
