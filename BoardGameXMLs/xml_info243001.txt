							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Transformers: The Role-Playing Game (1st Edition)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Transformers RPG is a traditional table-top role-playing interpretation of the classic 1980s Transformers Generation 1 mythos. It allows players to take the role of Autobots (or Decepticons), waging interstellar war over Energon, the precious lifeblood of all transformers, and for domination of their home planet, Cybertron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes these Autobots and Decepticons unique&amp;mdash;what has captured the imagination of the world for thirty years&amp;mdash;is their ability to transform. By assuming alternate modes, often based on vehicles or equipment from their current location, these giant robotic life-forms become more than meets the eye&amp;mdash;robots in disguise. Gifted with the skills and abilities of both forms, transformers are the perfect warriors, spies, diplomats, and more. They are just as varied and passionate as any human, and they are perfect heroes (and villains) for all manner of science fiction adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
