			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow in the In the Footsteps of Fools, with this picaresque series of adventures for the Dying Earth, featuring the exploits of Cugel-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part Four: Beyond The Mountains of Magnatz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may have thought your adventurous rogues were trapped in the barren north until the sun went dark. But no, the former Lords of Cil are on the move again. Initially reprising their roles as the heralded Lords, the adventurers must:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Wriggle out of a tight spot as sacrifices to the demon Magnatz&lt;br/&gt;     Progress through a series of greater and lesser challenges, both natural &amp;amp; magical, as they struggle across the savage mountains&lt;br/&gt;     Explore strange hospitality in the valley of the mighty Pharesm&lt;br/&gt;     And survive lands populated by an army of basilisks, before at last winning free to the civilized lands of the east&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next (and final) publication in this series (&amp;quot;And Thence to Almery&amp;quot;) wraps it all up. It will carry the PCs from the Northern Scamander, through Erze Damath, and via Old Romarth back to Azenomei and an epic confrontation with Iucounu the Laughing Magician. The previous adventures in the series are In the Footsteps of Fools Part 1: All's Fair at Azenomei, In the Footsteps of Fools Part 2: Strangers in Saskervoy and In the Footsteps of Fools Part 3: Lords of Cil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
