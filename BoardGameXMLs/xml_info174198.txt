							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wolfe and Archie: The Nero Wolfe One-Page</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our Heroes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nero Wolfe, famous private detective, lives ensconced in his brownstone on West 35th Street in New York City. He seldom leaves it and every day, but Sunday, he spends 9am to 11am and 6pm to 6pm in his Orchard greenhouse on the top floor of his abode. He is curt, obstinate, magisterial, and the best detective money can buy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is aided in his residence by his orchid expert Theodore Horstmann, his cook Fritz Brenner, and his &amp;quot;leg-man&amp;quot; Archie Goodwin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archie is the brawn to Wolfe's brain. He is a bit too breezy to be termed &amp;quot;hardboiled&amp;quot;, but he is definitely a good egg. He like dancing, baseball, and has contacts all over the City that come in handy to his boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
