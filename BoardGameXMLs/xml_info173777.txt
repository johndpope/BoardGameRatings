			<description>Round We Go is a strategic family board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to race to the center of the board. First person to get both of their player pieces to the center wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick is that pieces are unable to turn on their own, which can cause you to go round and round on the circular board, unless you plan accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must strategically place arrow pieces on the board to either help them advance or force opponents to backtrack. However, it is important to remember, in a game of circles, sometimes what goes around comes around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
