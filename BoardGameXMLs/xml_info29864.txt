			<description>&amp;quot;De Berend Boudewijn Kwis&amp;quot; was a very popular quiz-show on the Dutch television during the early seventies. &lt;br/&gt;This game contains 100 cards with questions and three possible  answers (A-B-C). If you got it right, you earn plus-points (1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for C). If you got it wrong, the points are subtracted of your total. &lt;br/&gt;You can play against time, or to obtain a certain amount of points. &lt;br/&gt;Questions like: &lt;br/&gt;- When did the Titanic sink?&lt;br/&gt;- In which country was gunpowder invented?&lt;br/&gt;- What year was Kennedy shot?&lt;br/&gt;- How fast can a pigeon fly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
