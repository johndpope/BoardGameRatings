							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To Go Boldly: Simple Star Trek RPG</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple roleplaying game based in the universe created by the original series of Star Trek. Where people had trouble with Tribbles, overacting was considered the baseline, and Klingons were rascally villains with smooth foreheads. I have mostly ignored the films and modern series altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players create characters that are fresh out of Starfleet Academy. Their first posting is as a Ensigns on a survey team and they are assigned to an Explorer Class vessel called the USS Magellan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has a crew of eighty, including a veteran Captain and Executive Officer. The rest of the crew are like the players, greenhorns. This is how Starfleet in this era weeds out those who just will not make it in the field. Those that don't make the grade will be transferred back to Earth to work in desk jobs, others will come home in small steel capsules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
