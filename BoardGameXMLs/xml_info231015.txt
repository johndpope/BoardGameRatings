Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:Pawns in war! Key monsters and NPCs from the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path come alive on your tabletop with the Ironfang Invasion Pawn Collection, featuring more than 100 creature pawns for use with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or any tabletop fantasy RPG! Printed on sturdy cardstock, each pawn presents a beautiful full-color image of a monster or NPC from the Ironfang Invasion campaign, including hobgoblin soldiers, corrupted fey, fantastic beasts, and dozens of unique pawns. The Ironfang Invasion Pawn Collection, together with the creatures and characters from the Pathfinder Pawns: Bestiary Box and Monster Codex Box collections, provides pawns for nearly every Ironfang Invasion encounter. Each cardstock pawn slots into a size-appropriate plastic base from any of the Bestiary Box collections, making the pawns easy to mix with traditional metal or plastic miniatures. With tons of distinct images, the Ironfang Invasion Pawn Collection brings to life the enemies and allies from all six adventures of the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
