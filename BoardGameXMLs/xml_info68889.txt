			<description>The playing surface is long and oval-shaped, and the playing spaces are narrow and angled. The basic rules of race games are still used however, with turns missed and players moving backwards and forwards as directed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hare must be advanced on its own track at the same time as the dogs. This is achieved by using two dice of different sizes, the smaller one for the hare. The dogs are moved by the players individually when their turn comes round, but the hare is moved at each throw of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win, a dog can either land in the same compartment as the hair or pass the winning post, but the dogs may not pass the hare, and those that might, lose a turn. Losing a turn is also the penalty if a dog lands in a compartment already occupied as `it is supposed a fight ensues'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
