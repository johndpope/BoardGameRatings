							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">How to Make a Great Villain</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a traditional story, the villain is a catalyst for story. Usually, the events of the world would follow a destined course of action, but the villain decides that they want more, or they simply want the world to take a different path. Once one person steps out of the shadows to change the course of destiny; another person inevitably steps up to stop them. In more complex stories, a second party might not seek to stop the changes in progress; instead they may seek to create further changes of their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This great how to book continues the series of tips and tricks, this time around Avalon Games is looking to improve your villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
