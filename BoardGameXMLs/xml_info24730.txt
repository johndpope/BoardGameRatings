			<description>The game is played within the box itself. The bottom has 30 slots to keep the available shares and 4 trays to save the money of the bank. The top cover can be left open and it indicates the current value and dividends for each title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes 5 shares numbered 1-5 in 6 different colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players throw one 6-sided die and one color-die to determine which of the shares can be bought, pay dividends or maybe give special gratifications. If a 6 is thrown, the share of the thrown color is given a new value by an additional dice throw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with 200.000 for each player and the one who collects  1 million first is the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
