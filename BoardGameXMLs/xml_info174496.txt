			<description>From the publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;Qui si parla di maledizioni e punizioni gravissime. Come se l'essere un vampiro non fosse gi&amp;agrave; una maledizione, ecco qui c'&amp;egrave; in atto molto di pi&amp;ugrave; che il mero succhiare sangue...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English translation:&lt;br/&gt;Here we talk about curses and serious punishments. As if being a vampire was not already a curse, here there is a lot more than the mere blood sucking...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourth game landed in the house Mini G4m3s Studio, but the first that does not use the usual regulation that was previously at the base of the other three. Here we talk about curses and punishments serious. As if being a vampire was not already a curse, here there is in place a lot more than the mere sucking blood ...&lt;br/&gt;Why you ask? What's worse than sucking blood to survive? Vampires are not already cursed by sunlight? No because:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- After making common cause with the mortals,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Shone as Dragqueen in sequined clothes and lived most insipid love stories of those of Dawson;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Agreeing to be passed by the protagonists of novels horror protagonists of the stories of amorein style Harmony,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowadays find themselves reduced to a minimum. Is exact in every sense! Vampires from mighty predators are now ghettoized even insects and even mocked by most animals cute and cuddly ... This is the terrible fate that hit the so-called Mini Vampires, those survivors who have not surrendered, those who rebelled but living yet every day the horrible reality: the vampire myth has collapsed and now the fate of this ancient lineage of the damned is in their hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your task is to try to grow, telling their wickedness to the detriment of others, obviously trying to shift the blame on others always. You will be quite sinister and treacherous as expected by tradition? Will our anti-heroes to return to their original size or succumb smoked by coils and pesticides until completely eclipsed by the hand of Shame?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On our Facebook page you can also find the strips Mini Vampires!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
