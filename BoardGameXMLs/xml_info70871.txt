							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kavit M. Tor&#039;s Emporium of Collectable Curiosities</name>
									
			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I am an explorer, a man of action, and foiler of nefarious plots. Come read my book, Evocative City Sites, and I, Owain Northway, will guide you through the back allies to the door of a little shop that was not there yesterday. I will tell you of Kavit M. Tor's Emporium of Collectible Curiosities.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evocative City Sites: a Pathfinder Roleplaying Game-compatible supplement detailing small locations that you could find in any urban campaign setting. This site is detailed with its own cartography, a 1&amp;quot;=1 square scale map pack, three unique npcs, 10 new magic items and 10 flavorful curses, all presented in the unique, useful, and entertaining form of Owain Northway's first person point-of-view guidebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kavit M. Tor's Emporium of Collectible Curiosities is a place that is easy to stumble upon, a place where you always seem to get a great deal, a place full of fascinating mysterious and exotic items, a place where the only thing not for sale is Kavit's smoking pipes and his caged monkey, but buyer beware, for there is not a liberal return policy and it is a place that may not be there tomorrow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This product includes: Pit-Fiend-Bound Human Sorcerer (Infernal)(CR 12)&lt;br/&gt;     Ebon Servitor Gargoyle Ranger (CR 8)&lt;br/&gt;     Monkey Monk /Blind Master (CR 7)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
