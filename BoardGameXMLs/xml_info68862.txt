			<description>The game requires each player to position his fleet on the pad and guess the position of their opponent. The winner is the one who finds out the opponent's position first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player takes a pad of charts and decides whether he shall be Blue or Red. He then marks on his chart the positions of his fleet, as follows, by means of crosses:&lt;br/&gt; One Battleship: four squares &lt;br/&gt;One Cruiser: 3 squares &lt;br/&gt;Two Destroyers : 2 squares each&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The squares marked must be consecutive for each ship, and must be in a straight line, although they may be placed diagonally, vertically or horizontally. There must be, however, at least one blank square between any of the ships, and they must not touch each other. The players must not see each oher's charts and where their opponent's ships are placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
