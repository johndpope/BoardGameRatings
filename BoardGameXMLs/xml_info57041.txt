			<description>Back Cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the fun at Frostbite Falls and Wossawatta U. with Bullwinkle, Rocky, and all their pals! The Bullwinkle and Rocky game lets you play the role of your favorite character- from Dudley Do-Right and Mr. Peabody to Boris Badenov and Snidely Whiplash! Easy to learn, the Bullwinkle and Rocky game is really three games in one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Narration Game has all the fun of roleplaying with none of the complex rule! Using cards as cues, you and your friends take a Bullwinkle and Rocky story, a Fractured Fairy Tale, or any other story and retell it- your way! The only limit to the looniness is your own imagination as the story takes dramatic turns, implausible twists, and silly leaps of logic! And incredibly easy to learn, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Everybody Can Do Something Game, you play an actual Bullwinkle and Rocky character in adventures based on your favorite TV cartoons! Boris and Natasha have another Fiendish Plan- can Bullwinkle and Rocky stop them? Will Bullwinkle ever pull a rabbit out of his hat? No dice in this game- take a spin on one of the six character customized spinners to find out how things turn out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mr. Know-It-All Graduate Game gives you even more freedom and flexibility. Make up your own characters! Design your own adventures! Use your favorite Bullwinkle and Rocky characters...or don't! It's completely up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Puppets: Hand puppets of your favorite characters. raise silliness to new heights!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character Cards: Pictures and game statistics for all the zany characters from the cartoons: Bullwinkle and Rocky (of course!), Inspector Fenwick, Sherman, and even Horse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spinners: Boris Badenov is hatching another evil scheme! Rocky swoops down to stop him. Who will succeed? Spin each player's Rotational Randomizer to find out! Spinners aren't just for kids anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards: Filled with strange places and unusual happenings! use them to prompt the action, or to take the story in a completely unbelievable direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diplomas: Sort of offical documents from Wossamatta U. proof that you've mastered the intricacies of Bullwinkle and Rocky roleplaying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: Illustrated rulebooks that clearly explain how to play the game, complete with comments from Bullwinkle and Rocky and their friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
