			<description>Starting with $1.2 million in cash, players (or teams) buy and sell stocks, bonds, real estate, and gold. First player to $10 million wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start on any square on the board and move clockwise by rolling the dice. Some squares allow you to optionally buy or sell various assets, other squares require you to buy or sell assets. Asset value can change during play when a player lands on one of the &amp;quot;Change In Interest Rate&amp;quot; squares, causing the &amp;quot;Inflation Rate Indicator&amp;quot; (a plastic spinner) to move up or down, indicating a new value for everyone's assets. After the rate change, the player who landed on the square is required to sell from half to all of one of his assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inflation Rate Indicator starts at &amp;quot;5-10%&amp;quot; and during play will move up and down to &amp;quot;0-5%&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;10-15%&amp;quot;. Players may borrow from the bank, but it must be paid back before someone reaches the $10 million goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
