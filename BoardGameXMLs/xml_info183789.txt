			<description>Shattered Earth is a tabletop war game set on Earth many decades into the future, after the world has been ravaged by an unprecedented number of natural disasters. The geology of the Earth has been forever changed, now cracked and broken, existing landmasses drowned in vast oceans whilst others have formed anew, created by the seismic movements of tectonic plates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each cataclysmic shockwave formed by extinction-level natural disasters pounded against the door of another world &amp;ndash; a mirror image of our own &amp;ndash; until eventually that door gave way. The resulting breach flooded the Earth with an esoteric power known as Ether, a volatile energy that is the very foundation of the Immateria, the world of dreams. And in return, the material world bled into the breach, corrupting and choking everything it touched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mankind now struggles to comprehend this new power, seeing in it both ruin and salvation.  Scientists attempt to harness its energy to create wondrous new technology, whilst others practice dark rituals and worship strange new powers, using Ether to alter their surroundings and themselves, bending reality to their whim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is 30 A.E. This is Shattered Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
