							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Demigod</name>
									
			<description>Demigod is a video game developed by Gas Powered Games for the PC platform. The game is a RPG/RTS hybrid which was significantly influenced by the popular Warcraft III custom map Defense of the Ancients. The game's title refers to the powerful player characters that battle for supremacy over various zones. The game is multiplayer-oriented and competitive in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two distinct types of Demigod: Assassins and Generals. Assassins rely on their varied combat abilities in a direct fight to kill other Demigods. Generals are a hybrid Demigod that create and support their own minions and other Demigods.Demigod launched with eight Demigods available, four for each type of Demigod, and added two additional Demigods after release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gold and experience points are earned as the player defeats the enemy and captures nodes. As the player's Demigod levels up, the player also gains access to new abilities through the respective skill tree. Each Demigod has its own unique talent tree with a blend of offensive, defensive and team focused abilities. Demigods can also purchase items to boost their abilities, including some ancient items, the most expensive items in the game. Achievements earn the player favor points, which can be used to purchase favor items. Players are allowed to choose one favor item that can be used throughout the match, but once the favor item has been chosen, it cannot be replaced until the next match. Once a favor item is purchased it will be available for use in following matches for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Demigod (video game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
