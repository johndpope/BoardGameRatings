			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've seen something haven't you kid? Was it the flash of light in the sky? Was it the black helicopters circling the creek last night? Whatever it is you know to much now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you mean, you don't know anything? You know something, and that's all that matters to them. They've got to make sure you keep quiet, and they aren't going to take your word on that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who are they? Well I have some theories I'm still trying to tie together. The Trilateral Commission, members of Club 33, Majestic 12 maybe. Your basic New World Order. I've been studying them for years, keeping my head down, just waiting for an opportunity and someone to help me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't look at me like that. It's too late to go back to your real life now. Hell, there isn't a real life to go back to. It's come with me or be eliminated. Simple as that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where are we going? Oh kid, you're not going to believe this...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
