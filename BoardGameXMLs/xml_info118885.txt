			<description>Made Man is set in the New York underworld of organized crime in the Mafia. The storyline is written by crime author David Fisher with collaboration from former mafioso Salvatore &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot; Bonanno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player assumes the role of Joey Verola, a former soldier, as he is indoctrinated into the world of American organized crime and must relive his life - every moment, every kill - as he rises through the ranks to become a made man. The storyline spans three decades of his life, from the horror of Vietnam to the urban jungle of Brooklyn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joey is forced into the world of crime when he saves a don's right hand man in Vietnam. The game's missions are a series of flashbacks: as Joey is being driven to the don's place to be made he reveals to his nephew how he rose through the ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title was originally under development at Acclaim Entertainment's Manchester studio under the name of Interview with a Made Man. When Acclaim collapsed, employees from its studio reformed as SilverBack Studios, and backed by Fund4Games, continued to work on the game. The title was shortened to Made Man and a planned Xbox conversion was dropped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Made Man (computer game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
