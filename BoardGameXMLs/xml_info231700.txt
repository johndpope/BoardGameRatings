			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pillow forts, lava covered floors, and monsters under the bed come to life in this family friendly strategy card game.  Ninja Monkeys is for the kid in all of us. Imagine the chance to ground your parents, dogs that really do eat homework, are we there yet cards that move time forward, and Ninja Monkeys that try to swipe your cards are just a taste of what awaits you in this fast paced game of reversals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every card in Ninja Monkeys is based upon the magic and wonder of childhood.  Finders Keepers, Double Dog Dare, Teachers Pet, Bed Time Drama, and Tattle Tale are just a few of the humorous cards in this game that you can use to throw a wrench in the plans of your opponents.  For example The Floor is Lava stops players from placing cards directly on the table and limits them to playing cards on the existing ones.  Monster Under The Bed has to be fed a card each turn.  Play the Bed Time Drama card, and see if all the other players at the table don't throw a tantrum.  If someone starts to play an action card against you, put a Brain Freeze card on it to stop them in their tracks, and be sure to watch out for Ninja Monkeys!  Get your copy of Ninja Monkeys today, we double dog dare you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
