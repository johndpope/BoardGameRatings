							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cheese Louise</name>
									
			<description>Any way you &amp;quot;slice it&amp;quot;, Cheese Louise is a speedy test of cheddar challenges! Reach, spin and swap pieces of cheese to cover all the tasty toppings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each slice of bread contains a different combination of condiments -- peanut butter and jelly, pickles and ketchup, mustard and olives. Cover the toppings with the cheese slices so none of the fixins' can be seen through the holes of the cheese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who finds the correct combo of bread and cheese first wins the card. But who will cover all their fixins' first? Combine speed and visual thinking skills and you'll be the BIG cheese!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
