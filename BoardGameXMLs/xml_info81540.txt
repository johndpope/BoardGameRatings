			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1993 Microprose released Fields of Glory, a strategy game where the player could replay Napoleon's 100 Days Campaign (1). The game offers both the four famous battles of the campaign, namely Quatre Bras, Ligny, Wavre and Waterloo, but it also adds two fictional battles that could have happened; Nivelles and Wagn&amp;eacute;e. &lt;br/&gt;The game offers 4 historical or 2 fictional battles, in which the player can command either side, and 5 difficulty levels.&lt;br/&gt;The game also includes a database, with a detailed overview of all the troops present in that campaign, and all commanders, complete with description about the person&amp;rsquo;s history and all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is top down. The map can&amp;rsquo;t be rotated but it can be zoomed. In the game, the player commands brigades and batteries, represented by a few dozen men or 2 guns, thus making playing this game feel like playing a tabletop miniature wargaming battle. However, gameplay is realtime, not turn based. Victory is achieved by capturing or holding victory locations and inflicting enemy casualties, while losing as little troops as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is currently downloadable as abandonware on several sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) See: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Hundred Days&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
