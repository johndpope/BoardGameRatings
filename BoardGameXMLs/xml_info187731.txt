			<description>In the world of Tempest: Shards of the Gods, the apocalypse has come and gone. The world as it once was has been shattered into countless shards of reality. The only things that remain are the gods and what pieces they could salvage before the end came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the place of a god of ancient myth: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Anubis: leading the Egyptians&lt;br/&gt;     Athena: leading the Greeks&lt;br/&gt;     Inari: leading the Japanese&lt;br/&gt;     Heimdallr: leading the Norse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tempest: Shards of the Gods features a number of unique mechanics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Discard any card for resources. Resources do not build each turn; instead, every card you play comes at the sacrifice of another.&lt;br/&gt;     Tailor your deck to your opponent as you play. Split your resources between modifying and building your deck, or playing cards to fight your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;     Tell the best story to win. Demigod and Tale cards have Labors that can be completed to score Victory Points. Reach 5 points first to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight for dominion over what is left, conquer enemy shards to piece together a universe for yourself, fend off attacks from rival gods and set your name in myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
