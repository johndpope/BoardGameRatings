							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mallow Drops</name>
									
			<description>Mallow Drops is a gravity puzzle where two kiwis regather their eggs in a shattered world. Help Marsh and Mallow rescue their eggs and get to the exit! Turn everything upside down as you slide, shift and move through the tricky world of Mallow Drops, a mix of platformer and a sliding block puzzle. Getting to where you need to go half the fun - just be sure to have a safe landing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Wooly Jumpers hopping about and Dirty Underbears surprising you suddenly, it won't be easy, and if you're not careful, the dreaded Dropbears may get the drop on you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You move in straight lines. Your world turns upside-down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you turn the world of Mallow Drops, things shift in unexpected ways and new paths are revealed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mallow Drops is a meditative mix of platformer and a sliding block puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
