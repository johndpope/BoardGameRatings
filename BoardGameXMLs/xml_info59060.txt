							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">PsychoPet: The Nutty Pet Clinic</name>
									
			<description>In the nutty pet clinic a whole lot is going on, because everybody here has some sort of quirk: the animal patients and the charmingly mad clinic staff. So try your luck as a doctor and cure the bigger and smaller neuroses of your pet patients: Will a kinesitherapy help the hoggish hamster? Is a musictherapy the right treatment for the vegetarian cat? Show that you have the courage, the right tactics and the necessary pinch of luck to become the chief physician .....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You work as veterinarians in a nutty pet clinic. The animals there are not really ill but&lt;br/&gt;a little strange. The patients cards show how many therapy points are needed to heal the patients. To gather therapy points you have to deal with the strange therapies in the nutty pet clinic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every therapy card is worth at least one therapy point. In order to cure your animal patients it requires a lot of therapy cards. Therapy cards are uncovered one after the other and placed in a row. Whoever thinks that enough therapy cards are displayed places his doctor figure below the last uncovered therapy card, since as soon as a second therapy card of the same kind is uncovered, chaos breaks out in the nutty pet clinic, ending this phase of the game immediately. Whoever has placed his doctor figure in time receives one therapy point for every uncovered therapy card up to his doctors figure, the others are left empty-handed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To gather a larger amount of therapy points, the players have to use the special functions of the clinic rooms on the gameboard. Having gathered enough therapy points the players place their feeding bowls in clinic rooms. With the feeding bowls the players gather more therapy points so that they can cure the stranger patients. &lt;br/&gt;So it's up to the players to seek a career in the nutty pet clinic and reach the upper clinic floors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Action cards allow special actions and provide surprising events. The player who cures many patients and thus collects most victory points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
