			<description>By my Code!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you plan on running a game of knights and honor? Want to play a knight in your upcoming campaign? Then A Squire&amp;rsquo;s Guide to All Things Knightly is the book for you. Inside you will find 24 pages of knightly facts, from an exhaustive list of the different noble titles to the different parts of a knight&amp;rsquo;s armor to a discussion of the knightly code of honor with many classic examples. Add to that a huge 34-page role playing appendix with advice on how to play a myriad of classic knight types in several different campaign styles from high fantasy to science fiction, plus a collection of useful universal record sheets, and you have a guide that is a truly useful reference to all things knightly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Squire&amp;rsquo;s guide was originally produced as a children's teaching tool for the New Jersey Renaissance Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been considerably expanded to become more adult in tone, although it is still an in-character guide to the knightly life. The appendix takes this information and applies it to many aspects of role playing a knight and provides appropriate record sheets. ZIP file contains both a book fold and on-screen version of the Guide (48 half-pages/24 full pages) and the Appendix (68 half-pages/34 full pages).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Publisher Blurb]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
