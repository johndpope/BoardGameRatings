			<description>from The 1-page Rules Summary:&lt;br/&gt;All characters are defined by a short list of Traits, which represent their skills, talents, and other abilities. Each Trait is ranked on a scale from one to ten, with four being average. Special abilities, such as magic, super- powers, and other privileges are handled in the same way. The player defines what they can do, and how they work, along with any limitations on their power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a Trait is tested, the player rolls two six-sided dice and adds their Rank in the Trait. The margin of success or failure determines the quality of the attempt. When two characters are in direct competition with one another, one side rolls the dice, and the other adds 7 to their Rank. Supporting Traits can give modifiers to a roll by making a linked roll to try and gain an advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
