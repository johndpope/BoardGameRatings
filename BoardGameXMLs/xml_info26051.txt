							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Day Full of Energy</name>
									
			<description>Energy as a concept is not easy; scientists believe that the amount of energy in the universe is constant, not used up, but converted from one form to another. The original science through literacy resources (shown opposite) followed a family&amp;rsquo;s day and all the different types of energy they encountered: a day full of energy &amp;ndash; from the energy inside them, to that found and used around them. Stimulating young children to understand the value of energy and how not to waste it, is vital. This boardgame has been developed as an extension to the resource pack and posters, following requests from teachers already using the material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has been designed for use within the primary school, linking science and literacy at various skill levels. On the following pages, are not only background information, facts and ways to play the game, but also suggested variations and ideas for follow up activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
