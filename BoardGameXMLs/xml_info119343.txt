			<description>RECALL is designed to measure and improve your ability to recall information. RECALL does not require exception memory capabilities but rather relies on organizational techniques to help you organize information to improved memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does RECALL work? There are six thematic game boards with different pictures on each board. There are eighty tiles with pictures on each board. There are eighty tiles with pictures of familiar objects printed one each tile. The object of the game is to place these tiles face down on the game board, and use cues from the images on the board to the develop associations that assist you in recalling which object is on each tiles as you turn them over. You can start with just a few tiles and work up to recalling the objects on dozens of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RECALL can be played as a single-player activity, as a cooperative game, or as a competitive game. It can also be used as a great learning tool for kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be surprised how well your organizational techniques work. You will see improvement in your recall capability immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For competitive play two or more players can play the game competitively. Each player takes a turn selecting, placing, and turning over Object Tiles. The number of correct Object Tiles is recorded and the player with the most correctly placed tiles wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play cooperatively all players collectively decide on where to place Object Tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
