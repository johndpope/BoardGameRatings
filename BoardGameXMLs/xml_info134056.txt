			<description>3 different Game Modes are waiting for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHAIN REACTION&lt;br/&gt;Meet Blasties with a very sensitive and unbalanced system which makes them explode if they hit anything in the fluid. Your job here is to create a chain of subsequent explosions in order to reach a given popping percentage indicated in the top-left corner of the screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRITICAL MASS&lt;br/&gt;Meet Floaties, who attract each other very strongly. When two of these species get too close to each other they merge into a bigger, mutated entity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLECTOR&lt;br/&gt;Some Floaties are just too lazy to attract each other and merge. They don't feel the urge to team up and become a bigger and stronger entity. So you have the chance to play with them and collect them into crates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: [&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://invictus.com/games/blastwave&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://invictus.com/games/blastwave&lt;/a&gt;# The Developer Website].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
