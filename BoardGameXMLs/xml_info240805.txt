							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Save the Day Advanced Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is an attempt to expand the options available and let you create a character without the limits of Origin and Class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book also provides a system of tweaking existing powers to make them more individual and unique. Characters can be fine-tuned with Tweaks that broaden the powers available to players and GMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are presented to help create consistent Gear and Vehicles as well as robots and hidden bases. Real-world examples are also described in game terms to help players and GMs better imagine the scale and range of the items described in the game system. This may contradict some of the examples available in the Basic Rulebook so use the Advanced Rules and the upcoming Gear books as a guide as they are more accurate. A discussion of Gear items as plot devices wraps up the Gear chapter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, guidelines for running more free-form &amp;ldquo;theatre of the mind&amp;rdquo; campaigns are presented to help you transcend the game table with only the power of your imagination to drive your story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
