			<description>Each player starts with $500. The two decks of cards are shuffled separately and dealt face down onto their respective places on the game mat: the Package Cards are eight piles of four and a pile of three and all seven Door Cards are placed on seven separate spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins with an open auction for ownership of one of the Package Card stacks of four. The winner of the auction looks at another stack of four and haggles a purchase price with any of the other players. The buyer of the latest stack initiates the next deal and the game goes on until all eight stacks are gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Package cards may be redeemed for cash from the bank but the purchase price for the cards goes into the Jackpot on the game mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all eight Package Card stacks are gone, the players total their earnings and, in turn, each player chooses a Door Card. The players start with the player with the most money and play in descending order cycling a second time if necessary. The player who chooses the Jackpot Card gets all the money in the Jackpot and the player who chooses the Mystery Package Card gets the remaining Package Card stack of three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who has the most money at the end of the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
