			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses the same game mechanics that everyone remembers from the early 90s. The Classic Mode plays just like it always has, except is is now presented in a 3D 3/4 top-down view. Each level has a theme based on a different continent. The other major difference from the traditional Minesweeper, is that this game has different shapes to the grid pattern. The outline is not always going to be square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-player game is a little unusual. All the players are working at the same time to try and mark as many mines as they can before their opponents do. This is available either locally or on the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
