			<description>It is near future, the energy sources and drinking water have almost depleted from earth and the apocalypse is closing in. And it is closing fast. Humanity's last hope is to escape to space stations, in which there ain't enough room for everybody.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players represent different nations with different leaders, all having different powers. Their goal is to build a working rocket and launch it to space before everybody else. The requirements for the working rocket change every game, and are only partially known to players. The rockets have four different aspects  which can be build to higher levels, highest one being level 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is separated to phases which happen simultaneously to all players. First there's production in which each player produces whats printed in their country-sheet, plus any specials they might have earned throughout the game. After production comes building/trading, players can only build one part of the rocker per turn but can freely trade anything (knowledge, materials etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After producing and building players draw one card from the event deck. Some of the events help players, some don't. Some give them more time to build, and some bring doomsday clock closer to midnight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game ends when event-deck runs out, or when somebody decides to launch his rocket and the launch is succesful (meets all the requirements).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basis and rules for this game were created in a 25-hour happening organized by Helsinki city library in 14.-15.3.2014. The game will be available mostly through libraries in Finland, but currently there are no plans to repringt it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
