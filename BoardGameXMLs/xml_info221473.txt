			<description>La Dispute is enlisting your help in coming up with the ideal setlist. Mirroring the way the band builds performance sets in real life, you'll arrange themed subsections (called Blocks), using the right songs in the right combinations to earn the most Applause Points. However, Broken Strings and Technical Difficulties might disrupt your plans...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carder Harmonies is a card game for 1-3 players (competitive or collaborative mode available for multiplayer games). Using various Song cards covering the entire discography of the post-hardcore band La Dispute, players use their hand of 3 cards to populate Set Blocks with Songs, abiding of course by that Block's special conditions (a variety of song counts, allowing songs of only certain records, or heavy/soft dynamics). When a Block condition is met, that Block becomes closed and those songs are safe from the banes of Technical Difficulties, Broken Strings, and other immediate action cards in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New to the game in 2nd edition are Block Modifiers, a type of card to add additional restrictions to a single block, granting bonus applause at the end of the game for achieving the listed goal or costing you the same amount upon failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all their Set Blocks are closed, players then tally their Applause Points, accounting for a Song's individual worth, any special conditions granting bonus points, and a streak of consecutive Songs from the same record. Solitaire players aim to surpass a given Applause threshold for their chosen difficulty level, while 2 player mode has the players aiming to score higher than their opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
