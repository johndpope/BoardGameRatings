			<description>Can't get enough of swapping puzzle games, but want something different? Swap till you drop with Super Swap!, an exciting blend of arcade action and match-3 fun. Drag colorful blocks in one of 4 directions to connect 3 or more blocks and clear the board. As new blocks fall, you'll have to move fast to keep the stack from reaching the top! Experience plenty of twists and never-seen-before gameplay as you make combos, collect special power-ups and gain additional points in 4 different game modes. With so much fast and furious puzzling fun, you'll never want to stop the swapping!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
