			<description>The gameboard shows a grid of Dutch fields. On many intersections, there are one, two or three houses. Two playing pieces and a blockade piece are randomly placed on three intersections, and a sand timer or stopwatch counts 60 seconds. In that time, players have to find a route from one playing piece to the other that goes through as many houses as possible, while making no more than four turns. They have to write down that number of houses before the time runs out. &lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest number shows their path first - if successful, they get that number and everyone else gets whatever they wrote without being checked. If the highest player fails, they get two points less than the lowest player and the second highest shows their path, etc. So bluffing is encouraged, as long as you don't bid too high. &lt;br/&gt;First player to reach 55 points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
