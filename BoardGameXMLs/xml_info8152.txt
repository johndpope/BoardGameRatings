			<description>A 2 player basketball game. You choose three of the five available types of players to make up your team (each having a bonus for offensive movement, defensive movement, shooting, etc). You takes turns playing offense. The offensive player has 3 turns to play a card (1/turn) and get a shot off. The offensive player can move and pass the ball around, the defensive player move to block the offensive player, steal the ball, or block the shot. If the offensive player does not get a shot off by the end of the 3rd turn, its a turnover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The closer you are to the basket, the easier the shot. There are two ways to resolve shots, either a simple roll of the twelve-sided die, with longer shots being tougher, or by a little dexterity shot where you flick a basketball up on a slightly angled board, and try to get it in the basket. The farther away you are on the main board, the further back you have to attempt the dexterity shot with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second in Grapac Japan's series of games under the label &amp;quot;Aeronaut&amp;quot;. They are meant to be very fast playing (around 15-30 minutes). They all come in a file-type holder, with the inside of the file being the game board, and all of the components attached to the ring-binder in bags and pouches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
