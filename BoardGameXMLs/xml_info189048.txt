It was developed by three different designers in a randomized, anonymous fashion.  For details, and for information on how the versions are structured, see the series RPGGeek entry here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge 2015. All of the entries are available here: #Threeforged RPG Design Challenge Winners and Everything&lt;br/&gt;Stage One: James Iles; Stage Two: Jeff Ricks; Stage Three: Bill White&lt;br/&gt;Stage One and Two Title: Stardust Contenders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Pitch:&lt;br/&gt;First contact as a sports movie - humanity is invited to send a delegation to an interstellar Olympics just 5 years after making contact with a pan-galactic interstellar confederation, and so must send a delegation equally adroit at diplomacy, anthropology, game theory and athletics to represent the Earth. Its inspirations are a hybrid of Mass Effect and Cool Runnings, with a dash of The Player of Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intro:&lt;br/&gt;It has been five years since mankind first made contact with sentient alien life. Soon, the first games will begin.  Humanity has sent its best team to the Galactic Arena, to represent the human race among the species that make up the Galactic Council and win a place for humanity as a full-fledged member of pan-galactic civilization.  The stakes are high!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
