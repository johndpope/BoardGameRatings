			<description>Introducing Black Squad&lt;br/&gt;the battle between Viper Circle and Peacemaker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mysterious cases are being reported all over the world&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;It appears that Viper Circle is the group behind these criminalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the CIA&amp;rsquo;s report, Viper Circle is known as an international corporation operating legitimate&lt;br/&gt;businesses. However, there may be more that lies beneath the corporation&amp;rsquo;s fa&amp;ccedil;ade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In truth, Viper Circle is a ruthless organization, attracting all criminal forces and activities around the world;&lt;br/&gt;utilizing them for profit. Currently, the force of their organization is so strong,&lt;br/&gt;that the CIA has deemed themselves incapable of handling the notorious group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to their inability to handle such extreme measures, members of the UN have banded together&lt;br/&gt;to form the Global Anti-Terrorist Taskforce formally known as, Peacemaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peacemaker&amp;rsquo;s mission is to stop Viper Circle, and be the leading force involved in saving the world from future threats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tensions begin to boil, as both groups continue to overthrow each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To join Viper Circle and dominate the World? Or save the world with Peacemaker?&lt;br/&gt;The war has begun. Which side will you join?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
