			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here be Dragons is a roleplaying game of adventuring into the darkest corners of the world, shooting strange creatures and avoiding the jealousy of your colleagues. What&amp;rsquo;s hit is history, what&amp;rsquo;s missed is mystery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Here be Dragons the player characters, who we will call Explorers from here on in, journey into the darkest areas of the world, the unexplored areas, the areas where 'here be dragons' might be written on a map, to find, shoot and catalogue all manner of strange beasts, birds and insects. The dragons of the title are not literal dragons, but the metaphorical dragons of sailors' tales, myth and legend. Along the way they will overcome obstacles described to them by the Guide, as well as their seething jealousy of the other players and their desire to be the best and come out on top no matter what. The game is set in and around 1850 &amp;ndash; 1860, the period of Darwin and Wallace and the beginning of the theory of evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
