							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ungame: Catholic Version</name>
									
			<description>The Ungame - Catholic Version is a redesign of the classic Ungame packaged with the updated standard Ungame board and two new decks of cards with questions specifically meant to start discussion on the Catholic faith of the game participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players roll the dice and travel around the game board answering questions along the way. The journey's the thing, as there is no finish line and no losers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will answer questions from one of two decks. Deck one is light hearted and meant to break the ice. Deck two is deeper and meant to be more thought provoking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of questions from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you could meet three famous Catholics from past or present, who would you choose? Why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have a patron saint? Who? Why did you choose that person?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do you think HEAVEN is like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does your Catholic faith show in your actions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
