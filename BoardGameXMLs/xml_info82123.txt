			<description>Sports Champions is a 2010 sports video game for the PlayStation 3, which utilizes the PlayStation Move controllers. It was officially unveiled at the 2010 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The game is a collection of modern and medieval sports games published by Sony Computer Entertainment and is jointly developed by San Diego Studio and Zindagi Games as a launch game for the PlayStation Move which would be bundled with the controller in several regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game involves the player taking part in six unique sports games. However unlike Wii Sports, a similar collection of sports games for the Wii, the game consists of a series of modern as well as medieval sports. The game deviates from the norm by including uncommon sports such as Disc Golf and Bocce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to participate as one of ten athletes in the various events. The game features three gameplay modes, Free Play, Challenge Mode and Champion Cup mode. In Free Play mode, players can play practice matches with their choice of gameplay options. Challenge mode allows players to compete in a series of events to increase their high scores. In Champion Cup mode, players compete against ten other athletes in an Olympic-like event to become the ultimate champion. Players can also take part in the various modes along with up to three other friends in the game's multiplayer mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Sports Champions&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
