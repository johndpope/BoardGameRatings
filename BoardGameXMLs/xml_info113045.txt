			<description>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Before the Age of Television, the Dream Palaces ruled the Land of Entertainment. Week after week, Hollywood ground out celluloid fantasies for the masses. The people came into the large, ornate theaters to worship before flickering images of their favorite stars, to be informed by the newsreels, and laugh at the animated funnies.&lt;br/&gt;But that was long ago. The Palaces have been replaced by hives of tiny cracker boxes. The Glamor of Hollywood has lost much, but not all, of its shine.&lt;br/&gt;However, the Magic of the Movies still exists. There is the subtle thrill of descending into the dimly lit theater with a cold drink in one hand and popcorn in the other and being transported with everyone else in the theater to the dream that lights up on the silver screen.&lt;br/&gt;Dream Palace is a game that allows you and your friends and family to create stories in the style of the movies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
