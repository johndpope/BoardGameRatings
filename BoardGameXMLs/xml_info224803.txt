							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Daisy Chain</name>
									
			<description>Basic idea: In Daisy Chain, players conduct a &amp;quot;Battle of the Garden Paths.&amp;quot;  Players aim to place paving stones of their color into a garden courtyard in order to construct a path leading to more flowers than any of their opponent's garden paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Daisy Chain is played on a hexagonal grid surrounded by flowers.   On a player's turn, the player rolls &amp;quot;bug dice,&amp;quot; which determine what cells on the grid are eligible for a stone placement. A player then places a single stone of his/her color into one of these cells; once placed, stones never move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the board is full or both players pass, chains of stones in each color will have been made.  Players count how many flowers each chain of theirs touches.  The player with the chain that touches the most flowers wins.  In case of a tie, players compare their second-highest-scoring chains, and so on, until the tie is broken.  Draws are impossible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
