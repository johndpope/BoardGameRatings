			<description>It's time to make salsa! But will you have the ingredients needed to make a salsa bowl that suits a customer's order...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Red Hot Silly Peppers, players have a hand of four pepper and fruit cards from a deck of 64. The pepper cards have varying degrees of heat depending on which pepper they feature (+5 to +30), while the fruit cards reduce the heat in a salsa (-5 to -20). Your goal is to create a &amp;quot;salsa bowl&amp;quot; by playing two or more cards from your hand that collectively match the &amp;quot;heat&amp;quot; of the current order, plus or minus five degrees. The target is determined with a spinner marked in increments from 10 to 100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, you draw a card, then either use a special action card, discard a card, or try to make salsa by playing cards from your hand. When you make salsa, other players can trump your salsa by playing a &amp;quot;salsa bowl&amp;quot; with the correct value and at least one card more than you played. Whoever plays the best (i.e. largest) salsa claims all the cards played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the deck runs out, players have one more chance to make salsa, then the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
