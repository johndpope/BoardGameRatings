							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WWF Superstars Card Game</name>
									
			<description>WWF Superstars Card Game was sold in double packs featuring two WWF wrestlers.  Each wrestler is represented by a 30-card deck, although the card distribution is identical for each deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players draw a hand of four cards and take turns either playing or discarding a card and then drawing a new one.  Players try to have the highest Takedown card in the center stack.  Break] cards restart the stack.  If a player is unable to play a card, they must discard.  If your opponent discards, you can then play a Pin card, which can only be defeated by an Illegal Hold.  If you are able to play two &lt;i&gt;Pin&lt;/i&gt; cards and then a Referee, you gain 3 points, and a new round begins.  Else, if both players' decks run out, the last player to play a card gains 1 point.  The first player to 5 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out of the box, the game is for 2 players.  However, a second set allows for 4-player tag team matches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
