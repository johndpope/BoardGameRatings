			<description>From the Perilous Journeys Kickstarter:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my &amp;ldquo;fantasy heartbreaker&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; a game that strives to marry my memories of playing original D&amp;amp;D in the late 1970s with my love for Dungeon World, with added inspiration from the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG. If you're familiar with Funnel World, one of my previous projects, you might call this Advanced Funnel World. It&amp;rsquo;s a 32-page, digest-size book, content-complete and currently in playtesting with my weekly game group. The PCs&amp;mdash;comprised of the classic four classes of Fighter, Thief, Cleric, and Magic-User&amp;mdash;plunder the wilderness for treasure, with the goal of stashing enough away to one day retire. Character generation is mostly randomized (down to name and appearance), and the fatality rate is high; survival is the name of the game. Arcane and divine magic are volatile, and their effects are subject to structured negotiation. For instance, arcane spells are generated using a Vancian spell name table that holds the potential for more than a million different spells, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to the player and GM to decide what each spell does in play according to its name. The three spells the Magic-User had in a recent playtest session were &amp;quot;Barbaheer's Ingenious Wings,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Enveloping Hammer,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Munnohulik's Entangling Aether.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;From the Designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freebooters is a &amp;quot;hack&amp;quot; of Dungeon World, using the same basic ruleset as DW but modified to suit the &amp;quot;treasure-hunting in the wilderness&amp;quot; theme. It depends on knowledge of Dungeon World, and on the exploration mechanics in Perilous Journeys. For example, rules for character creation, 4 playbooks, an equipment list, and a comprehensive set of moves are included, but it uses the DW rules for monsters, so no rules for monsters are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Release date: Sept. 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
