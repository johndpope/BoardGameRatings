			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially released for GURPS Second Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First version was 60 loose single-sided copies of the character sheet provided in the basic set with 6 different 'dummies&amp;quot; for modeling a character portrait. No blank sheets for the character portraits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second version consisted of 60 double-side character sheets plus four two-sided Grimoire forms (cover says eight, but that's only if one counts each side of the page as a separate form).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-four of the character sheets have models to base a character portrait on. There are six drawings total (3 male, 3 female) each of which is repeated four times. The rest of the sheets have blank portrait spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
