			<description>RENEGADE OPS&amp;trade; puts players in a mobile commando unit sent behind enemy lines to defeat Inferno, a madman intent on global domination. Defeat enemies across a range of stunning environments using a wide variety of vehicles, from tanks armed to the teeth to fully loaded helicopters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have the choice to fight alone in single player mode, team up offline with two-player split screen or join the dynamic 4-player online co-op experience. Blast your way through enemy lines by working together, or compete for achievements as you and your friends aim to top the online leader boards. Unleash your full arsenal of weapons and destroy anything that stands in your path as you battle to protect the free world in any way possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madman Inferno, the commander of a sinister terrorist organisation, has detonated a devastating bomb to demonstrate the power of his new deadly weapon. Furious at the world&amp;rsquo;s leaders decision not to fight against Inferno, General Bryant has recruited a crack team of military specialists, known as the RENEGADE OPS, from around the globe to wage war against Inferno&amp;rsquo;s promise of world domination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
