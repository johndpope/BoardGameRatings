			<description>from the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global Cooling is an &amp;ldquo;energetic&amp;rdquo; family board game invented by Danes and produced in Denmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all about placing as many Global Windmills on as many of the World&amp;rsquo;s 7 Continents as possible. To get the right to place a Global Windmill on one of the World&amp;rsquo;s 7 Continents you need to have been able to place a Forrest and a Windmill on your Lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You receive a salary each time you pass START including a bonus in case you have made wise environmental disposition! You need money to build up a windmill empire! You can increase your income and your chances of winning the game by investing in sustainable energy solutions such as buying an Electric car, Solar Panels for you House &amp;ndash; or by winning in the Casino. If you are lucky you may even receive a contribution from the Global Cooling Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are in need for cash you may pawn your assets at any time. But be aware - it can be risky! The other players might get a chance to buy your pawned assets if they subsequently land on the Pawn square where you have placed your pawned assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You occasionally get the opportunity to draw so-called &amp;ldquo;Global Cards&amp;rdquo; which describe realistic climate and/or environmental scenarios giving you either an advantage or a disadvantage in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards the end of the game there will often be a hectic race against the other players. The winner of the game is the player who first passes START having placed the most Global Windmills on the World Map - subject to all 7 Global Windmill having been placed on all the World&amp;rsquo;s 7 Continents &amp;ndash; alternatively the player who first succeeds in having placed a total of 4 Global Windmills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
