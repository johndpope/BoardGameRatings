							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Metapontum Peace Chess</name>
									
			<description>Metapontum is a cooperative abstract strategy game created and promoted by Dutch designer Hans Theo Frenkel and the foundation he created, for the purpose of promoting world peace. It is played on an 8x8 hexagonal board with 16 pieces on each side, that have movement very similar to those in Chess, and are abstract as in Chess. The goal of Metapontum is for both sides to exchange their pieces from their chosen opening setup to their chosen end setup in a minimum amount of moves. On every turn, a player can either move one of his pieces or exchange one of his pieces with one of his opponent's, as long as his piece has line of sight to the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frenkel's web site sells various game boards made out of either cardboard, wood or stone. Frenkel claims that all games are produced under fair trade practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
