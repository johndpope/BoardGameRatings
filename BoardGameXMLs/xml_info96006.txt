							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Assassins of Abu-Dala</name>
									
			<description>Website blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Who can stop the Assassins of Abu-Dala from their murderous campaign. An adventure for 4 to 8 characters of levels 5 to 10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Background:&lt;br/&gt;Deep into in the shifting sands of the Empty Quarter stands the lonely mountain. Its ragged flanks of black stone thrust high from the dunes that ebb and flow with the eternal winds that scour the arid continent from its furnace like interior to its rocky, spray drenched shores. Few know of the mountain, but those that do, fear it well.&lt;br/&gt; The rumors told by the simple shepherds who herd their emaciated goats occasionally through the area say that the mountain was once the home of the old man of the mountain; better known as the father of assassins. Whatever the truth of these tales, if there be truth in them at all, the mountain and the fortress within it has become the focus of a recent series of disturbing events. The assassins have returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is available as a free download from Dragonsfoot.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
