			<description>The object of the game is to win the most money by getting to the planets Mercury through Saturn from Earth and claiming their mineral resources.  Each player gets a space-o-meter to record the number of millions of miles they have traveled on each leg of the journey.  Movement is governed by a spaceship spinner that advances from 10 to 90 million miles per turn.  To claim a planet, you have to be the first to have your mileage hit the orbit range of a planet.  For example, to claim Mercury, you have to hit the 100 to 130 million mile range.  If you go over, you have to reverse your direction and  start subtracting mileage for each spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all planets are claimed, you add up the value of your planets.  These range from 10 billion dollars for Mercury's gold to 50 billion dollars for Saturn's plutonium.  These are very generous sums for 1951!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has rich retro decco graphics.  The artwork is very similar to the 2005 Zathura: Adventure is Waiting.  In fact, the spaceships are nearly identical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
