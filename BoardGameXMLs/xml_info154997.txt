							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Three Hearts over Glitterhaegen</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love in a Time of Adventure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is it that we are comfortable with slaughter, mayhem, and looting corpses in our games, but not themes of love? The answer is that most of us will never face down an orc armed only with our knowledge of the arcane arts and our trusty wand, but all of us have felt the pain and joy of love. It is easy therefore to treat an encounter with an orc as fun, but mushy stuff makes some of us uncomfortable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three adventures follow classic, maybe even clich&amp;eacute; quest formats: the delivery, the fetch quest, the treasure hunt. Classics. For groups that are looking for a little valentines day massacring without getting their characters directly involved in the romance they are great adventuresÍ¾ they can also act as a springboard for discussion on including romance themes in games (if you want to have such a discussion). I know of at least one 13th Age group that has a player character romancing an icon, and at conventions I often see One Unique Things that deal with romance, so maybe your group is ready for it. Or maybe not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
