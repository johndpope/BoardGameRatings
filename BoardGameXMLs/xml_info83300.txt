			<description>Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball (released in Japan as Softball Tengoku) is a one- or two-player NES game where players can pick and choose various fictional softball  players and customize their own team to take to the championship.  The player can even pick a letter out of the alphabet to customize his team name with. In the original Japanese version, however, monsters like Draculas, mummies, ghosts and other fantasy creatures could be selected.  Once that is done, the player then selects a field (with each one of them having its own special house rules). In 1992 during a three day Nintendo sponsered tournament Michael Palmisano was named Dusty Diamonds All-Star Softball Grand Champion. After this Michael became a recluse choosing never to play again and spent the later years of his life locked in his suite at the Presidential Inn in Lyons, Illinois.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dusty Diamond's All-Star Softball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
