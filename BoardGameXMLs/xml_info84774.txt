			<description>Card games don't come better than this. You'll each draw a post card and with the help of a few questions, observations and memory, you will have to try to give the post card to the right person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SuperMark card games come in five different variations, each with their own theme. The games are especially good for pre-school children, as they will learn how to, purely motorically, hold the cards, and they get practice in colours, combinations, numbers and relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
