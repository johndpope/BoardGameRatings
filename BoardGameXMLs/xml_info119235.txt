			<description>From Introduction in the beginning of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orbit game system (fully explained in this one book) covers individual characters, items, armies, starship battles, planets, weapons, governments, and galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, there's a long list of different alien races, creatures, androids, and pirates &amp;amp; other assorted rogues.  Although, unlike other science-fiction adventure, or &amp;quot;space opera&amp;quot; roleplay games, your character may meet any of them, or even be any of them, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's just one thing which makes Orbit different from the rest.  Added to that, the system itself is easy to understand and flexible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No level-limits on careers.&lt;br/&gt;No penalties based on gender.&lt;br/&gt;No boundaries on your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Orbit, roleplaying the way it was meant to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
