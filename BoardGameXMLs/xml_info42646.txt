			<description>Manufacturer description: &amp;quot;Alien Invaders is a game for all Ages 5 and up. The rules are easy to learn (less than 60 seconds),however, because of the possible combinations of moves it could take one a lifetime to master.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Alien Invaders is unlike any other board game. The game board is unique in every respect. Not only is it printed lenticular, but also it can be rolled up into a tube and when released from the tube immediately returns to a flat configuration.  It is waterproof and&amp;nbsp;virtually weatherproof and can be played in any environment.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
