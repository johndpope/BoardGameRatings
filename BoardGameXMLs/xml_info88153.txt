			<description>From the original rules:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;OLTCIT Rally (Raliul OLCIT) is an attractive competition game created in order to learn the road signs along with their meaning, racing elements and specific terminology.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is made from 65 modular plastic tiles, 43 having numbers on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After choosing the favorite color of your car, when your turn comes, you role one die and move on the board with a number of spaces equal with the number depicted on it. After this, you search the space number in the game rules to see what you have to do:pay taxes,receive points, low speed, high speed, going forward, going backwards, or do nothing (if the tile you are sitting on is blank).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this way you can earn or lose points. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
