							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake</name>
									
			<description>Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake is a downloadable video game for the PSP made by Titan Studios and sold by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the second game in the Fat Princess series, with six more levels than the original and an expanded single player story mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake is primarily a zero to twenty-four multiplayer game with the basic goal of rescuing the Princess and bringing her back to the team's base. The players pick up and carry cakes to feed the Princess which makes her heavier and therefore harder for the enemy to carry back to their own castle. The game contains six character classes (The Villager, The Worker, The Priest, The Ranger, The Mage, and The Warrior) each of which helps contribute to the team's task of capturing the princess in a unique way over 17 different maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake, the player joins one of two opposing groups with the goal of rescuing their team's princess from the other team's castle. In order to make their opponents' task more difficult, players can feed the captive princess more and more cake slices so that she will become heavier and harder to carry back to her respective castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
