							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Zombified (Powered by Fate)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about the zombification of the entire population of Earth, and it is set in a period when this process is already well under way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zombie apocalypse has already come, in some places faster, in other places slower. Some areas have managed to keep the worst ravages at bay, but these areas are small and shrinking. The world will never be the same again. It's been zombified!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes the rules from FATE Core as the game system, and no other books are necessary to enable you to start play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes rules for zombies, character creation, special zombie combat rules, details and maps of New York State after the zombie apocalypse, and a starter adventure to get you into the swing of zombie survivalism gaming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So grab a rifle and a tactical hatchet, and let's kill some zombies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
