							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Aleph Beis Race Game</name>
									
			<description>The Great Aleph Beis Race Game is designed to teach children the Hebrew alphabet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are given a card showing a Hebrew word and they must find the hidden letters on the board which make up this word. The game board displays a town through which players must race their cars (player tokens) in order to collect the Hebrew letters. Using a spinner, players travel along coloured paths which direct them to the hidden letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to complete the word on their card and return to the starting point wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
