			<description>Puck! is an ice hockey simulation game. Each player receives a hand of nine cards showing either a player position (Defenseman, Wing, Thug, or Center) or an action (such as Hook, Line Change, Breakaway or Great Save) as well as a value.  Generally, players have higher values, but lack the special abilities given by action cards.&lt;br/&gt;To begin play, each player simultaneously plays reveals one card for the faceoff.  After seeing the opponent's play, each person chooses two other cards to add to their play. Whichever players set of 3 cards has the highest total value has the advantage and may take a shot.  A card from the draw pile is flipped over in order to decide if the shot was on goal and what the target number for success will be, then one more card is flipped over.  If the value of the second card, plus any modifiers from players cards such as Breakaway, or by having a much higher three card value than your opponent exceeds the target number, a goal has been scored.  If there is no goal, players check for penalties (if a Hook was played) or fights (if each team played a Thug), both of which are resolved by reducing the hand size of one of the players.&lt;br/&gt;Play continues with the cards in hand, even if one side is unable to play 3 cards from injury or penalties.  If at the start of a round, a player has no cards, they draw a new hand of nine (a Line Change).  Line Changes also occur after goals (for both teams) or by playing a Line Change card during a round.&lt;br/&gt;Once the deck is exhausted and not enough cards are left to complete a round, the period ends.  The player with the most goals after three periods wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
