							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Dominoes</name>
									
			<description>Space Dominoes consists of a forty card deck, with each card being divided into three sections and each section containing 0-3 pips in one of three colors (threes are red, twos are blue, ones are yellow). Each player begins the game with a hand of 6-7 cards depending on the number of players, and one card is laid face up on the table as a starting card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, a player lays one card from hand onto the end of a card on the table, covering one or two sections of that card with one or two matching sections on the played card. If the player covers one section, they draw one card, then end their turn; if they cover two sections, they can play again immediately, still drawing one card and ending their turn whenever they play something that covers only one section or can't find another play. (A player can optionally choose to draw cards at the start of their turn.) If a player can't make a legal play, they must draw cards from the deck until they can make a play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to play all their cards wins the hand. If no further plays are possible, the player with the lowest pip count wins the hand. In either case, the winner scores the pip count of cards in hand from the pip count of each opponent, then scores the sum of these values. To determine the overall winner, you can play to a particular point total or play a certain number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
