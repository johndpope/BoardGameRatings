			<description>In Sequence, the computer will think up a random sequence of five colors. The object is to guess this exact sequence in twenty turns or less. For each turn, you guess a sequence of five colors. If you are correct, you win. Otherwise, you will be told, in order, (1) how many of the five colors you guessed are in the solution in the same place as they are in your guess, and (2) how many of the five colors you guessed are in the solution in different places than they are your guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
