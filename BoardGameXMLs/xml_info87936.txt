							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fusion 2</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2907 the Xylons have been on Earth for a year. Masquerading as an harmless race of alien workers, they have infiltrated every important industry and taken control of all strategic points of the planet. Only you can free your homeworld by entering the Xylon complex, disrupting their computer network and finding a way to overload their fusion reactor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fusion 2 is a side-scroller action game. The player explore the Xylon base, destroying defense robots, energy barriers and computers along the way. Once all the computers of the level have been destroyed, the player can use the teleportation machine to go to the next level. There are no power-ups in the game, but the player's hit points and energy levels (used to power the laser gun and the jetpack) are recharged over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
