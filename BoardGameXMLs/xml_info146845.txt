							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of the Cult of Nagfa</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;400 years ago built into the foot of a volcano, upon a gloomy and barely accessible swamp not far from the island of Kos was a dark temple where evil men alongside diabolical monsters performed secret rituals. Among them was Nagfa, a most vile troll whose sole intent was to demoralize and enslave the nearby realm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then it came, The Great Cataclysm devastated the known world as well as the evil plans Nagfa had set into motion to achieve his dastardly goal.  The world, in its destruction, had been spared what may have been a more horrific and terrible fate. Not for over seventy-five years has there been worse than the occasional hobgoblin harassing travelers, until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rumors of evil dealings and long forgotten creatures have been spreading and a group led by Atticus TouD&amp;iacute;a, The Duke's son has disappeared, bringing fear back to the region.   It is up to you and your fellow adventurers to bring peace to the region and find Atticus.  Or will the swamps returning evil claim your very souls?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rise of the Cult of Nagfa is author and game designer John F Kadolph's second published adventure module. Rise of the Cult of Nagfa takes place in the Free Lands of Zinovia which will be the focal point of the adventure path series of books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
