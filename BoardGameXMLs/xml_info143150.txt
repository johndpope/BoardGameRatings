			<description>Scroll down to Web Links to read the full rulebook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chi is a strategy game for 2-3 Players.&lt;br/&gt;Each Player takes control of 5 Zodiacs, and must use their Chi to maneuver their pieces, and capture the opponent's Zodiacs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each Player's turn, they have 3 Chi (or 3 Action Points) to spend. A Player must spend all of their Chi, or they must pass their turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Player has a variety of different choice they can take on their turn. For (1) Chi, they can move (1) Zodiac, or add a &amp;quot;Push&amp;quot; to one of their Zodiacs, they can also move the &amp;quot;Void&amp;quot; (1) space, or swap any of their adjacent Zodiacs.&lt;br/&gt;Using this Chi, players will strive to complete the goal of the game: to capture all of their opponent's Zodiacs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Zodiac is captured when it is surrounded on all sides by opponent's Zodiacs, The Void, or any Void tokens.&lt;br/&gt;Once all your opponents Zodiacs are captured, or your opponent forfeits, you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
