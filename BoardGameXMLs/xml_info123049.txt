							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curious Case of the Disappeared Decktet card</name>
									
			<description>HELP! One of the cards from the original decktet has been stolen. You are on the case, like the good detective you are. The rich reward and eternal glory certainly are good motivations. Unfortunately you are not the only detective who's after the card. This makes the investigation difficult at least. &lt;br/&gt;The answers you get from your fellow detectives are ambiguous and enigmatic. So... it's up to you to find the missing card first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first Decktet deduction game. All 2-9 cards but one have been dealt out. The cards in this game all show at least 4 characteristics: one rank, two suits and one type (location, personality or event). On your turn choose two characteristics you would like to know more about. Ask the other players how many times these characteristics appear on their cards. As a detective, you will find it's just a matter of elimination. It's all quite logical...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
