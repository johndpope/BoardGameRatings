							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Era: The Consortium Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>Humanity has left Earth over a thousand years behind, landing on a new planet and founding a new government. The Consortium is an inspiring ideal: three star systems teeming with life and four species living and working together. As time passes, however, cracks are showing in the Humanity-led society, and those less scrupulous have taken power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter at any point in 500 years of playable story, following the Consortium&amp;rsquo;s growth from a small colony to a multi-system economic and political establishment. Explore new worlds and encounter alien races, direct or fight in battles which span a solar system and will decide the future of the Consortium or join a Resistance movement against the government to save or destroy billions of lives!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What you decide will define the future of the Consortium!&lt;br/&gt;This book contains the full story of the Consortium&amp;rsquo;s history, a complete guide to character creation, a list of implants, weapons, equipment and spacecraft encountered in the Consortium universe, the rules, complete with worked examples and a section for the GM which contains everything from sample campaigns to premade characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Source: From the back of the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
