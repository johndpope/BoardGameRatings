			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, a mage named Adder began an adventuring career.  Unlike his companions (who sought gold and treasure), Adder adventured to further his pursuit of knowledge. He did not seek power or wealth, except where these tools could increase the information available to him. He and his companions grew powerful and wealthy, but while they spent their fortunes on life's finer pleasures, Adder spent his on books and scrolls. Adder would let little stand between himself and knowledge.  A kind, patient man, he became intractable in his pursuit of ancient tomes.  A small town, renowned for it's libraries, once denied Adder access to the information contained therein for political reasons.  Adder, with the help of his companions, removed the mayor in a bloodless coup, and left him stranded in a town thousands of miles away.  They then took over rule of the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 7th - 10th level characters.  Usually distributed as a ZIP archive including the scenario document and nine JPG images (maps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
