			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beskuerens &amp;Oslash;je is a classic dungeon crawl with a twist. The players are playing characters from the 1990's Eye of the Beholder computer game. The human Lucas, the dwarf Cassandra, the mysterious Nystul and the half-elf Chrissy. The four have just started a dungeon crawl, but for the players it's not just about the dungeon...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario operates with two kinds of logic that are in conflict with each other. On the one hand, the &amp;quot;Role Play Logic&amp;quot;, about playing your character, is standard - to experience the situation and to create a story together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, faced with the &amp;quot;Computer Role Logic&amp;quot;, where one's options are very few, it is about knocking off monsters and going up in levels, and never worrying about what comes later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beskuerens &amp;Oslash;je is about the experience of roleplayers being caught in the computer game's internal logic and unconsciously, but surely, being lured into a particular way of thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is thus a humorous tribute to 90's computer role-playing games like Eye of the Beholder, but also a criticism of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario debuted at Viking-Con 33 (2014).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
