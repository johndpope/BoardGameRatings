							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribes Most Foul: Worgs</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bored of pitting your PCs against boring, one-dimensional kobolds, orcs and goblins? Want to provide your monstrous minions with style and flair in appearance, mannerisms and battlefield tactic? Then, Tribes Most Foul is for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each supplement presents three tribes in rich, flavoursome detail and includes notes on the tribe&amp;rsquo;s society, practises, ecology, lair, battle tactics and notable tribal personalities as well as sample stat blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribes Most Foul: Worgs presents three worg tribes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Howls From The Desolation: The keening, circling winds of the southern oceans surround a newly-separated, isolated continent drifting inexorably towards the pole. The lush temperate forests, which once housed a myriad of life, are transforming into ice wastes as the temperature plummets. In this desolation come the howls of the last sentient creatures dwelling in the frozen ruins of abandoned civilisations &amp;ndash; cruel packs of thylacine worgs ruled by a caste of powerful bone-witches.&lt;br/&gt;    The Gaolers of Bleakmoor: The wasteland of Bleakmoor, a series of flat uplands covered in low-growing scrub, is constantly shrouded in heavy rain. A single miserable fortified manor house stands dejectedly amid the downpour. The Bleakmoor Manor serves as a prison for the trapped souls of angels, captured to forever prevent their return to the upper planes. The warden, the malevolent lich-worg Cossaylor, watches over the imprisoned souls, relentlessly torturing each in turn. His undead pack vigilantly scours the grounds for intruders, never resting.&lt;br/&gt;    The Regnant Void: Deep in the parched ochre canyons of the Weranavas Badlands, a cloister of hagspawn worg mystics capture and dissect the troubled nightmares of mortals. Calling themselves the Regnant Void, the worgs hunt the dreams of mortals via the mystical, undulant canyons which channel and focus distant nightmares. After consuming a transcendent brew of poisonous and hallucinogenic herbs, the worgs stalk into the creature&amp;rsquo;s dreams to taste their terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
