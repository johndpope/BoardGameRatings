			<description>From the game rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squigle is a chess like strategy game for two players.  It is played on a specially designed game board of ninety-three squares.  Sixteen geometrically shaped pieces (called SQUIGLES) are used in play... four tee and four square that are black in color... four El and four cross that are red in color.  Though different in shape, each is mathematically computed to use the same number of squares.  The black SQUIGLES are used in play by one player and the red SQUIGLES are used by the opposing player.  SQUIGLE is simple in context and yet can be complex in play depending on the skill of the two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
