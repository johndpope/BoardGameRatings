							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">River Race</name>
									
			<description>DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;The air is clear and the water sparkling, as you and a group of friends prepare to go down the river on rafts.  With your skill set high, and the water moving swiftly and dangerously, you are anticipating an exciting run down the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you end up drenched and ejected from your raft, or will you finish first and victorious?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OBJECTIVE:&lt;br/&gt;Complete your 12 cards before everyone else&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAMEPLAY:&lt;br/&gt;Players can complete up to 5 cards each round, by rolling dice and matching them up with card goals.  You can continue going until you claim these river/downstream cards, but if you roll twice without claiming a card, you BUST and need to reset that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME ELEMENTS:&lt;br/&gt;72 cards (12 for each player) and 20 dice of three different colors (for multiple simultaneous player turns)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
