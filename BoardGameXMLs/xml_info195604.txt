			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game centers around trying to determine which of the characters is guilty of a murder.  The game is subtitled a &amp;quot;youdunit&amp;quot; because every character, during creation, is assumed to be the guilty party.  A character's backstory must include enough incriminating and contradictory data to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; they are guilty of the murder - if the information can be discovered by other characters during play.  The game proceeds in scenes with players taking turns as the primary narrator for a scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have three Attributes:  Brains, Beauty, and Braun [sic].  These have a &amp;quot;Stat&amp;quot; or numeric rating.  Characters also have various other Traits that allow them to investigate and find out about other character's secrets.  Action resolution uses a dice pool that yields a success count.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the game author/submitter was known only as &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; on the forums.  The game was entered as an text file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
