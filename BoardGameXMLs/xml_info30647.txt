			<description>(This game was a one-of-a-kind gift for Nate (Cavedog_pdx on BGG) designed and assembled by his regular gaming group. He had no idea what 14 of his friends were up to!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the English rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Game Night at Nate&amp;rsquo;s! As the regulars trickle in, the haggling begins. What to play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this highly realistic simulation, you earn points by having fun. Play lots of games with lots of people.  Earn bonus points when you play your favorite games. Better yet, dive for a seat in a game with everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite host, Nate. The player who earns the most points by the end of the evening wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
