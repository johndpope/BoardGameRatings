			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player takes the role of Kirt.  Kirt, while appearing human, is the last remaining member of a race of beings (known as &amp;quot;the People&amp;quot;) to possess the ability to shapeshift, a gift of the gods.  At the beginning of the game, evil members of his race (who were responsible for the death of his parents) find him where he has hidden on another world.  Consequently, a being he knows as his Grandfather opens a gate back to Kirt's homeworld.  From there, Kirt must track down Veste, the leader of the evil forces hunting him, and eliminate Veste once and for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played from a first-person perspective, using a 3D engine developed by id Software (between the development of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom).  At various points in the game, the player comes across obelisks, which grant the ability to take on the shape of a new fantastical creature, including but not limited to a catman, a frogman, a dragon, and a stone golem.  Each race has special abilities that allow Kirt to overcome various in-game obstacles.  The game also has an elevation meter that allows Kirt to fly (by raising the meter) or swim (by lowering it) when in a form with the relevant capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
