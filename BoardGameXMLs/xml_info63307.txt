			<description>Killer Bunnies Nu Series Promo cards available in the specially packaged Killer Bunnies Quest Blue Starter Deck and the Killer Bunnies games for Go! Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bunny White&lt;br/&gt;Nu 01: TThis is a single Specialty Bunny. The player with these bunnies down may play two cards per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interview With The Bunnies&lt;br/&gt;Nu 02: This is a double Specialty Bunny. The player with these bunnies down may play two cards per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bunnies Twain&lt;br/&gt;Nu 03: This is a triple Specialty Bunny. The player with these bunnies down may play two cards per turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;br/&gt;Nu 04: Roll all of the twelve-sided dice in your game. If a number of dice (equal to the number of players) roll any identical number, then all players move to the adjacent seat. For example, if three people are playing, then three of the numbers rolled must be the same. It does not matter what number it is, as long as there are three of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even Stephen, Odd Todd&lt;br/&gt;Nu 05: May be used once by a player who rolls the die. An Even (or Odd) roll allows a player to take an Even (or Odd) numbered Carrot from any opponent or Kaballa&amp;rsquo;s Market. For example, if a player rolls a 9, then he may take any Odd numbered Carrot from any opponent or Kaballa&amp;rsquo;s Market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Journey To The Center Of The Circle&lt;br/&gt;Nu 06: All players must place their five-card hand into a separate pile in the center of The Bunny Circle. All of the cards in the center pile are shuffled, and the player who used the card deals five cards back to each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red October&lt;br/&gt;Nu 07: Each player rolls the die in the order of play. Players who roll an Odd number must place one of their bunnies from The Bunny Circle into the Red October while players who roll an Even number may take a bunny out. The player who played the card rolls last and may roll twice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;br/&gt;Nu 08: May be used once to force any opponent to discard all cards in his five-card hand that contain the letter 'A' in the title or that have a Red button in the upper left corner (RUN cards). The player decides which option to use. The opponent must show his hand to the player to confirm that he has complied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Tale Of Two Bunnies&lt;br/&gt;Nu 09: May be given to any opponent with at least two bunnies in The Bunny Circle who must give any two of his bunnies away to other players. The opponent chooses which bunnies to give away and to whom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through The Looking Glass&lt;br/&gt;Nu 10: May be used once by a player or given to an opponent. Odd rolls increase a player&amp;rsquo;s Cabbage or Water by the amount rolled while Even numbers decrease the amounts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 Skidoo&lt;br/&gt;Nu 11: Allows all players to discard any cards in their five-card hand that have a 2 or a 3 in the Card Identification Number. Players may keep any cards that they wish. New cards are drawn immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W Is For Whammy!&lt;br/&gt;Nu 12: May be used once by a player to launch all Weapon cards in his five-card hand at any bunnies in The Bunny Circle. Weapons are launched one at a time directly from the player&amp;rsquo;s hand. All cards used must be replaced with new cards from the Draw Pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
