			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;You are Chandelle, apprentice to your famed jeweler father, who has been kidnapped by creatures under the mystic spell of the evil red dragon. Somehow, you must try to rescue him. Perhaps the pouch of gems with unknown magical powers will help...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He is Coren, a beguiling young knight hoping to prove himself on his first quest. And then there is Sir Torbeck, the older, more experienced fighter, with reasons of his own for joining you. Each one offers to help you, but each has his own way of reacting to your special magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will your fantasy adventure lead you to your first romance, or will the decisions you make carry you into realms in which there is no return? In a HEARTQUEST book, you, the reader, are challenged to PICK A PATH TO ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
