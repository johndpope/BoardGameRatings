			<description>Auction Poker is a card game based loosely on Poker. Eight cards are dealt face up and players use special bidding cards (1-5 per player) to win the cards to build their hands. Directional cards (1-3, &amp;quot;across&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;down&amp;quot;) indicate the position of the cards being bid on that round. Players reveal their bids and the lowest bidder gets first selection of three identified cards or one face down card from the deck. After all players have built their hands, the winner is determined using the regular rules of poker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
