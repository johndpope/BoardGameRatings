			<description>With two players, each player plays with seven pieces on a 4X4 grid. (Eight pieces and a larger grid are used with more players.) On his turn a player either places one of his pieces onto an open square of the grid or captures an opposing piece by jumping it. A player is forced to jump a piece if his opponent placed the piece next to the player's piece. Play ends either when one player achieves four pieces in a row or when no player has enough pieces left to form four in a row. Players score four points for completing four in a row and one point for each captured piece. Play multiple rounds until one player reaches twenty one points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
