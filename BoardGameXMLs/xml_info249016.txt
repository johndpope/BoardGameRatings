							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Soulweaver</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Soulweavers have mastered the ability to take control of souls that leave the living and turn that energy into magic. When a soul leaves the body, there is a small window of opportunity where it can be grappled within the material plane. A soulweaver is able to time it just perfectly, as to take that freshly transitioning energy and cast it immediately into an assortment of useful healing, damaging and life creating abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of their studies, weavers have adopted the use of spirit vessels, containers capable of storing this &amp;lsquo;soulforce&amp;rsquo; for later use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Soulweaver class is a completely new class, created for D&amp;amp;D 5th edition with a heavy emphasis on death and life. Soulweavers can use reactions to harvest energy from kills, store it and turn it into useful abilities and magic later on, or use the same reaction to do more interesting feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soulweaver is a low spell count, high utility class, with an opportunity for replenishing spells at a constant rate. The soulweaver class also has multi-subclass picks, allowing players to pick 2 subclasses over their class progression, creating various interesting combinations of abilities and spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comes with 6 subclasses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(includes class table seperate pdf)&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Author Summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
