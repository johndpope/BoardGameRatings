							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hit It! Tactical Card Game of Tennis</name>
									
			<description>Hit It! is a quick print &amp;amp; play card game of tennis for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a deck of 25 cards, of three types to represent different tennis shots, plus two types of cards that modify shots. Each player sets out four cards face down to form the playing surface. (Choosing these cards adds an element of deck building to the game.) Each player takes six of the remaining cards from their deck. The first player &amp;quot;serves&amp;quot; by placing a card on one of the opponent's hitting zones and draws a replacement card from his deck. The opponent then moves his player marker to the ball and selects what card he will use to hit the ball back. This continues until one player manages to place a fourth card in a particular hitting zone, or a player is unable to return the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player has won the set, i.e. six games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hit It! has abstracted tennis into a quick tactical card game, but retains the feel of the sport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
