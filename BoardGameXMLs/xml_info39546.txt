			<description>From the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Give and Take is a board game one can learn in a few minutes, although mastering it may take a little longer... like a lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simplicity and elegance with diabolical plotting and incredible depth of thought make this game worth trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This may be the only board game one may win even when trailing way behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination of chess, checkers and backgammon principles with a unique way of sacrificing pieces for position, Give and Take is destined to withstand the test of time.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start with sixteen pieces that can move one space forward or to the side, but never backwards. Pieces are captured by jumping and if a piece can capture another, it must (like ZERTZ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a piece advances to the opponent's edge of the board, it becomes a King and can now move any number of spaces in a single orthagonal direction. Also, if a player only has one piece remaining, that piece automatically becomes a king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who captures all of his/her opponent's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
