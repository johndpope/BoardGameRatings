							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Olive Tree Reformation</name>
									
			<description>In John 15:5 Christ says He is the vine and we are the branches... If we take that into account then the Protestant Reformers are also &amp;quot;the branches&amp;quot; of The Olive Tree. Towards the beginning of the 10th century most Christians lost sight of the original church's truths by means of creeping pagan compromises within their midst. In the Dark Ages the Bible and its truth was finally silenced and were instead replaced by traditions. Only a select few were allowed to read from its pages and the common people were told it would be too much for their understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then stood up reformers in the church that read the Bible and uncovered its truth. These reformers showed that the Bible was meant for one and all, thus the gospel was spread once again. However by doing these acts some of the reformers were exiled, persecuted, or even executed by the hands of the church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those that want a little more of a challenge, this version of The Olive Tree is for you! This game focuses on learning timelines of the Biblical characters and Protestant Reformers that brought the church back into the truth of scripture. Have you ever wondered in what century was Job? Where in the Bible does it show what Martin Luther believed? Why was Jan Hus burned at the stake? All will be answered!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Olive Tree Reformation is a co-operative Bible timeline game that reveals God's &amp;quot;Spiritual Family Tree&amp;quot;. Points are accumulated in the game by naming the correct character from the Branch card and connecting it to the correct level of Root or Vine cards. The game has 13 Timeline Rounds. Will you bear enough &amp;quot;Fruit Points&amp;quot; by the end of the 13th round?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
