			<description>Players divide themselves into two teams. Each team begins with $500,000, 5000 fans, and a set of playing pieces. They decide which team will be the home team and the game begins. The standard rules of baseball apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both teams ante $50,000 every inning. The ante increases by $25,000 every three innings. The team that scores more runs in the inning will win this pot. The pot rolls over if both teams score an equal number of runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the result of an at bat is rolled, the defensive team may move its playing pieces on the gameboard to indicate its defensive position. The offensive player rolls the icosikaidihedron, a 22-sided die, to determine the result of the at bat. If a base runner is in the first, second or ninth batting position then the offensive player may try for a stolen base. The game gives the offensive player a fifty-fifty chance of success for a stolen base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain events will allow either team to move its token along the Franchise gameboard. Fans are won and lost here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when the baseball game is complete. All fans won by the teams are worth $10 each. The team with more money has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
