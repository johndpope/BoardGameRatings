							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strike Dice Promo Cards</name>
									
			<description>The Promo Tricards are 8 in total and they carry different effects for the 8 Tribases you will find on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These effects have a great impact during the game since are more powerful. You can use these cards as you do with the original ones in the basic game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One basic rule applies here: The Tricards you can play must be always 8, 1 card per Tribase. Adding the promo cards we have a total of 16 ( 2 cards per tribase). Before you begin the game choose with your rivals the cards you think are better (8 in total), shuffle them and place them face down in the cantre of the board. Now you can start playing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last and important: The promo Tricards are language independent. Their effects are included in the card pack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
