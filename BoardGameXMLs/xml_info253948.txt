			<description>Try to get the best out of your arbor with planting the most valuable seeds and selling them at the right time... But the success of this business, as much as hard work, needs attention, calculation and bit of a chance... plant the best seeds, harvest them at the right time, expand your lands and make the best deals with other farmers so you can be the best farmer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jaliz is a card game for 3-7 farmers based on a popular game of Bohnanza. Jaliz has some twists in the rules and gameplay that make it a fast and smooth. For instance tractor and fertilizer tokens adds more layers of decision making, plus event cards that reveals a new surprise for all players each round!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
