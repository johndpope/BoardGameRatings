							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Rascal</name>
									
			<description>[Taken from the first section.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Allies&amp;rsquo; planned invasion of Nazioccupied France, the Allied commanders wanted to convince the German high command that a seaborne assault could happen anywhere and at any time. That would spread Axis troops out over the coast instead of concentrating them on the beaches of Normandy where the planned attack would happen. They started a disinformation plan called Operation Fortitude, designed to make Germany believe that an attack would occur to the south, in Calais; they went to the extent of staging massive radio traffic, constructing fake tanks out of wood, and leaking fake documents to known spies. The success of Operation Fortitude was so thorough that Hitler didn&amp;rsquo;t believe it was a diversion until it was too late to send the troops stationed near Calais to help the defense of Normandy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid in Operation Overlord, the actual Allied invasion bound for Normandy, French resistance groups managed to map and identify many emplacements and bunkers to help figure out the best locations to strike with their second distraction, Operation Rascal. The mission was designed to send Allied Talent Operation Groups through a portal (created by the famed Talent Pevnost) into France to cause as much damage and draw as much attention as possible, in an attempt to lure Axis forces from the fortifications on the beaches of Normandy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From grocer trucks and foot traffic, the resistance managed to locate and map everything from factories, training grounds, munitions plants, communication centers, and even down to mortar and machine gun placements. Assigning targets to the squads best suited to take them out, General Eisenhower recruited TOG squads that totaled 350 men into Operation Rascal. The squads were chosen carefully; to put a squad into Operation Rascal was to pull them from the front line of Overlord.  The Talents that were picked were the ones with the most destructive, cunning, and elusive powers that would serve them well behind enemy lines but perhaps not so well on the beaches&amp;mdash;super-spies, mesmerists, men who summoned viruses, speedsters who needed more of a runway than the scant few feet of a lander would give them&amp;mdash;and those who served in their squads. Others were picked not because of their Talents but because whoever nominated them didn&amp;rsquo;t want them to be killed on the sand of Omaha or Utah beach. Blatant and loud powers were picked alongside subtle ones, since the more attention the Rascals gathered as Talents, the more Ubermenschen would be pulled off of the front line to intervene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
