							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Cadets: Flagship</name>
									
			<description>This Flagship plastic miniature is an upgrade to the cardboard token that represents the players' ship in Space Cadets. It fits within a one inch square, and stands on its built-in pedestal to a total height of about half an inch. This was produced as a preorder incentive.  Stronghold Games has indicated that this was never to be sold after the initial release of the game, and would only be available via special giveaways thereafter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a blue plastic ship, and Space Cadets: Ship of The Line is gray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
