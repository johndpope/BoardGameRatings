							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vampire: The Eternal Struggle â€“ Legacies of Blood</name>
									
			<description>Legacies of Blood is an expansion set for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle that was published by White Wolf in 2005. The bulk of the set focuses on the Laibon, a sect of African vampires introduced in the Vampire: The Masquerade sourcebook Kindred of the Ebony Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four of the Laibon legacies are presented as standalone clans in Legacies of Blood: the Akunanse, Guruhi, Ishtarri and Osebo (bloodlines of the Gangrel, Nosferatu, Toreador and Brujah, respectively). Each of the set's four preconstructed starter decks spotlighted one of these four legacies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the support for the Laibon, Legacies of Blood booster packs also introduced a number of new cards for the bloodlines that had already been introduced in earlier sets: the Ahrimanes, Blood Brothers, Daughters of Cacophony, Gargoyles, Harbingers of Skulls, Kiasyd, Salubri (and their antitribu), Samedi and True Brujah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the sparse information on the Laibon (and, to a lesser extent, on several other bloodlines) in material published for Vampire: The Masquerade, nearly all of the crypt cards in this set feature characters who were created for V:TES rather than characters who were adapted from the roleplaying game. The same also holds true for Ebony Kingdom, a later expansion set that focused more specifically on the Laibon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crypt card Kisha Bhimji was omitted from this set due to a printing error; the crypt card Uzoma (intended to be exclusive to the Osebo starter deck) was accidentally printed for inclusion in booster packs in its place. Kisha Bhimji was later given out as a promotional card at tournaments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
