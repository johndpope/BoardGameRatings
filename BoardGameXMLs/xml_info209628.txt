			<description>An educational travel game regulated by the draw of movement cards (that allow one to choose routes combining different means of transportation) rather than dice. It includes a trivia component (wrong reply to a trivia question concerning the visited location makes player miss a turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first to visit a pre-set, random list of locations wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is double-sided including two versions of the Italian map (political and physical), offering some added variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publication date is uncertain: I would venture the educated guess 1988-1990 (Yugoslavia is still showing as a neighbouring country).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
