			<description>Very rare role-playing game of politics, diplomacy and military strength in China. Players take social positions within an agricultural society.  The players are: The Emperor; the Official, Gentry/Landholder; Scholar; Silk Peasant; Rice Peasant; Wheat Peasant; and the Warlord.  Each Player gets a booklet that describes your function in life.  You start your life by choosing a booklet in random. And you act according to the role described in your booklet until you achieve your next position in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is for the players to move up or down the social ladder.  How you achieve your objective depends on how you play your role in society. For example: how do you solve the social-economic-political problems of a rural society?  How do you feed the people?  Build public works?  Collect taxes? Fight wars?  Defend yourself? Revolt?  Grow crops? Accumulate money?  Become powerful?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The variables involved are as numerous as your personality.  And how you move up the social ladder depends on your ability to interact with the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
