							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World of Warcraft Trading Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a collectible trading card game published by Upper Deck in 2006 (Cryptozoic Entertainment took over the license and game in 2010) based on the massively multi-player online roleplaying game &amp;quot;World of Warcraft.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World of Warcraft Trading Card Game draws from the rich lore of the Warcraft universe. Two factions are battling for supremacy over Azeroth&amp;mdash;the Horde and the Alliance&amp;mdash;and each time you play, you choose a hero from one of these factions to represent you. Your hero is the leader of your party who fights alongside your allies. The cards that you play will allow you to equip your hero with weapons and armor, use spells and talents, invite allies into your party, and complete quests. With each successive TCG set, the theme and cards echo the current max-level content from the online game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to defeat your opponents before they defeat you. Over the course of the game, your hero and allies will deal damage to your opponents&amp;rsquo; heroes and allies, and that damage is permanent unless it is healed. If your hero takes damage equal to or greater than his or her health, you&amp;rsquo;re out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sets released&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes of Azeroth (released October 2006) &lt;br/&gt;Through the Dark Portal (released April 2007) &lt;br/&gt;Fires of Outland (released August 2007) &lt;br/&gt;March of The Legion (released December 2007) &lt;br/&gt;Servants of the Betrayer (released April 2008) &lt;br/&gt;The Hunt for Illidan (released July 2008) &lt;br/&gt;Drums of War (released November 2008) &lt;br/&gt;Blood of Gladiators (released March 2009) &lt;br/&gt;Fields of Honor (released June 2009) &lt;br/&gt;Scourgewar (released November 2009) &lt;br/&gt;Wrathgate (released May 2010) &lt;br/&gt;Class Starter deck (July 2010)&lt;br/&gt;Archives (released August 2010)&lt;br/&gt;Icecrown (released September 2010)&lt;br/&gt;Worldbreaker (released December 2010)&lt;br/&gt;War of the Elements (released April 2011)&lt;br/&gt;Twilight of the Dragons (released July 2011)&lt;br/&gt;Throne of the Tides (released October 2011)&lt;br/&gt;Crown of the Heavens (released February 2012)&lt;br/&gt;Tomb of the Forgotten (released June 2012)&lt;br/&gt;War of the Ancients (released October 2012)&lt;br/&gt;Betrayal of the Guardian (released February 2013)&lt;br/&gt;Reign of Fire (released July 2013)&lt;br/&gt; Raid Decks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Onyxia's Lair (December 2006) - Featuring the black dragon Onyxia.
