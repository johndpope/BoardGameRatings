			<description>A children's game where you will compete in a show jumping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At first you have to find four different equipment-tiles placed face down. After that you roll a die and move your plastic horse around the course with obstacles. According to what you roll different things will happen: After a roll of 1 you must move your horse one step back and take a marker (after three markers you're out of the game). If you would jump over a obstacle after you have rolled a 2, 3 or 4 you have to take the top card from the deck and according to the card's colour different things will happen: If it's green you have passed the jump, if it's yellow you have knocked down the obstacle and get a yellow fault-marker and if it's red your horse has refused to jump and you have to stop and take a red fault-marker. A roll of 5 or 6 makes you just jump over the obstacle without taking a card. The fastest horse with least faults is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in the box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
