			<description>Bootlegger is a bridge-like partnership trick-taking game with a few twists on the familiar theme. The deck consists of four suits with six wild &amp;quot;Bootlegger&amp;quot; cards. The latter may be played to any trick and cause the lowest (rather than highest) card to take the trick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of the traditional bid/pass, a player may &amp;quot;Inkle,&amp;quot; which is a non-bid signal to partner that one can support a certain suit. A &amp;quot;Nullo&amp;quot; is a No Trump bid to take no tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams score points (40 to 520, depending on the suit and number of tricks bid) for making their bid, or lose points if they fail. Play is to 500 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
