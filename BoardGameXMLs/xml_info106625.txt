							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SIX D SIX</name>
									
			<description>SIX D SIX is a set of six strategic board games playable with dice. All six games were designed to rely on luck as little as possible in their outcomes. In most cases, the &amp;quot;randomness&amp;quot; of the die-rolling is used to set-up the game, but does not influence who will win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that is needed to play are 36 six-sided dice in six different (non-black) colors, and an additional 36 six-sided black dice (for most of the games). One also requires a chessboard, and some require keeping score with pen and paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIX D &amp;quot;ONE&amp;quot;: A tactical game that allows each player to get creative and &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; a gameboard to stump the other players. Play consists of claiming a spot on the gameboard each turn, scoring for pip count and connections with other claimed spots.&lt;br/&gt;SIX D &amp;quot;TWO&amp;quot;: Roll a big pile of dice and take turns removing two dice of the same color. When all the dice have been removed, or there are no more matches left, whoever has the most pips showing on all the dice they've removed is the winner! &lt;br/&gt;SIX D &amp;quot;THREE&amp;quot;: Relying the most on luck of any of these games, the gameboard consists of a 6x6 grid of randomly rolled black dice. Players draw a &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; of three dice (which they roll), and can play them on the gameboard in any space matching the pip count shown. Points are scored for matching adjacent die in color or pip count.&lt;br/&gt;SIX D &amp;quot;FOUR&amp;quot;: A &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; abstract strategy game, played on a chess board, where you'll need to capture your own pieces in order to capture the black pieces that ensure victory.&lt;br/&gt;SIX D &amp;quot;FIVE&amp;quot;: A simple but strategic dice stacking game for 3 to 6 players. Place your dice matching the dice already in play. You'll need to think in three dimensions for this one! &lt;br/&gt;SIX D &amp;quot;SIX&amp;quot;: A game that involves identifying rows and columns on the gameboard consisting of &amp;quot;same color, different pip count&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;different color, same pip count&amp;quot;. Players will place the pieces they identify into a personal play area, scoring points as they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete rules for each game are available in this PDF: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://chesstris.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6D6.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://chesstris.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6D6.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
