			<description>The author says that the game tries to simulate and teach soccer tactics, the intended audience were soccer enthusiasts and sports clubs; the flyer to the game shows the 1974 world champions Gerd M&amp;uuml;ller and J&amp;uuml;rgen Grabowski as well as Helge Andersen (game critic) and Holger Obermann (sports journalist, trainer) uttering enthusiastic opinions about the game.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a huge velour-covered gameboard and two teams of 11 players each. The men get a movement allowance equal to the roll of a die, and on an odd roll the player may continue with another turn. Rules for nearly every conceivable real-life soccer situation. Two egg timers are available to limit each player's time to move.&lt;br/&gt;However, the rules sometimes seem far-fetched and often do not give real choices to the players. This, of course, also affects the value as a training and simulation game, and the game vanished from the shops as quickly as it came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1987 edition contains a smaller variant of the game named &amp;quot;Hallen-Cup&amp;quot; on the reverse side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
