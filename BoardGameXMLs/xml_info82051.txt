			<description>Bill &amp;amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure is an action-adventure game based on the film Bill &amp;amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure that was released in North America by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. The game's plot is not an adaptation of the movie, but rather serves as an original continuation to the film's events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the level, players take control of either Bill or Ted to search for the stranded historical figures' various worlds throughout history and return them to their rightful times. Players will explore houses, building, and castles plus talk to locals for clue and outfox mad villagers by outrunning, or using items from their inventory that can either distract, satisfy, entrance, or cause the person to disappear. In order to gain the historical figure's trust, the player must locate items called historical bait hidden within each world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
