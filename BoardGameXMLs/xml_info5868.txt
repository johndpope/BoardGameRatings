							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">WorldWide Cruise Line&#039;s Caribbean Cruise Board Game</name>
									
			<description>Player rolls dice and moves their gamepiece across the gameboard - which is a stylized map of the Caribbean on a backgroud of varied hues of blue. The players goal is to visit / collect a pre-determined number of islands from a scorecard of 160 Caribbean Island destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Islands are added or subtracted to individual scores by landing on island squares on the gameboard or by landing on the Island Card or Ship Cards squares on the gameboard, and taking the top card from the appropriate deck. These Island and Ship cards (approximately 400 total) reveal information about the islands and their people, cultures, foods, carnivals, languages, art and design, beaches, scuba dives, tropical rainforests, exotic animals, multicoloured fish and corals and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cards also feature information about the Cruise Experience - shipboard activities, shoreside excursions and the wonder of awaking to a new destination aboard your floating luxury hotel with it's multi-national staff and crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designer Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In designing this game, I have gone against the grain in accepted board game strategies where the norm is to win at any cost; destroying, trivializing or bankrupting other players along the way to a so called victory. The main theme of this game is of the Journey ~ not the finish, and it is hoped that in playing this game people will be encouraged to take a real journey, maybe to the beautiful islands and waters of the Caribbean or maybe further afield where they can interact with others, break down barriers and fears, find new life-paths and celebrate the world in a more spititual and humanitarian light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game is packaged in a clear polycarbonate Captain's Chart Tube ( a virtually unbreakable and watertight container, adding to the nautical theme ). To repackage Game ~  roll up all game contents in the laminated gameboard and slide game back into chart tube. Gameboard may also be left out of tube and bluetacked to wall as a poster between uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
