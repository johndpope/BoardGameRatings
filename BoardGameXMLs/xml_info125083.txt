			<description>Idiot Knowledge is not a traditional quiz game with a boring and slow questions. This is the game instead of all that is not learned about in school ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you know how many percent better boys perform as they train in the gym in front of the girls? Is it possible to tattoo on the tongue? or Why Mona Lisa has no eyebrows?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 400 hilarious crazy, bizarre and totally meaningless, but still super interesting and entertaining questions, that's as fun to be able to answer as to hear the answer! Idiot Knowledge is the perfect game for anyone who loves knowledge mixed with meaningless nonsense and lots of humor!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to many other trivia games. Roll the dice, move Your pawn, draw a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
