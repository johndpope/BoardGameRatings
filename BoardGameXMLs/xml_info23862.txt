							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battle for Tromaville</name>
									
			<description>Dr. Killernoff, the pollution breathing alien from the planet Smogular, has come to Tromaville. Unless we team up with Toxie and the Good Guys, Tromaville is doomed. Apocalypse, Inc. and the Bad Guys are out to destroy us! Let's go get 'em!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective of the game is to be the first player to travel the board and get back safely to Toxie's headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You become one of the Toxic Crusaders as you travel the path through Tromaville. You will battle the sinister Bad Guy cards with Toxic Crusaders Good Guy cards. You'll be challenged to fight the pollutant mutants of Apocalypse Inc. wherever they spread toxic disaster.&lt;br/&gt; On each turn, players move along the game path. The path leads through six endangered areas of Tromaville. Players battle the Bad Guys and clean up Bad stuff as they follow instructions on the game board. The first player to reach Toxerific is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ages 6 and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
