			<description>Shoot Cows is a strategy game for 2 to 6 players ages 12 and up. The object of the game is to be the first player to rescue 3 Survivors. Survivors freely come and go from your party, so don't get too attached!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are competing against each other, as well as the game. You can only gain cards by EXPLORING, wherein you draw a card and then REVEAL one. When you reveal a card, its effects take place immediately... for good or for ill. Cows will attack you when they're revealed, and events could rescue you right off the bat--or kill you off while the story is still in the prologue. Like any good survival horror game, your knowledge of the genre will aid you in your quest to survive, but only to a point... these are MAD COWS, after all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
