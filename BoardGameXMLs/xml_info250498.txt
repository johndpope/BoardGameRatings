			<description>Be the first to assemble an eight-piece picture of a house by collecting your tiles. Roll the die, move your token and act on the instructions on the space. Some spaces allow you to draw tiles from the deck. Keep your own tiles if you draw them or discard other players cards. If one of your tiles is on top of the discard deck on your turn, forego your die roll and take the tile. A game of pure luck that may appeal to young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
