			<description>Board has a turning disk under it to place the treasure chest in 1 of 16 holes on board, each covered with a gold coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are pirates looking to be the first to collect 25 coins.  Movement is by rolling two six sided dice.  Rolling doubles gives you the option to add another of your playing pieces to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you reach a hole on the board, collect the coin and check to see what's under it.  The treasure chest is worth 10 coins, you can also find nothing, or be captured by another player and sent to their hideout.  To be released takes one coin and a roll of doubles, or two coins without the roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player with 25 coin wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
