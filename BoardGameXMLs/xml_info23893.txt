							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Milwaukee Scene</name>
									
			<description>A Monopolyesque game themed around late seventies Milwaukee, WI USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to accumulate wealth by buying and selling significant local entities such as:  Pabst, Schlitz, or Miller Breweries; The Mecca; Marquette University; Summerfest; or The Milwaukee Brewers MLB team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Have you ever wanted to own the Hyatt Regency, a radio station, the Brewers or Admirals?  Now is your chance by playing the Milwaukee Scene!&amp;quot;  --John N. Hansen, 1979&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may become politicians, labor leaders, or publishers, as well as owners of professional sports teams in this game.  Connection cards are sought to enable owners to develop properties in order to increase rents, and to do so requires bargaining with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, why not sit down with a Miller High Life or MGD and make a decision to buy the brewery which produces it?  Sorry Laverne and Shirley, Schlitz is no more, and Pabst left town for good...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 playing board&lt;br/&gt;50 Scene Cards (including two blanks)&lt;br/&gt;25 Ownership Cards (deeds)&lt;br/&gt;3 Debtor Cards&lt;br/&gt;4 Power Group Badges&lt;br/&gt;16 Connection Cards&lt;br/&gt;6 Tokens&lt;br/&gt;2 Dice&lt;br/&gt;1 Card With Colored Circular Markers&lt;br/&gt;5 Deominations/Money&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
