			<description>Moby Dicks Freunde is played on a board with 8 x 10 rhombs. Every line of the rhomb shows a number between 1 and 6. 8 dice and 8 whales are the game components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 4 whales, who are placed on the first 4 rhomb edges to the right. Each turn, 5-8 dice are thrown. Whales can move to adjacent rhomb edges, when the die on the board corresponds to one of the die numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A restriction is that the 4 whales of a player must always form a herd, that is they must always be connected to each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving the whales on the side where the opposing herd stays is allowed, but only, if they are not blocked by such moves. Thus, a certain amount of cooperative play is requested!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winner of the game is the player whose herd reaches the opposing side of the board first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Karin and Reinhold Wittig are named for the copyright of the game rules. The game is by Reinhold Wittig alone, though).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
