			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Blackest Night! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythic Monsters: Shadow brings you a dozen and one shadowy sneaks from the realms of endless nocturn. Whether lurking in the dark and hidden places beneath the ground or emerging from beshadowed realms far beyond this mortal coil, there is something terribly cool about creatures of raw and endless darkness. From the sleek and sinister unseelie realms to the coiling, roiling, pits of eternal night, creatures of shadow have always captured our imagination, whether they are simply misunderstood dwellers in darkness or truly villains of the deepest dye. From CR 3 to 25, we bring you the living and the dead that live beyond the light, from simple shadows seeking to blot out the light and drink your life to towering nightwalkers, the devastating heralds of annihilation. The secretive and stealthy dark creepers and dark stalkers lurk within these pages, alongside the misshapen umbral shepherds and the terrifying tenebrous worms that mature into beautiful but deadly gloomwings. A quartet of killer kytons are found, from the bloodthirsty lampadarius and the vivisecting interlocutor to the sinister sacristan and the horrid eremite lords of the kyton race. Finally, the umbral dragon graces these pages with its sleek shimmer-gloom, breathing darkness and devouring light. As if a dozen existing monsters were not enough, the mysterious shadowpeople exist forever on the edge of sight, their motives as much an enigma as their true face and form. For heroes or villains wishing to tame the shadow, we also present a mythic version of the shadowdancer prestige class, with mythic versions of each and every class feature!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
