							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Search for the Doctor</name>
									
			<description>From the Back of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU are the only hope for the salvation of the Doctor in SEARCH FOR THE DOCTOR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 2056. From the Fern Spacelab orbiting above the Fusion Energy Research Network in California, OMEGA has mounted a devastating attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMEGA plans to take over the Doctor's mind and body. By controlling the Doctor's awesome power, OMEGA can take revenge on the Time Lords, who sacrificed him to obtain the secret of Time Travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YOU will join forces with DRAX and K9 to free the Doctor and defeat OMEGA. As DRAX uses his secondhand TARDIS (cleverly disguised as a 1956 Cadillac) and K9 uses his impressive electronic skills, YOU must use all your wits to FIND YOUR FATE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other gamebooks in the Find Your Fate series, the Doctor Who series uses dice, and visual puzzles in addition to the reader making the decisions in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
