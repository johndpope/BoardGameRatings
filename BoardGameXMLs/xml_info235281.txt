							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Trainer Class</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurers of all stripes have a long and storied relationship with the monsters that fill their world. Everyone fears them, or hates them, or views them as obstacles to be overcome. Everyone, that is, but the Monster Trainer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To a Monster Trainer, every monster is a potential source of new and greater power. Through their unique ability to capture and befriend their weakened foes, they can take their enemies&amp;rsquo; strength and make it their own. As their name suggests, Monster Trainers also have the ability to train their monsters, taking man and monster to heights that they could never reach alone in an unending journey to become the very best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
