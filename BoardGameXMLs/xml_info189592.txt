							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Medieval Hunter&#039;s Cabin</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a 32 x 20 inch, full color battlemap of a Medieval Hunter's Cabin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Product comes with the Square, Hex and No Overlay versions and the Virtual Tabletop Maps (VTT).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about murdered sheep. Sheep are unworthy animals for a hunting man to slaughter and their hide is worthless for tanning.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;The Lone Huntsman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Cabin is a single level map of the interior of a wooden cabin and porch surrounded by an exterior plains clearing in the middle of a forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medieval Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Cabin is intended for use in fantasy or medieval historical era games. It is also useful in fairy tale and horror games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lone Huntsman: A wandering shepherd has found his flock ripped to shreds and over half his sheep dead, gutted by a large wild dog or wolf. The shepherd offers the group what little he has, sheep&amp;rsquo;s milk, the meat of the slaughtered animals, and wool for winter clothes if the group will help him hunt down the slayer. The spoor of the creature&amp;rsquo;s tracks leads to the woods of a huntsman who lives alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The huntsman claims to have seen no dog or wolf. Curiously, the huntsman does not own a hunting dog in an era where most hunting techniques use a hunting dog to corner prey for a hunter to deliver the killing blow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The huntsman gives them permission to look around his forest for wild dogs or wolves as long as they do not interfere with his hunting or tanning work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What creature or creatures killed half the shepherd&amp;rsquo;s flock and where did they go?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
