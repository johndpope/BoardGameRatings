			<description>&amp;ldquo;Each player recruits a group of Immortals seeking to gain power over other such groups. Based on the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons RPG rule set &amp;lsquo;Wrath of the Immortals&amp;rsquo;. These associations of Immortals are variously known as Groups, Cliques (informal), and Councils (formal).&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players represent a specific alignment: Lawful, Chaotic, or Neutral. Alignment affects the types of immortals which may be recruited by a player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to control one hundred Power Points worth of Immortals and Resource cards. A player may also win by reducing all opposing players to zero Power Points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
