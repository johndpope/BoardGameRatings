							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Ruined Town, Old Observatory</name>
									
			<description>The Blueprints product line offers you old-fashioned blue printed maps for using in your adventures and campaigns. For each map you get a blueprint version and a standard black and white version. The maps are all vector-based so you will get maximum print resolution. Despite their old fashioned appearance each map offers you a degree of customization, using the pdf technology at its best. A button (which will not be printed) on each map allows you to turn on and off the grid, eliminate the room numbers, get the walls filled, don&amp;rsquo;t show doors and furniture and many other options, depending on the kind of map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each product features a classic fantasy adventure location: a dungeon, a keep, a temple complex, a thieves guild and so on. You can use these map as reference to build your own adventures or simply take them at hand in case your players go in an unexpected direction during the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Old Observatory rises on the southeast part of the Ruined Town, topping the hill called &amp;ldquo;The Hill of the Black People&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is told that a very old dwarf built the observatory; local people nicknamed him &amp;ldquo;the black dwarf&amp;rdquo; due to his dark complexion. He was a scholar who spent most of his time watching the stars. In order to accomplish his scope, he built a brass device, made of gears and lens he placed on top of the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day a strange woman went to the tower and the same night of her arrival, sinister lights were sighted in the observatory. The woman never left the town and each new moon people began to disappear in the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of these unlucky men and women were found, months later, wandering at the base of the hill, turned into blathering idiots with dark complexions and deep scars all over their faces...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product expands a location found in &amp;Oslash;one's Blueprints: The Ruined Town&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
