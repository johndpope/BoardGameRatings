			<description>Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyperlight Patrol beams you into a new dimension in adventure games. You, in your single star cruiser, must locate and destroy a fleet consisting of unknown numbers of four different classes of enemy ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE KEY DIFFERENCE IN HYPERUGHT PATROL?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the Klingons, Cylons, etc. of most space games, these enemy ships manuever intelligently in the three dimensional space around you &amp;mdash; and can move as you do &amp;mdash; by hyperlight jumps!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-Game Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this science-fiction conflict simulation you are the commander of a single star-cruiser. You have been sent to a remote border region to investigate the reported presence of elements of an Empire invasion fleet.  Your mission is to reconnoiter the entire area and report all enemy forces there. You will attempt to destroy those forces that can be engaged without jeopardizing your search. Good luck and good hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
