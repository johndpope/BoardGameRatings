							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hexagonia</name>
									
			<description>Hexagonia is played on a hex-shaped board comprised of 127 smaller hexagons, seven on each side.  The hexes are alternately colored red, white, and blue, except for the central hex, which is colored gold.  Each player (one with black pieces, one with white) has eight pawns, four knights, two cannons, and one king.  Each piece is capable of capturing enemy pieces, and has a different method of movement.  The king piece cannot be captured, but can be put into check as in Chess.  A player's king must be moved to the central gold hex to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to one account, the game's inventor lived in New Zealand.  The exact method for each piece's movement is currently unknown, though there is some mention of the cannon pieces moving somehow laterally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is not to be confused with another Jaques game called Hexagony, which used hexes in a much different and smaller configuration, and with different pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
