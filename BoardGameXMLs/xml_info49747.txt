							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Croatan Song</name>
									
			<description>The World Before the Wyrm Came&lt;br/&gt;Three brothers: Uktena, Wendigo and Croatan. Three tribes that kept the Wyrm at bay, that kept the Pure Lands pure. Three tribes that guarded the Americas with their lives. But the Pure Lands were never truly peaceful - and ultimately, one of the three tribes was forced to sacrifice itself so that the other two could survive. This is the story of the Three Brothers, and the lands they guarded, in a time when the Pure Lands were still pure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Tribe's Last Stand&lt;br/&gt;Croatan Song is the story of the werewolves of Native America and their territory before the coming of Columbus. In these pages, players will find the history of the Pure Lands, the tales of the human tribes there, the struggles and battles that were waged before the Wyrmcomers came, and the final sacrifice of the Croatan. The New World awaits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
