			<description>Trick-taking game set in a futuristic zoological park where mythical creatures battle for glory. Each player takes control of a Territory composed of 15 cards and tries win tricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chimera Sanctuary is a trick-taking game for 2 to 4 players set in a zoological park where mythical creatures fight for glory. Each player controls a Territory made of 15 cards and tries to win points (called Honors), or prevent other players from doing so... The player who starts the trick decides the suit the trick will be played in (among 4). The cards all have different values depending on the suit, and the weakest one of the trick may play a special rule called Virtue which can turn the trick and the game around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are able to put a card in a safe place, exchange one card with each other, and sucker punch one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round, Honors are counted, and players switch Territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after 3 rounds. Whoever has the most Honors wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
