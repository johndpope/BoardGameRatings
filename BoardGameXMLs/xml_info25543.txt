			<description>Board Talk is a letter-by-letter word card game that uses a board for building up one's hand.  During their turns, players roll 2 dice and move around the board.  The space they land on allows them to get cards (1-3), lose a card, or use a particular letter with their cards to form a word.  You may end the round by calling a word if it is 4 letters or longer.  Similar to gin rummy, you get the points for the word you call only if it isn't beaten by another player.  If beaten, the higher player gets your points *plus* his.  After the scoring, the board and cards are reset, and another round starts.  The winner is the first to reach the total point goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
