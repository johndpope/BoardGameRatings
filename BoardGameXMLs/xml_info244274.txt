			<description>Ba&amp;iuml;am is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series from Makaka Editions subtitled &amp;quot;The comic in which you are the hero&amp;quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &amp;mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &amp;mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &amp;mdash; sometimes really badly!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's different about Ba&amp;iuml;am from other titles in this &amp;quot;You are the hero&amp;quot; series is that Ba&amp;iuml;am is for 1-4 players, and each player has their own book, embodying a particular character with special powers. Work together with others (albeit separately) to progress on islands full of adventures and brain twisters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
