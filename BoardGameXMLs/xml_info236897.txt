			<description>Canastra is a pickup and deliver with area majority game about the traditional production of Cheese in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Although not very known outside Brazil, Minas Gerais is a state that produces great Cheese since colonial times, more than three centuries ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a medium weight strategy game. Each player owns a singular Brand of Cheese, identified by a color. Everyone may produce, transport, deliver to stores and sell to the tourists to get money in return and become the wealthiest producer in the state while making each producing region more valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows seven different regions, each one has its own Cheese recipe, therefore there are seven types of cheese available and any player may produce any Cheese from any region they wish. Each type of Cheese is identified by the color of the region. When a Cheese is produced, a player puts a Cheese token (with the color of the region) over her own color mold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the game, players may build farms; produce Cheese in their own or another player&amp;acute;s farm; invite an expert to certify the regions willing to increase the Region&amp;acute;s Value (RV) which gives them more Money Points; pick up and deliver everyones products to supply any store available they choose. The expert follows a queue of Regions which was previously chosen by players in a very similar way as the Governor Track in Maharaja: the game of Palace Building in India (by Michael Kiesling and Wofgang Kramer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And who will buy all this Cheese at the store? Tourists, of course. Players may also organize tours of tourists to visit a store and sell them all the Cheese! You know how tourists are when they find a good cheese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How this game is played? Every turn, players use a certain amount of action points to make theiractions. In Canastra, action points are represented by bottles of milk. And milk comes from their cattle. Yes, you got it right: more cattle means more milk and more action points to spend! It has a variable action point system, from 5 to 9 in a Round. When all the milk is gone, the Round is over and players get to milk their cattle once again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the game ends? Canastra has two end triggers: a) when a certain amount of Regions have gotten a Certified Production Seal OR a certain number of tourists have visited the stores, whatever happens first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who wins the game? The Brand with the most Money Points is the best producer of Cheese from Minas Gerais and the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to make Money Points? There are three main and independent ways: Producing Cheese, Transporting Cheese and Selling it to the Tourists. There are two different area majority values to measure the value of Cheese. RV: Region Value and TV: Tourism Value. &lt;br/&gt;RV: When Cheese is produced and is still in a Farm, Region Value is given by the number of Quality Certificates it has. All the regions begin with value 1 and may reach value 3. &lt;br/&gt;TV: When Cheese arives at the Store it is ready to be sold to the Tourists. And they want variety of types. For instance, if a Store has Cheese from five different regions, each Cheese there is worth 5MPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also the Transporting Value. TV gives Money Points to the owners of Trucks according to the distance they take the Cheese. The farthest possible e three roads. Then, a delivered Cheese may be worth 1MP, if it was produced in the same region of the Store, to 3MPs if it was produced three regions away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the game, owners of Farms and Stores also get MPs according to the Region Value (RV) the Farm is built in; Brands get extra MPs according to the variety of regions they have produced and sold Cheese; and also the amount of Tourists they have brought to all seven regions.&lt;br/&gt; Well, let&amp;acute;s play and you are welcome to have some &amp;ldquo;Queijo Mineiro&amp;rdquo;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
