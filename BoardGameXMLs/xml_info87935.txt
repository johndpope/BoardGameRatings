			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its 1996 and the war to repel the Earth invaders is still going on. A new combat vehicle has been developed, capable of transforming itself into a laser-armed tank, an helicopter or a grenade-launching jeep. Its up to you to field-test the prototype and destroy as much of the enemy as possible in order to prove the combat effectiveness of the machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flash is a top-down shoot'em up game. The goal is to destroy the many enemy bases across the landscape while avoiding or destroying the opposing infantry and vehicles. The player's vehicle can morph into four different forms: an infantryman with a short-range laser rifle, a tank with a laser cannon (the most powerful weapon available), an helicopter with bombs (fast but vulnerable) and a jeep firing grenades (vulnerable, can fire over obstacles with is not powerful enough to destroy all targets). Each vehicle has its own set of lives and ammunitions. Enemies include foot infantry, tanks, bunkers, several kinds of installations and flying saucers (fast, armoured and deadly).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
