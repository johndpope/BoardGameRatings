							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bombers Over Germany</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;The B-17 Flying Fortress was the principal heavy bomber of the US during WW II. The plane was used for daylight bombing missions against industrial targets in Europe and, to a lesser extent, the Pacific Theatre . . . Often the B-17s would be accompanied by escort fighters such as the P-47 and P-51.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple historical miniatures air combat game designed for classroom use in grades 6-8. The game is played by two teams representing the American and German forces. The American players have eight B-17 bombers and eight escort fighters, each divided into two squadrons. The German players have sixteen fighters divided into four squadrons and a fifth squadron containing four jet fighters. The German players attempt to shoot down as many bombers as possible before the bombers can move off the end of the board or time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to be played using 1/144 scale models and a 7.5x5 foot mat hex map using hexes that are about three inches across. Free print-and-play paper aircraft models are also provided for use with the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
