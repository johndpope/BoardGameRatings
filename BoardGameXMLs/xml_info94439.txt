							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Newtonia: Civil War on the Missouri Border</name>
									
			<description>Published in September 2007 issue of LPD newsletter &amp;quot;Special Operations&amp;quot; are a Print &amp;amp; Play game Newtonia - Civil War on the Missouri Border, debuting the new Orders system for the Battles of the American Civil War game series (same as Battle of Honey Springs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Newtonia is a game designed to test new rules concepts for the Battles of the American Civil War series. There were two battles outside this tiny Missouri town, one in 1862 as the Confederacy sought to tap the agricultural produce and mineral resources of the surrounding region, and another in late 1864 when Sterling Price&amp;rsquo;s Army of Missouri sought a brief rest during its retreat after the Battle of Westport. Each scenario exemplifies a different tactical situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I Newtonia shows a Federal &amp;ldquo;demonstration&amp;rdquo; against the town. A &amp;ldquo;Demonstration&amp;rdquo;, in Civil War parlance, is a threatened attack on a stronger enemy which doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually intend to get heavily involved. Demonstrations are economy of force missions, occupying a larger enemy to support other operations. Here, a &amp;ldquo;Demonstration&amp;rdquo; simply reminds the Confederates that there was an active opponent in the areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;II Newtonia is a classic delaying action. Both armies are fatigued and at the limit of battle worthiness. In addition, Confederate morale was low because of their defeat at Westport, lack of food and absence of any meaningful time to rest. The Federal army is buoyed up by their victory, but is equally tired and hungry.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
