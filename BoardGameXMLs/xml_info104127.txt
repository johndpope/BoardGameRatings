							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Traffic Department 2192</name>
									
			<description>The player takes on the role of Lieutenant Marta Louise Velasquez, a hot-tempered young pilot working for the Traffic Department in the city of Vulthaven, on the planet Seche, in the year 2192. Since the vile gang known as the Vultures began attempts to take over the planet, the Traffic Department has become the only law-enforcement in the city. As the game's introduction explains, fourteen years earlier, Velasquez saw her father Ric killed by the Vultures while returning from garrison duty.&lt;br/&gt; The story deals with Velasquez's aggressive attitude towards everybody she meets, apparently caused by the painful memory of her father. Intertwined is a complex science fiction story of cloning, mind control and cybernetics, combined with a classic tale of betrayal, infiltration, and warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Traffic Department 2192,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
