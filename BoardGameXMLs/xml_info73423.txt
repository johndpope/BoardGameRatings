			<description>&amp;quot;Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword is the second official expansion pack of the turn-based strategy video game Civilization IV. The expansion focuses on adding content to the in-game time periods following the invention of gunpowder, and includes more general content such as 11 new scenarios, 10 new civilizations, and 16 new leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Corporations: A new gameplay feature, similar to the &amp;lsquo;religion&amp;rsquo; one, allows players to create corporations and spread them throughout the world. Each corporation provides benefits in exchange for certain resources. &lt;br/&gt;Espionage: Now available much earlier in the game, this expanded feature offers players many new ways to spy on opponents, stir citizen unrest and defend their government&amp;rsquo;s secrets. &lt;br/&gt;Random Events: New random events such as natural disasters, pleas for help, or demands from their citizens will challenge players to overcome obstacles in order for their civilizations to prosper. Random events can also be beneficial, such as scientific breakthroughs or incidents that improve relations with a neighbor. &lt;br/&gt;Advanced Starts: When starting the game in any era, this new option allows the player to purchase components for an already-developed nation. &lt;br/&gt;Expanded Space Victory: Obtaining a space victory is now more difficult and requires more strategy and decision-making than before. &lt;br/&gt;Expanded Diplomatic Victory: It is now possible to achieve diplomatic victories much earlier in the game, and to defy resolutions. &lt;br/&gt;New Game Options: Beyond the Sword offers various new game options, like new world-types and the option to play any leader-civilization combination.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Beyond_the_sword,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
