							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enascentia Player&#039;s Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just imagine a world where men and women are neither born nor grow old, a fantastic place where magic pervades everything and everyone, where life's first experiences are not learnt but are something you have never been taught and yet somehow already know.&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Enascentia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you imagine a fantasy world where people are not born, yet can live forever? Discover the magical land of Enascentia as both you and your character take your first steps in a surprising new environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin your adventure with an adult character who has no previous experience but a vast set of knowledge. You get to play from the very first moment your character is created, and yet you don't have to learn speaking, walking, or even fighting&amp;mdash;those and many more skills already belong to you, as well as basic starting equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't know who you are, but you know what you believe in: the Kami. The Kami describes your way of living, a higher calling, the beginning of everything, or just everything itself. Each Tribe has a different explanation for why they are sent here and a different opinion on the nature of the world of Enascentia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start with a belief in your Kami and trust your inner impulses. But you can become anyone you like. Others before you chose a different path for themselves rather than follow their destiny. There are many Ways, many choices to make, and a whole new story to write...your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;330 pages of adventures await you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    10 new playable races&lt;br/&gt;    over 60 new skills, hindrances and edges to personalize your character&lt;br/&gt;    more than 50 new powers&lt;br/&gt;    magical gear: 70 new enchantments for weapons, armor, and magical objects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
