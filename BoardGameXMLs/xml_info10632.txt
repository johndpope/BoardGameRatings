							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Who Can Beat Nixon?</name>
									
			<description>This game was developed immediately after Nixon's first election, and apparently by someone who did not want him to get a second term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a simple Monopoly-type game, but it has an interesting asymmetrical dynamic. Essentially, one player takes Nixon and up to seven play as challengers, with Nixon trying to knock them off one by one as Primary cards come up. Players still roll to land on states and buy them, and other players pay a fee when landing on them afterwards. But buying states requires a combination of two forms of currency: money and media points. Many state spaces also trigger event and media cards, which have different effects on Nixon and challengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key to the game are the four Primary cards in the Event deck. Each time one of these comes up, Nixon rolls off with the top-ranking challenger, and whichever has the highest electoral vote total gets +2 on the 2D6. Loser is out of the game, winner grabs a state of his choice from the loser, and the rest goes back to the bank. There is a &amp;ldquo;saved by the bell&amp;rdquo; re-entry card in the deck that allows a loser to stay in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There also is a provision for the challengers to join forces if Nixon seems about to win, but only if they can agree on which challenger should be the winner instead! The decks include blank Media and Event cards to allow players to customize the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
