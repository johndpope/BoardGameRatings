			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set out on Faer&amp;ucirc;n&amp;rsquo;s premier mail-order quest service! No need to join a guild or sign up with unscrupulous journeymen who care only for the gold in your pocket. Be your own boss! Make your fortune in your spare time! Learn from the greatest heroes in the realm! Join The Greenscale Adventurer&amp;rsquo;s Academy today!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Party...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working under the somewhat-dubious long-distance tutelage of Saarvin Greenscale, your party of rookies has set out to learn what it takes to be true heroes. Sure, the quests all come in the mail, and maybe you've never actually met (or even heard of) the legendary teacher who's leading you, but that's never stood in the way of the professional murder-hobos of the Sword Coast before so why should it now? You've been promised riches and glory, all for a very reasonable up-front price; all that's left is for you to go out and find it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure begins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take on this, the first chapter in a brand-new light-hearted (mis)adventure series for beginner and veteran players alike, driven by a Terry Pratchett-meets-Lucasarts sense of humour and a slightly eschew view of the classic Forgotten Realms setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
