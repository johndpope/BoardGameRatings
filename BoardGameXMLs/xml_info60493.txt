							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Caravan City of Azul</name>
									
			<description>User Notes: City-based adventure setting for any level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of their motley appearance and nomadic lifestyle, the Azulites are sometimes derided as gypsies or vagabonds, but they insist on calling themselves a traveling village. Everyone in the caravan over the age of twenty originally lived in the village of Azul, once located on the contested borderlands between Lothir and Vidia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty years ago, King Lor of Harek willed on his deathbed that his lands be divided between his two children, Prince Johnas and Princess Naresa. But the two siblings hated each other and from the moment of their father&amp;rsquo;s death, they fought over the lands that lay between their respective capitals. Even today, as both King Johnas of Lothir and Queen Naresa of Vidia begin to gray and wither with age, their feud continues unabated, and the two kingdoms skirmish and invade each others&amp;rsquo; territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The village of Azul lay astride the main invasion route favored by both sides. Over the next twenty years, the depredations of war battered them unceasingly. A conquering army might take their. food, their possessions, their women, their men, and burn their houses just for the pleasure of it. A retreating army might do the same, to deny the resources to the enemy. And on top if it all, the town suffered crippling taxes - from both sides. In a given year, Lothir might tax Azul as its subject, then Vidian soldiers occupying the lands would levy new taxes upon subjects of Queen Naresa, before Lothir again conquered the land and lay new taxes yet again to pay for their glorious liberation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
