			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was as peaceful a day as New York ever gets, when suddenly the sky went dark and a monstrous droning noise filled the air.

Horrible slimy things that got down into the subway tunnels and began clawing their way up.  If anyone was going to save the city, it would have to be me.
