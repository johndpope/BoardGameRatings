			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The God's Light Went Out&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The god of the night sky, HIM, has left us. In the vacuum has come the fires of the reborn Vord King, sending the country into anarchy. Son against brother, father against sister, the land burned. Only a threat from the outside, the hated wolf-soldiers of Hyrkhalla, sewed the wounds of our country together before it hemorrhaged to death. We rise again, a phoenix at dawn break, our wish to be anew relighting us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We Will Not Be Stopped&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The country of Morvaen was originally found in the World Book of Khaas, Legendary Lands of Arduin. This expanded version has more grit and detail than the original, as well as associated material appropriate for the Arduin Eternal&amp;reg; game system, published by Emperors Choice Games &amp;amp; Miniatures&amp;reg;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
