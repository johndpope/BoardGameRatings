			<description>This game is based on the television adventures of the famed &amp;quot;Paladin&amp;quot; who accepts assignments to capture outlaws of the Old west. Each player is dealt a card depicting an outlaw, the city he's located in and reward amount for capturing him. On your turn, you spin the spinner and advance along the trails the number of spaces indicated. When you reach the town where the outlaw on your card is located, you immediately spin the spinner and if it stops on &amp;quot;HIT&amp;quot;, you capture the outlaw (otherwise you try again next turn). Once captured, you place a &amp;quot;Bullet&amp;quot; token on the card then draw a new one. If you land on another player, you may have a shootout (high spin wins) and the loser has an outlaw escape. The first player to return to San Francisco with the required amount of money ($15,000 with 4 players) by capturing outlaws wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
