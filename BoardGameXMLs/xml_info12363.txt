			<description>This is a different game than the 1988 Games Works Inc title, although with a similar idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spit It Out! is played in teams. Each turn, the playing team takes a Challenge Card from the box. One at a time, team members say words or do actions that meet the Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example: Carnivores native to the American continent or A word that starts with the THIRD letter of the previous player's word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must answer in turn order, cannot repeat an answer and are not allowed to confer with their team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One point is scored for each correct word or action completed in 30 seconds. The team moves its playing piece round the board by the number scored, acquiring bonuses or penalties on the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
