							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Island Hopping</name>
									
			<description>Island Hopping is how you get around in The Bahamas!  And it's also a lively game of strategy and chance.  As you play, you'll explore the country's beautiful islands and discover places you'd like to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game by stacking four similar coins on one island.  But as you develop your winning strategy, remember that your best-laid plans can be sidetracked as the game takes you to unexpected destinations!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
