			<description>Snag the flag is an active game designed to teach kids and people of all ages about health and fitness by making it fun and energetic. The players won't even realize they're exercising and learning but just having fun. Snag the flag is all about action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will not sit and hang out but instead they will be on edge ready to chase after flags, act, guess, high five and perform tons of hilarious actions. The game has three different challenge decks to choose including fitness, trivia and showtime. Each deck contains 50 cards. The game also includes a 2&amp;quot; soft foam category die, 6 sets of flags and a game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fitness challenges have individual and group challenges with four levels per card. The trivia challenge cards have four levels of questions as well. The Showtime challenge cards are hilarious stories that have to be acted out for an applause. Than you also have to be on guard for someone trying to snag your flag. So the game is quick, exciting and unlike any other family game night out there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
