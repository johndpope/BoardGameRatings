							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Snail Invasion</name>
									
			<description>Snails try to eat the plants before they can grow, while the gardener tries to trap the snails: a Looney Pyramids game played with a single rainbow stash and two dice on a 3x4 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the solo game the player is the farmer, and in the two-player rules the second player plays the snails. The farmer has all 12 of the transparent colored pyramids (plants), and the snail farmer has only the three black pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All pieces start off the board, and each turn one player throws both dice, applying the roll to a single piece, which must be moved in a single track, from left to right and top to bottom, circling back to the beginning if it runs off the end. Smaller pyramids can be carried by larger pyramids that they land on top of. Same-sized pyramids can trap pyramids of the opponent. Larger pyramids can capture smaller opposing pyramids (or protect smaller friendly pyramids). Captured snails are available to return to play, while captured plants are removed from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The farmer wins by building a three-part tree of a single color, or by trapping all three snails. The snails win be capturing at least one piece of each color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
