							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hobbit: The Adventures of Bilbo in Middle-earth from The Lord of the Rings</name>
									
			<description>The game is actually played in the game box. The board is &amp;quot;3D&amp;quot; in that there are tiered areas and freestanding icons of trolls, spiders. elves, Smaug and Gollum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High roller starts to move his/her hobbit across the board. The objective is to reach the last space on the board by exact dice roll. Foils to this are losing a turn (if another player lands on the space you are already occupying), trolls (who keep you stuck in the Misty Mountains until you land on &amp;quot;Escape&amp;quot;), Gollum (who keeps you trapped until you land on a space that matches your hobbit's cloak color), goblins (same concept as the trolls, but you have to land on &amp;quot;Saved by Eagles&amp;quot;), spiders (whom you have to &amp;quot;kill&amp;quot; by dice roll) and elves (whom you have to escape from by dice roll).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Art has a Rankin/Bass feel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
