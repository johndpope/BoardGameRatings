			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Has the mage&amp;rsquo;s guild lost touch with their research outpost and sent you to check in? Did you join the wizard&amp;rsquo;s college and get placed in a dorm with several shady characters? Is your party researching rumors of a newly discovered spell that opens gateways to other dimensions? With D20 Cartographer, the story is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasy Maps are full-featured encounter maps designed to fill your fantastic world! This release, Magical Research Facility, features a two-story structure with an alchemy lab, spell testing room, dorm, storage units, and a second floor summoning/binding circle. With cozy furnishings for the resident mages, this can be the site of an information-gathering mission, a close-quarters combat encounter, or an opportunity to steal rare and expensive reagents. All maps are in typical 1 inch = 5 feet scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included for your convenience are several different formats including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Full-color map in .jpg format&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; High-contrast black and white map in .jpg format&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; PDF files with images sliced up over multiple pages for easy home-printing (compatible with both US Letter and A4 International paper)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D20 Cartographer also supports virtual table top (VTT) systems and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 100 DPI gridless map with objects removed&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; A folder with all &amp;lsquo;objects' in .png format for use on this map or reuse on your private maps&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; An RPTools MapTool VTT file (.cmpgn) with vision blocking and object layer set up for you&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
