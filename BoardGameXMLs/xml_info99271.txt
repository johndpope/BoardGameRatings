							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barbie Super Model</name>
									
			<description>Barbie Super Model is a one or two player video game that allows the player to play as Barbie. The main part of the game comprises very simple arcade-style sequences. In each level, the player must navigate from one end of a horizontally scrolling area to the other, avoiding all of the obstacles and potential hazards coming towards the main character. This game was available for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The levels each have a different theme. The themes include driving Barbie's convertible in Hollywood, roller skating in Hawaii, walking in the snow during a vacation in Vail, and riding her bike in New York City. The arcade-style sequences are interspersed with sections that test the player's memory. At the half-way point of each level the player can practice Barbie's moves for a fashion show. At the end of each level, the player must correctly perform these moves from memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By collecting certain objects, the player can unlock bonus rounds. The aim of these rounds is to dress Barbie and choose her makeup and earrings in order to match magazine covers. The two player option is essentially the same as the one player option; the players take turns in completing the same levels, and do not interact with one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Barbie Super Model&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
