			<description>Cay Control is a pirate themed strategy game for 2 players that takes about half an hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a sea dotted with islands and pirate bases on either side. Start by placing your ships on your base. On each turn you'll roll the dice and move your ships. You capture enemy ships by landing on them, but you have to bring them back to your base to claim them. Stacks of ships can be captured over and over, and you can even break out with a lucky roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first person to claim all of their opponents ships wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
