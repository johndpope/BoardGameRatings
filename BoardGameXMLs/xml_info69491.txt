			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mont Saint Michel is a Live Action Role Playing (LARP) game. Each player in the game is given a character to portray. Each character has its own goals and personality. In this game there are no winners or losers. Though some characters may have 'goals', actual success at attaining the goals is no reflection on the player's ability. (For example, an actor is playing Shakespeare's Hamlet rather poorly if by the end of his performance the tragic prince were still alive...)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Mont Saint Michel monastery. There are a large number of foreign guests presently, including guests from Protestant nations and a visiting Vatican inquisitor, so the abbot is watching the foreigners very carefully. Because of international tensions between European powers in 1632, and the Protestant split with the mother church, the atmosphere is very tense. Fortunately, nobody is foolhardy enough to spill blood in the house of God. Please join us for an evening of conspiracy, diplomacy, mystery, romance, and swashbuckling under the eyes of Archangel Michael.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
