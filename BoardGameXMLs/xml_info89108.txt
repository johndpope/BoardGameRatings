			<description>This game is played on a 12 x 12 field, with some squares colored and some grey. The players have 2 chieftains, 4 druids and 12 warriors each. Each type of pawn has its own movement rules. The goal is to reach the opponent's end zone with two chieftains or warriors. &lt;br/&gt;The colored squares are either danger fields or trigger fields. If a pawn is on a danger field and the opposing player can move a pawn into the corresponding trigger field, the pawn on the danger field is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
