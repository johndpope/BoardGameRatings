			<description>The adventure begins when, after becoming shipwrecked on a desert island, the delegates to the World Economic Convention begin to set up the foundations for a new civilization. To support the development of the budding economy (or &amp;ldquo;contrary to common sense&amp;rdquo; - as the opponents would have it), the castaways introduce a micro-version of a Modern Economic System on the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players will run their businesses, trade commodities on the exchange and take out loans, forcing the island&amp;rsquo;s bank to create new money and pump it into Moolah island&amp;rsquo;s economic bloodstream. &lt;br/&gt;Will it lead to an economic boom and general prosperity or to a spectacular fall of the island&amp;rsquo;s civilisation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The castaways will work as farmers or artisans producing four basic commodities: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    fields&lt;br/&gt;    crops&lt;br/&gt;    tools&lt;br/&gt;    luxury goods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commodities will serve to satisfy their own needs, to increase their production capacity or to trade on the island&amp;rsquo;s exchange. To make trading possible, the castaways have created their own currency, which they have also named Moolah, after the name of the island, and set up a bank whose task is to keep moolah in the island&amp;rsquo;s economic circulation by giving loans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is winning the Celebrity Cup for three years in a row. The cup goes to the player who has accumulated the greatest number of luxury goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
