			<description>This is an educational game system created by McGraw-Hill. It is a workshop designed for small groups of children in Grade 2 who need extra help with reading comprehension skills. There is a set of six game boards (Let's Go Skiing, At the Ranch, Under the Sea, etc.) with lavishly illustrated pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move along the pathway by drawing cards and responding correctly. The first player to reach the Finish space is declared the winner but all of the pathways contain bonus spaces to let slower players gain extra moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
