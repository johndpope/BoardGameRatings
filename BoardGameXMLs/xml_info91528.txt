			<description>From the Curious Games site: &amp;quot;Bluffing Battles is a much needed update to the classic game of War, adding strategy and bluffing, making a fun game for everyone in the family!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players play with 3-card hands, with all cards being shown to each other at the start of the game. The draw pile is also face up so players can have a rough idea what their opponent's hand is - and then they have to guess &amp;quot;Will they bluff?&amp;quot;.  As in traditional War, the players reveal a card, with the larger card revealed capturing the smaller.  The alterations in Bluffing Battles changes the game into a small bluffing/strategy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Base rules are for playing with two decks once through, but includes rule adjustments for playing until one person has all cards, and for single-deck games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
