			<description>Long before Monica Lewinsky and cigars came to the fore on Clinton-based games, &amp;quot;Slick Willie&amp;quot; was a common theme in the Clinton-based game fare. As the designer goes on to note in his introduction, &amp;quot;This game is based solely on my opinion. It's designed to make you laugh at all the hard times we've had over taxation and for all the aggravation, desperation and suffering we're all going to share in the months and years ahead.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In light of the game having come out before Clinton finished his first year in office, the prior 12 years of Republican presidencies, and the subsequent U.S. economic boom, it comes across in hindsight as one of the more mean-spirited Clinton games to hit the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is nominally for two to four players, though the designer notes that, &amp;quot;you may play up to 6 players, for extra pawns use lose [sic] change.&amp;quot; The object of the game is to amass and retain 270 electoral votes while trying to enter the White House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
