			<description>Das Streuhandspiel is a board game that is set against the early years of the German reunification (1990s).  Players assume the roles of rich influential men who try to make profits by exploiting and buying out the East German industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over the course of 16 rounds, in which each player takes a turn of action.  After every 4 rounds, the effects of the players' actions are asserted on the industry and their profits and losses are tallied.  Depending on the space their token lands on, players can undertake four types of actions.  They can buy an East German operation, getting it for free by impersonating as a former owner (the result of a good dice roll) or outbidding the other players in the resulting auction.  Usually, the followup action is to lay off the workers of these operations (at the expense of the industry) to increase profits.  Players can also increase profits by taking the action to grab the grants for rescuing the ecology of the ravaged industrial lands.  The last action is to negotiate with each other to manipulate the market to their benefits through threats, bargains, and bribes.  During the course of the game, cards are drawn that allow their owners to influence the effects of their actions or to affect their opponents'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends with the conclusion of the final (16th) round.  At that point, the players tally up their final assets and the one with the highest wealth wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
