			<description>Subtitle: How to find nearby people to game with&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary: Guide to finding new players for rpg groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;How to find great players&lt;br/&gt;How I consistently find high quality groups and players to game with in my neighborhood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Johnn Four, publisher Roleplaying Tips and former Dragon Magazine columnist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Filling the Empty Chair you will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Find gamers fast and easy online with my list of the best gamer registries and player finder websites.&lt;br/&gt;     Recruit offline quickly with 28 new and easy ideas to find gamers in your local area, even the lapsed ones.&lt;br/&gt;     Attract the best players with my tips and advice on how to create the right kind of ads.&lt;br/&gt;     Always be where the best players are looking by receiving free updates when new sites and methods are added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding fellow gamers is tricky. It's not like we wear a badge, special hat or red shirt. Your neighbor could be an awesome roleplayer and you might never know about it. That's why the online registries are awesome. There are dozens of them now, and your neighbor, or others in your local area, could have visited any one of them and put up a listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's because they are in the same boat as you. But to make your quest even trickier, these registries and player finder sites are spread out all over the internet. Google will pull some up for you, but many are hidden away under strange keywords or are mainly found by links from other RPG websites. It can take hours locating all these places. I have the solution for you though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My name is Johnn Four. I publish the Roleplaying Tips newsletter and also had a column in Dragon Magazine back when it was still in print. My specialty is writing how-to gaming tips and solving gamer problems. I have moved many times, which meant finding a lot of new players through the years. Sometimes I even had to form entire new groups from scratch. Yes indeed, it's difficult finding fellow gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
