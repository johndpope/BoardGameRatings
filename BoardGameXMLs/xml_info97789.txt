							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Casefile: Night Fears</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old Cranston house had stood unoccupied for as long as anyone could remember. Few spoke of why. After a while, everything just passed into rumor, and now nobody knows the truth for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But they do know one thing: it's one hell of a spooky house. If you can make it through the whole night in the Cranston house, you'll be legendary back at school, kings and queens of the hallways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, anybody up for a dare? Come on, we can do it. It'll be a scream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Night Fears is a Dresden Files RPG casefile, a one-shot mystery-adventure intended for 3-7 characters at the &amp;quot;Feet in the Water&amp;quot; power level. Customizable, pregenerated characters, a mix of mortals and minor talents, are provided with sheets and power details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can run it as a &amp;quot;who will survive?&amp;quot; horror thriller, or as a deeper supernatural mystery. Or integrate it into your own game, and use it as a starting point for your characters -- or as trigger-story about the kids who went into the house and never came out again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together with a copy of The Dresden Files RPG: Your Story, Night Fears is perfect for a &amp;quot;test drive&amp;quot; at home, or for a convention GM looking for a print-and-play scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
