In 3 days and during a solar eclipse the outnumbered Christian Army utterly destroys the invaders.  One player is the Christians, the other is the Moors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players share a unique common deck.  Cards are of 7 different types: Leader, Skirmisher, Cavalry, Infantry, Terrain, Strategy and Weapons.  Cards have a force value between 1 and 5 and may also have special effects.  Some cards can ony be used by one side or the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is conducted over a number of turns with each turn comprising 5 phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.

Battle Phase&lt;br/&gt;-    Starting with the Muslim player, players take turns either placing one card down face up from their hand to the table for its force value or discarding one card for its tactical effect:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard a Skirmisher to destroy a placed Infantry&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard a Cavalry to destroy a placed Skirmisher&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard a Strategy card to draw 1 card and look at your opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard an Infantry to destroy a placed Terrain &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard a Terrain to destroy a placed Cavalry&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard a Leader to draw 2 cards&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    Discard a Weapon to destroy another placed Weapon&lt;br/&gt;-    The higher force value wins the hand.
