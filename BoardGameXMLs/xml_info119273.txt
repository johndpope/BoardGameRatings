			<description>An abstract strategy game created for the 2012 Global Game Jam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a circular board, without a set number of &amp;quot;spaces&amp;quot;, but rather the game pieces also make up the number of spaces, and as pieces are captured, the board will shrink until one player has only one piece left, and they are the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have two movement cards laying visible in front of them, and choose how many spaces to move their &amp;quot;king&amp;quot; pieces by flipping one of the cards (thus changing the number of spaces they may potentially move their next turn). The game can be changed subtly by choosing a different set of movement cards to play with each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
