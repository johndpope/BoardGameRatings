							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fun Ranching</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's intro in the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fun Ranching game was created by a 4-H leader of a live-stock club from Albany, Oregon. The details and format of the game were refined by kids from the city involved in her Livestock Club, some with learning abilities. Fun Ranching has three (3) levels to provide equal opportunity for all ages and learning abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THEME: You are living with mom and dad on the OLD HOMESTEAD. They say it is time for you to try ranching on your own. They have authorized the bank to issue each of you $4,000. You may begin BUYING and SELLING Livestock and/or your ranch as soon as the game begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE OBJECT: you are BUYING and SELLING livestock for profit to complete the ranch of your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TO WIN: 1) Own all three (3) ranch properties that complete a ranch. 2) Own the required amount of Livestock to complete a ranch. 3) Have all your bank loans and debts paid in full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
