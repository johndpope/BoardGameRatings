							<name  sortindex="1">Space Quest 2: Vohaul&#039;s Revenge</name>
							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Quest II: Vohaul&#039;s Revenge</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;A comic is included in the manual to explain to the player what events have occurred since Space Quest I, when Roger became Hero of Xenon. The player also learns of the villain, Sludge Vohaul who was behind the original Sarien attack of the Arcada, and how he was driven mad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roger, despite his newfound status as hero, is transferred to the Xenon Orbital Station 4 and promoted to Head (and only) Janitor. All is quiet until he is abducted by Sludge Vohaul.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Roger is being transported to the Labion labour mines as punishment for thwarting Sludge's original plan, the prison ship crash-lands in a nearby jungle upon the planet. He manages to escape his pursuers and the dangers of the Labion jungle and soon reaches Sludge's asteroid base. Once again, it is up to Roger alone to stop Vohaul's evil plan: to eradicate sentient life from Xenon by launching millions of cloned insurance salesmen at the planet!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Space_Quest_II:_Vohaul's_Revenge,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
