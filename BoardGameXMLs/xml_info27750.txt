			<description>A very large bicycle race game, published in Denmark in 1998. The first edition contained stats for riders in the 1998 race season. Other seasons were to follow.&lt;br/&gt; The game was so large it actually came in two big boxes. Total weight was just over 15 lbs. (7kg)! One box contained the basic components to play and the other contained the specific components required to play the 1998/1999 race season. With the modular boards, just about any race course the Tour de France covers could be duplicated.&lt;br/&gt; Each rider stats card will determine if they are a star rider, mountain or sprint specialist or a good all around rider. These cards are based on real rider&amp;rsquo;s stats. At the start of the game each player will build a team of 9 players that includes one star rider and the team you build to support him.&lt;br/&gt; The box came with four rule sets: Danish, German, French &amp;amp; English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
