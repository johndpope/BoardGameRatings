			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: As a swift action I cast my Quickened Fireball and then cast Lightning Bolt as a standard action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: You can do that? I think I need to look that up. (Flips through books&amp;hellip;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many players and game masters alike are familiar with the above scene. A player uses an action type you have never heard of or you player uses a unusual action like lighting a torch and the game stops as you look up the action and to see if it&amp;rsquo;s legal or whether it&amp;rsquo;s a standard action or a full round action. Well, your friends here at Healing Fireball Publications have an elegant answer to this problem. The Combat Cards: Action Types present all of the various action types you can make in a round with a detailed description of each action type and a list of the specific actions that fit in each type on an easy to print and use reference card. Never search a book for the action type again - Move Actions, Standard Actions, Free Actions &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re all here. The Combat Cards put the rules at your fingertips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
