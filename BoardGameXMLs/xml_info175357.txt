							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Moleryn Castle</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moleryn is the capital of the Thardic Republic's Ramala Province and the seat of the provincial magistrate and marshal. It is also the headquarters of the Ramala Legion and houses two of its eight companies. Moleryn sits on the Salt Route, the main corridor for trade between western and eastern H&amp;acirc;rn, and prospers as an important trading center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moleryn Castle article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, and economics, and provides details for some of its craftsmen and other locations. A description and color floor plans are given for the castle, as well as for the Magistrate's Palace, home to the corrupt government officials. Also includes color local maps for GMs and players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portions of this article were originally published in 1987 as part of the Thardic Republic module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
