			<description>Combat School, distributed in North America as Boot Camp, is a 1987 arcade game produced by Konami where the player takes control of a military recruit who is undergoing basic training at a United States Marine Corps Recruit Training also known as a boot camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The control panel consists of a single trackball and two action buttons that change functions between events. The game can be played against a CPU-controlled opponent or a second player. Player 1 takes control of Nick, a brown-haired recruit in an orange shirt, while his rival is Joe, a blond-haired recruit in a blue shirt. The gameplay is similar to the Track &amp;amp; Field games, also released by Konami.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is composed of seven training events whom the player must complete. Upon failure to complete an event, the player must do a set number of chin ups as punishment in order to continue into the other events, or it's game over. The events are as followed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obstacle Course &amp;ndash; Set in a side-scrolling segment, the player must reach the end of the stage under the alloted time before his opponent while climbing walls and clearing bars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting Range No. 1 &amp;ndash; The player must shoot as many targets as possible under the allotted time. If played against a second player, then the one who shoots the most targets win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Man Race &amp;ndash; Similar to the obstacle course, but set in a top view angle. The player must reach the top of the stage while avoid mines and other obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting Range No. 2 &amp;ndash; Same as the first one, but featuring moving targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arm Wrestling &amp;ndash; The two recruits are pitted against each in a match of strength and stamina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shooting Range No. 3 &amp;ndash; The third and final shooting range stage features penalty targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fighting &amp;ndash; The player faces against his instructor in hand-to-hand combat in the final event. If played with a second player, then the two players must fight each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all seven events are cleared, the player's graduates from basic training only to be sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. President from armed terrorists. The final stage consist of a single side-scrolling level where the player must fight off terrorists using the skills acquired during the course of training. This stage can only be played by one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Combat School,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
