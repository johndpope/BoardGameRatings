			<description>Flight Simulator 5 (FS5), released in 1993, was the last DOS-only release in the popular Microsoft Flight Simulator series which began in 1982.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FS5 marked a significant change in that it was the first version of the series to use textures. While this allowed FS5 to achieve a much higher degree of realism than the previous flat-shaded simulators, it also resulted in all add-on scenery and aircraft for the previous versions obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other noticeable improvements included the use of digital audio for sound effects, custom cockpits for each aircraft (previous versions had a generic cockpit that was slightly modified to fit various aircraft), and overall improved graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FS5 also featured:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded bundled scenery (now including parts of Europe)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Improvements to: modeling of the included aircraft, weather system's realism and artificial intelligence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;History of Microsoft Flight Simulator&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
