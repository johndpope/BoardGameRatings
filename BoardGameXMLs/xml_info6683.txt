							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dick Tracy Playing Card Game</name>
									
			<description>A simple but original card game - the goal is to get a hand which is just Dick Tracy and 4 Jewels. There are only 3 card types, Dick Tracy, Jewels, and Thugs. Each turn you can discard Jewels, Dick Tracy, or Thug WITH Dick Tracy, as many times as you like - filling your hand back to 5 at the end of the turn. If you only have Thugs you show your hand and discard one card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going out is 30 points. Other players are penalized for each thug in their hand not canceled by a Dick Tracy, and rewarded for each Jewel. The game is to 100.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
