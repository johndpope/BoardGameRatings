							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lesserton &amp; Mor</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lesserton and Mor: A Place to Risk Your Life&amp;hellip; and a Place to Live It Up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once, the vast city of Great Mor stood as mankind&amp;rsquo;s proudest achievement, civilization&amp;rsquo;s farthest outpost, impregnable to any invasion&amp;hellip; or so the Dukes of Morland believed. But when the mighty Half-Orc Lord unified all the barbaric humans and humanoids of Eastern Valnwall into a single giant army, and the Wood Elf King abandoned the humans to their doom, Great Mor fell. Something more than warfare tore through the city, destroying invader and defender alike, laying waste for miles around. The survivors clung to a bit of rock in the swamp and slowly built up the town of Lesserton: home base for any who dare enter the Ruins of Mor and hope to return with treasure and their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This complete supplement for any classic fantasy role-playing game includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Lesserton: A separate booklet suitable for handing to the players, with popular shops, inns and prices, rules for making your own local PC, and how to earn experience points through good living!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Referee&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Lesserton: With a quick, readable style, this tome covers everything a sinful town of 7,600 can offer: Neighborhoods and racial intolerance, haggling, begging, muggers and pickpockets, bribes and the law, cost of living (poorly or well), rumors and hirelings, massive celebrations and their aftermath, entertainers, services on the street, gambling and drinking, finding adventure, searching for love, and 65 shops and establishments peopled with over 140 quirky NPCs. Plus a bonus adventure by Jeff &amp;ldquo;Bighara&amp;rdquo; Sparks, DEADLY CHANCES!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Referee&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Mor: From getting past the giant walls in the first place, to the many deadly beings who lurk in the Ruins, to the peculiar habits of the Vermin Tribes, this guide holds everything the referee needs to run adventures in the Ruins of Mor. The double-sized map covers two square miles, framed and seeded with set locations and foes, and offering plenty of room for random Weirdness, wandering monsters, and the referee&amp;rsquo;s own ideas. Tables cover day and night encounters, Hazards, Hauntings, Excavations, Lairs, Pits, orkin clans, the Curse of Mor, and much else besides. Includes BELOW THE JADE TEMPLE, a bonus adventure by Jeff &amp;ldquo;Bighara&amp;rdquo; Sparks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
