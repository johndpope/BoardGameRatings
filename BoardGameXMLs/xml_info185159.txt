							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Into the Thieves&#039; Guild (d20)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Adventure for Four 8th-Level Player Characters...Corfin has been the lieutenant of the Thieves&amp;rsquo; Guild for nearly 15 years and he is sick of it. He wishes to be the head of the guild. But for some reason, all of his men are deathly afraid of the current head, one Lalsthor Longcloak. He has had no success paying anyone to assassinate Longcloak; indeed Corfin himself feels an irrational fear when he is in the mysterious presence of his leader.  Therefore he has had to suffer as second in command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
