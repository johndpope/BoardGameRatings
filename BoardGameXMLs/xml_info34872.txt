							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ELECTION! The Election Game</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELECTION! The Election Game is a fun new board game which puts you on the road to the White House! Roll the die and move around the board collecting Money, Lobby, Vote and Politics cards. First, get elected to Congress, then the Senate, and, if you collect enough Votes , move to the inner circle, occupy the White House and WIN THE GAME! But watch out! There are many pitfalls along the way! Opponents can freeze you in place with a FILLIBUSTER! card, or steal your Votes  with a REDISTRICTING card! But you can fend off their attacks with SPIN CONTROL! cards! Ten different Politics cards; thousands of scenarios!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELECTION! The Election Game combines skill, luck and strategy in a simplified and non-partisan game that makes light of the hijinx that characterize American politics and the election process. It is easy enough for anyone to quickly enjoy, but requires enough strategy to make players think and plan ahead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
