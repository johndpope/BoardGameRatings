							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fenrir&#039;s Fury</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the frozen wasteland of the Norselands, a gentle druid returned to his village after a successful hunt. Upon his return he found his village reduced to a smoldering ruin, his home ransacked, and his family slaughtered. All love died that day, and his soul became a rock of ice bent upon revenge. Thus begins the fury of the rabid wolf shaman Fenrir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Sidetrek Adventure is set in the great viking north and is suitable for 4-5 6th level characters. It includes skill encounter rules for viking lie-tells and cross country travel as well as 6 custom battlemaps suitable for printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sidetrek Adventures are short flavorful adventures that can be inserted into an ongoing game with very little effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
