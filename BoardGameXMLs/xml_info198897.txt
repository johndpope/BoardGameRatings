							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The King&#039;s Shadow</name>
									
			<description>The King's Shadow, his adviser, confidant and second in command has unexpectedly died. You are racing others to fill that position. &lt;br/&gt;   Using a worker placement mechanism combined with spatial maneuvering you attempt to gain the most support from the villagers to influence the King's decision on who will his next Shadow.&lt;br/&gt;   You have 3 minions at your disposal. The first part of the game players take turns selecting villagers these minions will initially influence to your side. The second half of the game has the players moving the influenced villagers around in a grid based movement system to gather further influence from surrounding villagers.&lt;br/&gt;   After all the villagers have moved, the player who gained the most influence will become new King's Shadow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
