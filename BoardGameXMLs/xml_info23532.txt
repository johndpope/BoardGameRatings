			<description>It all comes down to this. You are competing against rival corporations for a multi trillion-dollar contract. You are up against the most brilliant robotics engineers in the Solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each opponent will deploy a squadron of four robots representing decades of development and billions of dollars in material and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your goal: Infiltrate your opponent&amp;rsquo;s home stations while preventing all of them from doing the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But wait! There&amp;rsquo;s a catch. A single Intercepting Trapper robot represents the previous champion. The I.T. robot will capture and imprison any other robot it comes into contact with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to use all of your best programming skill. Employ on the fly upgrades to your robots to make them more formidable, more elusive and more intelligent. Of course, your rivals will all be doing the same!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A description of the game itself:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a squad of four Chase-Bots. The object is to get your robots into the starting spaces of your opponents. Game play is in three phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.    The Programming Phase&lt;br/&gt;2.    The Reveal Phase&lt;br/&gt;3.    The Movement Phase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Programming Phase, each player selects one card from their hand and places it face down in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Reveal Phase players simultaneously turn their cards over. Turn order for each round is determined by the values of the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Movement Phase, each player moves his Chase-bots in turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last player to move one of his Chase-bots into the main play area is the first to be IT. He must capture another Chase-bot with the black IT robot before he can move his own Chase-bots again. This makes one of the other players IT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the game players will be installing, stealing and interfering with each other&amp;rsquo;s Upgrades. Upgrades give each player additional abilities such as alternative ways of moving their robots, increasing their hand size and any of up to 30 special powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Trigger cards add to the excitement as players wrest turn order from each other, steal upgrades from one another and basically sabotage their opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playground tag was never quite like this!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
