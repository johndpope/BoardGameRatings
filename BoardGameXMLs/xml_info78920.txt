			<description>From the game manual:&lt;br/&gt;Now you can enjoy this top rated TV show anytime.  That's right, $1,000,000 could be yours!  That's virtual dollars of course, and only if you can answer all 15 questions correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play by yourself of with as many people as you can cram around a keyboard. Either way, the gameplay is always challenging, with hundreds of questions that will become increasingly more difficult the closer you get to $1,000,000. You'll experience all of the excitement that the TV show has to offer.  From the Fastest Finger round to using those precious Lifelines, you'll be the one in the hot seat hearing that ominous question &amp;quot;Is that your final answer?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
