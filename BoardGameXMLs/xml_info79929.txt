			<description>Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition​ is a 3D fighting video game produced by SNK. The game was released in Japanese arcades on January 28, 1999, though the title screen shows the year 1998. It is part of the Fatal Fury series of fighting games. It was one of the last games released for the Hyper Neo Geo 64 system board. It was ported to the Sony PlayStation on June 24, 1999 in Japan and December 11, 1999 in North America. The game was re-released as a downloadable game for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via PlayStation Network in Japan on April 25, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game re-tells the story of the original Fatal Fury video game. It introduces Touji Sakata and Tsugumi Sendo to the series, and places Mai Shiranui, Kim Kaphwan, and Li Xiangfei as participants of the original King of Fighters tournament. Ryuji Yamazaki also appears as a mid-boss character. Ryo Sakazaki makes an appearance as Mr. Karate, tying the events of Art of Fighting 2 to this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition is a 3D fighting game, but gameplay is similar to that of a 2D fighter. The button layout is the same from Real Bout Fatal Fury 2, but the D Button is now called the Axis Shift instead of the Line Sway. This feature allows players to move their characters left or right using 3D movement. Characters attack using Punches, Kicks, and Heavy Attacks. Every character also has an assortment of Special Moves and Desperation Moves (Now called Super Power Attacks). Super Power Attacks can only be performed when the player's health meter is flashing red, and does not use the Heat Meter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much like in Real Bout Fatal Fury 2, players are able to perform throws, counter attacks, pursuit attacks, taunt and recover quickly after being knocked out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
