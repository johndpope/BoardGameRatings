							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pixel Glory: Pets Expansion</name>
									
			<description>Pets are awesome companions that join you on your quest for Pixel Glory! Pets stay by your side every turn to help you slay monsters in the dungeon. You acquire a pet in the town/drafting phase by choosing to draft one instead of a spell. Before the town/drafting phase, one pet for each player is shuffled into the spell deck - players may only use one pet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is exclusive to Kickstarter and conventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Base-game reminder:&lt;br/&gt;Pixel Glory is a fast-paced dungeon crawling card game for two to four players that plays in 20 minutes and takes five minutes to learn. Team up with fellow wizards to vanquish the sinister monsters that lurk in the dungeon, and save the nearby village. This is a noble and honourable quest, and... oh, who are we kidding? In reality, you're a greedy wizard who is all about fame and personal gain, and your fellow wizards are cut from the same cloth! Prevail over your opponents by learning the best spells and using that knowledge to out-manoeuvre and kill-steal in the dungeon, so you can gain admiration of the townsfolk, fame across the realm, and achieve Pixel Glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
