							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Othello</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First performed at the court of King James I on November 1st, 1604, The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice is one of Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s more unusual works. Set during the war between Venice and Turkey of almost a half-century prier, the play tells a sordid story of lust, hatred, revenge, murder, and suicide. Granted, these elements alone hardly mark the play as different from any of the Bard&amp;rsquo;s other tragedies. What makes Othello unique, however, is the title character; the play&amp;rsquo;s tragic hero. Men of color and Moors had often been portrayed in Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre, but usually as comic buffoons or as scheming villains. In Othello we find a noble and heroic man worthy of admiration; and by play&amp;rsquo;s end, the audience &amp;mdash; no matter how white or how Christian &amp;mdash; finds itself empathizing with the ruined warrior. This RPG sourcebook focus on the history and setting of this well known Shakespeare piece and how to integrate it into your regular local gaming session. This sourcebook also comes with several adventures seed with different endings to this classic play. You have read the dramatic piece, now play the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
