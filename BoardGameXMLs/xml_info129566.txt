							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Little Game of Good Manners</name>
									
			<description>This trivia/party game can be played in two teams or with at least two players. The topic is &amp;quot;good manners&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to win as many cards as possible, by answering questions about good manners and performing tasks from the activity cards. Each card is worth 1 point. The game is over when the first player reaches the goal box. The player who has won the most cards/points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activity cards come in two types: &amp;quot;Picture Memo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Confusing Letters&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Picture Memo&amp;quot; means the active player has to memorize the picture on the card. After 30 seconds, the player on the left makes up a question about the picture, which the active player has to answer. In the &amp;quot;Confusing Letters&amp;quot; activity, there are three words on the card, with their letters jumbled. The active player has to guess the words while the timer is running.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
