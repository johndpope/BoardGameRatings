			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q-bitz Jr. is a fun way to introduce your child to pattern matching, spatial reasoning, problem solving, visualization and more. The engaging play is easy to learn and mastering it will give your child the visual intelligence needed for future math and STEM success. A complete parent guide offers more ways to play with Q-bitz cubes to foster additional learning and visual dexterity. Plus, it's so much fun, your child will want to play again and again! Game play is simple. Each player receives a set of for same-colored cubes and a sturdy wooden tray. When someone turns over a pattern card, it's off to the races as players simultaneously try to recreate the pattern with their set of cubes. The first player to match the card shouts &amp;quot;Q-bitz!&amp;quot; and wins the card. A round of rolling the cubes adds more luck and excitement. The player with the most cards after six rounds wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
