							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">So What&#039;s For Sale, Anyway? V</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your PCs have final emerged from the dungeon laden with loot pried from the clutches of their slain foes. Heroically returning to civilization, they divide up the choicest items, sell the dross and other unwanted treasures and gleefully count their share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most are happy to spend their loot on normal magic items, but others like to buy esoteric or unique items, and chief amongst some objects are intelligent magical items! So, they ask &amp;ldquo;So what intelligent magic items are for sale in this town, anyway?&amp;rdquo; At that point, likely or not, the game grinds to a halt as the GM frantically generates a few lackluster items (After all, most GMs have better things to do with their prep time than generate what the PCs might want to buy on the off chance they return to town after a successful foray).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s For Sale, Anyway? V banishes this problem by providing 30 pre-generated, ready-to-use intelligent magical items for the busy GM to immediately use in his campaign. Each item comes fully detailed with powers, personality, background and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is a Dual Format PDF. The downloadable ZIP file contains two versions, one optimised for printing and use on a normal computer and one optimised for use on a mobile device such as an iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
