							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Frontiers: Alpha Dawn (Digitally Remastered)</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star Frontiers was my first game purchase. I shelled out ten bucks and had no idea exactly what I had bought. I knew it was a game, I knew it looked cool, but I had never played a role-playing game before and wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely certain what to expect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I opened the box when I got home and found two plastic odd- shaped dice, a white crayon (to fill in the engraved numbers on the plastic dice then wipe off the excess), a couple of books (one called &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; and one called &amp;ldquo;Expanded&amp;rdquo; rules), and a bunch of tactical maps and punch-out chits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My first game was a lot of fun, though I did just about everything wrong that I think is possible. The character&amp;rsquo;s stats were all inflated, I kept increasing IM with each roll, adding over and over... You name it I did it wrong. But it was an amazing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a few years, I had a lot of experience with role-playing. Friends got me into playing D&amp;amp;D and some others, and I learned the value of good story-telling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During all this time, I kept playing Star Frontiers. My human military specialist turned spy became very tough, able to handle just about any situation. He had enemies and friends all over the frontier, had an island on a remote world with a private military base and a small army to defend it. I played other characters, but Gavin Rove was always my favorite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most amazing thing about all this... I never purchased another supplement. I played and played, never running out of ideas, imagination, adventures, enemies, and fun. One box is all I needed. Games just don&amp;rsquo;t sell that way anymore. Any company that did that would be shooting itself in the foot financially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So that is why I have assembled all these rules here. You won&amp;rsquo;t find too much modification to the original, I tried to keep it all true. Anything I added is shown as optional, and derived from some published TSR source or another (Dragon Magazine, adventure modules, etc.) I didn&amp;rsquo;t add much in the way of house rules in order to remain true to the original game. All in all, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping someone else gets their hands on this book and has years of fun and adventure, just like I did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
