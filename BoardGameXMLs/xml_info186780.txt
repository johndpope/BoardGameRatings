			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a historical adventure, not merely in that it is set in a historical place and time, but in the fact that the characters are based on people who really lived and the events are based on a variety of similar events which actually happened in the period. Some specifics have been changed or added, but in essence, this is how it was six-hundred and fifty years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature of money as used here should be noted. The standard coinage is the Pound (&amp;pound;) (20s), the Shilling (s) (12d) and the Penny (d). 1 UX$ on the Oroborus price list is equal to about 3 Shillings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players should be prepared for the rigors of this background. Characters should have almost no personal wealth or possessions (PRIx2s) and be young and inexperienced. It might be a good idea to have a fairly large group of characters, even two per player, as large numbers may be needed. Alternatively, it might work well with a party of 4-6 primary characters with one or more retainers or hangers-on each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
