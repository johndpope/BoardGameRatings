			<description>Match Makers - an abstract game dripping with theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this two-player card game the competitors try to lead promising couples from first love through engagement to a happy wedding. You will be&lt;br/&gt; - drawing characters from the character deck,&lt;br/&gt; - forming new enamored couples,&lt;br/&gt; - strengthening the relationship of your couples through engagement or marriage and&lt;br/&gt; - seducing your opponent's characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Couples that have many common interests are less vulnerable to seduction, but will also earn less points in the final scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friends of tile laying games will enjoy the hunt for every opportunity to break up opposing twosomes. A good timing of the available actions - combined with swift adaption to the rule changes triggered by the marriage licenses - is the key to success. You can play on the safe side, but should definitely take some risk when your opponent has a limited hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/match-makers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/match-makers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
