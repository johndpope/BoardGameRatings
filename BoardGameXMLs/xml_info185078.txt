			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fantasized Adventures is available online as HTML or can be downloaded as multiple DOC files.  The HTML formatting is difficult to use because the material is divided into quite small units.  It is a rules-heavy game with much complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have an Occupation, which is somewhat analogous to a Class found in typical RPGs though less restrictive and less significant.  Characters also have nine Attributes (Agility, Appearance, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Leadership, Luck, Strength, and Wisdom) that are randomly generated wish scores ranging from 3-18 before racial adjustments.  The game supports &amp;quot;Exceptional Attributes&amp;quot; for high scores.  Characters also calculate a RALF (Roll Attribute Luck Factor) Score and calculate Action Points (how much a character can do during a round) and Movement Points (how far a character can move during a round).  Each Attribute has a variety of effects on various classes and the relationships become quite complex.  Characters gain Experience and can advance in Rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters use Skills by, generally, rolling d100 and trying to roll below their situational modified Skill Rank.  However, Skills have assigned Letter Codes and other nuances that make Skill resolution complicated.  Combat generally is resolved with a d20 compared to a &amp;quot;to hit&amp;quot; calculation, but again numerous modifiers and rules come into play making the entire process complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are tightly linked to a unique setting, with e.g. special rules carried throughout for several unique races and various Skills depending upon race, occupation, or region.  However, the primary definition of the setting is found in a companion work, The World of Ba'Kara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
