			<description>BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend (originally titled BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II Plus) was announced for the PlayStation Vita at E3 2011, and was later confirmed to be slated for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well. The game features an updated version of Calamity Trigger's Story Mode called Blazblue Calamity Trigger Reconstruction, the inclusion of Relius Clover as a playable character, four new stories for Platinum, Makoto, Valkenhayn, and Relius, a new Unlimited Mars game mode, hidden Distortion Drives for every playable character's Unlimited form, and further balance tweaks. In addition, the game also includes a new opening animation produced by Production I.G. as well as new theme song called &amp;quot;Sōkyū no Hikari&amp;quot; (蒼穹の光 Celestial Light?) by Faylan. Aksys has also released Continuum Shift Extend international. A version for the game for the PlayStation Portable was released on May 31, 2012 in Japan. This version features an exclusive BBQ (BlazBlue Quiz) Mode not found in the other versions. However, while the other versions have full online play, the PSP version is limited to ad-hoc, with support for two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
