			<description>Contents:&lt;br/&gt;1 dice, 1 jigged playing board, 1 wolf spinner, 4 playing piece cards, each showing 3 pigs, 4 coloured card stands, 4 sets of slot-together houses, one of straw, one of sticks and one of brick&lt;br/&gt;The object is to build a straw, stick and brick house in front of you before moving your pigs to the safety of the middle of the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;Players throw the die to move round the board. If the player lands on a brick, stick or straw square they take a house piece of that type from the pile on the table. If they have already completed that particular house, they do not take a house piece and play passes to the next player. Players are aiming to collect both pieces of each house, which are slotted together in front of them.&lt;br/&gt;If the player lands on a wolf square, they spin the wolf spinner. If the spinner points to a stick or straw house, the player may take one of those pieces from another player saying &amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;ll huff and I&amp;rsquo;ll puff, and I will blow your house down!&amp;quot; If they do not need the house piece, because they have already completed that house, they take the piece and return it to the relevant pile on the table. If the spinner points to the brick house, the wolf cannot blow it down, so the player cannot take another player&amp;rsquo;s house piece.&lt;br/&gt;When a player has assembled all three houses, they have to continue to play in order to reach the safety of the middle of the playing board (throwing the exact number, or more to move there). Other players can still take pieces of their completed straw and stick houses. If this happens, then the player who loses a piece/s of their house, must replace it/them before, again, attempting to go to the middle of the playing board.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to reach the safety of the middle of the playing board, having assembled their three houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
