			<description>Nation is a great game of tactics and military strategies where the diplomacy and the ruse of each player take precedence over the chance and the stroke of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to build 1 capital and 10 headquarters.&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a Capital, represented by a hexagon with a star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns:&lt;br/&gt;1- Raising army&lt;br/&gt;2- Moving armies&lt;br/&gt;3- Fighting&lt;br/&gt;4- Building headquarters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Capital and headquarters are providing movement and force points (1 each to a limit of 6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement points are used to move pieces (tanks, ships and fighters).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Force points are the force of a unit (including Capital and HQ) have to attack or defend. Units can be combined from adjacent hex, the force with the higher points total win, the defeated force must retreat according to specific rules.
