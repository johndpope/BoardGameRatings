			<description>Multipli Cat's is a card game of calculation, memory, concentration and speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns turning their cards over and compare their results. If 2 players have the same result (for instance 4 x 9 and 36), they must hit the mouse card placed in the center of the table (green card) as fast as possible. The quickest gives his cards to his opponent.&lt;br/&gt;There are six different action cards which give more punch to the game. They either require speed or quick counting.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
