							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hollows of the Haemsea</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hollows of the Haemsea is a sandbox-oriented adventure space for no specific setting or system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material covers a set of notable locations bordering the titular Haemsea, provides an approach to the generation of local settlements and routes, and introduces three beings: the howler, the phonklid - part of a far larger organism - and the flicker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also includes tables for possible settlements, figures present and strange arcana, plus notes on the life on the Fringes, the weird phireover mist, the cultivation and effects of the substance known as haemphire and the structure and behaviour of a phonk colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also describes a powerful entity from another realm - the shifting halls - an agreement with which could span decades and bring unimagined riches or ruin, and major repercussions not only for the Fringes themselves, but the wider region and even the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hollows of the Haemsea can be combined with many of the products in the main bundle: the Elaboration series can be used to add detail to the structures, the mist, the phonk interior and the sea, the Character series to develop specific figures and the Events to introduce new situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
