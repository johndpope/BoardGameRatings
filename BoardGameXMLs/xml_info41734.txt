							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Destination Bournemouth &amp; Poole</name>
									
			<description>DESTINATION is the award winning fast moving Taxi game that will take you on a journey through the streets of Bournemouth in your very own cab!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the driver you will visit famous destinations in the city, collecting fares and trying to avoid the traffic lights. You must not run out of fuel, or lose your license and be careful not to upgrade to a Turbo Taxi too quickly as you could run out of cash and may need a logbook loan to bail you out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this game is to be the player with the highest earnings... if you survive the shift!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
