			<description>This educational card game was intended to teach children &amp;quot;the names and numbers of the British cavalry regiments&amp;quot;. The cards are illustrated with the various regiments, and the instructions note that: &amp;quot;It is taken for granted that the players know that there are seven Dragoon Guard Regiments&amp;quot;. Players compete through drawing and exchanging cards to complete sets of the regiments, with the player completing the most regiments winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game appears to have been published sometime between 1900 and 1920.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
