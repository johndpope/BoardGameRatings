			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are go for landing on the moon - only the moon isn't there to make it easy for you. Craggy mountains and craters make it difficult for you to find one of the few safe landing spots on the surface, and even when you're aligned above level ground, your fuel is running out fast. Do you have the right stuff that it'll take before you can take one giant leap?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very well-done Lunar Lander clone, using the keyboard to rotate the lander, and the first paddle (or joystick X) to control the thrust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed by Bill Budge, the game is the Apple II version of Atari's first arcade game, Lunar Lander.  Budge created a new graphics routine for the Apple II (simulating Atari's wireframe graphics) and maintained the limited fuel and control of rotation and thrust of the lander, that were the hallmarks of the original lunar lander text game, which was written in FOCAL and created by Jim Storer in 1969.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Budge's version, if you didn't land softly enough (or didn't land on the landing pad), there was a goofy animation where your ship would break into pieces and fly off into the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edu-ware later acquired the rights to the game from Budge, and re-published it in 1984.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
