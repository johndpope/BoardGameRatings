			<description>From the back of the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;To enjoy hours of fast-paced professional boxing at its best, the TR VCR Top Rank Boxing Game included hundreds of fight action sequences taken from your favorite outstanding boxing contests.  See your favorite contenders in action such as Roberto Duran, 'Marvelous' Marvin Hagler, Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini, and of course, many, many more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and your opponent clash throughout 15 rounds of thrilling boxing action, scoring as many points as possible just like authentic professional boxing.  But watch out!  There is the ever present threat of a knock-out punch that will end match [sic].  Or, if you get in serious trouble the referee will end it for you by calling the match a technical knock-out (or TKO).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever happens, you and your opponent(s) are assured of enjoying the most realistic boxing game ever.  So choose your opponent, find a ring-side seat in the comfort of your own home, and join in the boxing excitement with the TR VCR Top Rand Boxing Game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a game board, &amp;quot;Fight Action&amp;quot; cards, &amp;quot;Boxer Challenge&amp;quot; cards, &amp;quot;Punch Action&amp;quot; cards, and a &amp;quot;Fight Action&amp;quot; videocassette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
