							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Artificer</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artificer is a rare individual, able to blend science and magic, two disciplines often considered to be mutually exclusive, to create potent items of aid to scholar and warrior alike. With a mind capable of understanding the intricacies of arcane formulae and the reactions between various alchemical reagents he makes a welcome addition to many adventuring parties, albeit one accompanied by the smell of oil and the whirring sound of gears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 6th book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20 system game, each of these mini-supplements introduces an entirely new core character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
