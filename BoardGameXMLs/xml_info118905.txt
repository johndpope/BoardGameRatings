			<description>World Combat (Warzaid in Europe) is a military themed first-person light gun rail shooter. The arcade game comes in two types of cabinets, one for four players and one for two players. The game possesses many similarities to Namco's Time Crisis series, not the least of which is the ability of players to take cover at will. Each player character comes equipped with a large, portable metal shield that can block incoming projectiles. Unlike the Time Crisis games, however, this shield is not activated by a foot pedal, but rather by pointing the gun outside the screen (like many classic first-person rail shooters, shooting off-screen also reloads the player's weapon). The game also features a mechanic similar to Time Crisis's &amp;quot;Crisis Sighting,&amp;quot; where most enemy projectiles miss the player harmlessly, but those that are an immediate threat slow down and are much larger than normal, giving the player a small window to react.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Warzaid&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
