			<description>Technology changed our past. Firstly gave us improvements, comfort, progress and evolution. But this technology used metals for military purposes. Metal and technology gave us armors and weapons. These armors and weapons got to be Mechs, and these piloted Mechs became very powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year 2200 began the war, it was inevitable ... metal mixed with technology turned to fire, smoke and destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nowadays a few cities have survived, and are defended with great metal walls, mazes and gates to prepare a first defense before reaching the city center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Men are only worth their armor inherited from parents to children. Sometimes armors are made with scrap and pieces of other Mechs, rarely are new designed and most often are stolen on the battlefield. Really there is no longer honor in the war.&lt;br/&gt;Pirates, mercenaries and traitors attack the cities to conquer them, loot them or steal as much junk and technology as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After so many years you have managed to form a small unit of mercenaries with a few Mechs, mechanics and droids. You vowed to defend those few cities that are still standing. Each time the attacks are harder and less resources are available, but Metal City, the place you was born, can&amp;acute;t fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Wars is a tactical game with 70mm and 50 mm big Mechs, 32 mm miniatures and scenery. With 2 game modes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Co-op campaign with 8 missions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Competitive Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-op mode:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have a mercenary unit and you must save Metal City from attacks and looting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select your assigned pilots Mechs, weapons and ammunition, hire mercenaries and other types of units, use the scenery to overcome the 8 missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explore the map in each mission, with scenography, enemies and random events within the course of the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help yourself with the fire, barrels filled with gasoline, protective walls and access doors. Gain special skills for your pilots through experience points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tutorial mision:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You've been hired for a mission outside Metal City in the unsecured zone. You have to find and bring 2 parts of an engine, and a unit of pirate mercenaries prowl the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Nora, starts Mech Steel engines, we have a mission!, cried Paul, &amp;quot;The Legend.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Take your tools, we'll need you. Paul continued looking at the mechanical engineer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Paul, medium and short range weapons for the Mechs?, Nora consulted, although she knew the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Yes, today we have an eassy mission, enter and leave, how many times have we heard that, Nora?, Paul answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Will you hire a freelance?, the mechanic asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul shook his head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Mechanic, help me to load more ammunition, we'll need it, Nora asked while she was walking to the hangar where the Mechs sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
