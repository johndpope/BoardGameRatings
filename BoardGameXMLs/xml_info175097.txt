			<description>Farrago is an entertaining quiz game where you start off with $75,000. You need to travel around the world and visit the casinos of Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Monte Carlo, and Macau. On the way you must answer questions: Correct answers wins you money, but it costs if you can't answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You also have the oppertunity to gamble. You can challenge your opponents in Black Jack to win their money - or loose. You can put money on the dice, the one-armed bandit, or try a fortune cookie, which can bring fortune but most certain also the opposite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first to visit the four casinos, reach the board's center and correctly answer a crucial question. BUT only if you also have the most money in your pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Farrago there are plenty of opportunities to both gloat with your knowledge and tease your opponents, when winning their money from them. You must dare to gamble, challenge your opponents and have the fate on your page. Or you can go completely bust when the playing fever runs away with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
