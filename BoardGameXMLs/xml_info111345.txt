			<description>From Loren Wiseman's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20-ton launch is among the smallest general utility craft in common use, manufactured in many configurations throughout known space. This publication deals with nine common variants (including an armed version -- the 20-ton gig). This book contains nine variants on the same basic design, and includes deckplans (scaled at 1/2&amp;quot; = 1.5 meters) and game ratings for Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and GURPS Traveller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the standard, unmodified launch, this book describes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Lifeboat variant, carried by small merchant starships, and equipped with emergency low berths for 24 passengers.&lt;br/&gt;    The Liaison Launch, for use as a mobile office/headquarters by business magnates or military officers.&lt;br/&gt;    The Survey Launch, used by scientific missions and bases.&lt;br/&gt;    The Search &amp;amp; Rescue variant.&lt;br/&gt;    The Hunting Launch, carried by yachts and safari ships.&lt;br/&gt;    The Retail Launch, used by retailers in remote areas as a mobile &amp;quot;general store.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    The Estate variant, used by managers of large plantations, factory farms, estates, and wilderness preserves.&lt;br/&gt;    The Gig (Armed Launch).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
