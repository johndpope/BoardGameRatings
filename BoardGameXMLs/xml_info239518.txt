							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legend of Zelda: Clockwork Realm â€“ Shattered Lands Expansion</name>
									
			<description>The Shattered Lands expansion for The Legend of Zelda: Clockwork Realm takes the hero Link outside of the dungeon and allows him to explore the land of Hyrule by adding a new Overworld Phase.  Unlike in the base game, the heroes no longer begin each level with a pre-determined number of Items, nor do they start with any Triforce Shards.  Instead, they must work for every advantage they can get before proceeding into the various dungeons by exploring the land of Hyrule and encountering its many denizens.  Shops will allow you to spend your hard-earned rupees to buy Items; challenges may allow the hero to upgrade his Skill cards to higher levels; and Lore, Quest and Forage encounters may endow the hero with a variety of benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of the Cogs introduced in the base game is continued above ground, with the landscape of Hyrule shifting and changing between turns.  Many paths exist to allow the hero move from one location to another, but they won't always connect on the ways the hero might want them to.  Players can play their Skill cards to move around Hyrule, as well as allowing them to shift the Location tiles around, permitting them to reach previously unattainable locations.  The treasures that the heroes have gained may also provide shortcuts or otherwise give the players an advantage during encounters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
