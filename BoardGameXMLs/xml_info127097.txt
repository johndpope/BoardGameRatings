							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Brief &#039;n&#039; Brisk Baseball</name>
									
			<description>Statistical baseball simulation, different to the company's Brief 'n' Brisk Major League Baseball. Unusually for this owner/designer, Patrick Premo, he has co-designed this game, not published it as one of his own designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual, dice and charts combine to give match results. Results are quickly established so a whole season is a realistic possibility to complete in only a few evenings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An amazing number of teams are rated, from 1871 to 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
