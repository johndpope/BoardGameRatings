			<description>Pocket version with questions about about food and drinks. Comes in a special two-part container that holds the questions and pie wedges, and is played by two players or teams. In this version there is no board. Just a category-die to determine in which category the player gets a question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon the right answer the player gets a pie token to fill his playing piece. Whoever fills his piece first with 6 different colors wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
