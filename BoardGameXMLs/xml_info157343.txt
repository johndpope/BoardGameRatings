							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Village of Troubles</name>
									
			<description>from How to use the Village:&lt;br/&gt;This scenario provides seven micro-encounters to use with Dungeon Delvers. Feel free to use them singly in any village, or together to stop the cult of the Devourer, at least for now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encounters were designed with 4 PCs in mind, but difficulty/opposition can be adjusted up or down if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The encounters in this village were inspired by Scott (AngryDM) Rehm&amp;rsquo;s village map as posted on Google+.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;The map is not included but a link to the file is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
