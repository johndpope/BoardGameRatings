			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dream Hunters is a storytelling scavenger hunt game for a technological world. Players are tasked with taking pictures of specific Images over the course of a predetermined Time-Limit. But just taking a picture is not enough. Players must also capture the story of a Dream in that picture. Whoever does so best will earn the votes of their fellow players in the Dream Council and the player with the most votes wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dream Hunters is a game which can be played face-to-face, via digital corespondence, over social media, or by mixing any of these mediums. Because of the variety of ways in which this game may be played, some rules (such as the Time Limit and details for voting) are left open to the needs of your individual game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
