			<description>Trial! is an interaction game in which players assume the roles of Prosecution, Defense, Witnesses, Judge, and Jury and try a case from key bits of evidence.  The game is for six to any number of players (more than 8 and the extra players become the Jury).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three teams are set up:  the Accused and Defense, the Prosecutor and Key Witness, and the Judge and Jury (who can also double as witnesses).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards are drawn to determine key elements of the trial... the crime, evidence, and witnesses.  The prosecution team has 5 minutes to form a case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played like a real trial, witnesses are called, evidence is examined and the Judge makes rulings.  When the final closing statements are made, the Judge and Jury each get a Verdict sheet and vote Guilty, Not Guilty or Abstain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the majority vote is Guilty, the Prosecutor and all Jurors who voted Guilty win the game.  Not Guilty goes to the Defense and Jurors.  If there is a tie, there is a hung jury and nobody wins (unless jurors have abstained, then they win).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
