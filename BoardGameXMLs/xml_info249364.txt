							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Â¡TACO FIGHT!</name>
									
			<description>A strategic card game. Taco Tuesday has gone terribly wrong. The Tacos are fighting back. Can you survive the taco attack before going into a food coma?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;iexcl;TACO FIGHT!, the players work cooperatively to fight and survive a taco attack. You'll smash tacos and use their ingredients to build defenses. You'll also eat the tacos, but be careful! If you eat too many, you might go into a food coma. The player is not out of the game as they can be brought back in by other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the tacos get spicier and stronger, their numbers grow. As they start to overwhelm you with their numbers, you'll have to work together to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn is broken into two parts. First, you play an ingredient card to increase your or someone else's defense. Second, the tacos attack! The player with the &amp;quot;&amp;iexcl;TACO FIGHT!&amp;quot; token is attacked by a number of tacos that increases over the course of the game. If that player doesn't have a strong enough defense to survive the attack, they go into a food coma! The players win by surviving the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
