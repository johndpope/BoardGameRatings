			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delve right in to your D&amp;amp;D world and populate it with some of the most peculiar, intriguing, and imaginative NPCs you can find. Developing a character can take an awful lot of time and effort, and for a good reason; they are people and beings with a history of their own. Any one NPC can have as much background as a player and can add just as much emphasis on any storyline. This document has been specially assembled to help you introduce brilliant characters to your world for you and your players to enjoy without the hassle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
