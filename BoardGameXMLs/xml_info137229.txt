							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lord Doomicus and His Giant Battle Planet</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Insurgent Alliance continues to strike back at the Universal Commonwealth. As a means of total retaliation, Lord Doomicus devises the ultimate weapon to crush his enemies&amp;hellip;His Giant Battle Planet.  His Giant Battle Planet has the power to rip stars apart and crush planets; along with his elite cloned battalions of Lightning Squads, Lord Doomicus can change the shape of galaxies, both politically and physically. But mostly physically. He likes the physical stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His ability to tap into the Quiet Energy all around us to perform acts of deadly telekinesis has no equal. His military leadership has no peers, as he commands a well-trained and loyal army that the rest of the universe both fears and respects. His training and use of the ancient art of the Neon Saber is unheralded. But it is His Giant Battle Planet that will be known as the crowning achievement for Lord Doomicus&amp;hellip;once it becomes fully operational.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, to run an operation the size of His Giant Battle Planet, it requires a lot of people in the background to run it and maintain it. Nameless IT contractors who need to keep the Thruspace wireless data transfer system up and running. Dissatisfied pencil-pushers who need to get the cost overruns down by cutting a corner or two. The thankless latrine cleaners. The bored meat-drones who need to count the bolts every other day to ensure that the hull is stable.  Guys and gals who don&amp;rsquo;t really care about the military implications of what they are doing; it&amp;rsquo;s just a stupid, underpaid job to them, with cramped shared podrooms and paper-thin walls that refuse to muffle the horrid dubstar music in the podroom next door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is their story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
