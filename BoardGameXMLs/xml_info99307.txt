			<description>Signals: The Sneaky Card Game. Collect all 5 members of one family and your team wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;Instructions&lt;br/&gt;20 Family Cards&lt;br/&gt;40 Money Cards&lt;br/&gt;4 Photo Albums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets one Photo Album, and one Money Card (dealt randomly). The player with the highest value card starts the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 more Money Cards are dealt face down to each player. The remaining Money Cards are placed faced down in the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 Family Cards are dealt face down to each player. The start player places one Family Card face down on the table. Each player has one chance to buy this card, by placing one or more of their Money Cards face up on the table. The next player can make a higher offer or pass. (If a player passes, they may take one card from the top of the Money Card deck.) There are no rules about talking. You may say anything you want, but if you don't want the other team to know, be sneaky, use the signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until one player has collected all 5 members of one family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
