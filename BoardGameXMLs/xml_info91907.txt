			<description>Exzisus is a 1987 Horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game released by Taito which was only available in Japan until it was later included in a compilation of Taito arcade games Taito Legends volume 1 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows. The player controlled a giant robot that could transform into a space-ship or be accompanied by robotic animal helpers in an attempt to free four planets from a mechanical enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players controlled a giant flying robot that could walk along the surface of each level as well as crouch. The robot was equipped to fire bombs from its back and shots from its gun simultaneously. By collecting A items, the robot would transform into a ship which had the advantage of adding one extra point of health and increasing speed. However, once the player transformed into the ship, the ship could not brush against the surface of the level or it would count as a hit. Despite that, the surface would disappear during boss fights, yet the ship and its bombs could still detect it, though the ship would not be damaged by it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any mechanical animals assisting the player during robot form would converge with the robot once the A item was collected, combining their firepower. A checkpoint was active, though an on-screen map would show the player how close to the end they were. During a boss fight, the map would change to the boss' health meter. Extends were awarded with every 100,000 points. While destroying enemy waves, there was always a mid-section composed of various barriers that the player needed to avoid getting hit by such as asteroids and ice-blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A - Aerodynamic Power: Colored white and dark blue. Collecting these would transform the robot into a spaceship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D - Disruption: Colored white and green. Collecting these would widen the player's shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D - Destruction: Colored blue and purple. This would destroy any and all enemies on-screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F - Full Automatic: Colored green and yellow. Increased firing rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;L - Laser Lighting Blaster: Colored white and red. This would give the player longer, stronger shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M - Guided Missiles: Colored white and yellow. This would make the bombs sweep over the surface of the level. Collecting the power-up again would give the missiles homing capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;O: Colored White. Collecting this would call in a mechanical bird that would support cover-fire with a Laser weapon. Collecting this a second time would call a mechanized dog with a Wave weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Exzisus&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
