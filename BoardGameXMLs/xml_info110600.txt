							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asuang: Shapechanging Horrors</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A malevolent hunger stirs in the dark corners of the woods. With their inhuman forms they crawl, they fly, and they leap; inching closer toward the sound of the rolling ocean waves, toward the town and its lively chorus. You stop as you sense their otherworldly eyes watching you, their tongues longing for the taste of your entrails. You brace yourself as they step out of the darkness - and are surprised to see that they can wear a human form just like you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asuang: Shapechanging Horrors is an illustrated, 18-page product that showcases some of the iconic monsters of Philippine folklore. It tackles the different stories common folk tell regarding these creatures, as well as storytelling themes that a gamemaster can use to integrate these creatures into any campaign. Intended for the 4th Edition of the Dungeons and Dragons game, this product presents eight new monsters ranging from levels 4 to 18 - all in a new, updated statblock format. Some of these monsters include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The tianak: Undead creatures created from unborn children infused with an asuang's blood.&lt;br/&gt;     The sigbin: Shadowborn asuangs that can assume the form of misshapen black hounds.&lt;br/&gt;     The manananggal: Malevolent spellcasters who sprout wings and segment their torsos to fly off into the night to hunt prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product also contains a GM toolkit with asuang encounters, as well as thematic storytelling and game elements that a gamemaster can add to existing monsters to provide an &amp;quot;asuang feel.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
