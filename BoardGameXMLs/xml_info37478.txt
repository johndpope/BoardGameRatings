			<description>It's time for some Halloween mischief.  The parents pick the tricks and everyone tries to accumulate the treats.  Who will be able to get the most candy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck contains 90 number cards in 6 suits and 16 trick cards.  The number cards are dealt out to the players.  Players take turns choosing the &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; -- rules for different types of card tricks.  Rules include the One-Shot (everyone plays a card simultaneously and the highest card gets points), the Center (everyone plays a card simultaneously and everything except the high and low cards gets points), and the Single Color (players play cards once around following suit if possible with the highest card in the led suit getting points).  Play continues until all cards have been played.  Whoever accumulates the most points wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
