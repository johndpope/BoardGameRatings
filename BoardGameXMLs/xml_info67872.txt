			<description>INSECTO is like first board games for children.  It is the great insect race with this 2-sided magnetized board game with plush insects and useful carrying case.  It initiates youngsters to board games and develops concentration and dexterity.&lt;br/&gt;Insecto is an ideal travel game with 2 interesting ways to play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BUZZY BUZZY BEEZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bees go from flower to flower all day long in search of the precious nectar.  At the end of the day, it is a race to return to the nest.  Which bee will be the first to enter the nest?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player advances his bee the number of flowers indicated by the number on the die.  Every time a bee stops on a flower where the tail end of a caterpillar is found, this bee must slide down to the flower where the head of the caterpillar is found. Every time a bee stops on a flower where a butterfly is found, this bee must follow the butterflies to the other flower.  But take care to the spider webs or your bee will skip a turn!  The first bee to enter the nest wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VEGGIE LAND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ladybugs are very useful in a vegetable garden as they feed on harmful insects.  VEGGIE LAND is a simple game that is captivating, yet easy to play for kids 3 years of age and up.  It does not require any reading or counting skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On his turn, each player rolls the die and moves forward to the next vegetable illustrated on the die.  On certain vegetables, there is a spider!  If a player stops on a vegetable with a spider, he must skip a turn.  But if a player stops on a vegetable with a ladybug, he plays again!  Then, a few vegetables come in pair.  If a player stops on pair of vegetables, he moves forward to the next single similar vegetable.  The first ladybug (player) to reach the vegetable cart wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
