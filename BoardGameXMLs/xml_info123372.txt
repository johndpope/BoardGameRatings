			<description>Imperial Crusade Freedom is a tactical space combat game that uses plastic cards made of the same material as credit cards to represent each ship on the tabletop.  These cards have ship stats printed on them so that everything that happens during a battle can be tracked directly on the card with a dry erase pen.  These cards are moved around the table like a miniature and everything is recorded directly on them.  Battles between a few ships can be played in a couple of minutes or massive fleet battles can be played in about an hour.  &lt;br/&gt; This is an expansion to Imperial Crusade Armada that adds two more factions to the Imperial Crusade universe.  It is also a stand alone game that does not require Imperial Crusade Armada to play.  The Freetrade Coalition uses drone fighters and mines to destroy their enemies.  The Outland Alliance uses powerful gunships to assault enemy ships and their force manipulators to disrupt their opponent's plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
