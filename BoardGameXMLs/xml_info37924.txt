							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Face to Face Paddington</name>
									
			<description>Contents: 36 hexagonal tiles, each with 6 triangles showing pictures of Paddington in different colours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you start, choose one of the figures shown on the side of the box. This should be used as model. All cards are divided amongst the players. The youngest player starts by laying one card face-up on the table. The player on his left-hand side then takes one of his cards and puts this next to the &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; card, in such a way that the previously chosen figure can be made. The cards have to be laid out face to face. When a player is unable to lay a card on the table, he has to skip a turn. The first player to lose all his cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
