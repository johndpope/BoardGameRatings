							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Primordium Wars</name>
									
			<description>In the year 2661, humanity makes contact with a dying alien race, the Mirrugennin, whose survival depends upon a constant influx of a rare substance known as primordium, found only in a remote section of an asteroid field close to the Mirrugennin's home world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the feeble Mirrugennin are incapable of acquiring the primordium for themselves, because they would never survive the inevitable encounters with the monstrous Raptezoids and their horrific mother, the Hive Queen, with which the primordium rich asteroids are infested. And so various human factions agree, for a handsome fee, to mine the Primordium for the Mirrugennin, and to battle, and when possible, gather specimens of the Raptezoids for the Mirrugennin to study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not long before the lust for wealth sends these mining factions into conflict with one another, as they each seek to claim more and more asteroids for themselves. Ordinary space miners, most often equipped with nothing more than their trusty pick-axes, have to quickly figure out how to become soldiers as they are sent headlong into bloody battle against the armies of other mining factions. These conflicts become known as the Primoridum Wars, and rage for several years before the Mirrugennin suddenly and mysteriously disappear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will play the leader of one these human factions. You will expand your primordium mining operations throughout the asteroid field, fight the terrible Raptezoids, and wage war against your opponents. At the end of five rounds, the player with the most wealth wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Primordium Wars is a quasi tile placement and resource gathering game where players place tiles representing various buildings onto their asteroids in order to increase their primordium mining operations. It is also a game in which combat plays a significant, though secondary role, where players attack each other in order to claim more resource producing asteroids, or to disrupt their opponents operations. The game takes place on a modular board where, in each round, players slowly shift the asteroids around on the game board. Because of this, very interesting things can take place, such as: A path is suddenly created leading straight to an opponent's once well protected mining hub, or two players suddenly find that their starships are now in the same sector where a massive space battle is imminent, or an opponent's dangerous class A starship is now cut off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round, players will first acquire, in a bidding phase, tiles that represent the items needed to expand their mining empires such as various asteroid modules to be built on the asteroids (mining facilities, orbital turrets, pulse cannons, science laboratories, etc), various starship upgrades (warp drives, sniping lasers, stealth devices, etc), miner and mercenary reinforcements, build points for building new starships, and grav technology for tethering asteroids together into clusters (a core mechanism that greatly increases mining production, and expands the functionality of most modules built on the asteroids).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will then deploy their newly acquired items onto their asteroids and starships, take turns moving their pieces deeper into the asteroid field in order to expand their mining empire, fight Raptezoids and the dreaded Hive Queen, and battle other players through a diceless blind/bluff mechanism in which players that are in conflict secretly and simultaneously make, and then reveal, their battle plans. (This allows for thrilling Operation Bodyguard/Overlord type strategies where you make an opponent think you are attacking HERE, drawing out his forces, but then you really attack HERE, where he is vulnerable.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other core mechanisms: The configurations of players' starships are customizable, and kept hidden from opponents, and the more mining facilities built on any particular asteroid, the greater the chance Raptezoids will appear on that asteroid, and hence the greater the chance that they will summon their queen. This is accomplished by die rolls during the &amp;quot;Raptezoid Phase&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round players will collect their income from their mining operations and Raptezoid research, and a new round will begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
