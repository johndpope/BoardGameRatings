			<description>&amp;quot;Are you joking?&amp;quot; is an educational game for English learners. It consists of two type of cards. One type has tongue twisters, jokes, quotes and such; the other type contains words (in English and German). One player reads one card of the first type, then counts from 10 to 0. The other players check whether they hold word cards with words that are included in the text. If so, they can discard them in front of themselves and draw new cards. Players who manage not to laugh during the countdown get an extra card; if everyone laughs, the reader gets it. &lt;br/&gt;After a certain number of rounds, the player with most points on his/her cards is the winner. &lt;br/&gt;There are some advanced rules included, for example demanding a certain reading style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
