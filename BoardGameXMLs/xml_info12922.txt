The player with the most money after everyone has obtained and erected all eighteen elements of a complete lot is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with three unique dice: The Contract Die (used to purchase a lot, which is needed to start, get permits and insurance), The Material Die (used to get the eighteen elements of a complete set) and The Building Die (to determine how many elements can built or eliminated from the player's lot).
