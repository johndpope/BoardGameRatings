			<description>Six cards are on the table. Players place bets on any of those (no tokens included for some reason) and roll three dice. The dice show on of the cards on each of their sides. If the cards you bet on are rolled, you get double your money back (one die), triple (two dice) or quadruple (all three dice). No goal is set, players just play as long as they want.&lt;br/&gt;Was one of six little games in Piatnik's Texas Series in 1989.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
