			<description>&amp;quot;Experience the adventure and romance of Isle Royale National Park...yesterday and today!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game provides players the opportunity to explore the geography and history of IRNP as a boardgame.  It's a standard roll-and-move format, on a large 14x40 inch roll-up board.  All players start at one end of the island.  Four dice (provided) are rolled, and players use the value on a single die or pairs of dice to see if they can equal the mileage to proceed to the next location.  Water routes are sometimes available, and you can use those if you roll trips or a four-straight in three rolls, Yahtzee-fashion.  There are penalties for being landed on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The locations are campgrounds, scenic sights, fire lookouts, etc., with each type worth so many points to the player landing there or passing by.  Points are tallied on a provided pad with a provided pencil.  Some sights allowed the drawing of a Fortune Card, which can add or subtract additional points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board is very attractive and informative, and the four pawns with the game are solid copper lathe-turned figures.  I imagine the game-play might be just a notch above the average roll-and-move, due to the complexity of the path network, the varying values of the stops, and the &amp;quot;Can't Stop&amp;quot;-ish dice selection mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
