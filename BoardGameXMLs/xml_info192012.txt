							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume XIX</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume XIX, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 19 mythic spells, from sleet storm to stonetell. A mythic snare can be placed in any location, and tightens on the victim with each attempt to escape. A mythic soul bind doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an expensive material focus, and can even be used to destroy the target&amp;rsquo;s soul outright, while a mythic spectral hand can be used to wield weapons, manipulate objects, or make touch attacks to drain a foe&amp;rsquo;s life force directly, and mythic spell immunity can protect against entire schools of magic, or, with the greater version, even protect against all magic of a certain type (arcane, divine, or psychic). This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
