			<description>High/Low Farms is on the surface a trick taking game, but it's heart is in a classic Euro-style economy game. Over three rounds, players take tricks with cards that have duo values. Depending on the round, they will try to be the highest or lowest in value and then choose how to use the card they win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may choose three ways to use the card they win by either choosing to use it as a farm, turn the card in for a resource to put on their farm, or turn the card in for money. After each round, players may trade between themselves for the goods they need or with the farmers market to make the best use of their goods for points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
