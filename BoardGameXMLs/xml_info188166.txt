			<description>A World Building Supplement of Traps and their Master Builders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traps are wonderful, diabolical machinations (and there are certainly traps in this book) but by themselves these tricky mechanisms don't have the layer of world building that we were looking for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We kept asking ourselves: &amp;quot;What can we could do to bring these traps to life in our world?&amp;quot;, and finally, the thought clicked that what we needed to do was explore &amp;quot;who brought these traps to life in our world?&amp;quot; And that's exactly what this supplement focuses on. Yes we'll show you some traps &amp;mdash; but not just traps alone &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll also meet the people who made them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Trapsmiths of Dragongrin, a dossier of four distinct trap makers - each with a signature trap of their own custom design. Not only will we describe the trap at length for use in your game, but also give you an insight on who built it and why. We had quite a lot of fun creating it, and we hope you enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
