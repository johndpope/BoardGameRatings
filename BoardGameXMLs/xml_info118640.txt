							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Zone (1994)</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Zone is a game where you pilot an attack helicopter in an effort to thwart the global dominance ambitions of a bloodthirsty dictator who is armed with nukes.  Since the dictator has threatened to nuke all who oppose his rule, it is necessary to send in special forces to take him down in a way which won't attract attention.  The game plays very similarly to Desert Strike.  In broad strokes, the introduction and storyline adheres closely to the history of Adolf Hitler's rise to dominance in Europe due to gradual expansion and the use of appeasement to try to contain him, except that this dictator is in Asia and has nuclear weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is not to be confused with Red Zone on Amiga and MSX, which is an entirely different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
