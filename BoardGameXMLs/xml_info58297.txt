			<description>(Translated from the book introduction)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is always a first time at the life of an RPG player where he is considered a newbie. This is always pointed by the inexperience on the first sessions of a new RPG. Many players, even the experienced on other systems have some difficulty absorbing so many new rules for game use, and becomes stunned with the many options at character creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This books was created thinking about those situations. Dedicated to the new comers of the fascinating Tagmar world, that do not want (or don't wish) to lsoe a lot of time learning the character creation rules... a book to help you learn first to play, and latter to create new characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has 24 Arcehtypes encompassing the 6 races and and the 6 basic professions, for both sexes. It is an excelent choice not only to learn the game, but latter on as the archetypes were created following the normal rules. With a good range of choices, the archetypes allow you to evolve them naturally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the fascinating world of Tagmar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
