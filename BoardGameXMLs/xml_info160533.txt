			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beau-Jolly made their name in the music business by selling compilations. In the mid 1980s they were looking to do the same thing with video games. One of the companies they approached was Imagine. After their spectacular and public collapse, Beau-Jolly ended up owning Imagine's back-catalogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Value Pack compilations released by Beau-Jolly contained mostly Imagine games. Some were duplicated across different platforms, but no two compilations were the same, though they shared the same artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 16K ZX Spectrum version consisted of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcadia - A Gorf / Galaxians style shoot 'em up.&lt;br/&gt;Ah Diddums - A teddy bear needs to escape from a toy box to comfort his crying baby owner&lt;br/&gt;Molar Maul - The player is controlling a toothbrush fighting against bacteria in a mouth.&lt;br/&gt;Jumping Jack - A platform game where the player has to guide Jack to the top of the screen by jumping through holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
