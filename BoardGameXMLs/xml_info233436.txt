							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Yet Another Nameless Dungeon</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think it says a lot about a dungeon when you don't even bother to name the thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You see, when you give a dungeon a nifty name, like &amp;quot;Undercrypts of the God-whore,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Deepest Deeps of the Lord of the Deep,&amp;quot; you're already at the very least implying that there's a story of which the dungeon is a larger part. This may not even be true, but the implication is there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, when the dungeon has no name, you're declaring: I have no preconceptions about this dungeon and how it will fit into my campaign. There's no over-arching storyline here, no Big Bad that somehow fits into the campaign in a meaningful way, no artifact specifically intended to end up in the players' greasy little hands. No, a nameless dungeon generally says one thing, and one thing only: this place is full of monsters, and its sole purpose for existing is for you (the players) to pillage and loot the place - or die trying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And there is - in my opinion - absolutely nothing wrong with that sort of declaration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
