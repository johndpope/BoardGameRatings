			<description>Premier Manager 2 (also known as PM2) is a football management simulator video game for the Commodore Amiga and DOS platforms. It was released in 1993 by Gremlin Interactive. The objective of the game is to manage a football club successfully within the top five divisions in the English league system. It is preceded by Premier Manager, and followed by Premier Manager 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Premier Manager 2 follows on from Premier Manager and uses the same situation for the game. The user gets to choose one of the Conference League teams to join as manager. They then must manage the team's players and tactics to win matches. The team can play in both the league and cup competitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the conference league the teams automatically qualify for the FA Cup first round, unlike in reality where non-league teams must go through qualifying rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as managing the team, the user must also manage the club's finances, such as bank loans and advertising boards. Money can be raised by selling players, adding sponsors and ticket sales (as well as some miscellaneous events). To improve ticket sales the user can invest in upgrading various aspects of the stadium such as seating and facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for one or two players which can choose their team at the beginning of the game. The two users must then take turns in accessing the computer game to manage their teams. During player transfers, both users are requested to make a bid. Users can change the team they manage by applying for positions when they become available during the season, or accept job offers at the end of the season once their contract expires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Premier Manager 2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
