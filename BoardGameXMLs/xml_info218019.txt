							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Curse of Partelisa</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Curse of Partelisa is an adventure designed for use with the fifth edition of the world&amp;rsquo;s first fantasy role-playing game. It is intended for four to six characters of third level and can be completed in a single gaming session. Depending on the number of characters and the challenges met, the characters should gain a level at the end of this adventure. As this is a classic dungeon-crawl, a variety of character classes is strongly recommended to handle the magic, combat, and dungeoneering that will be necessary to successfully survive the dungeon and lift the curse. The adventure is set in the extreme southern tip of the continent, a place where rugged and rocky deserts bake between the boundaries of the tropical ocean on either side. The land here is stark, yet possessed of an abundance of life if you know where to look; and the beauty is equal to any mountain or forest the players have seen, with great stone monuments and&lt;br/&gt;high plateaus giving way to valleys of copper-colored stone and bright green cacti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
