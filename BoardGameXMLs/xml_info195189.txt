			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are defined by a variety of Traits that are vaguely like Attributes but often much broader in scope.  Also, the values associated with Traits vary through play.  Some Traits are individual scores but others are shared &amp;quot;pool&amp;quot; Traits for all characters.  Likewise, the game uses two shared dice pools during play.  The game presents a detailed and intriguing setting with several complex elements.  The game also is notable for being one of the lengthier submissions to the online competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
