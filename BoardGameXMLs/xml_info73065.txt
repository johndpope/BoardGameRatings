			<description>Main Street in your town has just been incorporated into Route 66, the US highway system that links Chicago to Los Angeles. Can you manage to snag a piece of the tourist business pie? Will you build a motel or a cafe? How about a mini-golf and can you make money from your neighbor's giant ball of twine? Some of your family may work for free, but you will have to pay a higher wage to get the people in town to leave your competition and work for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erecting neon signs and billboards, expanding current businesses, and annexing land to increase the size of the town (can we actually incorporate that huge canyon over there?) are all viable ways to make the most money before the interstate system opens and all the traffic bypasses the towns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
