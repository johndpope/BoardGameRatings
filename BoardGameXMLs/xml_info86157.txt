			<description>Technopoly is a promotional game produced to celebrate the 50 year anniversary of Ineel Institute. It is almost an exact copy of Monopoly with the following exceptions: There are fewer spaces, there are only Chance Cards (no Community Chest) and the Free Parking House Rule (in which players take all the money from the center of the board when landing on Free Parking) is an official rule in this version (called &amp;quot;The Jackpot&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players move around the board they have the opportunity to purchase the deeds for places named after technological facilities of the Ineel Institute, such as &amp;quot;Fluorinel Dissolution and Fuel Storage Facility&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Stored Waste Examination Pilot Plant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Experimental Breeder Reactor-II&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Spent Fuel Storage Cask.&amp;quot; The Chance cards also feature text related to Ineel including, &amp;quot;Pay Duty on International Waste Shipment Thru RWMC - pay $100&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Conduct a Seminar on WFC - Collect $25 fee.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules allow the game to end either at a set time or until only one player remains in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
