							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Word Wizard</name>
									
			<description>Word Wizard is played with a deck of cards containing words and six special dice depicting objects.  Each die is unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word cards are arranged face down on the playing surface.  The active player selects a die and rolls it.  Next, a card is chosen.  If the player can create a compound word containing both the word on the card and the object showing on the die, the card is removed from play and the placed in front of the player.  Otherwise, the card is returned face down in its original position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who collects the most word cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is included in Mensa Brain Games.  Included in the box is a book of over 100 brain teasers, plus rules and components for a number of board, dice and word games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
