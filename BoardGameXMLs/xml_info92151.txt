			<description>Wargame is a strategy game for 2 players.  Playing time is roughly 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 13 cards ranked from 13 (Bazooka) down to 1 (Spy).  Cards of a higher rank typically take cards of a lower rank, though there are some exceptions (Spies, for example, take both the Bazooka and the Mortar, while Shooters can sometimes be &amp;quot;turned&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player first deploys his cards by placing them, 1 and 2 at a time, into the 13 spaces on his line.  Once all cards have been deployed, players take turns advancing their cards into the combat zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the game interesting is the ability for players to switch two cards before advancing one into battle.  Each player can do this exactly 5 times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to win 7 of the 13 battles in the combat zone, or win 4 adjacent battles.  The winner will almost always be the player who most skillfully utilizes his troops, as there is very little luck involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
