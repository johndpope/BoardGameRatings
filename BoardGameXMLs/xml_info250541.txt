			<description>Karate-chop your way through addition and subtraction to become a maths master!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting Started:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Player chooses a bingo card.  Place the cards on a flat surface, with the sides with blue(for addition) or red(for subtraction) origami stars facing up.&lt;br/&gt;Put the spinner and bingo chips in a central location where all players can reach them.&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets on bingo chip to mark the &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; space in the middle of his or her bingo card.&lt;br/&gt;Players may use scratch paper and a pencil to take notes during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game:&lt;br/&gt;The youngest player goes first.&lt;br/&gt;For addition, on your turn, spin the spinner twice and add the two numbers together.  when you know the sum of the two numbers, see if it's on your bingo card.  If so, cover it with a bingo chip.&lt;br/&gt;For subtraction, on your turn, spin the spinner and determine if the the number it lands on is the answer to any of the subtraction problems on your bingo card.  If so, cover it with a bingo chip.&lt;br/&gt;Game play moves to the left and continues until a player has three bingo chips in a row.  If you have three in a row, yell out &amp;quot;Ninja Math!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;For an additional challenge, try playing until someone has filled all of the squares on their bingo card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
