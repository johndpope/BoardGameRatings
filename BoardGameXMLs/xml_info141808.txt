							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Oregon Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Play The Oregon Game and, if you know more Oregon facts, history and simple trivia than your opponent, you win.  The Oregon Game will test the skill of the staunchest native Webfoot and yet the multiple-choice questions offer an entertaining way for children and newcomers to learn more about Oregon.&amp;quot; (Taken from the rules)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active player reads aloud the question and four possible answers.  He then silently guesses the answer, checks the back of the card and if correct, moves his peg forward.  If incorrect, the other player then gets a chance to guess and move (if correct).  Players take turns as the active player until one has reached the end of the scoring track for the win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
