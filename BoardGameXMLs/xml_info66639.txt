			<description>The game consists of a &amp;quot;board&amp;quot;, which is in fact a string with knots and ant pieces tied to it. At its end, there is a wooden cup under which a prize can be hidden. Also, there is a wooden anteater with a leather tongue plus several playing pieces in simple anteater shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game rules are very simple: One player closes his/her eyes. One other player takes the anteater and tickles the blindfolded player with the anteater's tongue. If the tickled player guesses who tickled him/her, he/she gets to move forward three ants. If not, the tickling player moves forward one ant. The first player to reach the cup is the winner and gets the award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
