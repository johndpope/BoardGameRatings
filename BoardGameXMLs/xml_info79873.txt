							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Swarms, Stampedes, and Skirmishes</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swarms, Stampedes and Skirmishes looks at groups of creatures acting as one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a few new swarms, swarm powers are described: quasi-magical effects that multiple swarms working together can achieve. The aquatic swarm, or school, is demonstrated with the piranha. Stampedes are larger creatures hell-bent on running, trampling everything in the path beneath them. Skirmishes are mobs of creatures involved in a melee where it is generally every man for himself. Handling a barroom brawl has never been easier. After a few spells, an Epic Swarm is described. What's more fun than a single DemiLich? A swarm of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
