			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Pathfinder/3.5 Compatible Adventure for 4 PCs of levels 5-7&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs are hired by the Black Gold Consortium to track down passengers of the Wasp, a ship which has wrecked somewhere in the Vast Swamp. One passenger in particular interests the consortium more than any other: a woman named Sandalia. Sandalia is known by every citizen of Cherrian&amp;rsquo;s Rest as the most beautiful woman in the city, she was recently hired to train as a diplomat for the powerful Black Gold Consortium. Now Sandalia has gone missing and the consortium wants her back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What starts out as a simple rescue mission suddenly takes a turn for the worst when a love struck wild thing leads the PCs on an all out chase through the swamp. The would-be rescuers travel through haunted bogs and fields of fire to a final confrontation which may just be the oddest conclusion anyone has ever experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included in &amp;quot;Wild Thing&amp;quot;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Choice of 3 vessels with special swamp navigation rules&lt;br/&gt;     New swamp bugs and diseases&lt;br/&gt;     Environmental/Meteorlogical/Bestial Randomization chart for swamp travel&lt;br/&gt;     1 new Monster: the Bog Troll!&lt;br/&gt;     2 new Magical Items!&lt;br/&gt;     7 new Traps!&lt;br/&gt;     A new city: Cherrian's Rest and the powerful Black Gold Consortium which runs the region with financial influence&lt;br/&gt;     Multiple ways to complete the primary quest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
