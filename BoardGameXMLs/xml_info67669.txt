							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: The Sinister Vault</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great doors open smoothly outward to reveal a ten foot wide limestone tunnel leading deep into an expansive vault with a ceiling stretching over 25 ft. above the floor. Obscene glowing skulls light the vault chamber ahead of you from steel hooks mounted on the walls. They stare covetously down at the treasure and objects d&amp;rsquo;art strewn across the floor and around the four limestone pillars. There was a soft rumbling of voices and clinking of coins from the vault when the door was first breached, but the room is now strangely silent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover The Sinister Vault!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 34, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
