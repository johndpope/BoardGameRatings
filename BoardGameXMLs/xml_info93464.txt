			<description>Object: To follow the animal tracks and capture the wild animal before the other players can reach it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before Playing: One player lays out the trail by placing footprint cards and the round stop/go cards at spaced intervals to form a trail that will eventually lead to the Big Game (the wild animal card). The trail can be set up inside or outside and even have trails that branch off with ones leading to dead ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To Play: The person who spun and drew the lowest number gun goes first. They spin the spinner and move their gun the number of spaces as indicated along the animal tracks. When a hunter reaches a stop or go card they follow what is printed on the card. The first hunter to follow the correct path and find an animal card gets to keep it and lay out a new trail with another animal (or use the same trail if desired)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
