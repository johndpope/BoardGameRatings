							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Synthicide Full Rules Draft</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is set in a Galaxy on the verge of collapse, where bullets are more common than food and equally essential for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An evil mutant force called the Prodigravus attempted to absorb all of humanity. A millennium-long war ensued, destroying almost every civilized planet. Humanity descended into a dark age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tech cult called the Tharnaxist Church retained scraps of scientific knowledge. They used it to gain power over the surviving humans and mutants, but these cybernetic priests aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in the lives of organics. They only care about discovering more technology and building synthetic beings to run their society. Under Tharnaxist rule, the murdering of a robot &amp;ndash; also known as Synthicide &amp;ndash; is regarded as the highest crime on any planet. If one commits Synthicide and is caught, they earn the ire of the Church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With human life devalued, remaining social structures have descended into barbarism, extortion, and gang-rule. Anyone with the means has become a Sharper: an independent agent that drifts from world to world, scraping by on dirty work. For a Sharper, floating through space is preferable to settling down on any Tharnaxist-ruled hellhole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Synthicide Full Draft Rules were published September 28, 2015, to kick off the major public playtest phase of development.&lt;br/&gt;The first major revision was published February 2, 2016, adding artifacts and some rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
