			<description>Your rich uncle just gave you some investments.  Can you make some smart moves and turn them into a fortune?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stock Trader is a simple and fun stock market game that you can play solo or with the whole family.  Do you have what it takes to be a smart investor on the stock exchange?  Find out with Stock Trader, The Stock Market Board Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to become the richest player by buying and selling stocks and gold.  Buy low, and sell high!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main board tracks the value of each investment.  The value of each investment is increased or decreased by rolling dice each turn, if the positive die (green) is higher than the negative die (red), the value moves up that many spaces.  If the red die is greater than the green die, the value drops and could even crash that stock completely!  Each turn there is a new 'Headline News' card that can affect the stock values in addition to the dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the dice are rolled and the values set, each player decides what they would like to buy and sell and tracks their shares on their own 'Portfolio' card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 10-turns, everyone sells their investments and the player with the most money wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
