							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Winter Woods (Pathfinder)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Winter Woods are situated in the northern climes where the snow falls from late Autumn to early Spring. The map can be roughly divided into fi ve geographical regions. The extreme west is a land of thickly wooded canyons, mesas and buttes divided by rushing streams that fl ow into the Great River, visible in the southwest corner of the map. The north central portion of the map is a rolling prairie of tall grasses, wildfl owers, leaping gazelles, browsing wisent and mammoth and prowling smilodons. The prairie and canyon lands are bordered on the east by a land of forested hills, gentle compared to the western lands, and very fertile. The extreme east of the map contains what the native folk call the &amp;ldquo;Black Water&amp;rdquo;, a vast sea of viscous, black water that gives off an acrid smell and is said to harbor things better left unseen. The shores of the Black Water are a moor of black, spongy ground and perverse fungal growths, some growing as tall as trees. The natives of the Winter Woods believe they know what lies beyond the Black Water, but are hesitant ever to speak of it lest &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; prick up their ears and take an interest in the teller of tales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
