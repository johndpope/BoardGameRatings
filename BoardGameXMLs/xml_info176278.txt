			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sega Action Chair is an extremely rare peripheral built for the Sega Mega Drive. It essentially combines the features of a Sega Mega Drive controller with a movable chair. The d-pad movements are mapped to the chair itself, so if the user leans left the on-screen character will move left too. As it uses a DE-9 port it is also compatible with Sega Master System games. They have been know to sell for $500.00.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
