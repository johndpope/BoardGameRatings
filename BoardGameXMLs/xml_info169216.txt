			<description>from the back cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three generations of hard graft the starship that your grandfather, your father, and yourself  have all grafted for, is in peril. If you don't make the next payment, you'll lose your livelihood, your home, your ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There isn't anything that's going to stop you getting the money you need. With aliens, pirates, robots, criminals, the military and even the police against you, the odds aren't in your favour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the time when the real inter-planetary trader come into his own. Warm up the engines, bring the guns online, snap up the cargo, it's time to make some cred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traders Vengeance  is a game-book where you play the hero and choose the path to take. You decide which enemies to fight and which shipments to make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
