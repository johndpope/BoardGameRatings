			<description>Pirates in Pocket is a fan-made PNP card games for free. Up to four players can compete for the King of Pirates on high seas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player may send his/her ship to plunder ports &amp;amp; merchant ships, or attack other player's hideout. You may also send the captain or first mate to ports to do some secret missions like recruiting crews, gambling, collecting rumors &amp;amp; treasure hunting...No one knows what you have sent (ship or crew?)to each place until they are revealed. So it's critical to guess where your opponent's ship is going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are events in different places each turn. You may collect rumors in taverns to get hints about the coming events but not all rumors are correct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may use loots to hire more crews, bid parts to upgrade your ship, bribe guards, gamble, or even buy fames. Beware, as your fame go higher &amp;amp; higher, there is a big chance that you will be hunted by the Royal Navy or challenged by the notorous Ghost Pirate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three kinds of combats in this game : Ship to ship combat, melee combat &amp;amp; duels between captains. Each captain has his/her own special ability which may get bonus in certain combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
