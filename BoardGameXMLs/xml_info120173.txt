Securing the central group can be achieved by Majority or Totality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If aiming for a &amp;lsquo;Majority&amp;rsquo;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    With two players you must occupy 5 of the 6 hexes in the central group.&lt;br/&gt;    With three players you must occupy 4 of them.&lt;br/&gt;    With four player you must occupy 3 of them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If aiming for &amp;lsquo;Totality&amp;rsquo;:&lt;br/&gt;You must occupy at least one hex of the central group with the rest being completely empty of opposing pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win by either of the above methods the player must place&lt;br/&gt;one of his towers in the central hex, which takes &amp;lsquo;a turn&amp;rsquo;. Victory can also be achieved by capturing all of the opposing towers thereby leaving you opponent without a tower to place in the central blank hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
