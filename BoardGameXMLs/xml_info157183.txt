			<description>Echo of the Wilds is a puzzly narrativy adventure, featuring randomised wilderness survival.&lt;br/&gt;Finding yourself in mysterious forests you must unfurl a spiritual tale of solace before the unending winter consumes all. There a spirit guide will help you learn the skills of survival and the secrets of the wilds: why you awakened there, their purpose, and how to finally be free from its clutches and malevolent apparitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay focuses on exploration and survival of the randomised wilds. Gathering resources to build gear and sustain yourself, learning new skills and the intertwining interactions between the various areas, seasons, and weather. The game includes 22 areas to discover and 157 items, including food, resources, tools, clothes, gear and furniture. There's also an 'Endless' game mode which removes all narrative to focus on simply surviving through the ever fiercer ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
