			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AdventureLand is a small, 4 pages RPG I wrote in a hurry (about 6 hours) for advanced role-players. It was originally titled &amp;quot;Cliches &amp;amp; Unicorns&amp;quot; but I found that, hmh, too cliched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AL harks back to the simpler days of yore and as such it is limited in scope, easy to understand, flawed in many ways, probably incomplete, and, hopefully, fun. The moniker &amp;ldquo;for advanced role-players&amp;rdquo; is just a flimsy excuse to not explain basic role-playing concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AdventureLand has a sweet, if minimalistic setting and a funny cosmology. There is probably more in it but I did not take the time to develop the concepts further. Maybe I will later. Just note that AdventureLand&amp;rsquo;s Universe is not cruel, just terribly overworked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
