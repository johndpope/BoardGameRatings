			<description>EXPLORE THE WORLD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the beauty of a world where nature has reclaimed its place from mankind. As a wolf with the power to control other animals and a determined companion on your side you'll discover ruins of old cultures and remains of long forgotten civilizations that tell you a story of hope, loss, ambition and failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Switch perspectives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your main character will be the wolf. Majestic, fast and agile he is perfect to run through the woods, travel the world and hunt down all the other animals he encounters. These other animals can be possessed anytime the wolf encounters them along his journey and their special abilities are vital in some situations. Fly through the tops of the tree with a parrot, dive into the depths as a fish or dig your way to otherwise inaccessible areas as a mole - your ways of getting around are numerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
