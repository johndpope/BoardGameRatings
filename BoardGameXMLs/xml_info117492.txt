							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The A.Typical RPG</name>
									
			<description>The A.Typical RPG is a quirky game that seeks to put you in the role of a college student having the weirdest week of his life as he shapes his destiny, while trying to keep a social life and decent grades. Play football, cheat on exams, use raw emotions to sway people&amp;rsquo;s opinions, brawl with bullies, rebel against teachers and much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can our hero save the world? Can he pass the exams coming up next week? Is the world in any danger at all? Can he face the girl of his nightmares? We answer this and many other questions while making an exam feel like an epic battle. Beat that, Call of Duty! Get ready for an experience that is &amp;ndash; well, atypical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
