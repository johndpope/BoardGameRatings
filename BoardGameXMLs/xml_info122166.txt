							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spin-Golf</name>
									
			<description>An early C20th golf board game, made in England. The game has 5 cast metal teetotum spinning tops which represent 5 different golf clubs and which are spun to obtain the result of each stroke. Naturally the idea of the game is to complete the 9-hole course in as few shots as possible. The golf course (complete with clubhouse, tees, fairways, bunkers and greens) is represented on the board and there are small numbered metal playing pieces (4) to chart the progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
