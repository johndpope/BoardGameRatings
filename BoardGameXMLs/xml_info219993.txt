							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Of Drow Origin</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matron Mother has learned that something of drow origin has been located in a human settlement and sends her trusted daughters to deal with the matter. When they arrive they find themselves interrupting a wedding reception. What secrets will be discovered and which will remain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This story based module favors roleplay and is good for beginners and experienced players alike. Characters built to fit the scenario are included and is written for 4-9 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Kickstarter page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of Drow Origin is a tale of intrigue and shifting loyalty. This one-shot module has a very high replay value, caters to new players and veterans, and features unique game play scenarios which ultimately resolve through PVP interaction (combat and non-combat).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contains a full package of goodies certain to appeal to all types of gamers, including a beautifully illustrated book chock full of unique content and extras that make this a grab-and-go solution for DMs that want to run a game for friends,  a party, or convention. As written this game is intended for NINE players but scales well down to as few as four or five.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story is written with an emphasis on roleplay. Character levels range from two to eleven making choosing allies an all-important task. Each of the nine main characters has a short background that provides just enough ambiguity to allow players to insert themselves into the heads of their character while still making decisions that make each play-through different. By focusing on the roleplay, this game has wide appeal to all levels of experience, while still keeping the power-gamers second guessing every choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
