			<description>Ancient Egyptians hid treasures in their pyramids, and protected them with dangerous traps. Each player picks a pair of colors, and either gains or loses coins based on where those researchers land. Support your team colors and delay the others to win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other games, you do not play a single color in Pairamid.  Each player always plays in two colors, and these are indicated by Pyramid Markers placed in front of each player.  You might share Pyramid colors with another player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player rolls all the dice, and selects one die to place on the board -- the die does not need to match your own color!  The player places the die on the matching square on the board, then moves the matching researcher the number of spaces indicated on the die.  The player then passes the remaining dice to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When moving a researcher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Spaces occupied by another researcher are jumped over and are not counted.&lt;br/&gt;- If the researcher reaches a space with either the White Scarab or Black Scarab, they stop on that space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The White Scarab will always be in a white chamber, which will have a positive score listed on the board.  When a researcher is moved to a space with the White Scarab, all players with a Pyramid Marker matching the color of the researcher receive the number of Treasure Tokens indicated on the board.  Similarly, the Black Scarab will always be in a black chamber, and all players with a Pyramid Marker matching a researcher in a chamber with the Black Scarab will lose the number of Treasure Tokens indicated on the board.  In both cases, this causes the Scarab to be moved to the next chamber matching its color (from +1 to +2 to +3 and so on for the White Scarab, and from -1 to -2 to -3 and so on for the Black Scarab).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Chamber may be used as a shortcut by one researcher at a time.  It is also the final room for both Scarabs, counting as +7 as well as -7.  When a researcher enters the Great Chamber after a Scarab has been placed there, that color is scored as normal (+7 or -7 for the matching color), and the game ends.  The player with the most Treasure Tokens wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Working in Teams, Planning Ahead, Evaluating Options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
