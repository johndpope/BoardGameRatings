			<description>Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt; Summary  &lt;br/&gt;In this game you have control of 8 men who you move around the map to either defend your own flag or to sneak into the enemy's territory to find and capture their flag to win the game. Each man has his own strengths and weaknesses in the different abilities of speed, vision and stealth so some are better suited to defence and some to attack. It's an exciting race against time as you explore your opponent's half of the map and avoid being seen and captured by his defenders while you know he's quietly searching your half too...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes complete with a built-in map designer to create your own maps which can then be shared with other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
