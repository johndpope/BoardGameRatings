			<description>From the back of the package:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Something's amiss at the bakery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conveyors are spinning out of control! A torrent of cakes and pies pours from the ovens. The besieged Baker, must snatch the pastries before they fall off the end, but avoid the deadly silverware. If that's not enough, there's a dancing gingerbread man that tries to out-fox the Baker, and a surly janitor to sweep up the mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must maneuver the Baker among the six conveyors. You can stop one, but neglect it or try to stop another conveyor and it's on the move again. When you catch enough pastries, you'll earn a coffee break. Rest, enjoy your coffee, and get ready for a new onslaught of runaway goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good reflexes alone aren't enough to avoid disaster. As the pace increases, planning time and margin of error vanish until the bad-tempered janitor won't clean up another spill. Can you catch all the pastries and keep the Bakery going until the next coffee break? Test your speed, skill, and decisiveness in Cakewalk, the  latest video challenge from Commavid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
