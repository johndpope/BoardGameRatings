			<description>In Save Our Souls 2 to 4 players try to evacuate (reduce to 0 cards) their doomed cruise ships (their deck).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever since Dominion and the early adopters of the deckbuilding mechanism had been released, the designer mused about a deck de(con)struction game being released just being a matter of time.&lt;br/&gt;Up to now, nobody has implemented this in a way that uses deckbuilding mechanisms and where the sole goal is to empty the deck (Valley of the Kings being very close though).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rescue cards from your deck, buy action cards to speed up things, be the first to empty the deck (pun intended).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
