							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">3D Maze Man</name>
									
			<description>3D Maze Man is a 1998 computer game.&lt;br/&gt;Conceptually, it is influenced by Namco's popular arcade classic Pac-Man in that the main character (Maze Man) is a yellow sphere with a triangular mouth whose goal is to collect all the pellets in the current level and avoid the enemy ghosts. Like in Pac-Man, there are pellets which allow Maze Man to, for a short period of time (&amp;quot;Party Time&amp;quot;), eat the enemy ghosts, who regenerate from a specified location. Aesthetically, however, the 3D format of the game allows for a number of other features which differentiate it from Pac-Man. It provides for the ability to jump (also seen in Pac-Mania), enabling 3D Maze Man to avoid the ghosts when not in &amp;quot;Party Time&amp;quot;. Also, the navigable platforms can span multiple altitudes, allowing for sloped or &amp;quot;elevator&amp;quot; platforms. In addition, some levels include colored keys which unlock certain correspondingly colored bricks, green spaces which prevent Maze Man from jumping, and red spaces which kill Maze Man on impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;3D Maze Man: Amazing Adventures&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
