			<description>The renaissance of the arcade boxing genre is upon us. Created by the same team that developed the award-winning Fight Night Round 3, this all-new intellectual property offers irreverent fun, immersive gameplay and eye-popping stylized graphics. In this in-your-face, arcade world full of ego-wielding characters, each boxer comes to life with unique attributes and distinct personal style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pit Romeo, a Latin lover known for his pelvic thrusts, against Molotov, an oversized Russian demolitions expert with a penchant for fighting dirty, to see how Romeo's back-handed slaps fare against Molotov's illegal use of explosives. Add a little personal motivation to your fight by uploading a photo of your face to create a realistic likeness using Photo Game Face, and go toe-to-toe with a real-life friend or foe. Following the total domination of your rival, mount their head onto the wall of your virtual trophy room where you can relive your conquest over and over again. Every time you clobber someone in the ring, you earn their head for your collection. Go on a head-hunting mission to assemble your own army of pugilists. Then upload a clip of your clash to extend their humiliation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
