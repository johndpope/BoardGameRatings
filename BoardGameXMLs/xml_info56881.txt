			<description>Game system where 48 cards (from Ace to Queen in all four sets) build a 7x7 board centered in one single card summing up all Kings. Cards can be connected to the existing board following their order within the set or sideways by cards with the matching symbol, each way scoring differently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several game variants are offered (from 1 to 8 players), as well as adaptations of other known games to the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
