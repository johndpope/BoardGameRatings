							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gods of Adventure</name>
									
			<description>In Gods of Adventure players take on the roles of classical Gods who together influence the motivations and emotions of a group of eight fantasy adventurers, slaying creatures and overcoming obstacles. However, unlike many Richard Launius games, Gods of Adventure is not a coop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays either 3 or 4 players.  Every God's (player) deck is identical except for color and another small but important detail: the spoken words on the cards for each hero (divided by color) are all different, reflecting your temperament based on the God you are playing.  Each player will have a unique power associated with your temperament. The four temperaments are associated with Greed, Good Fortune, Aggression, and Deceit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
