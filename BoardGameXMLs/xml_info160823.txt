			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Argo Galaxy is growing &amp;ndash; not physically but figuratively. After years of study, the House of the Alliance has finally decided to open the Hastilion Expanse for full settlement and corporate utilization. Researchers identified numerous planets and moons as optimal for civilization and corporations from around the known galaxy, including Drake Mining and Manufacturing, are making plans to acquire land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception, Drake Mining and Manufacturing has prided itself on mining resources and creating high-quality products from those resources to support the entire galaxy. Moving into the Hastilion Expanse provides them with a wealth of opportunities to expand their operations and grow their business. That is, of course, if their new facilities can survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New planets are always fraught with hidden dangers from native flora and fauna, pirates, rival corporations, and rebellious populations. Only the strength of Drake&amp;rsquo;s mercenary force will help them overcome any roadblocks and become successful. As long as they don&amp;rsquo;t get killed in the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perilous Journey #15: Mission Alpha presents part 1 (out of 14) of the Hastilion Expanse campaign for Mercenary Breed [Savage Worlds]. Originally published in Savage Insider Premium and the Hastilion Expanse Compendiums, this new Perilous Journey series updates the campaign to Mercenary Breed 2.0, expands on the original content, and offers the new fictional series, along with conforming to the Perilous Journey template.  To utilize the Hastilion Expanse campaign, players and GMs will need a copy of the Savage Worlds core rulebook, available from Pinnacle Entertainment Group, and the Mercenary&amp;rsquo;s Handbook for Mercenary Breed. GMs should also have a copy of the Galaxy Guide and Xenopedia. [The original Mercenary Breed (Expanded Edition) core setting guide may work as well.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perilous Journey #15: Mission Alpha includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The first part of the Hastilion Expanse campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     Traveling encounters.&lt;br/&gt;     3 new character xeno templates.&lt;br/&gt;     3 new planets.&lt;br/&gt;     Mechanics for housing and vehicles pertaining to the campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     1 new Xenopedia entry.&lt;br/&gt;     The first part of a space opera fictional series.&lt;br/&gt;     ... and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
