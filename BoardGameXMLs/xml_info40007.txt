			<description>Medio-Milenio is a trivia game based on the relationship between Spain and Latin America. Its main theme is the encounter among the two worlds. &lt;br/&gt;In the game, this encounter is reflected as a journey depicted on the board between Europe and America or the other way round. The players can choose where to start their journey and will be answering questions during it.&lt;br/&gt;The questions have four different levels and are all related with the history, arts, tradition and facts of the two continents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was released as a commemoration of the 500th anniversary of   Christopher Columbus' reaching landfall in America in 1492.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
