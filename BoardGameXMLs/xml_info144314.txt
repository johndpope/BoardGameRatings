			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Achievement Unlocked! introduces 40 new achievement feats, including a subset of six feats that are compatible with the new Ultimate Campaign downtime system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample Feats&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Felineus Interruptus - Whenever a creature with the pounce ability charges you, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snake Oil Salesman - Once per day, you can offer an ally a flask of ordinary water. If you successfully Bluff, the water grants the ally temporary hit points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thick-skinned - Reduce bleed damage dealt to you by 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triple Threat - Whenever you cast a spell, you get +1 to hit and damage for 1 round. Whenever you deal damage with a martial weapon, you can cast a cantrip or orison as an immediate action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
