			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filbar Friday continues in the Dual Series with FD9 &amp;ndash; Windmill of Tregg! You&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at the small community of Smentz (15 locations!) to regain strength after your last adventure. While speaking with the people of the small village you catch wind of some ruins across the river that may have a mine or cache of ore and ruins to investigate. Your group is not the first who has had interest in searching but those that have ventured east have not returned. Are you ready for a bit more adventure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Dual Campaign for a 2-4 mid-level adventurers and DM.  Primarily designed for two players, the FD series has included the opportunity for NPC assistance or with just four players. This adventure is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
