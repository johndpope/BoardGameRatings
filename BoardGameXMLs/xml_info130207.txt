			<description>Back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;America's Favorte Word Game has gone shopping with the Limited Too Edition of SCRABBLE! It's a Girl's World and the classic SCRABBLE crossword game is now played on a beautiful pink game board and includes a special bonus world list to help you score big points and have more fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the basic rules from Scrabble apply. Players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants:&lt;br/&gt;1) Players take 9 tiles instead of 7 and any word that uses 7 or more tiles score the 50 point bonus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Play until a player reaches a pre-decided score based on skill level and the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Bonus words! There are 50 different words that when played will score bonus points. 12 which score 5 extra points such as coat, sun, hair, text); 27 which score 10 extra points such as school, flower, ballet, cool, camera); and 11 which score 15 extra points such as stripes, journal, clothes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
