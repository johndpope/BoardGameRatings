			<description>A game about door-to-door sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plan shows a typical town map, with manly one-way streets. At the start, each player buys an office, where his salesmen will start every round. In each round, every player selects how many items they think they can sell. Then, everyone secretly selects their selling price. The person with the lowest price moves all his hired salesmen first, and has the best chances of selling his items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends after a set number of rounds, with the richest player being the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
