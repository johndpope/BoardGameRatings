			<description>Welcome to Gods &amp;amp; Minions &amp;ndash; the customizable card game of fantasy warfare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First of all: Gods &amp;amp; Minions is a card based tactical combat game, so one game represents one battle. You and your opponent each represent generals who command their troops. The troops are displayed using cards. Compared to a full wargame (like Warhammer), Gods &amp;amp; Minions is much lighter on the rules and compared to a customizable card game (like Legend of the five Rings), Gods &amp;amp; Minions focus is 100% on the battles (instead of kingdom building, diplomacy or intrigue).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the godswar in this action loaded, customizable and collectible card game. Assemble your army from a huge variety of nations and factions available. Collect and play gods, minions, enhance your troops with artefacts &amp;amp; equipment and unleash powerful spells, command mighty beasts, towering war-machines and unique personalities. Fight for dominance over a fantasy world broken by age old war of nations. Be part of a universe where almighty gods are pulling the strings behind from the scenes and decide between life and death as they see fit. Be prepared when this brand new fantasy wargame hits the shelves!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unique Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Full-fledged and affordable tabletop warfare system without expensive miniatures&lt;br/&gt;     Manaless resource system without staple cards that clutter your deck&lt;br/&gt;     No artificial rarities &amp;ndash; you get exactly the cards and amount of copies you want&lt;br/&gt;     Lightweight wargame rules prevent slow gameplay without being over simplified&lt;br/&gt;     All rules and cards available for download. for free. always.&lt;br/&gt;     You pay only if you want a printed copy (physical product) of your own.&lt;br/&gt;     No dice: Gods &amp;amp; Minions does not require any additonal component or luck factor!&lt;br/&gt;     No Grid &amp;amp; No Rulers: An innovative movement system renders rulers obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;     No shallow story: Dive into a background world full of history and folklore.&lt;br/&gt;     Welcome to the end times &amp;ndash; welcome to the world of Gods &amp;amp; Minions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
