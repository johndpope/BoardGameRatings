			<description>The game takes place on Ruli Island (Lazulis Island in the English translation), governed by Count Arganan and located at the entrance of a harbor serving as the only entrance to a mountainous continent. The player controls a group of mercenaries that have come from the desolate continent to the island seeking work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes abilities such as &amp;quot;Gathering&amp;quot;, which allows Zael to draw the attention of enemies to buy time for his allies to cast spells. Another ability called &amp;quot;Focus&amp;quot; allows you to make long range attacks and see the weaknesses of enemies. The game also features a cover system and over the shoulder viewpoint, while making use of rapid fire crossbows in a manner similar to third-person shooters. In addition, the game also features real-time strategy elements, allowing the player to issue commands to other characters in real-time. This includes directing allies, telling magic users to destroy bridges, or archers to attack specific enemies, for example. The game also features stealth elements, such as the abilities to &amp;quot;hide behind cover and pepper unsuspecting guards with arrows, luring them out on their own for a stealth attack, or pick off dangerous mages and healers from a distance&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also contains 6-player cooperative and competitive online modes, where users either team up to face monsters or battle each other. The game also features online multiplayer modes such as Suppression, where players team up to take on a boss for special rewards, and Fray, a player-versus-player battle royale deathmatch or team deathmatch mode which allows up to six players to fight each other using the character of their choice and even enemy monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The Last Story&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
