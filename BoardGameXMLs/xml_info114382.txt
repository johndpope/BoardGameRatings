							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Faces of Thedas: Tallis</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deadly and witty elf assassin called Tallis is an exciting new addition to the world of Dragon Age, debuting simultaneously in the original web series, Dragon Age: Redemption, written by and starring Felicia Day, and the Dragon Age II downloadable content, Mark of the Assassin. Felicia Day created the character of Tallis and portrays her in both projects. Now, with this short DLC for the Dragon Age tabletop roleplaying game , GMs can import this intriguing character into their own campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is Tallis an ally or a rival? Is she out to aid or thwart your campaign&amp;rsquo;s PCs? Does she spark a new adventure or add complexity to one already underway? In the dynamic stories of the Dragon Age RPG, anything&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following pages give you background lore and game statistics for Tallis so you can use her in your campaign. We also present a short interview with Felicia Day, spotlighting her creation and portrayal of Tallis, so you can get a clearer idea of how to play the part in your own RPG adventures. What&amp;rsquo;s here builds&lt;br/&gt;on, but does not spoil, the various projects in which Tallis appears. For more information, enjoy Mark of the Assassin and Redemption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
