							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sydney&#039;s World</name>
									
			<description>Explore an entirely new world. Meet new friends (and enemies) and fight monsters. Save Sydney...and her dad! Stop small dogs from barking, learn magic, and determine the fate of an entire world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sydney's World is not meant for children under eight. Girls and boys will enjoy the game equally. There is no running around collecting coins or blowing things up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sydney's World is like a game with a book inside that comes to life. You will even be able to hear Sydney and villains speak. Take turns reading different character parts with your parents, friends, or even your teachers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
