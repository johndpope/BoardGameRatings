							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">Le Mousequetaire Final</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Grande Finale...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le Mousquetaire Final is the fourth and final adventure in the Le Mousquetaire D&amp;eacute;shonor&amp;eacute; campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Le Mousquetaire Final the characters finally face Delmar Boulanger, the former musketeer responsible for the deaths of several musketeers, all killed as part of his elaborate plot for revenge. As the leads have dried up at the conclusion of Ran&amp;ccedil;on de Sang and all of Boulanger&amp;rsquo;s former comrades are dead, the characters are once again in Paris performing their usual duties as musketeers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, Boulanger is not quite finished. As the man who took his eye is dead, Boulanger has turned his anger toward the dead musketeer&amp;rsquo;s son, who also happens to be a musketeer. Toward that end he has arranged to have the character&amp;rsquo;s superior, Lieutenant Jean-Marie de Guerre, kidnapped and used as bait to bring the character to him. Boulanger has chosen the site of one of his greatest victories as a King&amp;rsquo;s Musketeer to dispatch the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for moderately experienced characters, although more or less experienced characters can be easily accommodated. It is not necessary to run D&amp;eacute;sir Mortel, Le Baiser de la Mort, or Ran&amp;ccedil;on de Sang (the previous adventures in the Le Mousquetaire D&amp;eacute;shonor&amp;eacute; campaign) before running this adventure, although you will get much more out of playing Le Mousquetaire Final as the culmination of the Le Mousquetaire D&amp;eacute;shonor&amp;eacute; campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
