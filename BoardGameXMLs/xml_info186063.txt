							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Alchemy of Askrias</name>
									
			<description>Alchemy of Askrias is a casual board game for 1 to 3 players (1 to 5 players with the added 4 to 5 player expansion). The game uses 'Askrias Cubes' which allow the players to socket game tiles, each of which have different abilities on them; which then allows the players to either create the victory points for the win or powerful spells to interfere with your opposing Alchemist's!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is focused mainly on actual dice building - each turn players will have the chance to add tiles to a 'Askrias Cube' depending on the formula that they choose which will then alter the way the game is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With extra cubes, the game can also be expanded up to 5 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
