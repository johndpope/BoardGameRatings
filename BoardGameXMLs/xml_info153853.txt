			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joan of Arc is a story roleplaying game about scientists and rescue personnel working to save a damaged space station before disruptive energy rips it apart. Starting from the planet&amp;rsquo;s surface, the team has limited time to get to the station, climb inside, and repair the damaged station. The clock is ticking as problem after problem besets the team members who have limited resources to battle the ravaged reactor core.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Protocol game series uses vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles to tell a story. Each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity and isolation in a dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joan of Arc is a zero-prep game for 3 or more players. The game length is exponentially long, so games with more players take more time to complete. Home requires a deck of poker cards as well as tokens to track drama points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series presumes some understanding of GMless game protocol: scene-framing, shared authority, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
