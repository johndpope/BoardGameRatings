			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not the world you know. Time and time has done a lot to it. You are now in 4520. It seems like what you know now, but it's just an illusion. Nothing is the same. You can't buy nothing with 5$. To have a nice life, you have to be in the lucky few that work and live around the &amp;quot;Hot Spot&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Hot Spot&amp;quot; is a big city into the city. There, you find all the wealth of this sick world. There you could have a nice life. Outside that city, there's the &amp;quot;Wild City&amp;quot;. The real jungle, the place where life worth nothing and justice is just a dream. There's still some cops working outside the &amp;quot;Hot Spot&amp;quot;, but they looks more like soldier than what you maybe know of a cop. In the &amp;quot;Wild City&amp;quot;, the cop don't need a legal paper to visit you and fire at you. The &amp;quot;Wild City&amp;quot; is mostly a training ground for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the &amp;quot;Hot Spot&amp;quot;, you have all the high tech that mankind has created. Cyber ware are still illegal in there, but if you have the cash it could became much more legal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be played either as a tabletop RPG with a d3, or as a LARP using Rock-Paper-Scissors - rules are given for both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
