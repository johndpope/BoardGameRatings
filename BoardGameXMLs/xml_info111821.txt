			<description>The Fat Penguin is an ice-breaker. In the game, players take turns to ask a question of the others. Players secretly choose their answer (red/no or green/yes). Then the asking player has to guess individually what the other players answered for themselves. If the player is correct, then its penguin advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions varies from everyday-life tendencies and preferences, to life/death and ethical dilemmas, and funny/dirty questions. E.g.: &amp;quot;Have you in the past year used someone elses toothbrush?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Would you rather give up your mom's love (green) og the respect of your friends (red)?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What is more unattractive: Too self-confident (green) or too shy (red)?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Routined sex three times a week (green) or exciting sex once every third week (red)?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is intended as an ice-breaker at parties. The drinking-game variant makes the players take a shot of booze/beer if they are right or wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is published in German &amp;quot;Der Fette Pinguin&amp;quot;, in English &amp;quot;The Fat Penguin&amp;quot; and in Danish &amp;quot;Den Fede Pingvin&amp;quot;. There is also a smartphone App version of the game (available in Danish for iPhone, and soon in English and German and also for Android).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
