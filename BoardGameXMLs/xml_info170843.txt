			<description>Each player gets one pawn, starting in the corner with the same color. The money chips should be divided evenly between the players. Goal of the game is to be the first to get in the middle of the spinning wheel, thus collecting all the money there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player turn consists of rolling both dice and move your pawn the number of spaces shown on the number dice forward, entering your &amp;quot;target way&amp;quot; to the middle of the spinning wheel only at the entrance marked with your color. If you rolled green on the other dice, you draw and execute an event card after moving. You draw no card if you roll red. The event card tells you either to put a number of your money chips into the middle of the spinning wheel or to spin the wheel in clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Thru spinning the wheel, the pawns may slide in (to the center of the wheel) or out. To end the game, the last space of the target way has to be reached exactly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
