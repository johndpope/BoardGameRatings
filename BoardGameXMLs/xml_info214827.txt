							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer Expansion #4: France 1940</name>
									
			<description>IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to play this expansion, you will need a copy of the Panzer base game; ownership of Panzer Expansions 1, 2 or 3 is NOT required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion set includes the most significant French forces that saw action on the Western front in 1940. Also included are the German forces that invaded France and the Low Countries, flanked the Maginot Line, and finally pushed on into France. The playbook includes rules for special units, new optional rules for Staggered Initiative, Command Span, and others, 12 riveting scenarios (including 2 historical scenarios depicting the fierce battle for Stonne), and unit summaries for the French and German units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to all the other features included in this expansion, there are two new exciting extras. The Panzer Leader rules and the respective 7/8&amp;rdquo; Leader counters of various enlisted and commissioned ranks for all forces &amp;ndash; French, German, US, British, and Soviet; and the unique hull and turret damage rules and the respective 5/8&amp;rdquo; counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ownership of Expansions 1, 2 or 3 is not required to field the German forces, they are all here including the STuG IIIA and Hs 123A-1 aircraft, which were not previously available. This expands on those German units included in the first three expansions &amp;ndash; no unit IDs are duplicated. Combine the German units from all of the expansions to create customized scenarios on either the Western or Eastern Front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TO&amp;amp;Es booklet includes details for the French and German forces covering the 1940 period, including the five major divisions from the cavalry and infantry arms of the French Army, including the Mechanized Light Division (DLM &amp;ndash; Division L&amp;eacute;g&amp;egrave;re M&amp;eacute;chanique) and the Armored Division (DCR &amp;ndash; Division Cuirass&amp;eacute;e de R&amp;eacute;serve). German forces include panzer, motorized infantry and infantry divisions, as well as the Grossdeutschland (mot) Infantry Regiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this expansion includes the next 4 double-sided geomorphic mapboards, modeling the terrain found in the French countryside including 2 historical maps depicting the terrain in and around Stonne. Add these to the geomorphic mapboards from expansions 1, 2 &amp;amp; 3 for added play and many possible battle combinations.&lt;br/&gt; Components:&lt;br/&gt; 4 Counters sheets&lt;br/&gt;264 double-sided 7/8&amp;rdquo; counters&lt;br/&gt;160 double-sided 5/8&amp;rdquo; counters&lt;br/&gt; 4 Map Panels&lt;br/&gt;10&amp;rdquo; x 27.75&amp;rdquo; double-sided geomorphic maps [panels 21-28]&lt;br/&gt; 21 double-sided 5&amp;rdquo; x 4&amp;rdquo; Data Cards &lt;br/&gt;French:&lt;br/&gt;AMD-35&lt;br/&gt;AMR-33&lt;br/&gt;AMR-35&lt;br/&gt;AMR-35(H)&lt;br/&gt;Artillery&lt;br/&gt;Bre.693 Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;CA25 CA38 AAG&lt;br/&gt;CA25 SA-L 34 ATG&lt;br/&gt;CA47 SA 37 ATG&lt;br/&gt;CA75 97/35 ATG&lt;br/&gt;Char B1-bis&lt;br/&gt;H-35&lt;br/&gt;H-38&lt;br/&gt;H-39&lt;br/&gt;Infantry Mortars, HMG and Anti-Tank Weapons &lt;br/&gt;Infantry Squads, Half-Squads &amp;amp; Sections &lt;br/&gt;Limbers&lt;br/&gt;Lorraine 38L&lt;br/&gt;MB.174.A3 Aircraft&lt;br/&gt;R-35&lt;br/&gt;R-40&lt;br/&gt;S-35&lt;br/&gt;Truck AA 13.2&lt;br/&gt;Trucks&lt;br/&gt;UE&lt;br/&gt;Unic P107&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;German:&lt;br/&gt;2cm FlaK 38 AAG &lt;br/&gt;2cm FlaK Zgkw 1t &lt;br/&gt;3.7cm FlaK Zgkw 5t &lt;br/&gt;3.7cm PaK 36 ATG &lt;br/&gt;7.5cm leIG &lt;br/&gt;15cm sIG &lt;br/&gt;Hs 123A-1 Aircraft [not previously released]&lt;br/&gt;Ju 87B-1 Aircraft                               &lt;br/&gt;Limbers&lt;br/&gt;PSW 221&lt;br/&gt;PSW 222 &lt;br/&gt;PSW 231&lt;br/&gt;PzKpfw 35(t)&lt;br/&gt;PzKpfw 38(t)C&lt;br/&gt;PzKpfw IB&lt;br/&gt;PzKpfw IIC&lt;br/&gt;PzKpfw IIIF &lt;br/&gt;PzKpfw IVD &lt;br/&gt;SPW 251/10&lt;br/&gt;SPW 251/2&lt;br/&gt;STuG IIIA [not previously released]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 full color 8 &amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; x 11&amp;rdquo; booklets&lt;br/&gt;Playbook: 44 pages &lt;br/&gt;TO&amp;amp;E Booklet: 24 pages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
