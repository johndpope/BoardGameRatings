							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Empire Mania: The Hockey Conquest</name>
									
			<description>Each player starts the game with millions of &amp;quot;Empire Mania&amp;quot; dollars; and then proceeds to collect assets by purchasing teams and free agents, collecting bonuses, winning points for the League Standings, and staying clear of the Penalty Box Squares. As well, you can trade Teams and Free Agents - a strategy that can make you a bundle, or cost you a fortune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine the thrill of buying your favorite teams of the NHL, combined with the excitement of developing your own strategies to win the game. The player who has the greatest financial empire at the end of the game wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(This game was an Official Licensed Product of the NHL)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
