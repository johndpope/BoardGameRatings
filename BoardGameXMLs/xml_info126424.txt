			<description>Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty, known in Japan as Suiko Enbu (水滸演武?), is a 1995 fighting arcade game developed and published by Data East&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has eleven playable characters and many locations around China to choose from. Each character fights with his/her own unique weapon while some are unarmed. If the weapon is used to block attacks too often, the character will only be able to fight with his/her bare hands and lose the weapon for the rest of the round. Fighting moves are classified under low, medium and hard in terms of attack power, in order of increasing amount of damage dealt to an opponent. Each character also has his/her own special attack to use against the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1996, Data East ported Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation platforms. Despite the North American arcade being titled Outlaws of the Lost Dynasty, the North American home version was retitled as Dark Legend, while the Japanese title remains unchanged in the Japanese home versions. These ports include both the Original Mode, the mode that plays just like the arcade version; and the Special Mode, which adds extra moves. There is also a beginner mode that can be accessed by pressing the L or R button at the same time. In 2P Battle mode, Makoto Mizoguchi from the Fighter's History series (also by Data East) can be unlocked. The North American version is an update from the Japanese Version and it was translated for the American audience; however, most of the Japanese text and especially voice samples remained. Some of the options has been removed as well as the option demo play. Unlike the Japanese version, you cannot select between Arcade Mode or Special Mode, instead it defaults to Special Mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
