			<description>Each Treasure Hunt provides eight clues and eight number cards for locating hidden treasure and each Treasure Hunt may be played by eight couples.  Red, gray and yellow cards are used for indoor hunts and blue, green and orange cards are used for outdoor hunts.  The clue cards are hidden together with their corresponding number cards.  As the clues are found, a number card is taken but the clue is left.  The first couple to turn in a complete set of number cards plus the ninth card (the Treasure card) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
