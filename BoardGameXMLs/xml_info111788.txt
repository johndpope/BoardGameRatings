			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joe Blade is a sideview run-and-gun. The back of the box says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE STORY&lt;br/&gt;In an ambitious raid a gang of vicious terrorists led by the infamous Crax Bloodfinger have kidnapped six world leaders, demanding thirty billion dollars ransom for their safe release. Of course, the governments concerned have refused to pay and as the deadline draws nigh they decide to take the only course of action left open to them: send in Joe Blade-Joe Blade - trained in a Tibetan monastery. Mean, tough and fearless ,his very name strikes fear into the cold hearts of every gangster, assassin and drug baron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE MISSION &lt;br/&gt;You are Joe Blade.... Armed only with a light semi-automatic machine gun, you must infiltrate Bloodfinger's massive fortified HQ and rescue the hostages. Bloodfinger's base is guarded heavily by his private uniformed army and underworld henchmen, contact with which will drain your strength. The stronghold is also protected by 6 booby-trapped explosive devices, all of which must be activated, giving you twenty minutes to complete your task before Bloodfinger's lair blows up taking you with it. To activate these explosives you have to rearrange the access code into alphabetical order using left, right and fire to swap the letters. Scattered around are various pieces of equipment and supplies that may be used to your advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
