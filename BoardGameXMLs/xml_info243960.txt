			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D-Percent - 100 Dungeon Sights harkens back to the days of exciting dungeon crawls where diverse monsters lurked around every corner, the bizarre and unexplainable was commonplace, and war and conflict existed among the inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make your dungeons more dynamic with a &amp;quot;lived in&amp;quot; feel. This collection includes two pages of sights, areas, views, mysteries, and other exciting items that go beyond planned and random encounters. Let your players discover signs of battles, mystical oddities, discarded items, and other details to make your players scratch their heads in confusion, wring their hands in worry, and surprise you with their creativity as they react to the unexpected. Create greater depth and spark fantastic adventures with the roll of the dice!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your players zigged when you expect a zag. They asked you a question you didn't anticipate. You want to add details and avoid being repetitive. You need a ready supply of random generators! Welcome to D-Percent, Black Falcon Games' line of ready-to-use lists of themed items. Simply roll d%, consult the chart, and you have a handy detail right on hand!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is not specific to any particular game system, instead taking a neutral generic stance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
