							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Caveat Emptor</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So your PCs have gone to the market to pick up some last minute things for their next adventure... Rope, a few extra arrows, some trail rations, and an 11-foot pole when a 10-foot one simply won't do. You could simply say &amp;quot;Ok, that'll be 4 gold, 2 silver, and 3 copper, don't forget to mark them off your character sheet.&amp;quot; Or you could offer a richer environment for roleplaying with a marketplace to explore. Imagine haggling with the store clerk over that 11-foot pole's price. &amp;quot;Why's it cost more than a 10-foot pole?&amp;quot; And then the real fun begins...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But without NPCs in the marketplace to interact with, that can get a little dull. That's where Insta-NPCs #10: Caveat Emptor comes in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caveat Emptor features include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    8 tables offering thousands of unique combinations of buyers and sellers in a marketplace setting&lt;br/&gt;    15 examples of NPCs created for fantasy, science fiction, and horror genres&lt;br/&gt;    2 revamped tables showing how to use the product as-is for science fiction as well as fantasy&lt;br/&gt;    1 worksheet for printing the whole process on a single page to use later&lt;br/&gt;    Nearly 6,000 words of material across 13 pages (10 pages of content)&lt;br/&gt;    All in a system-neutral, rules-neutral format for use with all your favorite games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Caveat can be used for any setting or system. Need a market for a science fiction, fantasy, horror, or western adventure? I bet this will help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
