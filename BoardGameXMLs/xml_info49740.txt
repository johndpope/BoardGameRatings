			<description>This is a print and play map that is not to be confused with the later Alspach map with the same name. This map is a multi-player map that uses Puerto Rico's coin mechanism, as unselected roles gain money which is picked up when that role is selected in later rounds. This makes even otherwise undesirable roles become valuable after a few rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is detailed in this thread:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/130388&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/130388&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
