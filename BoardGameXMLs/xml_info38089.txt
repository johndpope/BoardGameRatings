							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pawn Poker</name>
									
			<description>An abstract strategy game played on a large 5x5 grid. The game also requires a different colored pawn for each player and a standard deck of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the deck is shuffled and a card is placed on each of the twenty-five spaces on the board. The players then select their starting corners and place their pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the players take turns moving their pawns, they get to keep the card (if any) from the space that the pawn was moved from. The game ends when all of the cards have been collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to make the best five card Poker hand from the playing cards collected by the player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
