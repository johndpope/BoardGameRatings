							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Deadly Tide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sit down little foals and pay heed to my tale, for it is a tale of fear and terror.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Listen closely, for Strynxgarnath, the Dweller Beneath, ripped a hole in the world and her Brood Mothers poured through the breach. Her creatures swam through the seas and crawled onto the beaches. Her broods spawned wherever they could and brought misery and suffering upon us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strange creatures have been seen in the sea and even attacked a village on land. Now brave adventurers are needed to scour the coastline for more incursions. What horrors will they find carried in by the tide?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Deadly Depths Adventure for a party of 3 to 7 second level characters. Deadly Depths features stand-alone adventures that can be played by themselves with no dependency on each other. However they are tied together by a common theme and enemy allowing as many or as few of them to be dropped into a campaign as required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
