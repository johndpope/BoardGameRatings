			<description>TOCA 2 Touring Cars (called Touring Car Challenge in the USA) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters, and released in 1998. It is part of the TOCA Touring Car series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mainly an annual franchise update of cars and tracks, the game did add more detailed graphics, physics, multiplayer modes and other minor features. Fictional (but realistic) tracks were added, and support races such as Ford Fiestas, Formula Ford and others also arrived. The level of car damage possible during a race was also enhanced, which was a significant selling point compared with the likes of Gran Turismo which had no damage model at the time. The intro (opening scene) of the US version features the song &amp;quot;Sole Sentiment&amp;quot; by Ratman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TOCA 2 Touring Cars&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
