			<description>Pandas! Bandits! Conservationists! Grandma!&lt;br/&gt;As a Panda: sneak into the Bandit Camp and get your babies back without getting caught.&lt;br/&gt;As a Bandit: catch those sneaky Pandas, while stealing as many baby pandas as you can.&lt;br/&gt;As a Conservationist: protect the Pandas! There aren&amp;rsquo;t many left!&lt;br/&gt;As Grandma: lead the team, and make some delicious bamboo soup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Panda is a team game. &lt;br/&gt;The Bandit Team consists of all the Bandits. &lt;br/&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re trying to work out who everyone is, so they can steal the baby pandas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Panda Team consists of Grandma, the Conservationist, and the Pandas. &lt;br/&gt;They want to keep the Panda&amp;rsquo;s identities secret, to keep the baby pandas safe from the Bandits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting with Grandma and going clockwise, players hand out 3 baby pandas each turn, then play 1 tea biscuit. When a player gets 3 tea biscuits, players vote on whether or not to net them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Netted players lose all the baby pandas they've been handed, but do not reveal their role or leave the game. If all Pandas are netted, the Bandit team win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise, the team with the most baby pandas at the end of Grandma's third turn is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
