			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sword of Martin is a pen and paper roleplaying game that has, as an understood setting, the world that Brian Jacques depicts in his world-famous Redwall series. This rulebook assumes that the reader has at least cursory knowledge of both the Redwall series and roleplaying games. To properly play this game, the players (of which there should at least be two) at least one of each of the following die: d4, d6, d8, d10, and d10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before players begin making their characters, they should now what they aim to create. This could be as simple as &amp;quot;Otter warrior-wanderer&amp;quot; or more detailed like &amp;quot;former family beast displaced by band of vermin&amp;quot;. By knowing more about your character&amp;rsquo;s past, they can become more than a collection of numbers, but legendary and fun characters to be talked about for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
