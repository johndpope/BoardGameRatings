							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">For the Honour of the Family</name>
									
			<description>from Game Plot:&lt;br/&gt;For The Honour Of The Family is set up as a political intrigue game. It is designed to have the players use bargaining and persuasion to resolve the conflicts. It is expected there is no requirement for physical conflict. Hence we have included no specific mechanics in this regard. There are several plots that are mixed into the game of varying importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main plot concerns the vote for the new Head of the House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other major plot point concerns the murder of Duna Cantacuzino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Game Structure:&lt;br/&gt;There is no set structure for the game, although a definitive beginning and finish is recommended. We expect this game to require somewhere between 3-4 hours with a full cast; although if a reduced cast is required this time could be cut down somewhat (although we would recommend a minimum of 2 hours).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user note:&lt;br/&gt;7 players with 2-3 GMs are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
