			<description>Escape-Room for kids from 7 and up.&lt;br/&gt;To stop the counter, kids have to retrieve a key from a plastic cage, using dexterity. With this key they can activate a &amp;quot;Quizmaster&amp;quot; which gives them three riddles (on cards). If they can solve three consecutively they retrieve a second key, used to stopthe timer.&lt;br/&gt;It can be replayed, because the riddles are card based and there are enough cards (with different levels of difficulty) for 20 games or so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
