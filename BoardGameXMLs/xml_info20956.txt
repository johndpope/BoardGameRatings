							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Civil War Wit</name>
									
			<description>A simple trivia game covering the American Civil War.  Each card (two standard decks' worth) has a photograph or etching reproduction on the front and a point value.  On the back are two questions--one &amp;quot;buff&amp;quot; level, the other &amp;quot;scholar&amp;quot; level.  Get either question right--it's not clear, from the rules, who gets to choose which question gets asked, the asker or the answerer--and you get the points listed on the card.  There is often no clear connection between the point value of the question and its difficulty.  The pictures, however, are very nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an odd twist, if a card's question goes unanswered, the answer is then read aloud and the card set aside.  After all the rest of the cards have been dealt with, this pile of discards--whose answers, again, have been revealed--gets shuffled up and gone through again.  Presumably this is to test short-term memory.  The game ends once all cards have been correctly answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of &amp;quot;WIT&amp;quot; games from this company, which included trivia games on wildlife, National Parks, and other Americana topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
