			<description>From publisher website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You gotta spend money to steal money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 1919. America is in its golden age of grift. Clever thievery has moved from shell games and three-card monte to a more mature art form: the heist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this head-to-head match, you must compete to hire a team of professional criminals, plan heists on unsuspecting marks, and muscle out your opponent to earn money. It's all about return on investment and knowing your opponent. The player with the most money at the end wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game plays in a series of 5-7 rounds, each round with three phases: The Purchase, The Plan, and The Heist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PURCHASE: Spend Wisely.&lt;br/&gt;Hire crew members to pull your heists. We've got Grifters, Partners, Insiders, Thieves, Muscle, Getaway Cars, and Cops on the Payroll. Spend wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE PLAN: Choose Carefully.&lt;br/&gt;Plan your heists by by secretly sorting your crew cards in your hand. Place your crew face-down when ready. Choose wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE HEIST: Plans unfold.&lt;br/&gt;Plans are put in motion that cannot be changed! You attempt your planned heists, but if you run into your opponent you must rely on your best muscle to save you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most money wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
