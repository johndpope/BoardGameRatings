			<description>Dark Menace Productions (via Filsinger Games) is taking Champions of the Galaxy (COTG)  into a whole new dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COTG: Battle for Cetus is the first part of a trilogy that takes COTG in a new direction with the use of &amp;ldquo;DM-Books&amp;rdquo;. The first release contains a story booklet describing exciting super hero action and adventure on the faraway planet of Cetus. You&amp;rsquo;ll meet legends like Star Warrior and Thantos and evil villains like Krakan and Ghengis Khan!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included with the story booklet are playing cards representing the heroes and villains of COTG in a super hero motif. You receive 6 cards, plus blank templates to create your own characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2 of this Champions of the Galaxy story is scheduled for release in December and Part 3 (final part) in July 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cetus has been attacked by the military forces of General Krakan. How will the top military brass on Cetus respond? Players can use the provided story or develop their own plots as you set up battles of good and evil. Each character is represented by a card with different attacks and defensive moves. Similar to the original Champions of the Galaxy card game, you roll on one of three offensive levels trying to wear down your opponent. The opponent won't go down without a fight, so if they happen to roll a comeback defensive move, they take over on offense. The fight goes back and forth until one fighter is defeated. New to COTG is the idea of fighting more epic battles with multiple opponents. You can have Star Warrior take on a group of Sentry Bots where he must defeat all the enemies to win. If he loses, will Supernova take over to conquer evil. Its up you in Battle for Cetus since its your story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
