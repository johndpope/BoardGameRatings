							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tactical Soldier: Undead Rising</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Tactical Soldier is a tactical squad level turn based game where you control a group of soldiers trying to uncover the dark secrets of an army research base, invaded by zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a story driven campaign with hand-drawn comic book cutscenes. 8 unique levels packed to the brim with a variety of flesh-craving zombies and an equally nice selection of weapons to halt their rampage! Everything takes place in a wonderful 3D world, with a freely moving camera allowing you to explore the bowels of the base. Our innovative action-camera system makes sure you see the blood spraying on the walls as the zombies eat their way into your squad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are put in control of a squad of several soldiers, using Action Point based game mechanics - You have to make tactical decisions to be able to survive the mindless horde. Do you clear the room with grenades, and then snipe the big boss from a distance? Or is it better to heal up first, and then pepper the corridor with a machine gun that has area of effect? &lt;br/&gt;Or maybe just rush in with a chainsaw...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
