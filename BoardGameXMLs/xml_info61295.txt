			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue is the colour of Magic, Symbols and Time. It is concerned with an understanding of the order that underlies the universe. From concept to form, idea to reality, measured in the increments of moments; the nature of the organization of That Which Is, is the matter that Blue magic seeks to comprehend and manipulate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those that devote themselves to understanding the Blue are able to manipulate spells, runes and symbols, and even time itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most devoted of these might become Metamages. Their powers are limited and focussed, but are the fear of even the most powerful Wizards. They cannot learn the diverse powers that are available to generalists or even other specialists, but may manage through manipulating the spells of others to achieve a variety of power that would be the envy of any generalist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Clerical or Mystical domains &lt;br/&gt;    a linked reclassification of one twelfth of the spells of the players handbook, with some new spell effects to fit the spells into Chromatic Magic Theory &lt;br/&gt;    a whole new character class, the Metamage. This spellcaster is devoted to the Blue, with abilities akin to a specialist wizard with a keen insight into and power over all magic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
