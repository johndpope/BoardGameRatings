							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carnival of Terror</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carnival of Terror begins as players hear the rumours of gruesome murders happening in nearby towns &amp;mdash; coincidentally following the arrival of a wondrous carnival. Could the seemingly innocuous festival be not as it seems? Could the enigmatic clowns and jesters of the circus be something far more sinister than they appear? Could the renowned Funhouse, an impossible labyrinth of smoke and mirrors, be involved with the disappearances of local children? As players begin to delve into the mystery of the murders, they will find themselves faced with indescribable horrors&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carnival of Terror was originally written and optimized for a party of Level 9 characters, though is primarily narrative-based and may be adapted to all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
