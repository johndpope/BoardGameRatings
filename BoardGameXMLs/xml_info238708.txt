							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">20 Quick Drow NPCs Volume One</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the finest collection of quick NPCs that you will find this side of the Nentir Vale!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DROW NPCs - culturally insular, xenophobic and vicious...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What happens when they are stranded far from home and have to get jobs and make their way in the world? The NPCs inside will show you how 21 of them turned out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Released just prior to Halloween it strikes me that these would be ideal when you want a darker or more grim NPC -strahd - shadowfell - vampire type adventures. They will fit into a regular setting as well when you want someone psychologically darker ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QUICK NPCS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do your players catch you out sometimes by suddenly expressing an interest in some random NPC who you never planned out because they weren't important? Do you sometimes struggle to come up with names for all the NPCs you are populating your setting with?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either way this document will help!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty NPCs described in just enough detail to make them quick to insert or adapt as needed.&lt;br/&gt;What you get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20(+1) NPCs described as mentioned above (click the preview for the free one)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 Male divided up as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Youth&lt;br/&gt;1 Teen&lt;br/&gt;3 Adults&lt;br/&gt;3 Middle Aged&lt;br/&gt;1 Old&lt;br/&gt;1 Wise (Because people don&amp;rsquo;t get very old &amp;hellip; they get wise!)&lt;br/&gt;10 Female divided up as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Youth&lt;br/&gt;1 Teen&lt;br/&gt;3 Adults&lt;br/&gt;3 Middle Aged&lt;br/&gt;1 Old&lt;br/&gt;1 Wise (Because people don&amp;rsquo;t get very old &amp;hellip; they get wise!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
