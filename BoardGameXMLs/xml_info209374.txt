							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gholand Keep</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many years ago, the Duchy of Caravelle was plagued  by a clan of fire giants lead by a warlord called Gholand who wielded a magical trident of great size.  The weapon was said to shoot forth searing fire as hot as red dragon&amp;rsquo;s breath which earned it the name of Flamefork.  Two or three times each year, the giants would emerge from the jungle of Tanglewood to pillage and burn a handful of towns before retreating back with their stolen booty.  Many lives were lost in each of these raids for the giants were as eager to kill and burn as they were steal.  The duke tried vainly to protect his towns and his people, but the border of Tanglewood was long, and his military forces spread too thin to provide an adequate defense.  Several times, the duke&amp;rsquo;s militia attempted to follow after the giants as they returned to their jungle home, but the dangers of Tanglewood were too great, and the giants too cunning to allow such pursuit any chance of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For mid-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
