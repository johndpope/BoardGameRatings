							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City Sewers</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 48 x 30 inch Floor Plan of a City Sewers Section, it has Hex, Square and No Overlays, it also includes the VTT files for online play. The map suits Modern rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do it man! It was the rats! The rrraattss! They don&amp;rsquo;t like light, heat, and noise in their domain!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product includes a main city sewer with a bridge running across it that leads to a fork in the sewer as well as a cubbyhole room and an underground station (suitable for a underground power or gas lines). Printing additional sewer tiles can allow you to make a bigger sewer if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product is intended for use in modern games but could also be used in near science fiction games where the sewer lines haven&amp;rsquo;t seen upgrades in quite some time. Other possibilities include horror or post apocalyptic games where the heroes run to the sewers to try and escape the horrors above in the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The power or gas utility investigates a routine outage in the area. They find their control machines smashed in an obvious act of sabotage. The group is called in as detectives to investigate the crime scene and try and find the culprit. An odd blockade leads to a cubbyhole in the wall. A vagrant is asleep, using a wad of newspapers as a makeshift blanket. He awakens with a start when the group nears and runs towards a corner of the room. As the group questions him about the crime he starts tittering and becoming agitated and starts screaming (see above). He seems crazy and mentally disturbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some possibilities at this point are the man is simply an innocent homeless man who witnessed rats or ratmen attack the underground station. The group needs to go put a stop to whatever is controlling the rats. In a twist it could be the homeless man who has some sort of affinity for the rats allowing him to control them. Or perhaps the homeless man is in fact, a wererat, a lycanthrope who hates light and the sounds the machines make. As soon as the group turns their backs to leave, he transforms and attacks them from behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
