			<description>Kiddie Cards is described on the box as &amp;quot;Colorful, Educational, Entertaining Cards for Children. The 55-card deck has backs in five different colors (red, orange, yellow, blue and green), while the front of each card has an illustration of what the rules call &amp;quot;items which surround every child in his everyday life&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards are clearly aimed at what the rule card calls &amp;quot;small fry&amp;quot;, and are primarily educational and aimed at very young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game does not come with fixed rules, and suggests that children may wish to devise their own games. The one game suggested is to deal the cards equally to the players, and have each child discard in turn. The next child may not discard unless he or she identifies the image on that card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex G. Malloy (American Games: Comprehensive Collector's Guide; Krause 1999) dates this as circa 1970s, but the illustrations of household appliances and vehicles have more of a 1950s look to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
