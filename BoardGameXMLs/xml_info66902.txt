			<description>Atomik Lifepath is a random-roll supplement that expands the Champions-centric version of the Lifepath in version 4.4.3 of the core rules into a version that can be adapted to many more genres.  From the opening:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The idea of the Lifepath goes back to Cyberpunk&amp;trade;, the first and by far most popular cyberpunk RPG.  Its popularity was such that the Lifepath was retained through many of R.Talsorian's games.  Upon the advent of Fuzion, a joint venture between R.Talsorian and Hero Games, Lifepath was revitalized and has become a staple of new Fuzion powered games such as Bubblegum Crisis and Champions: the New Millennium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;However, the Lifepath system for these products has been custom tailored to its specific universe, and often unsuitable for players wishing to run a new, independent or home-brewed game.  And some Fuzion games, such as VOTOMS, simply lack the Lifepath altogether.  Other players and GMs have seen the need to expand upon the Lifepath, either making it more complete, dynamic, or better integrated with the character design process itself.  Atomik Lifepath strives to address these issues, and presents a suped-up Lifepath that may be tailored to suit a variety of games, and can be made as simple or as complex as the GM may desire.  The new system further integrates the Lifepath processes with character creation by directly relating life events to skills, talents, perks, and complications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
