							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Final Lesson</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hundreds of years prior to the present, six powerful and extremely intelligent educators gathered a group of 50 students (24 boys, 26 girls) from the lands that surrounded the educators&amp;rsquo; school embedded partially in one of the mountains. These students were to learn and be the best at fighting, magic, and in academics, but the students soon grew weary of the pressure and turned on their mentors. In that revolt, many students died and those that didn&amp;rsquo;t were left in a catatonic state. All six of the educators were never found, and little do the surrounding communities know that the six have returned for more students, but this time, the lessons learned could be deadly as the six have discovered a dark path to immortality. The return of the six has resulted in several strange deaths in the area and a general dark presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
