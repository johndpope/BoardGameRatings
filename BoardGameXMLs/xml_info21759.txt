							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Carlo Derby</name>
									
			<description>Carlo Derby is a depression era horse racing game.  It comes in an orange and white tube with all the components rolled up in an oil cloth track.  The game contains a layout cloth, race tickets, ticket punch, five horse and a mixer called the &amp;quot;carlo box&amp;quot;.  The carlo box contains 6 white marbles, 5 red, 4 blue, 3 green and 1 black.&lt;br/&gt;As the marbles are dispensed, the horses advance. There are three raised felt circles below the track that receive marbles when you push the carlo box down.  The track has a fast and a muddy (slow) lane for each horse.  For example, the black horse fast track has only one space, which means he finishes the race the first time his marble comes up (1/19).  The black horse muddy track has two spaces.  You can bet on horses to win, place or show, and the payoff odds are shown on the track.  For example, black pays 8.5 to 1 for a win on the fast track or 24 to one for a win on the slow track.&lt;br/&gt;The best part of this game is the quality of the molded glass horses.  The tickets are also very realistic looking.&lt;br/&gt;The designer and publication date are unknown.  However, the game is described as patent pending, and the company address is 268 First Street in San Francisco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;carlo box&amp;quot; could also be found (with the same marbles) in the game Lido&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
