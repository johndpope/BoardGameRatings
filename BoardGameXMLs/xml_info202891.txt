			<description>Above Top Secret is a turn-based strategic Card Game designed as a two player game or team play for 4+ players (which would require an extra copy of the base game). The game is suited for ages 12+. Depending on how many players are involved, the game will take approximately 60 - 100 minutes to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been recruited to take command of the Defense Systems for a Top Secret Military Base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many weapon systems at your disposal, including some that are classified Above Top Secret. These include prototype systems, which have been reverse engineered from recovered Extraterrestrial Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As your Security Clearance Level increases, you will gain access to ever more advanced technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But beware; there are Extraterrestrial forces monitoring the conflict closely. Your brilliant strategic plans may be upset by their direct interference when you least expect it..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Military Base consists of four main areas. Players must protect their Base using the Technology and Weaponry at their disposal, subject to their level of Security Clearance. Secret Technology, Alien Technology and, at times, direct Alien interference features heavily within the game and will play a part in the strategies you develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using your personal deck of Defense Cards, which you are able to configure depending on the way you play, you must seek to break through your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Defenses and destroy their four Base Areas, whilst ensuring that at least one of yours remains standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
