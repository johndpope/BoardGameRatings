							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Game of Dixie or Bonus 20</name>
									
			<description>The object of this card game is to get rid of the cards in your hand by matching either the same symbol (circle, cross, star, triangle, square) as the &amp;quot;Call Card&amp;quot; played by the dealer or the same number.  In addition, there are &amp;quot;Bonus 20&amp;quot; cards which may be used as a wild card for any symbol.  Points are awarded by the value of the cards left in one's hand when one player goes out.  The game is over after each player takes a turn as dealer.  The player with the fewest points scored against him or her is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
