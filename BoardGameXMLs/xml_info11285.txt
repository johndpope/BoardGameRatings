			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: BEACHCOMBER was created by two world sailors. After rounding Cape Hatteras in a 60' schooner, they found refuge from the storm in Silver Lake Harbor on Orcacoke Island. During their stay on Ocracoke they found the Outer Banks life-style so unique that they were inspired to capture that feeling, and the game of Beachcomber came to life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BASIC SUMMARY: This is a card game in the vein of Mille Bornes. One's goal is to collect the most shells (similar to mileage cards). The quantity of shells one can pick up is based on the mode of transportation (food, bike, 4x4), and there are various problems that can slow you down (soft sand, no reservation, hot sand). You must be on vacation to collect shells (similar to the Go card), and there are things that can frustrate the vacation (hotel bill, food bill, beach gear bill, and gas bill); bills can be addressed with money or &amp;quot;super solutions.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
