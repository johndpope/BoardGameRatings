			<description> User Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kings and Legends is an addictive and enjoyable massively multiplayer online browser collectible trading card game which combines the strategic gameplay experience of trading card games and social game experience of MMOG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carrying an immersive storyline, the game takes you through a series of battles, quests and Arena showdowns against other players. The experience gained guides you to higher levels, where new, more challenging opponents await you. You can also   equip your hero, form Guild alliances with others and even gather resources while offline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective deck-building is crucial. You can gradually have access to hundreds of creature or magic cards, each with their own unique artwork. Combine them skilfully to create a variety of decks to your personal liking or specifically suited to tactically overcome any scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
