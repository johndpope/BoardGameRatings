			<description>TOUR OF DUTY: VIETNAM is a Board Game of Combat during the Vietnam War (1965-1973) for one to four players. Players assume the role of American Soldiers or Marines during the Vietnam War by creating their own Player Soldier Characters. Player Soldiers are part of a Rifle Squad or Team serving in an Infantry or Special Forces Unit. Your Squad or Team will be assigned a variety of Missions that you must complete during your Tour of Duty. Missions include Reconnaissance, Intelligence Gathering, Ambushes, Raids, Search &amp;amp; Destroy, Hearts and Minds, Rescues and many others.&lt;br/&gt; GAME OBJECTIVE: The objective of TOUR OF DUTY: VIETNAM is to successfully complete a number of missions to locate and destroy enemy forces in order to gain Victory Points (VP) for the US Forces.

Once all Missions have been resolved (successfully or not) the Player totals his VP and compares this with the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OPTIONAL RULES: There are rules for playing as Australian SAS Soldiers and Rules, Counters and Cards for playing a French-Indochina War Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TOUR OF DUTY: VIETNAM Can be found at the following URL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.berserkergames.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.berserkergames.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
