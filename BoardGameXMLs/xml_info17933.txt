The aim is to reach the green squares in order to rescue his friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On landing on a green square with an exact throw of the dice a player may collect a &amp;quot;Robin Hood&amp;quot; card which reveals the friend or treasure that you have found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win the game you have to be the first player to visit the green Robin Hood squares, rescued all of your four friends, stolen some treasure, and returned to the start square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
