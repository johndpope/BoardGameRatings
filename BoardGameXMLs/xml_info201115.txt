							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Alien Slime</name>
									
			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the last human survivor aboard the research ship Taccia (Tay-she-er), in which a military experiment to breed self-producing alien killing machines has gone horribly wrong. The original giant catalyst alien has spawned hundreds of smaller killers which have massacred the crew and crippled the ship. You only have one path to freedom, an emergency shuttle which is only activated when the ship has been set to self-destruct. You must do this in order to escape and rid the galaxy of the mindless problem; the Taccia is rapidly drifting out of controlled space which drastically reduces your chances of being picked up, when and if you escape. So your arduous task is further hindered by a time limit. Fortunately, scattered around the huge starship are various useful items such as powerful weapons and energy screens. Learn the whereabouts of these items and use them to your advantage. GOOD LUCK!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
