			<description>Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golf so real you can feel the grass under your feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With all the golf games out there, we could have left well enough alone. But with nothing legendary in sight, we rose to the challenge and created Mean 18 - the most true to life golf simulation game ever. You'll never settle for par again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No other golf game delivers the realism and playability of Mean 18. This is golf as it should be, with lifelike animation patterned after the pros and numerous strategy options. You'll sharpen your golf skills and maybe even your real-life game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You approach the first tee and take the screen: a crisp blue sky and a fairway of manicured green stretching forever. But don't be fooled by the breathtaking scenery. The first hole is a 427 yard par 4, and there's plenty of rough and water between you and the pin. Your gut jumps and the adrenaline flows. You know that feeling, and Mean 18 gives it to you again and again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decisions that lie before you: Will you stick with your home course or opt for one of the legendary courses - St. Andrews, Pebble Beach? Will you use the pro or regulation tee? Do you want to play expert mode or rely on a caddy to suggest your clubs? Will it be medal or match play? Are you going to hit a bucket of balls or use the practice green before you tee off?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you've mastered the Mean 18 courses, you can design your own with The Course Architect. And for those players with the ten all-time best scores, there's a permanent place in the Mean 18 Hall of Fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For one to four players. Mean 18 is the most realistic golf simulation ever, right down to the yardage markers showing distance to the pin. But don't let the flowers and scenery fool you. It's a tough course to walk, let alone play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You get all the elements of play, including the mechanics of a perfect stroke. Choose the right club, then swing through. Feel the smooth, deliberate backswing and compact follow through. But it's up to you to develop a rhythm and avoid that shank or a hook in to the rough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the famous courses already provided, you can design your own with the Course Architect. Do you want menacing bunkers? Finishing holes right on the ocean? A treacherous creek? Design a course for a relaxing round of golf or one that tests your limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
