			<description>It is the near future, and a new type of psychic power has emerged. Although the people initially viewed these powers with fear, a large conglomerate known as the Sumeragi Group has brought peace and order to the world by taking it upon themselves to supervise the psychics who possess these powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it is a peace that has come at the cost of the psychics subjugated by the Sumeragi. For what the Sumeragi describes as a shelter for psychics is, in fact, a concentration camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cruel experiments are conducted daily on the psychics held prisoner there. For a long time, the Sumeragi Group has kept the goals of its experiments a secret. But now, a group that has learned of Sumeragi's intentions has risen up against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their name is QUILL. They are an armed resistance force and subdivision of a foreign human rights organization dedicated to protecting psychics. Gunvolt, the hero of this story, is also a member of QUILL. The story begins when QUILL orders him to assassinate Lumen, a virtual pop star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
