							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lorien Trust Security Handbook</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This document&lt;br/&gt;Is organised into four sections, designed to give information at various levels. The first section is a broad overview and for general release to all members of staff, players and for general distribution to the public via the website. The second section deals with staff issues and is to be distributed to LT staff to provide further information on the department. The third and fourth sections deal with the mechanics of department operation and are aimed at members of the security team itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of this information is &amp;quot;closed&amp;quot; and anyone may view it if they wish, but it may have limited interest or relevance to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
