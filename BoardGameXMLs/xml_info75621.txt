			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hollywood Hijinx is an interactive fiction computer game written by &amp;quot;Hollywood&amp;quot; Dave Anderson and Liz Cyr-Jones and published by Infocom in 1986. Implemented using Infocom's Z-Machine, the game was released over a wide variety of platforms, including the Apple II, Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64. It is Infocom's twenty-third game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buddy Burbank was a genuine Hollywood success story. Not content to be a B-movie actor, he fought his way to the top, started his own studio and became one of Tinseltown's most acclaimed and prolific directors! Well, at least that's how Uncle Buddy would have told it. Actually, he married wealthy former debutante Hildegarde Montague, whose trust fund enabled Buddy to open a studio. His movies earned a lot of money but very little critical regard... but he did manage to crank out more than 600 &amp;quot;masterpieces&amp;quot; before dying of a heart attack several years ago. Who can forget such classics as Attack of the Killer Rutabagas, It Came from the Neighbor's House, or Meltdown on Elm Street? Now dear Aunt Hildy has passed on as well, and the player's character learns the terms of their rather unusual will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the favorite among all of Buddy and Hildy's nephews and nieces, the player's character stands to inherit the entirety of the Burbank estate, including their palatial home Hildebud. But only if the player can find the ten treasures (props from Buddy's films) that crafty Aunt Hildegarde has hidden on the grounds, that is. Oh, and it all has to be done in the space of one night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hildebud is filled with props, posters, and other memorabilia from Buddy's numerous films: a model of Tokyo complete with Atomic Chihuahua, the Maltese Finch, and a statue of &amp;quot;Buck Palace, the Fighting Mailman&amp;quot; (star of such films as Postage Due and Special Delivery). Adding to the atmosphere are hidden passages, a convoluted hedge maze, and other bizarre features of the estate. Those strange noises that sound like someone else is in the house&amp;mdash; are they just gimmicks too?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
