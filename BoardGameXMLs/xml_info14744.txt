			<description>Vem vet vad is a Swedish word game. Each turn, a card is turned up to reveal a category (a capital, a farm animal, etc). Then a wooden roulette-like spinner is rotated to select a letter. Whoever first comes up with a word starting with the selected letter that fits the category gets the card. The person who collects the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My copy contains 29 cards, but I suspect that a few are missing. The space in the box will allow a few more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no indication as to when the game was published, but I would guess and 1930-1950. No publisher is given either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
