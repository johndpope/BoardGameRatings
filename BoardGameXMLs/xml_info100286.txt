			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greatwood Ranger is a new Hero for you to use in the Chronicles of Arax solo adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Age of Golden Dreams, man, dwarf and elf lived unopposed upon Arax. Civilization flourished, with great cities and fortresses being built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the Greatwood, the elves built magnificent crystal towers to live in. This towers helped focus the magical energy known as mana and aided the elves in their spell casting. In order to gain this crystal the elves had to travel the world in search for it. Thus were born the Greatwood Rangers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rangers journeyed far and wide, looking for sources of the crystal that they could either claim for themselves or trade for from the other peoples of Arax. In this way they learned much about the world and its people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then the Age of Golden Dreams ended, and the Age of Darkness and Nightmares began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greatwood was invaded by orcs from the north and undead from the south. The Rangers were called home and, instead of traveling the world, were now tasked with defending the borders of the Greatwood. Slowly but surely the forest was defiled, and its borders pushed ever inwards, though if not for the Rangers the forest home of the elves would probably have already been wiped out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this day the Greatwood Rangers still protect the home of the elves, though some have left the woodlands in order to journey the world once more in search of something - anything - that will help them push back the inevitable tide of darkness that threatens to engulf them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
