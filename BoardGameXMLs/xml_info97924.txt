							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Lost Duchy of Gaeleth</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a peaceful and prosperous land, the Duchy of Gaeleth fell under a terrible curse when they dared to challenged the will of the Witch‐King. Legend says that the Duke&amp;rsquo;s daughter was demanded as a bride. When the Duke refused the first envoy of the Witch‐King, the nearby waters became infested with sea dragons. After refusing the second envoy, a deadly plague spread throughout the duchy. For his final refusal, the third envoy beheaded the Duke and placed the lordly skull atop its own tower. It is said the waters ran red for a week after this final insult and the envoy still collected the princess adding her to the Witch‐King&amp;rsquo;s harem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lands now run wild, few humans remain within its borders and those that do are members of a strange cult whose patriarch claimed he could protect them from the plagues set upon the land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
