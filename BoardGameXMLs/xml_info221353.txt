							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Trumpeter of the Dark Woods</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beware the shadowed woods,&lt;br/&gt;where satyrs play and frolic-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though they offer you fine goods,&lt;br/&gt;or a cure for baby&amp;rsquo;s colic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For their trumpeters oft play,&lt;br/&gt;such a melancholy tune-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last you&amp;rsquo;ll ever hear,&lt;br/&gt;it leads you to your doom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;-From a Peasant's Song&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the largest Satyr revels, those sponsored by the foul fey monarchs like those of air, or darkness, the trumpeters of the dark woods appear. Bloated, floating creatures of odd comportment, their ability to blow upon a horn  is nonetheless quite incredible. Either levelling a swathe of threats to the revels with one blast on their massive trumpets or inspiring deep dread with another tune. Indeed, their instruments are so large that some trumpeters even wade into melee, wielding the weapon like a greatclub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While they do float slowly along, the trumpeter&amp;rsquo;s ability to move into one shadow and exit another allow them to skirmish quite unpredictably alongside a battle party of satyrs or other fey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
