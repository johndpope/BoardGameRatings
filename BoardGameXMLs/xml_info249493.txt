			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dog Bear?!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOG BEAR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future, or possibly in the past, or maybe right now, we're not entirely sure, the nationless soldiers of non-government entities engage in the covert wars that have defined our future while we use the power of memes to infiltrate the highest levels of something, we're also again, not entirely sure. You are those soldiers, sitting down after a mission, playing poker, and explaining how the mess of a mission somehow resolved itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed to evoke the ridiculous plots of tropey, melodramatic modern military stealth and covert operation games, DOG BEAR is a game where you get a code name and a handful of quirks and play out a single session of lighthearted roleplay while trying to save, kill, trade or negotiate with enemies like Eco-Terrorists and Bitcoin Thieves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stay Ready, Soldier - and don't forget your CQC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DOG BEAR is a super-lightweight tabletop RPG designed for single-session games where the storyteller doesn't need to do any planning ahead of time, nobody needs to keep track of their character sheets, and nobody needs any specialty dice. To get started in DOG BEAR you just need this rulebook, and a deck of 52 conventional playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want a game that can show people how roleplaying works without needing them to embrace a deep system of rules or get acquainted with a whole set of systems, then DOG BEAR is for you. If you want something lightweight to play with your funny friends after a bigger, more intense game, DOG BEAR is for you! If you want to play with character creation full of deliberately ridiculous over-the-top character quirks, boy howdy is DOG BEAR for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
