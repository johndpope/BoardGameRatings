			<description>Swedish trivia game about animals (The Fantastic World of Animals). On their turn, players choose their own task for that turn by playing a card from their hand. The categories are charade, picture quiz or one of five different categories of questions, e.g. &amp;ldquo;Animals in the air&amp;rdquo;. There are also wild cards. If the player succeeds in her task, she discards her task card. The first player to loose all her cards is the winner. When playing a charade card, the player has one minute to perform the charade. If another player makes the correct guess, then that player may discard any one card from her hand. The player performing the charade may also discard a card because the charade was a success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8 years and up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
