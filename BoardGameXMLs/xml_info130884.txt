							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Gazala Gallop</name>
									
			<description>The Gazala Gallop - Basic Game, which is the active one - uses the popular 1st Alamein/Battles for Alamein game system.  It is regiment to division unit level, 5mis/8kms per hex, and has 14 2-day gameturns.  (The Advanced Game is still there for its map, for anyone curious.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Afrika Korps has superior speed/maneuverability, while the British 8th Army's 2nd and 22nd Armoured Brigades (which had the notoriously unreliable Crusader tanks) are subject to the British Breakdown Rule.  The American Lend-Lease Grant medium tanks are the backbone of the most powerful British unit, 7th Armoured Brigade, while Valentine and slow, plodding Matilda British infantry tanks are in the 1st and 32nd Tank Brigades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Airpower is abstractly modeled, as in Battles for Alamein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Allies have the option of a nonhistorical deployment, but are penalized in victory points for utilizing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As historically, Allied units are slow to activate/respond, so the Axis Player must hit fast and hard to flank and/or penetrate the Allies' Gazala Line and finally take fortress Tobruk, to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are provided - subject to revision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12Nov12:  I've broken the German recce grppe down into the 3 divisional recce bns - three 1-1*-5s instead of just the one 2-2*-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And KG Hecker is now a 2-2-4 ... although maybe that should have just been a 1-2-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
