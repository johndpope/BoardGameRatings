							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jagten p√• Skt Cluberts Horn</name>
									
			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clubert disappeared in the desert, his horn was lost. And with the horn, the hope of victory for the crusaders of the Hierophant in the land of the half moon also disappeared. The horn no longer blew assembly, its sound no longer elicits a shiver of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four hundred years later, the Hierofant's seat is empty. The Emperor of Montaigne has murdered the head of the Church with witchcraft, and sent his army to the holiest city of the Church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An army has washed over the Castilian border, and soon the wizard of the Witches will crush the Vatican Church. The time has come for new martyrs to fight the cause of the Church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the forbidden archives in the cellars of the Hierophant's palace, a young woman in the Inquisition's service has researched the truths among the oldest myths, read in forgotten incunables and manuscripts - and found a decisive trace. The key to retrieving Clubert's Horn is now in her hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
