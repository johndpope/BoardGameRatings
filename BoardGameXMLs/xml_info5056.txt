			<description>Strategic level game covering the battle for North Africa during WWII. The key feature of this game is its operation points which represent supply. These points are expended when units move or fight and also just to maintain a unit's existence. They're moved from the ports to the forward battle area and require record keeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game's supply system portrays the situation that existed. Even if you're just digging in and awaiting an attack, you still need supplies flowing to your troops to feed (and water) them. Also, because all units must be able to trace supply to exist, players are rewarded well when successfully able to cut off enemy units from their rear areas. You can even capture enemy supply depots that are located too close to the front.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be linked with the game La Regia Marina, also published by Simulations Canada. When playing this way, the available number of operations points is based on how well you manage your fleets and convoys in La Regia Marina rather than the fixed supply schedule that comes with D.A.K.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One full map is divided into Eastern map and Western map.  The whole map covers from Damascus to Casabranca.  This is one of the widest map of this theatre, I think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
