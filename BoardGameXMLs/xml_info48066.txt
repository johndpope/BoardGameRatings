			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Seven Shrines of Nav'k-Qar is a 1E module designed for 6-8 adventurers of levels 8-12. Nav'k-Qar! A name lost to antiquities and feared only by scholars who know of the dread toad god's former power... once surrounded by a cult which performed the most vile and evil acts in his honor. Now that all of his followers are long dead and the temples of the Gray One completely destroyed, the final resting place of the cult's last riches has been a source of speculation for generations. At long last, one scholar discovered the location of that elusive shrine, the greatest one of all... the fabled Seven Shrines! Do you have the strength, knowledge and skill to penetrate the horrors of that dread place and wrest the vast treasure from the jaws of the Gray One himself?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
