			<description>(From the back of the book)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through their cleverness and guile, the ancient Rinaldi made themselves the unquestioned rulers of Calabria. Their city of Triskellan became a haven of culture, technology, and commerce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But all things change with time. Generations of misrule and neglect have reduced the once-proud bloodline to fops and schemers. Now the Guild Masters rule the city, playing each Noble House off one another for their own advantage. But the title of nobility still carries certain privileges...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(From the Title Page)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's Changed in This Edition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a reprint of Rinaldi, the first supplement for Ironclaw. The attached materials have been updated to match the latest version of the core rules. The material has been condensed to fit in this new format. Two sections were removed: the calendar (because that is included in the latest Ironclaw) and &amp;quot;The Closing of the City Gates&amp;quot; (which was expanded and presented, again, in Ironclaw). All other material is here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
