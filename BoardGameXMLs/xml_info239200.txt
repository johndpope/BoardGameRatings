			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The war between Earth and Mars raged for years and was devastating to both planets, although it never did reach a decisive conclusion. Tensions run high and each side still wishes to defeat the other, but neither side has been willing to commit more military forces to the conflict without possessing a clear advantage.  It was for this reason that the Martians entered into an uneasy truce with Earth several years ago. Under the truce, neither side may execute a citizen of the other, lest war be unleashed anew. Instead, prisoners are interred in camps maintained by enemy forces.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs find themselves in one such internment camp, subject to the nefarious machinations and undisclosed technology of its Martian masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PENAL REFORM is a DayTrippers Adventure from the GOLDEN AGE ADVENTURES anthology.  If you have that book, you don't need this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DayTrippers uses a descriptive scale which can easily be converted to other game systems.  Conversions are included for 2-12, 1-20, PbtA and percentage-based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
