							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ski Sprung Spiel</name>
									
			<description>The Ski Sprung Spiel (in English: Skijump Game) is trying to simulate a ski jump competition. After team selection each player will roll dice for selecting the highest position on the jump tower. Therefore all seven dice are rolled. After each roll at least one die has to be set aside face up. When all dice have been allocated the jumper is placed on the tower according to the rolled total result which is equivalent to a certain jump distance in meters. After all players are set up one player puts one of his jumpers for the jump. Then card play takes over. The effect of cards is to add or subtract jumping length from the a fore determined jumping length (the dice roll) or to move the jumper left and right on the hill simulating wind. Other players play cards for this jumper which are countered by the jumping player. This goes in turn i.e. player A plays card jumping player plays card, player B plays card jumping player plays card and so on until each non-jumping player had the chance to play a card. If the jumper is moved too much to the left or right or too long or too short of the board it is counted as a fall. Finally the jumping player plays a card for the landing again adding or subtracting metres. The final result will be noted down. The player which ski jumper has the farthest jump wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
