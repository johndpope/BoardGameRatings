			<description>The Emperor is dead. Dragon Empire stands on the brink of destruction as four evil forces try to conquer the last place standing: the capitol &amp;mdash; but then another threat looms, an alien invasion force that just wants to devour our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World Eaters gives players the chance to play as four main evils (Orcs, Demons, Undead, Cold ones) and to conquer as much terrain as they can by rolling dice, recruiting armies, then sending them to fight by collecting dice pools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As much as evil will act brutally - that much Burn they collect and that much retaliation from Empire they will get. On Map 9x9 there will be cities to attack and either plunder them or conquer to gain resources bringing players closer to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn each player will throw dice depending on their logistic power to bring more troops, send them for quest, prepare the attack, build forts or sending spies to see the defense on city they wish to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
