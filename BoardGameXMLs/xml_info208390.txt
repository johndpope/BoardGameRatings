			<description>A Pain in the Mountains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for characters in their second or third careers. Due to the high combat element of the adventure, the party should ideally have 15-20 careers between them, and include some magical ability, at least a Journeyman Wizard or Anointed Priest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironstone Pass is a short incident that can be run at any time when your players are travelling through a mountainous region, as a stand-alone encounter whenever you need to spice up a mountain crossing. This adventure is nominally set in the Vaults, however it can easily be set elsewhere, just change the place names to something more suitable. And remember that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be the height of winter when they make the crossing &amp;ndash; bad weather comes earlier, hits harder, and stays longer in the mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally printed in White Dwarf (Issue 132 - Dec 1990), and was later re-printed in the Hogshead Publishing supplement Apocrypha 2: Chart of Darkness, where it was updated by Iain Smedley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
