			<description>A Berlin city version of &amp;quot;Ausgerechnet Buxtehude,&amp;quot; which is, itself, a 2-dimensional geographical variant of Urs Hostettler classics like &amp;quot;Ein Solches Ding/Such a Thing&amp;quot; and &amp;bdquo;Anno Domini.&amp;quot;  Players take turns placing a location card somewhere on the N-S-E-W grid in relation to previously placed cards.  After each card is placed, a player may doubt its position in relation to another card.  If she is correct in doubting, she gains a chip from the player who placed the card.  If she is incorrect, she must give the other player a one of her chips.  There is also an intermediate scoring round when players must guess at how many total cards in the layout are placed correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in all the other similar games, knowledge is helpful, but good bluffing can sometimes make up for a lack of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
