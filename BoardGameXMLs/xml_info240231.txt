							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lotus</name>
									
			<description>Lotus is a Go-like game where captured pieces swap colors. The goal is to claim the most territory -- pieces and any empty points they surround. It's played on the 72 intersections flower-shaped board, just like the better known, Kensington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of placing a piece on his turn, a player can pull the point track marker one step in his direction. This score is added to the territory count at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
