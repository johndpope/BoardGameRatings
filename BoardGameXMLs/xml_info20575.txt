			<description>Chicago is an auction game. It takes place from 1871 until about 1910, an exciting time of change when America was transformed from an agrarian to an industrial economy. You and your fellow players have come to seek fortune and glory in rebuilding Chicago. You will strive to become giants of industry and commerce. You will help settle immigrants who will work for your businesses. You will use your profits to engage in philanthropy to create cultural landmarks in a contest to see who will become the grandest person in Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
