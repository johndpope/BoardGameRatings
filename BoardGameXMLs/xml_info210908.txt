			<description>What do you call a 10 minute, real time, cooperative, pick up and deliver, puzzle game?&lt;br/&gt;Answer: &amp;quot;It&amp;rsquo;s a Train Wreck!&amp;quot; version 2 (2017)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two to six players work together to deliver as many goods as possible before the end of 10 minutes. Color of cubes indicate the destination city. During setup and before the clock is started the cargo dice are scrambled and arranged in a row across the top of the city boards. The player controlling that city can see all the cubes that must be delivered but can only pull from the right or left end of the cube row when loading them on the trains. There are no turns. Once the clock is started all players take their actions simultaneously, in any order, and repeating any action as often as necessary. To transport the cargo, a cube must first be loaded onto a short or long train piece that is at rest in the player&amp;rsquo;s home city train yard. No train can move without a crew peg, and no crew peg may travel beyond the adjacent city. In order to transport cargo to more distant cities a train will need to first stop and have the crew peg swapped or cargo exchanged between trains. While all this is going on players must avoid dropping or spilling cubes when picking up or handing the train to another player. Expansion components include tunnels and bridges to be placed between cities and present additional obstacles to negotiate. When time runs out calculate the score by multiplying the TWO LOWEST counts of cubes delivered to a city. Points are subtracted for dropped cubes, or cubes delivered to the wrong city and also for crew pegs that traveled beyond their adjacent cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With six players each takes one of the six main cities, each producing goods which are delivered to the other five locations.&lt;br/&gt;Note in some scenarios with fewer total players, each player may actually control multiple cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components that make up one player&amp;rsquo;s city are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;One city board with train yard spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Adjacent city color arrow indicator - used to store neighbor's crew pegs not assigned to a train&lt;br/&gt;One short train (unloaded) (the TTR-1aB)&lt;br/&gt;One large train (unloaded) (the BFT-9000)&lt;br/&gt;Three crew pegs of matching color &lt;br/&gt;20 cargo cubes (4 each of the colors for the other 5 cities)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tunnels and Bridges Expansion (sold separately)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
