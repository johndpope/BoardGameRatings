							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Psychiatrist the Game</name>
									
			<description>Psychiatrist the Game is a hilarious new spin on charades! With dramatic scenarios, outrageous personalities, hysterical actions and clever wordplay, Psychiatrist the Game is perfect for families, friends, and anyone in-between! The Psychiatrist must gather as much information as possible from his or her patients in order to diagnose their crazy symptoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psychiatrist the Game is both easy and fun, allowing anyone to play &amp;amp; enjoy it for hours on end! The game starts when the group chooses a Psychiatrist. He or she must then leave the room while the group draws a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card will list 2 symptoms - as a group, choose the symptom you'd like to play, and call the Psychiatrist back in. Remember, everyone in the group has the same symptom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Psychiatrist then asks the group different questions - these questions can be as generic or as detailed as you'd like! Whoever is being asked the question must then respond by blending in the symptom they chose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the Psychiatrist catches on, he or she can diagnose the symptom! If the Psychiatrist guesses the symptom correctly, the round is over, and a new Psychiatrist is chosen to leave the room!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
