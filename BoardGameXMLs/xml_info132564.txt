			<description>Out-golf up to 71 simultaneous opponents in this riveting game of strategy and luck. Choose between 9 and 18 holes to make the game longer or shorter (about 1-2 hours of play time). Each of the 18 holes is represented by a unique, hand-drawn map of the area, which is divided into small segments to help players gauge the approximate distance from the tee-off point to the green. Players use different colors of golf ball pawns to track their progress across each map. Just as with actual golf, players will attempt to complete the game in the fewest number of &amp;quot;strokes&amp;quot; possible. For each stroke, a player will first decide whether or not they wish to spin for a &amp;quot;distance bonus&amp;quot;--a free number of segments they are allowed to move their pawn toward the hole. This can be advantageous, but a bad spin also has the potential to land the player in a dangerous sand trap or water hazard (both of which carry a stroke penalty), so the decision should not be made lightly. After resolving or skipping this spin, the player then decides how many dice to throw, from 1 to 3, attempting to land as close to the green as possible. Each pip on the dice represents the player's ball moving forward 1 segment; therefore, if too many or too few dice are thrown, players can easily fall short of, or overshoot, their goal. Once a player lands on the green, they attempt to putt their way into the hole, which involves slightly different dice-rolling mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player is also given a number of Skill Cards which can be spent in various ways:&lt;br/&gt;1. A Skill Card can be discarded before a roll to add an extra die. This is helpful for players who wish to have a longer drive, thereby increasing their chances of avoiding a large number of hazards or traps near the center of a map.&lt;br/&gt;2. If a player does land in a hazard or trap, he or she may discard a Skill Card to ignore the stroke penalty of that hazard or trap.&lt;br/&gt;3. A Skill Card may be used to change one die result on a player's putting roll, thereby refining the putting accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;4. Finally, any unspent Skill Cards can be used at the end of the game to subtract a stroke from one's own score, or to add a stroke to an opponent's score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also includes a solo variant in which the player attempts to finish all 18 holes in under 72 strokes. This goal is then adjusted according to the player's level of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
