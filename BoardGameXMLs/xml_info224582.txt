							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Punch Buggy</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Al's a big time hero. Totally big time. After that explosion at the cake shop he worked at he was flung into another universe. He's an even bigger hero there. True story. He sided with the local rebellion against their awful military regime, was bonded to this sweet alien suit, rescued a hot princess, and trashed the aliens' Warp Gate technology so they could never threaten Earth again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But now Al's back on Earth and, let's be honest, &amp;quot;Great Al the Hero&amp;quot; isn't going to cut it as a hero name. So he made some changes to his suit and came up with a catchy name. PUNCH BUGGY! His awesome, unpredictable punching power is sure to frighten all the bad guys. But you knew this already, right, because your heroes have all been auditioning to be his sidekick. He'll be announcing who won on tonight's evening news. Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
