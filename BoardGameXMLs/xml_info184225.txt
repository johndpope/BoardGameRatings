			<description>From the game intro..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a role-playing game about a home. In this home lives a family, or a succession of families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll draw the home and watch as it changes with the family over the years. You will need a good-sized sheet of paper to draw on, pencils, and something on which to record characters (index cards are good).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big pile of 10- sided dice is helpful but not necessary. You'll also need to print and cut out the game cards, or transcribe them onto something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional user summary...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players establish a setting (real or fantastic), an era, the kind of family unit that lives in the house, along with the house's architecture and location. Then Flavour Cards are chosen that tweak the session's theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players then take turns drawing in rooms of the house and give them a purpose, vibe, view, etc. Each player then creates a member of the family that initially inhabits the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As play commences players take turns narrating scenes of life in the house. Each scene takes place in a particular room, which includes a description of how the room has now changed in some way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Families members age and eventually (perhaps) the original family moves away and the house gets a new family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends by player agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
