							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Might Makes Right: Muscle Marines in Space</name>
									
			<description>Publisher summary'&lt;br/&gt;You are Muscle Marines, charged with keeping the universe awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge Comments&lt;br/&gt;Finally a game for the middle of the Nerd/Jock Venn Diagram. An RPG where everyone is musclebound and everything is resolved through feats of strength. Not only a funny and novel way to resolve conflict but one where player interaction is heightened through the fact that you are all trying to work (out) together. Hits all the great notes for a micro RPG: Creativity, simplicity, but still recognizably a role playing game. - Jef and Jon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
