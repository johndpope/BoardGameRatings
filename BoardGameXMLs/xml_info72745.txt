							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">John Hancock Lifeline Game</name>
									
			<description>LIFELINE is the challenging and educational game about Life Insurance. In this game each player plays the role of head of family (father) and the goal of the game is to obtain insurance coverage in relationship to his income and responsibilities. The player who obtains these goals first is declared the winner. LIFELINE may be enjoyed by two to four players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- from the back of the game box (which also contains the complete rules for the game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This appears to have been a promotional game used by the John Hancock insurance company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quoting the rules, again:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Once a player has acquired a house, a wife, and 2 children, and has purchased all necessary insurance, he continues to move around the board until he reaches the Finish space, and then he is declared the winner.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Never have I heard a more ominous formula for victory as, presumably, at that point our poor victor has collected on his life insurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
