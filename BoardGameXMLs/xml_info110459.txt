							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dinosaurier Quiz-Spiel</name>
									
			<description>Dinosaurs themed quiz-game.&lt;br/&gt;32 cards show 2 questions with three answers each, the back side shows information and illustration on the subject. Players have question cards and betting cards, the starting player chooses a card and the candidate on his left tries to answer the first question - if he is right, the second is asked. In case of two correct answers the candidate receives the card and puts it with his betting cards. If the first answer is wrong, the left neighbour of the candidate can take over by betting one of his betting cards - if he answers wrong he loses the card. At the end the player with the most cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
