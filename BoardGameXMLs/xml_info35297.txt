			<description>Storm Trooper is a solo card game where you control a squad of 9 German storm troopers crossing a section of the Western front eliminating all enemies encountered in the trench-covered, debris strewn landscape of  World War I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 card decks that you must make:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     A terrain deck of 50 cards to create the 5 row, 10 column  &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; that you must cross to eliminate all enemies. Terrain cards have a defensive modifier and show start positions of enemy units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An enemy deck of 20 cards, representing units of 1 to 16 men. Eliminate all enemies to win the game.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A storm trooper deck of 45 cards that modify your squad's combat, defense, or movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all Warp Spawn games, every card has a historically inspired title to draw you into the theme of the game and serves as a good description of its function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Believe me, when you've got an enemy &amp;quot;Platoon&amp;quot; ahead of you, you don't want to be drawing &amp;quot;Wire Cutters&amp;quot;!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your squad is represented by a single pawn or token. You may begin at the foot of any column with a hand of 4 storm trooper cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, after you draw 1 card, your squad advances to any adjacent space and if in range of an enemy first they attack and then you have an opportunity to attack them. Enemies range in strength of 1 to 16 men. Pennies, tokens, or scrap paper should be used to keep track of men. Some battles may last over several turns or you may want to leave some battles unfinished until you get the cards and the confidence to return to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the game with 2 players (or more), field two squads of storm troopers playing cooperatively, but competing to be the first to capture an enemy HQ space (say, one of the &amp;quot;blockhouse&amp;quot; cards) agreed upon by the players before beginning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
