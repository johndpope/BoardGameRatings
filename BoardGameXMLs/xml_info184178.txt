							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mercenary Companies</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict has been a feature of Shaintar for as long as anyone can remember. Kingdoms have waged war with the forces of flame and darkness, and when there's a lull then inevitably one nation starts a war with another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where there's war, there will be mercenaries. In Shaintar the most storied mercenary companies are famous across the realm, their names linked to countless battles. The Shadow Falcons, the Riders of the Light, the Warmakers and many more.&lt;br/&gt;In this book we outline the main mercenary companies, their command structure, their individual styles of combat, and where you're most likely to find them being active. We even offer a few edges... perhaps one of your Shaintar heroes has spent some time among the mercenaries and learned a thing or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Lantern Reports are short books giving an overview of an organization or group with great influence on heroes' lives. Rather than being packed with many new rules, they are designed to add flavor to your games, to act as a launch pad from which to create interesting encounters and side-plots to your own epic campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
