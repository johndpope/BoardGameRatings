			<description>From the Publisher Website&lt;br/&gt;It was the summer of 1940. The Germans had already marched across France in a spectacular victory. Now both sides faced each other, with only the English Channel between them. The British Army had been rescued by the miracle at Dunkirk but, as a result of leaving much of its equipment in France, was a poorly equipped, broken force; backed up by untried British Reserves along with some under trained Canadian and Anzac units. The Germans facing them were the juggernaut that had won stunning victory after victory, were full of confidence, but with little experience crossing water. &amp;quot;What if&amp;quot; the RAF had been beaten in the Battle of Britain and events had transpired to create conditions where Hitler might have launched Operation Sealion - the invasion of Great Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the previous 17 titles in this award-winning series have focused on historical campaigns that were planned and executed across Europe &amp;amp; Africa - this is the first venture into a purely &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; campaign. With that said, the core game is based solidly on historical plans that the Germans had in place under consideration of execution. Additionally the OOB&amp;rsquo;s are based on the actual forces available to the combatants at the time. This is alternative history at its best!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sealion &amp;lsquo;40 features the familiar Panzer Campaigns interface and game scale: one hex represents 1 kilometer and each turn is 2 hours. The main campaign takes place on a 340 x 180 hex map of the south-eastern English coast line, from Ipswich in the north to Weymouth in the south. Hundreds of English hamlets will be the scene of house-to-house fighting as the British people defend their homeland from the invaders.&lt;br/&gt; Sealion &amp;lsquo;40 also features several scenarios specially optimized for Human vs. Human play and others specifically for play against the computer AI. A total of 25 scenarios are included ranging from small 10 turns actions covering a snapshot of the action to the monster 378 full campaign game. The September Sealion CG is based on historical German plans while the July CG with Strategy Operations is less historical but makes for a great play with a lot of variations in the CG and with that replayablity. Gamers can use Normal (AI) play, play by e-mail (PBEM), LAN &amp;amp; Internet &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; play, and two-player hotseat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
