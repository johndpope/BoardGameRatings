			<description>&amp;quot;Broken Age is an upcoming point-and-click adventure game and is Tim Schafer's first in the genre since 1998's Grim Fandango. The game is to be produced and distributed by Schafer's Double Fine Productions for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Age began under the working title Double Fine Adventure (internal codename &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot;) as a Kickstarter crowd funded project promoted by Double Fine and 2 Player Productions in February 2012. Originally set at a modest $400,000 to cover the costs of development and documentary filming, it became the largest crowd-funded video game project at the time, bringing in more than $3.45 million from over 87,000 backers within the month. It remains one of the highest-backed crowd funded projects of any type, and its success helped to establish Kickstarter and other crowd funding mechanisms as a viable alternative to venture capital and publisher funding for niche video game titles. The game's development is being chronicled by an episodic series of documentaries produced by 2 Player Productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broken Age is a point-and-click adventure game based on two characters, a young boy and girl, each 'seeking to break the tradition with their lives'. The player will switch between the two characters, the boy living alone on a spacecraft, while the girl wants to avoid being sacrificed to a monster by her village.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Broken Age&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
