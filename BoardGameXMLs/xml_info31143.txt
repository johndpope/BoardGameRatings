							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Michael Bully Herbig Spiel: Trilogie</name>
									
			<description>This game offers at least for the fan of the Munich comedian genuine cult potential. In funny small dialog , which originate partially from the feather/spring from Bully Herbig, a search term is replaced in the text by the word &amp;ldquo;Bully&amp;rdquo;. While a player reads out the texts, the others must try to guess the term. This guessing takes place into four steps, trying to encircle the term a bit in each round. Amazing what (wrong) associations some first references may lead to.&lt;br/&gt;While this first part of the game is strictly played in sequence, as soon as someone says the correct answer the game changes into chaotic action.&lt;br/&gt;The so-called riddle master must try to catch with a cup the figures of the others, which stand in the center of the game board. They try to pull fast enough the cord and thus theirs figures of the board, otherwise point loss.&lt;br/&gt;This odd mixture of knowledge and dexterity, has even something from the parodic humor of the Bully films.&lt;br/&gt;Two long-proved mechanisms are connected here in new and unusual way to an entertaining game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
