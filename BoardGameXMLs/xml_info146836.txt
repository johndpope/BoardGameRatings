			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Thornguard, the capital city of Peakvale and the most vibrant city in the three kingdoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is a little different to past solos because you have free reign over what you want to do in the city. There is no overarching quest; the adventure is what you make of it. You could become a city guard and hunt down criminals, or perhaps you would prefer a life of crime yourself and join the Thieves Guild. You may take up a career as a merchant, an adventurer or even a holy initiate, devoting your life to the Red Sun. Illegal actions may land you in prison, or even worse...on the business end of a noose. You can choose to buy property, from a small peasant house to a grand castle. Thornguard is your oyster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Limitless play from randomly generated quests&lt;br/&gt;     Get a job or join a guild&lt;br/&gt;     Buy a castle!&lt;br/&gt;     Be a straight and narrow citizen, or a crooked criminal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
