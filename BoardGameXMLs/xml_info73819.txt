			<description>&amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring is a 2003 real-time strategy game (RTS) developed by Liquid Entertainment, the makers of the previous Battle Realms and its expansion, Winter of the Wolf, and published by Sierra Entertainment. Set in J. R. R. Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s fictional Middle-earth, it expands upon the events of the War of the Ring as told in his fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the later RTS The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth by Electronic Arts, War of the Ring is unrelated to the films by Peter Jackson. The game is officially licensed by Tolkien Enterprises, as are other book-based (as opposed to film-based) Tolkien games such as The Fellowship of the Ring and The Hobbit (2003).&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_War_of_the_Ring,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
