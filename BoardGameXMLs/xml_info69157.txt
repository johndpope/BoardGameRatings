			<description>A Swedish boxing game from the late 50s or early 60s, probably occasioned by the international success of Swedish boxer Ingemar &amp;quot;Ingo&amp;quot; Johansson. You play out a schedule of 12 prizefights. If no winner has been established after this, a round of finals is played between the two leading boxers. There is also an economical element that includes betting. The fights themselves are resolved using offensive and defensive cards with labels like &amp;quot;Jab&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Uppercut&amp;quot; and accompanying point values. Some cards lead to the drawing of chance cards that affect the course of the fight. It is possible to win matches by knockout or points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
