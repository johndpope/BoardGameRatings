							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">1830 Lummerland</name>
									
			<description>Lummerland is an island from the novel for children 'Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver (Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivf&amp;uuml;hrer)' by Michael Ende. &lt;br/&gt;In the original map the hexes are named after the figures in the novel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C4 = Jim Knopf (came to the island by post), &lt;br/&gt;C8 = Lukas, the engine driver, &lt;br/&gt;C6 = Alfons, quarter to twelfth (the king), &lt;br/&gt;D7 = Mr. Sleeve , &lt;br/&gt;B5 = Mrs. Waas (has a little shop).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In principle the rules of 1830, an 18xx game, apply. The tiles of 1830 are used, although not all of them will be needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only one private company, the &amp;quot;Mailship&amp;quot;. Its price is 20$ and it has the characteristic of the &amp;quot;Schuylkill Valley&amp;quot;. No Hex is blocked by the Mailship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only two Corporations: &amp;quot;Jim Knopf&amp;quot; (JK) and &amp;quot;Lukas, the engine driver&amp;quot; (LL). Both corporations may build a station at C6 beside their home stations. &lt;br/&gt;There are the following trains: Two 2, and one 3, 4, 5, 6, Diesel each. In the phase &amp;quot;purchase of trains&amp;quot; a corporation may buy only one train. &lt;br/&gt;Wenn the 5-train is bought Mrs Waas bakes a &amp;quot;Gugelhupf&amp;quot; (A kind of cake in a special shape). In the following Operating Round B5 is worth 20$.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The total money is 2000$, 1200$ are divided between the players in the beginning. &lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game each player may make a bid. The player with the highest bid chooses his seat first. The other player follow in order of their bids. If two or more players have the same bid, roll a dice. In the end of the game the bids are subtracted from the money of the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
