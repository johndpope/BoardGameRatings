			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draft is a generic, universal system that is not tied to any setting or genre.  The game is based around using d10 dice, with higher scores being better than lower scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have nine Main Attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Reason, Intuition, Willpower, Charisma, Perception, and Empathy) in three categories (Physical, Mental, and Interactive).  Main Attribute values range from 1 to 10; any attribute reduced to zero renders the character unplayable.  Main Attribute values are purchased using a point pool.  Characters may also have Special Abilities, Disadvantages, and Faults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have one or more Skills that allow them to perform specialized actions.  Skill values range from zero (Untrained) to 10.  Skills are purchased from a point pool and can increase through play (use).  Skills are tied to a Main Attribute and the cost and performance may vary with that attribute's score.  An example Skill list is provided.  Skill checks are made on 1d10, modified by Skill rank and situational bonuses; this final value is compared to a target difficulty to determine success.  Difficulty Levels range from 4 to 20.  Opposed actions will have a Difficult Level that incorporates the opponents relevant Skills and bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat works much like a Skill but takes place in rounds and segments (6 and 2 seconds, respectively).  Actions have duration in Segments and combat supports initiative.  Weapons deliver &amp;quot;Impact&amp;quot; which is modified by Armor Type Protection prior to causing damage.  Character wounding proceeds through set levels with wound Stacking.  Special types of damage are considered (Falling, Suffocation)  Combat also supports a variety of special actions (Parry, Dodge, Ranged Weapons, Cover, Charge, Hit Locations).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the system is intended to be universal and generic, the rules do have a brief section on Using Magic.  Magic is said to have many &amp;quot;Branches&amp;quot; (schools).  The goal of the section is not to present a complete magic system but to explain how such a system might be best incorporated into the framework of the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
