							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Monster Allegiance</name>
									
			<description>Monster Allegiance is a strategic fast-paced card game which challenges 2-4 players to compete for majority control over a horde of powerful and often unpredictable monsters. Tilt the balance of power in your favor and hold it until the end of the game, and you win! But beware... These are not mindless minions, but proud and dangerous creatures. Defeat an opponent&amp;rsquo;s monster, and you&amp;rsquo;ll earn it&amp;rsquo;s allegiance. But if one falls to your opponent&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ll lose its respect and it&amp;rsquo;ll turn against you! As a Monster Commander, you must strategically decide when and where to place each monster, how to capitalize on the elemental strengths and weaknesses of each, and how to turn the tide with powerful item and element cards. Enter the Monster&amp;rsquo;s arena, but keep your mind sharp&amp;hellip;. for if it dulls, your usefulness to the monsters will swiftly end...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-From Kickstarter description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;-Beautiful colorful pixel art monsters.&lt;br/&gt;-Simple but streategic battles- decided by number comparisons on 4 sides. &lt;br/&gt;-Playable with competitive personal decks or a single deck for balanced play&lt;br/&gt;-Unique twist - All monsters brought into play by either player can swap teams. &lt;br/&gt;-Durable card material&lt;br/&gt;-Multiple games to play - new game instructions released regularly. &lt;br/&gt;-Future expansions with guaranteed content - No random boosters required to obtain all cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
