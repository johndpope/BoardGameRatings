			<description>CY GIRLS (also known as CY Girls or Cy Girls, and as COOL GIRL in Japan) is an action figure series by Takara Tomy and Blue Box Toys under the brand bbi collectible featuring an elite unit of female crimefighters, combining the elements of both a doll and an action figure. In 2004 a Cy Girls video game was developed by Konami for PlayStation 2.  The game is known as Cool Girl in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CY Girls, the game, tells a spy-fi story of CG-1 Ice (voiced by Michelle Ruff), the genius hacker and firearms expert on the mission to destroy an information file in the highly secure corporate building in Buenos Aires (where she is navigated by her partner Sancho), and CG-6 Aska (voiced by Mari Iijima), a master female ninja with astonishing athletic ability attempting to avenge the death of her father in a secret village in Japan (where she is navigated by her brother Kogetsu). While only Ice and Aska are made available as player characters, other CG member also appear in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay for CY Girls combines puzzle-solving with two distinctly different combat styles: ninja-oriented melee combat for Aska, and firearms combat for Ice. Essentially, the game was two different games depending on the character choice, as the game was released as a 2-disc package, containing Aska's data on one disc and Ice's data on the other. After completing the main story on a disc, additional characters from the story were unlocked, as well as an 'Extra Mode', where players could choose any combination of weapons, any unlocked character, or any outfit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, all unlocked characters had the ability to 'dive' into the world of cyberspace (referred to in game as Cyber Dimension, or Cy-D). Within Cy-D, standard moves were disabled, forcing all characters to resort to using punches and kicks to defeat enemies within the domain. In addition, players would have a maximum of 10 minutes within Cy-D before reaching game over (explained in-game as being the amount of time the character could remain within Cy-D without suffering a complete mental breakdown.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Cy Girls&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
