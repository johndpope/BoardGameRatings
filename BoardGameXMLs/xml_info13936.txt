			<description>From publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Age Games is a new gaming company that has produced a miniatures game based on the art and themes of Brom's Dark Age world. It's a dark and ruined world where different factions and different races battle to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a skirmish level game using a d20 for all dice rolls. It is designed for a two-player game of approximately 20 models aside to take an hour or less for experienced players to play. At the same time it gives you all the tactics and control of alternate activation with detailed control of each model's actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of Game Mechanics and Product Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Mechanics &lt;br/&gt;All dice rolls are with a d20, low rolls are better, special rules for rolling 1's and 20's (criticals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The measurements are in cm for greater detail and variety amongst units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play alternates between players with each activating a single unit at a time (individual or squad) and once all units have gone the turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is designed for an average 750 pt game to require approx. 20 figures a side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each army plays different, each has a distinct appearance and background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The majority of units are melee units with advantages stacked in favor of more aggressive play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional rules cover malfunctions, spellcraft, special abilities, formations and many other advanced gaming features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Age is introduced in the book Genesis, which covers the forces of the Forsaken, led by St. Mark, and opens the setting of this world with their encounters against the non-human Dragyri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story continues in Exodus, with the Forces of St. Mary battling the Skarrd, and Evolution, where the Devotees of St. John encounter the Brood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The revised Core Rules and several scenarios are presented by themselves in Essence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current version of the Dark Age miniatures rules is Dark Age: Apocalypse Core Rules with expanded current force lists in Dark Age: Apocalypse â€“ Forcelists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Dark Age: Apocalypse Core Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
