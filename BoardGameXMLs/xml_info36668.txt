			<description>This is a &amp;quot;Roll &amp;amp; Move&amp;quot; game from 1973, published by John Ladell Co Inc., Canton, Mississippi 39046.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 60 Item cards showing things that can be found at a few of the shops around the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt 10 cards which they must get rid of by landing on the shops where their items can be purchased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, each player &amp;quot;owns&amp;quot; three of the shops round the board, and can force players to draw on of their shopping cards as a kind of &amp;quot;rent&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, players may have to pay for parking permits at the Police Station, can get loans at the Loan Companies and the Pawn Shop, and get extra cash at the Bank and the Welfare Office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get rid of their 10 shopping cards (their &amp;quot;shopping list&amp;quot;) will win the game, as long as they don't have an outstanding loan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
