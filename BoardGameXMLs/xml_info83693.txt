			<description>The goal of the game is that the player has to get rid of three of their own color towers. At the beginning of the game, each player receives seven tiles of each color. From the rest of the stones a playing field is built up of 10x10 pieces.&lt;br/&gt;The starting player rolls with the six dice. Once the die is cast, a player turns the hour glass. As long as the hourglass is running, all players have time to explore on the field a similar set of stones which are set by the dice. The goal is to identify as quickly as possible to the corresponding color as in the color field. The more stones the found color range contains, the more point a player gets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
