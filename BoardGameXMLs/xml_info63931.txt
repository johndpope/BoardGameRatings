			<description>This game is made after classic detective Sherlock Holmes. You start at the start square and move along spaces. Some spaces have pictures with Holmes and other characters. When you step onto that picture you take one card with that picture and read that information under there. Then you need to decide where to go based on information that is know to you. You move like that and you need to reach finish. When you reach there, you can check out the solution. Was you way the right way or you missed something?&lt;br/&gt;There are about 1500 ways this game can go. 5 (cards for each space) times 30 (pictures) and 10 (different paths). At the beginning (like in clue) the solution is chosen and investigation can begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
