			<description>WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD SUPERHEROES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Champions Presents is an anthology of three of the best adventures that Hero Games has to offer. Each action-packed adventure is completely separate and can be played as such, or a Gamemaster can follow the guidelines given to intertwine the three adventures into a comic book-style campaign. Each adventure is fully detailed with NPCs (over thirty new characters!), layouts, bases, and everything else a GM needs to run the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVENTURE NUMBER ONE: Can you stop the evil villain group Spectrum, as they attempt to take Washington D.C. by storm in order to pass a paranormal restriction act? A pulse-pounding, no-holds-barred climactic battle on capitol hill finishes off this incredible adventure written by Scott Sigler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVENTURE NUMBER TWO: Its called No News of a Thaw, and this adventure involving ice demons, other dimensions, and a quest to save the world from domination by creatures of terrible cold is as off-beat as they get &amp;mdash; but a challenge for any heroes worthy the name. Written by Phil Masters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVENTURE NUMBER THREE: The final installment in this incredible trilogy is Menace Out of Time, written by Dean and Dana Edgell. As it's name would imply, this adventure involves time travel, both with the villain Tempus ripping things from various times to menace the characters, and the heroes chasing their foe through time. Nazis, robots, war gods, futuristic lawmen, ghosts and dinosaurs are the heroes' adversaries in this mind-boggling battle through time. Can your heroes keep from becoming marooned in the distant past? And if so, can they face the final, startling conclusion of the Menace Out of Time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
