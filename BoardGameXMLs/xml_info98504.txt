			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is primarily a puzzle game (like Bejeweled) with a bit of a poker theme. The object is to make &amp;quot;poker hands&amp;quot; out of the arrayed cards/gems to remove them from the field. Once removed, new cards drop down to fill their empty spaces. The player also has a few abilities at their disposal. They can slow down time or unleash bombs that clear sections of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are seven game modes and eleven thematic environments from which to choose. Single player has the normal Adventure mode, as well as Timed Mode and Puzzle Mode. Local multi is split screen, and Online multi allows for up to 5 players to play in tournament style rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
