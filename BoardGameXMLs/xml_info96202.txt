			<description>Road Rash, often called Road Rash 3D or Road Rash 3DO to distinguish it from the Genesis original of the same name, was originally released on the 3DO, and later for the Sony Playstation, Sega Saturn, and PC. A version for the Super Nintendo was planned for release, but was eventually canceled. The game featured full motion video sequences to advance the plot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five levels altogether, and five courses, all California locales: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Coast Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. The roads themselves are multi-lane with brief divided road sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is the same as in previous installments in the series: When all courses are completed without getting &amp;quot;Game Over&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Busted&amp;quot;, in 1st, 2nd or 3rd out of 14th place, the level will increase. Differences affected on tracks are the length and the amount of traffic on the road, with the additions of heavier fines from the police if the player is caught, and a larger reward for completing the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player could choose a character to play as, which came with a specific cash amount and a personal motorcycle. Some of these characters' names come from combatants from the original Genesis releases, such as &amp;quot;Axle&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Rhonda&amp;quot;. The character also had status among his or her fellow bikers, which was accessible after the race. Depending on what the NPC preferred (some liked being hit, some didn't), the other racers would dynamically react to the player depending on how he or she was treated during the races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Road Rash&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
