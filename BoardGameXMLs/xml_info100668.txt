			<description>Treasure Master is a video game released by American Softworks in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System as part of a contest involving MTV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Contest&lt;br/&gt;After the game's release in late 1991, players had until noon EST on April 11, 1992 to practice beating the game. At this time, MTV revealed a secret password. By entering in this password and the game's serial number before beginning the game, players unlocked a secret sixth &amp;quot;Prize World&amp;quot; level. After this, players had until midnight to complete the entire game including the Prize World. This prompted the game to reveal a 24 character code. By calling in to a special hotline with this code, players had a chance at winning one of 36,252 prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secret Password&lt;br/&gt;The password to play the full game is: 3HDJL9DNQV2WYTV4S91RXR86&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Treasure Master&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
