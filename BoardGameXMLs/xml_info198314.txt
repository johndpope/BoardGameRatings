			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moral Choice is a philosophical game published in Canada in 1985 by Moral Choice Associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game 2-6 players move around a spiral track representing their growth from childhood to adulthood to old age by rolling a die. Most of the squares have a large K or M on them in five different colours. There are also special Horseshoe (Opportunity), Lightning Bolt (Crisis), Light Bulb (Bright Idea) and Superdilemma squares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they land on K or M square, they must choose a card of the colour they landed on from a box divided into 18 groups. These cards describe moral dilemmas (brief case studies) on one side, with four multiple-choice options and the real solutions for both the K and M philosophies on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards are divided into three major categories based on age (Youth, Adult and Senior), each of which is divided into six colour-coded sub-categories based on the type of dilemma one must solve (Business/Professional, Biomedical, Social/Political, Environmental, Personal/Sexual, Superdilemmas).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The K squares ask players to answer a dilemma according to the duty-based ethics of Immanuel Kant. The M squares ask you to solve the same dilemma according to the utilitarian ethics of John Stuart Mill. The game comes with summary cards for Kant and Mill listing their seven key ideas in each case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can use either the easy multiple-choice option, or answer the dilemma in their own words, with the other players voting on how close they came to matching the true solution. In the case of a Superdilemma, no solutions are given, so players propose their own, with others voting to determine whether it&amp;rsquo;s correct. They can also time the game, giving each player 3-5 minutes to answer a dilemma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get the right answer, they can move forward next turn. If they get it wrong, they move backwards when they roll again. The winner is the first player who gets to the end of the spiral track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
