			<description>Challenge someone to a battle of words!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Word Bits, words begin as one to four letter bits rolled on the letter dice. Pick a category card and make a word using those word bits that fit the category. Everyone plays at once, so be the first to call out your word to win the card. This game promotes quick thinking while building spelling and vocabulary skills&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn over the top card. It will show how many dice to roll (from 1 to 4) and a general category. After throwing the dice,all players must quickly try to think of a single word that fits the category and includes all the letters shown. For example the two letters A and C and the category &amp;quot;Breakfast Food&amp;quot; might lead to &amp;quot;bacon&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cereal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pancakes&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;cantaloupe&amp;quot;. The fastest player receives the card and then turns over a card for the next round. At the end of the deck, the player who collected the most cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
