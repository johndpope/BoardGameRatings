			<description>Object of the game is to capture the &amp;quot;Hunny is Yummy&amp;quot; card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Each player plays as one of four characters: Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore or Roo.  Each player gets four cards face up on the table.  The remaining cards form a draw pile, and one card is turned up for the discard pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn starts by drawing one card.  At this point, you may trade an &amp;quot;Oh Bother&amp;quot; card (which has a picture of an object and character) that belongs to another player for one of their cards.  The receiving player takes the card, turns all of their cards face down, and shuffles them.  The giving player picks one of the cards and adds to their hand.  The turn ends with a discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get a &amp;quot;Busy Bee&amp;quot; card, and are the first one to discard this card when another player shouts &amp;quot;Honey!&amp;quot; to signify they have four hunny pots, you get to take one Hunny Pot card from the player.  The first player to avoid the bees and get the &amp;quot;Hunny is Yummy&amp;quot; card by holding four hunny pots wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternate rule sets for younger players eliminate the Busy Bee cards and players try to collect all six &amp;quot;Oh Bother&amp;quot; cards that match their character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
