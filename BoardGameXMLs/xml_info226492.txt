			<description>Card game based in the landing of Austriacist troops in Montgat (near Barcelona) in 1705, during the War of the Spanish Succession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the players is to get 10 points, playing the best sets of cards. At the peginning of a game, each player gets a special permanent character, which gives some special power). Then from a draw pile, in each turn, a player draws a card and plays as many cards as he wants in his playing area, trying to play the best sets, to either get points or to destroy card sets already played by other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
