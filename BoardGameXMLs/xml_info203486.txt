							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Expedition to Woodcrest Tower</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Woodcrest was once a peaceful logging town, but lately that peace has been shattered. The area always held a population of goblins, orcs, kobolds, and the like, but until recently, they were always too busy squabbling with each other to be more than a nuisance. Now the monsters have begun to gather in large numbers and launch raids on the region&amp;rsquo;s other inhabitants. A small town, with little in the way of defenses, Woodcrest has put out a call for a group of adventurers to discover what has united the disparate bands and tribes and deal with the menace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 1st level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
