							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Da Li Shui Shou</name>
									
			<description>Da Li Shui Shou literally means 'strong sailor' but the graphics used in the game clearly show the strong sailor to be none other than Popeye, the cartoon character. &lt;br/&gt;The players have a choice of being Popeye, Olive or Bluto and the object of the game is to get all your pieces from the start to the finish. Along the way, there are spaces with various instructions to follow.&lt;br/&gt;This curious Chinese roll-and-move game comes on a key chain. The tiny box holds the 12 pieces (four for each player), a little teetotum and a small folded paper board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
