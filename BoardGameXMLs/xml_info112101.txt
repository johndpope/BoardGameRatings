			<description>Oma, Tante, Anverwandte (&amp;quot;Granny, Aunt, Relatives&amp;quot;) challenges players to remember the faces of multiple oh-so-similar relatives and reproduce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a round, each player receives a portrait card, looks at it secretly for some predetermined amount of time (say 15-30 seconds), lays the card down, then tries to reproduce the picture as accurately as possible. Players score points for each element that is the right shape, and more points if elements are the proper colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some portraits have more elements to remember than others, so while your scoring potential is higher, you'll have a tougher time keeping everything in mind. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
