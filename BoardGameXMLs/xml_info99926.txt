							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lawn Mayhem</name>
									
			<description>In the small town of Greenfield everything seems nice and quiet. The inhabitants are enjoying the summer and many of them sit around eating and drinking in their gardens. But suddenly something breaks the silence. The noise comes from old Mrs. Olsen&amp;rsquo;s - it sounds as if a whole car park was just started up. What is going on?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The situation is actually pretty simple: Old Mrs. Olsen is a lawn mower enthusiast and she is just tired of looking at her neighbors&amp;rsquo; beautiful lawns and trimmed hedges while her own garden has been overgrown for years. Now she wants to relive the time when she could race her lawn mowers around the garden. To accomplish this she has hired some of the supposedly nice kids from the neighborhood. The youngsters don&amp;rsquo;t really all want to help, but she offers them money for the grass and weeds they can mow, and she finds a mower in her collection that matches each of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game:&lt;br/&gt;The players play one of the kids and compete with each other to mow the most grass and weeds while avoiding the flowers. At the same time they try not to run down the old woman, her cat or the other kids. The player who earns the most money (victory points) wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
