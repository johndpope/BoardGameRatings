							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Steal Princess</name>
									
			<description>Steal Princess is a puzzle-based platform game. The game is divided into larger areas that are subdivided into multiple levels. Levels are short and generally only take a few minutes to complete. The goal often involves defeating a set of enemies and activating switches in order to gain access to the level's exit. The puzzle elements in the first few levels combine to form more complex puzzles as the game progresses. There is also a level editor feature to allow players to create their own puzzles and share them on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Steal Princess&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
