							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Working Dead</name>
									
			<description>You work a thankless office job at a faceless corporate entity. Its stark, lifeless cubicles bleed grey into your very soul. Before you can even start your day, an old co-worker wanders into your workspace. He's been long dead but that doesn't stop him from being a distraction. You manage to blow his brains out with a modified staple gun and get back to work. Maybe you can make it to Friday. Maybe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of The Working Dead, a negotiation-driven strategy game, is straightforward: Be the first to earn $250,000 by the end of the week by negotiating for fellow co-workers! Check in on Monday, manipulate others to do your work for you, grab a beer on Friday. Don't let the undead get you down. Use them to your advantage or die trying. Always follow corporate policy &amp;mdash; or don't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
