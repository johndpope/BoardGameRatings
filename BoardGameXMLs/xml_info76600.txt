			<description>From Play The Game description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game for two players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Circa 1920&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information on gameplay from Play the Game by Brian Love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two farmers try to force their apparently 1-eyed if not totally blind pigs up the road to market. The route is a minefield of detours. The only consolation is that the players get to control 2 pigs rather than 1 and can decide in which order the beasts shall be moved nearer to the finish enclosure. You roll two dice and then determine which one will move .  Both of your pigs must get to the finish line in order to win. If your pig gets to a field marked IN it must enter the field and go through it until it gets back to the out gate. Once 1 pig has reached the MARKET you can only roll one die for the remaining pig.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
