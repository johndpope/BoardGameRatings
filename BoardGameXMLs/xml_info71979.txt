			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An action adventure type game. The player controls a &amp;quot;robber&amp;quot;, who walks around on maze-like flick screens, avoiding cops, ghosts and various traps. The goal of the game is to gain as much points as possible, but new to the era was that the player had several options. In the bank, there were diamonds to pick up, and somewhere a combination to find to unlock the safe. There was also the Mines, where ghosts roamed, and where the player could pick up TNT to blow things up. The player could also go into the Police station and rescue his lost lives (men), if he could find a key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player had to figure out where things were and how to manipulate the environent to his advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the theme, with the player controlling a robber who ran around shooting policemen, the game was criticized when released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
