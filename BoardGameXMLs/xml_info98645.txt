							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Altus Adventum Primer</name>
									
			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;The book you have in your hand now is an introductory glimpse into the Altus Adventum 2nd edition role-playing game. It includes everything you need to have an adventure with brand new characters (what we call Aspirants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primer is limited in that only the beginning level skills, spells, and monsters are included. The full game contains all levels, which consists of hundreds of skills, spells, and creatures. The full version also includes additional rules to handle a more detailed combat encounter, and gives players many more options with their characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full version also includes the Far East setting, and all that it brings with it (spells, skills, weapons, armor, monsters, guilds, etc). The intent of this primer is to give you a taste of the Altus Adventum 2nd edition game. I am confident that you will find it an enjoyable experience, and will choose to continue your adventures by purchasing the full rules and various Adventure PAKs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
