							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vindicators: Third Class</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Vindicators - Class Three - META FORCE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Third Class grew up watching the exploits of the Vindicators on television as they teamed up with the Sentinels to fight back against the forces of New Avalon as they battled across the eastern United States. As such, when the third class of the Shepherd Academy started, they were not content to wait until they were 18 to use their powers to help humanity. They would sneak out and use their powers to fight crime and protect the citizens of San Francisco. After a public battle against the forces of ATOM, the third class introduced themselves as &amp;ldquo;Meta Force.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Athena (PL 11): Sword-wielding myrmidon descendent&lt;br/&gt;    Barghest (PL 9): Lupine brawler&lt;br/&gt;    Caldera (PL 11): Earth-powered lava controller&lt;br/&gt;    Codex (PL 9): Smartest boy in the world&lt;br/&gt;    Ingress (PL 10): Magical, teleporting martial artist&lt;br/&gt;    Meteor (PL 8): Flying &amp;quot;BLASTER&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;    Mind Hack (PL 12): Mindcontrolling ex-street thief&lt;br/&gt;    Photonic Overdrive (PL 10): Sun-powered energy manipulator&lt;br/&gt;    Sigma Xi (PL 9): Shapeshifting machine-race alien&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
