			<description>As a god your destiny is to spread your influence throughout the world. But you are only as powerful as your following. Using your ability to sculpt the land, you can create a habitable environment that will allow a population of believers to flourish. In your crafted utopia you can grow as a god in the face of various challenges that affect the population. You can watch hundreds of individual followers live out their lives with dynamic and captivating behavior. If you choose to spread out and conquer more lands however, you will confront other gods with their own civilizations of followers. There is only room for one god, so prepare to guide your worshippers into battle by altering the world around them with your god powers, then watch your followers reign victorious across the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half a living sandbox world, and half a strategy game, players can choose to explore the power of the almighty however they wish. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s granting the power of life and blossoming the world around your believers, or using godly powers to wreak havoc via natural disasters to defeat the armies of other gods, prepare for the Ultimate God Game: Single Player, Multiplayer, Cross-Platform gameplay, sandbox worlds, strategic battles, living populations, and the power to create, change, and destroy the very structure of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An essential part of GODUS is single player. We all love to take the time to hone our godly powers before venturing into the exciting multiplayer wars with other gods.&lt;br/&gt;    It&amp;rsquo;s a living world, unique and detailed. And it&amp;rsquo;s a world you influence, whether you&amp;rsquo;re good or evil.&lt;br/&gt;    GODUS is instantly accessible, easy to learn but immensely deep.&lt;br/&gt;    As you flourish and build your own cult, you&amp;rsquo;ll engage in pitched battles with other gods and their cults. It&amp;rsquo;s a multiplayer power-struggle the way it should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
