							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mega-Feats Revisited</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 250 New Feats for the Pathfinder Role pLaying Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega-Feats: New Paths to Victory remains one of Skortched Urf Studio's best selling products. The release of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game presents us with a chance to revisit this weighty feat tome, revise the feats as necessary to bring them in line with how this generation of the game is played, and add new material to an already solid work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In keeping with the spirit of the Pathfinder revision, we're only making minor changes to the feats. If you have an earlier version of Megafeats, the older version of these feats still works fine. Forgeblood Feats have already been revised, and&lt;br/&gt;are available as part of Thinking Races: Heroes of Iron and Steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few feats have been excised entirely because they're too similar to how things work in the Pathfinder-revision by default or just because the new rules make them unnecessary. The Forge Gift Item Creation feats from Megafeats are gone, as are feats like Burning Belief (which let clerics deal direct damage with a turning check) and many of the variant &amp;quot;weapon and armor training&amp;quot; feats, hopefully proving the adage about great minds thinking alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Megafeats Revisited is intended as the largest collection of new feats available for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, more than doubling character options presented in either the first edition of Megafeats, or in the Pathfinder RPG core rules themselves! Many of the best feats from other Skortched Urf Studios and Otherverse Games products have migrated into this massive sourcebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new feats in this sourcebook are inspired by a wide variety of sources - mythology, fantasy literature, comics, anime and even the way some other popular game systems do things. Hopefully, you'll find feats to fit your favorite tactics, and&lt;br/&gt;some new ideas about what a role playing character can do over the course of a long, storied career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
