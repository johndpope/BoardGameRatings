							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">One Man: Thrag!</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Slay all of the wizards&amp;rsquo; beasts and get Thrag home in time for breakfast.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The red, green and blue tiles are the beasts summoned by the three evil wizards. Thrag must defeat all fifteen of these nasties in twelve hours (turns) or the game is lost. Higher numbers on a tile reflect a more challenging foe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Track turns by moving the black pawn clockwise around the outer spaces of the 2&amp;times;2 grid. Twelve turns have elapsed when the pawn returns to the upper-left space. The red, green and blue coins can help Thrag battle against the beasts of a particular wizard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Thrag fights a blue foe, he can only flip a blue coin, and so on. The pawns of these colors represent three special weapons at Thrag&amp;rsquo;s disposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice are used to randomize strengths on both sides of the battle. Aces count as 1s, Nulls count as 0s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The black coins track Thrag&amp;rsquo;s hit points. At game start, three of the coins are in use while the other three are in a face-up Healing Pool. The black tiles represent chances for Thrag to draw coins from the pool and increase his current hit-point total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Piecepack Game System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
