The board to use can be set freely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player draws an animal drawn on the card Put cards on board to connect,I aim to reach the opponent's position earlier than the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;Board games in which hand weights and read ahead are important,&lt;br/&gt;Card games where luck and strategy decide victory and defeat,&lt;br/&gt;It is a game that combines both good places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game flow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;① Two people determined the shape of the board to be used this time,I will arrange the cards and make the board.&lt;br/&gt;If the shape seen from the two people is the same, if it is within 45 total&lt;br/&gt;It is decided freely. (If you get lost,Please choose from &amp;quot;board card&amp;quot; and decide.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;② Hand each 4 cards to each player.&lt;br/&gt;I will leave the rest as deck piles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;③ The row closest to you on each player board&lt;br/&gt;Look at the card (base), exchange freely with your hand&lt;br/&gt;Decide the base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;④ Once both players have decided the base,&lt;br/&gt;Turn face up at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;⑤ Mix the card at the top of the deck with the card &amp;quot;Final card&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The one who pulls by two people and pulls the &amp;quot;second card&amp;quot; is the first&lt;br/&gt;The game starts. Those who ordered a normal card&lt;br/&gt;Just add it to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;(You will have 1 more cards in your hand)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;⑥ In the player's turn,&lt;br/&gt;I will do one of the following AB activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Cards are put out so that animal is connected.&lt;br/&gt;Look at your face-up card already on board, To connect to a small left and right animal.&lt;br/&gt;I will put out the card. Take it out to a card face down.&lt;br/&gt;If it is, replace it and add it to your hand.&lt;br/&gt;If you put it out on a face-up card, leave it as it is&lt;br/&gt;Overlay. (You will have 1 card less.)&lt;br/&gt;At this time, if you put a card on the base of your opponent&lt;br/&gt;It is a win and the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B pass and draw 1 card from the deck&lt;br/&gt;When I can not or can not withdraw my card&lt;br/&gt;Draw 1 piece from the deck and turn the turn to the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;If you do not have a deck when you pass, the back of the board&lt;br/&gt;Select one from the card and draw 1 piece. Draw&lt;br/&gt;Where cards are gone,I can not put cards in the future.&lt;br/&gt;Without cards facing the back of the board, It becomes &amp;quot;no drawing without draw&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;When two persons are &amp;quot;success without draw&amp;quot; in succession,&lt;br/&gt;The game ends with a draw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;⑦ If you connect the same animal with two cards,&lt;br/&gt;The connected card is called &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;You can not put your opponent on.&lt;br/&gt;If either of the two foundations is overwritten&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Double&amp;quot; is canceled.&lt;br/&gt;(Double can be used without the age to play)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
