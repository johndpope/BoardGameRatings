			<description>You are in a Japanese garden. Like the Japanese masters, the players make strategic moves to reach their opponent's camp. There's lot of strategy in this game where you advance step by step.&lt;br/&gt;To win the game, you must be the first to reach the opponent's temple with one of your three &amp;quot;kokeshi&amp;quot; figurine.
