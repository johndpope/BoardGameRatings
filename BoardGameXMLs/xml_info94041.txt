			<description>Take a journey back in time to the Mesozoic age when DINOSAURS ruled the earth! Witness their battles for survival in a prehistoric world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empire of the Dinosaurs puts you in control of heavily armed herbivores, gigantic long necked Sauropods, and fearsome predators such as Tyrannosaurus Rex, who dominated the ancient landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the unique abilities of each dinosaur to settle and expand territory, or establish a lair and hunt your opponent&amp;rsquo;s herds to extinction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To rule and conquer each choice you make is a matter of life or death. Protect your dinosaurs from vicious attacks, natural disasters, injury, and disease. The player who scores the most Fossil points by the end of the game is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Areas of your dinosaur kingdom are represented by different cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Territories are locations where you play herbivores and create herds. Once a territory becomes settled you can try to score Fossils by overcoming Events. But watch out! It&amp;rsquo;s your opponent who decides what Events your herds will face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Predator Lair is where your meat-eating dinosaurs are played. When your Lair gets established you can score Fossils for successfully hunting your opponent&amp;rsquo;s dinosaurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nesting Site is the area where you play Action cards. These cards allow you to dramatically alter game play or surprise your opponent with unexpected abilities. If you can form a Colony here then you will score Fossils for certain dinosaurs in your herds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card also contains fascinating educational facts about these mighty creatures of the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dinosaurs dominated life on this planet for over 160 million years, find out how with Empire of the Dinosaurs!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
