			<description>A Two-Round Adventure for Six Adventurers&lt;br/&gt;DM Invitational Version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A heroic quest, at last. Jedekai of Whitefalls, an archmage, is counting on you to help him fashion a magical gem. With this gem, you can close off a gate to the Abyss, averting an invasion by a horde of fiends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroes Three has spent most of the last week looking for something heroic to do. You currently operate out of Hamish, a good spot for adventuring. Unfortunately, other groups think so too. Several formidable quests, including a black dragon, were handled before you could get there. About all you accomplished was to get a chicken's egg from the junk lady. She insisted you carry it, even showing up to replace it when the first one got broken. Currently Barnath is carrying the egg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, a dying cleric gave you a clue that led you to a necromancer facing an archmage. Working like the well-oiled team you are, you defeated the undead and fiends that the necromancer had summoned. She escaped, taking a gem from the gate to the Abyss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Jedekai, this means that the gate is open only on the other side. He has been busy the past two days enchanting the gem, while you have guarded the gate. So far nothing has come through, but it could at any moment. You have managed to spell each other, getting rested and healed up after the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, something happens. Jedekai returns, popping in right next to Brunhilda. In his hand he holds a sapphire the size of a small egg. The gem shimmers with magic. It is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jedekai looks relieved to see you. &amp;quot;Well done, heroes. I have nearly completed the gem. Well, I have completed the part that I can. Six facets of the gem remain to be enchanted. As is usual for this sort of thing, it might not be easy. I will watch the gate while you complete the gem, if that meets with your approval. I warn you, it may be dangerous.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
