			<description>Monchhichi at the Fair is a children's game for two to four players, featuring the same spin-and-move system used in Candy Land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is described on the box as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to reach the ferris wheel [pictured on the game board]. With their own Monchhichi mover piece children can pretend they are taking a stroll through the fair, from the ticket booth, past the merry-go-round to the ferris wheel. &lt;br/&gt;There is a shortcut of course but a backslide too! There are smiling Monchhichi to help you get there faster, but a crying Monchhichi will slow you down.&lt;br/&gt;This is an easy game to learn and set-up and it's fun matching colours to move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
