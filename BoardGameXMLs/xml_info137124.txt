			<description>When it was discovered that Jules Verne was not a science fiction writer but an inventor and time traveler who was actually recording his exploits, the Gears-N-Geeks crowd jumped at the opportunity to recover his artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By collecting various power sources and putting them to use with Tesla cubes the GNG's will attempt to be the first to collect the artifacts from Verne's greatest adventures, his Voyages Extraordinaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a system of dice collecting they will amass power and by rolling they will fit their power sources to discover the hidden locations of the artifacts. It is an unstable game the GNG's are playing and dice will be stolen, traded and discarded all in an attempt to be the one who makes each discovery. The GNG's can only spread their resources so far and must balance gaining their own advantage with preventing their opponents from taking the prize.&lt;br/&gt;These artifacts have great power and value, once attained that power can be put to use for future collection attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the end it comes down to being the GNG with the most value in your collection of artifacts thus proving you are the greatest Vernian since the man himself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
