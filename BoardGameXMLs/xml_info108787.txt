			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a relatively simple title in which players advance race cars on a track by spinning a spinner. Each space on the spinner has two colors with associated numbers. When the spinner lands on a spot, both cars with the appropriate color move the number of spaces indicated. (For example: There's a spinner spot that shows a yellow 5 and a blue 3. When the spinner lands on this spot, the Yellow Car moves five spaces, and the Blue Car moves three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cars may change lanes if they have an unoccupied spot to move to. (A car that is boxed in my even move backwards to get free.) If two cars &amp;quot;collide&amp;quot; by occupying the same space, then the car that initiated the collusion is penalized two laps, and the car that got hit, one lap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of laps is determined by player agreement at the beginning of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game includes a board, four plastic cards, and an insert with a spinner and a series of peg holes to track the laps. (Some plastic pegs are also included.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no indication of copyright year on the box, but based on other similar titles by the same publisher, it was probably produced in the 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
