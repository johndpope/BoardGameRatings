			<description>This wargame covers all of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as well as guerrilla supply locations in neighboring countries.  It pits the government forces (army, air force and police) against the rebel forces of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not explicitly stated when the game is set, noting that the first important guerrilla incident took place in 1968, but the implication is that the game is set in 1975.  It last 24 game turns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in 1976 so would represent contemporary events.  It starts with an (undated) prediction from a South African general that the white minority regime in Rhodesia could hold out against the outside-supported guerrillas a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 2 years.(The bulk of the population lived outside the modern world and did not care much who won).  I guess this is the timescale of the game and it is attempting to predict the military outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
