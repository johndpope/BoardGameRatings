							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Animal Match Puzzle Cards</name>
									
			<description>Animal Match Puzzle Cards is a matching game designed to teach reading skill to young children. It consists of a series of cards depicting animals and matching puzzle pieces showing the written names of the animals. The picture cards are placed face-up on the table. The name pieces are stacked face-down. Players take turns choosing a name piece. They must then read the word and correctly match it to its animal picture card. If the puzzle piece fits the card, the player is correct and keeps the pair. If not, the name piece is placed back on the bottom of the pile and the animal card is returned to its place. Play continues until all pairs are claimed, and the player with the most pairs wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
