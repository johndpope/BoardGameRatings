			<description>From the Game's Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long ago, Mother Earth had many defenders against the dark wizards who would attempt to corrupt her, bend her to their will or alter her destiny. From the water, clever Merfolk and whimsical Sprites would come. From the Earth, staunch Dryads and powerful Giants would come. From the air, crafty Djinn and flighty Zephyr spirits would come and from the fire, mighty Dragons and fearsome Flamekin would come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then came Industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the power of Science, mankind wrested control of its destiny from its creator, the Mother Earth. Through this newfound independence, the Children of Earth built cities and monuments unimaginable to their ancestors. Yet science too has its dark wizards...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world now stands at the brink of destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summoning what remains of her power, the Mother Earth has made a bold move to try and save her children and herself. Acceding to the demands of the scientific paradigm, Earth has created new guardians - guardians born of Science, not Magic; A multitude of defenders whose power comes directly from mankind's own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Elementality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
