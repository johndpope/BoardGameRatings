							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Merano</name>
									
			<description>Merano is a Chess variant played with stackable pieces. Stacks of different heights represent Queens, Rooks, Knights, Bishops, Pawns and immovable Towers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stack is controlled by the color of the topmost piece. A capture is made by moving one or more pieces from an attacking stack onto another stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capturing can rapidly alter the situation in the game and result in quick victories. However, the strength of a stack is illusive. A Queen for example, represented by a single piece, will cease to be a Queen at the moment she makes her first capture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
