			<description>Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition (Japanese: ハイパーストリートファイターII -The Anniversary Edition) is a competitive fighting game by Capcom that was originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 in Japan and in 2004 in North America and Asia. Released to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Street Fighter series, Hyper Street Fighter II is a modified port of Super Street Fighter II Turbo in which players can control any versions of the main characters from the five Street Fighter II games previously released for the arcades. Although originally released as a home console game, an arcade port was released shortly afterwards in limited quantities, turning it into the sixth and final arcade iteration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PlayStation 2 version was released by itself in Japan and Europe. In North America, it was released in a two-in-one disc titled Street Fighter Anniversary Collection, which also features Street Fighter III 3rd Strike. The Anniversary Collection version was later ported to the Xbox in all regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opening sequence has been altered to use a modified version of the Super Street Fighter II intro, in which logos of the past five games appear flashing into the screen. The background music played during the player select screen was also reverted to the theme used in Super Street Fighter II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the game is started, the player has to select a game speed, and then they are asked to choose one of the five Street Fighter II games, which will limit the selectable characters to the roster of the selected game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot; features the eight characters from the original Street Fighter II. If both players choose this version of the game, mirror matches will not be allowed, as the original game did not support them, even lacking different character color palettes.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Champ&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Dash&amp;quot; in the Japanese version) is based on Street Fighter II&amp;prime;: Champion Edition and adds the four Grand Masters as playable fighters.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Turbo&amp;quot; is based on Street Fighter II&amp;prime; Turbo: Hyper Fighting.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Super&amp;quot; adds the four new characters from Super Street Fighter II.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Super T&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Super X&amp;quot; in the Japanese version), is based on Super Street Fighter II Turbo and adds Akuma.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Street_Fighter_II,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Street_Fighter_II,&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
