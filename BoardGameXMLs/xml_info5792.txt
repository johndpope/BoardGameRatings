			<description>This game is similar to a bare bones version of Traumfabrik in that you're collecting movie stars to finish movies. It's also very Monopoly like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's based on 20 movie productions. Players take turns moving around the board and have the option to buy various productions of older movies like Casablanca, High Noon, or A Streetcar Named Desire. There are title cards to represent ownership, with a list of three actors on them. If someone lands on your production they pay &amp;quot;studio fees&amp;quot;. The amount is dependant on the number of stars you've collected and any awards you've collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ways to acquire stars. The cards are nice with b&amp;amp;w photos of actors such as Humphrey Bogart, Marilyn Monroe, and 58 others. Once you've completed the production, you are eligible to receive rewards and there are several ways to get those. There are also Production &amp;amp; Publicity cards much like chance and community chest in Monopoly. Bankruptcies occur if you have to pay more than you have. The short games last about an hour and there are three variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regular game is two to three hours. Reviewed by Rex Reed for a finishing touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
