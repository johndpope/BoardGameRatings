			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War! Politics! Gender Inequality! The Environment! Education! Which of today&amp;rsquo;s burning social issues is most important to you and which would you trade away?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tradewala (pronounced trade wala) is a modern take on the popular frenzied group trading card game concept. Every day, we&amp;rsquo;re faced with news headlines or social issues that affect us. Tradewala makes it OK to talk about them in a crazy fun environment with friends, family or even strangers, face-to-face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;ldquo;wala&amp;rdquo; is an expert in a particular skill. Are you fast enough to be named the Tradewala?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this addicting and adrenaline-packed game, players start with nine satirical cards representing eight different social issues and blindly trade with one another, simultaneously, until one player collects all nine cards of the same social issue. Now quick &amp;ndash; sound the bell!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategy comes into play with how many cards to trade, which social issue to trade, with whom to trade and how quick and loud the players are. It&amp;rsquo;s rowdy for sure, but inevitably meaningful conversation arises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
