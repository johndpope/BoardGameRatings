							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vale of the Mage</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;There's only one way to get there - through the Barrier Peaks. Once you're there, you are confronted with armed guards, traps both magical and mechanical, and legendary beasts...not to mention the wandering necromancers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why go in there? Because rules of neighboring countries have asked you to persuade the Black One to help rout that group of expatriate necromancers. They tried a coup, failed, and came to the Vale of the Mage to hide - and, presumably, to regroup and ally with the Black One. They may have gained the help of the Tree People, as well; you won't know until (perhaps) it'll be too late to turn back. It's a jungle in there...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is intended for characters of 7th through 9th level, for a total of 35 to 40 levels.  A mix of character classes is desirable.  Further, it is important that at least some of the characters have magical weapons.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
