			<description>Cheerio is a turn-based dice game. In this version of it, you may play against yourself or another opponent. The object is to gain the highest total points by scoring high in each of several different scoring categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you roll all five dice. After the roll, you may either choose a category to score in or take up to two optional rerolls. For each reroll, you may select any of the dice to keep and only reroll the remainder. You may score at any time, thus ending your turn; after the second reroll (three rolls total) you must score it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To score, choose a category to score in. You may only score in one category per turn and may only score each category once in the course of the game. The game is over after all players have scored in each category. The points are totaled, and the winner is the player with the highest total number of points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scoring categories available depend on the mode of play you choose. The section on &amp;quot;scoring&amp;quot; (below) specifics how many points you get for each category. Here are the different categories that are available and what they mean:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Number Categories -- These are &amp;quot;Ones,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Twos,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Threes,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Fours,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Fives,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Sixes.&amp;quot; To score high in these categories, you must try to roll as many of the specified number as you can. For example, for the &amp;quot;fives&amp;quot; category, the more dice you have showing a five, the more you will score.&lt;br/&gt;Three/Four/Five of a Kind -- These three categories only earn you points if you have three, four, or five dice showing the same number.&lt;br/&gt;Run of Four -- This category only earns you points if you have a run of four: a one, two, three, and four; a two, three, four, and five; or a three, four, five, and six.&lt;br/&gt;Cheerio -- This category is equivalent to a run of five.&lt;br/&gt;Full House -- This category requires you to have three dice showing one number and two dice showing another. If you have all five dice showing the same number, that counts, too.&lt;br/&gt;Sum -- In this category, your score is the sum of all the numbers showing on each of the dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
