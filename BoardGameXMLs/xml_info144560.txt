							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rescue Roby</name>
									
			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Rescue Roby, you play the role of Roby, a robot who was rejected from the factory line and sent to the scrap metal pile.  He escaped, and now his goal is to find his way into the shipping crate to escape the factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each level, Roby is sitting atop a stack of crates, and your goal is to destroy the crates in such a way as to get him into the shipping crate.  Sometimes you will need to pop a crate to have him drop; other times you will need to pop crates to create an incline.  Use logic and timing to get Roby out of the factory, and don't forget to collect your three stars along the way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
