			<description>For Fame &amp;amp; Fortune (F3) is an addictive card-drafting game of high stakes Fortune Hunting. The objective is to collect the best Fortune Hand from several rounds of drafting. The twist is that players control the number of cards to draft, points they score, and Fortune Hands they make through a common mechanism that leads to many strategic decisions and tactical plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin with ten cards and starts by drafting five cards. Players will then play cards or pass. Each card they play will reduce the number of cards to be drafted next, as well as be the additional stakes of the player. The cards played will also form a common pool of cards that players can use to form the best Fortune Hand. Once four cards have been played, players can either play the fifth and final card or draw and discard a card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discarded card can be stolen by other players, so players have to be careful with discards and the ever-increasing stakes as the game progresses. Once the fifth card is played, the players will compare Fortune Hands and the winner will score points based on stakes played and a Fortune Modifier. The game ends after every player has a chance to deal, or after a pre-agreed number of rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To excel in F3, you will need the cunning of a boardgame player, the opportunistic instincts of a Hold'em player, the tactical savvy of a Mahjong player, and the risk-taking skills of a Hanafuda player. The game's challenging scoring system provides many ways to score bonus points to showcase playing skills and abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To win cautiously or attempt to shoot for the moon, your Fortune is in your hands!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
