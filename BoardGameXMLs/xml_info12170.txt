			<description>Who's hungry for a Krabby Patty? SpongeBob SquarePants and his pals are! They are eager to collect as many colorform Krabby Patties as they can and race to reach the treasure chest full of gold! Now you can help the nautical crew roam around Bikini Bottom, making snacks along the way, adding or losing Krabby Patties at each destination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barnacles! You've just run into Plankton! Off to The Chum Bucket you go, where you lose a bunch of your Krabby Patties, causing plankton to laugh with glee. He is now one step closer to discover the secret recipe to Krabby Patties!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gather as many colorform Krabby Patties as you can and reach the treasure before everyone else. Should you make your way toward Sandy&amp;rsquo;s dome, or take the path to Patrick&amp;rsquo;s rock? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you get sidetracked along the way, someone else could get sidetracked too. And if you lose tons of Krabby Patties, just make your way toward Krusty Krab and gather more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who will get to the treasure first--SpongeBob, Patrick, Sand or Squidward? Larger than a regular game board, the super-size play mat is perfect for young ones!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just sailorific good times, this game reinforces important learning skills like counting, color matching, critical thinking and decision-making. It&amp;rsquo;s seaworthy adventure that your kids will love playing over and over!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
