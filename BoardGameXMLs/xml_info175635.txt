							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lords of Law</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Law and Order!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lords of Law brings you a dozen and one embodiments of absolute order. Careful, calculating, and efficient, the agents of law are as purposeful as they are relentless. They are not wholly emotionless, but their is a certain dispassionate aloofness that characterizes their interactions with one another and especially with others. Their analytical frankness often feels like condescending hauteur, but the lords of law tend to be disturbingly perceptive and brutally honest when it suits them. It is duty, purity, stability, and consistency that are their bywords, whether their goal is succor or slaughter of the innocent. This book contains a wide variety of ultra-lawful beings, from the near-angelic archons to the shadowy and sinister jangling kytons. You will find tiny servitors of order like lantern archons and augur kytons, up through footsoldiers like the hound archon and kyton to the glorious trumpet and star archons. Between such extremes of good and evil, and often beyond any conventional sense of morality other than the pursuit of perfection, this book also brings you a bevy of truly lawful beings, from the azer working the forge-fires of creation to the axiomites that record the calculus of the universe, and the race of inevitables from lowly arbiters to mighty maruts that monitor and judge the flow of reality and excise corruption and chaos wherever it is found. As if these were not enough, we also bring you the serpentine sakathan, a race of reptilian kings who sought order, dominion, and divinity over their home world but gave into diabolic temptation. These fallen god-kings became suzerain-slaves to the Lords of Hell, their new emissaries in bringing new worlds under the inflexible tyranny of purest law and blackest evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
