			<description>&amp;quot;Bio Menace is a 2D, side-scrolling, platform  game  both developed and published by Apogee Software in 1993 for DOS. It was built on a licensed version of id Software's Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons game engine, and was known as Bio Hazard during production. Apart from the engine, all in-game content was created by the game's designer, Jim Norwood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player controls the protagonist, Snake Logan, a top CIA operative. Upon receiving reports of Metro City being invaded by mutants, Snake is ordered to fly recon over the city. However, after crash landing in Metro City, Snake is forced to complete his mission on foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three episodes, the first of which was released as shareware, the rest being available commercially. The episodes are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Episode 1 - Dr. Mangle's Lab&lt;br/&gt;    * Episode 2 - The Hidden Lab&lt;br/&gt;    * Episode 3 - Master Cain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sales of the game were discontinued in 2000 due to problems with more modern operating systems.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Bio Menace , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
