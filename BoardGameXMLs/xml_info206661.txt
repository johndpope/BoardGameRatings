							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Quick Fixture</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A free, downloadable PDF, fast-play, solitaire soccer simulation for generating league tables (standings) and basic statistics. Quick Fixture was intended to be a companion to other more detailed, longer playing games, but many gamers enjoy just replaying a season using this game alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key statistics such as winning percentage, goals scored, and goals allowed are translated to team ratings for both home and away performance. In other words, each team is rated twice for a &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; season.  The team ratings make it easy to adjust for certain in-game events, such as injuries or playing short-handed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Select leagues and seasons are rated as &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; seasons, adding a bit more detail.  A complete season includes players rated in distribution ranges for goal scoring and for discipline (yellow/red cards) which adds a lot to the story of a match.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is for the solitaire gamer who wants to quickly generate realistic results and enjoy a league or tournament from a high-level, observer point of view. See the website below for more details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
