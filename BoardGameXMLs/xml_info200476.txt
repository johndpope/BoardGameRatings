							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hoop Nutz Pro Basketball</name>
									
			<description>Hoop Nutz Pro Basketball is a realistic fast-paced, simulation game played using dice and charts. Pro player's offensive and defensive abilities directly impact the action on each &amp;amp; every roll of the dice. Play head to head or solitaire and coach your favorite team to victory by maximizing your team's strengths while exploiting your opponent's weaknesses.&lt;br/&gt; Find yourself immersed in a world of momentum changing 3 pointers, fast-breaks, steals, soul-crushing blocks, clutch free throws and last second buzzer beaters. Your decisions are dictated by your team's style of play. Are you built to shoot three's, or do you have a dominant big man to feed in the paint? Do you thrive in transition, or are you better off patiently working the ball up the court? You'll need to know your team if you want a shot at championship glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
