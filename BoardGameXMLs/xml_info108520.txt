							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ESPN National Hockey Night</name>
									
			<description>In ESPN National Hockey Night, the player is cast right straight into NHL action on his TV screen. Like most ESPN games, there is an exhibition mode, a season mode, and a playoff mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AI of this game is very difficult, like a hockey equivalent of Super Bases Loaded. The side view makes it more tricky and the computer opponent can sneak in goals when the player thinks that he is secure in a tied game or in a game in which he is narrowly winning. Most of the notable NHL players from the 1990s are here complete with stats to make them more realistic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;ESPN National Hockey Night (game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is not to be confused with the game ESPN National Hockey Night which is for Playstation 2 and is a different game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
