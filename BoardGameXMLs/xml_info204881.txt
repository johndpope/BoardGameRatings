			<description>The world's first tabletop novella!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Way out West, in the coldest part of the Wintery Woods lived the ghosts of songs he never played anymore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things must be remembered. Ghosts must never fade. Songs will keep you alive, now that the world has ended...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Spell Saga ~ realmwalker ~ the world's first tabletop novella! This is a one player solo-style game with magical items, mysterious party members, &amp;amp; dangerous battles. There is no grinding for levels, as the game allows you to grow by exploring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ending of any realmwalker is always the same, but how you get there--and IF you get there, is up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, you get a few cards in your hand, as well as some on the action pile on the table. One of the major finds can be story cards, that move the story (and the game) along. This will also trigger some of the cards (including enemies) in the action pile! You can perform different actions by moving your adventurers to different places - once you have discovered them! The story cards will (eventually) tell you how you can win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
