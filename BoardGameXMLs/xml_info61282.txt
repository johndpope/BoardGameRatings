			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orange is the colour of Chaos, Disorder and Change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The power of Orange is in the ending, changing or manipulating of things. Those that master it can destroy, polymorph or change matter according to their whim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some few have the magical potential and right mindset (some might say wrong mindset) to draw power directly from the colour Orange. This ability usually ends up twisting them somewhat? if they were not already twisted. Those who persevere in this power might become Unmakers, a class that others might describe as a bunch of homicidal maniacs bend on destroying the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new Clerical or Mystical domains &lt;br/&gt;    a linked reclassification of one twelfth of the spells of the players handbook, with some new spell effects to fit the spells into Chromatic Magic Theory &lt;br/&gt;    a whole new character class, the Unmaker. This spellcaster doesn?t believe in study or even learning, but can draw upon pure chaotic magic, as well as developing rogue like skills and abilities (whenever they care to pay attention that is).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
