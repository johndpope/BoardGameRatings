							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aztecs: Empire of the Dying Sun</name>
									
			<description>At the dawn of time, Huitzilopochtli, in the form of a hummingbird ordered the children of the Sun to follow him to a new homeland. On a swampy island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, an eagle with a snake in its mouth, perched upon a cactus would mark the site of their new home. Upon this site, they would build the great city of Tenochtitlan, and found the greatest native empire in North America. And in gratitude for their prosperity, they offered sacrifices to their gods...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...sacrifices of human blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aztecs: Empire Of The Dying Sun is a complete d20 world guide detailing the setting of ancient Mexico in the period before the age of the Conquistadors. Aztecs: Empire Of The Dying Sun includes new feats, new skills, prestige classes, and information on character social classes, as well as information on the Aztec gods and the domains they provide to their priests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
