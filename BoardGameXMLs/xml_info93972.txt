							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crossroads: The Accident Prevention Game</name>
									
			<description>Crossroads is a children's game.  The aim is to be the first to move your token from your start space to the home space.  Dotted around the board are hazards which cause you to return to your start space.  The hazards include crashes, visiting the police station or visiting the hospital.  Movement is carried out by means of drawing cards and moving according to the instructions on the card which are a direction and distance.  In this manner, players must plan a route which does not hit a hazard or a dead end.  If a player is unable to move their token, they must return to their start space and discard their hand of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box: &amp;quot;An exciting and hazardous racing game for 2 to 6 younger players&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
