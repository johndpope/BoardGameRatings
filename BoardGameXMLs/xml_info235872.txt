							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Micro Game</name>
									
			<description>The 19th century empires of Russia and Britian engaged in a series of strategic conflicts in Central Asia known as The Great Game. Relive that history in only 18 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based loosely on the COIN system, the Great Micro Game features a solitaire variant known as K1M (Kiplings 1-Player Mode). Despite the name, this allows you to play as either the British or Russian Empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally an Entry for the 2015 18-Card Microgame Contest and the Mint Tin Contest, it won 1st place for Top 3 Designs by Guest Judge Chris Hansen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two editions of the game in the files section:&lt;br/&gt;Core Edition - This is the original entry that won the Mint Tin Contest Guest Judge Award. This is the more play-tested game and will likely be a better solo play experience&lt;br/&gt;Alternate Edition - This edition has a video explanation, some thematic tweaks, and a different rule set. I recommend this edition if you want to learn by video.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
