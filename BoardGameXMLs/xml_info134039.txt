							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Octopus&#039; Garden: Shark</name>
									
			<description>A promotional expansion for Octopus' Garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beauty Score --.  Add 1 Shark tile to the pool for each player.  The Shark may not be purchased.  Instead, when a Shark tile is put into the Marketplace, the Shark prevents players from purchasing its row and column and remains in the Marketplace for one whole round.  Players may each add a Pearl to the Shark tile to track how long it has been in the Marketplace.  There may never be more than one Shark tile in the Marketplace at a time- if a second Shark is drawn, the first is discarded and replaced with a random tile and the new Shark remains for a whole new round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
