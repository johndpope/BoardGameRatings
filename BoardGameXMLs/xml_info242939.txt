							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">American Truck Simulator - New Mexico</name>
									
			<description>Discover the subtle beauty of the New Mexico landscape. Its nickname - &amp;ldquo;Land of Enchantment&amp;rdquo; - fits perfectly. A lot of unique natural scenery will accompany you during all hauls, two trips will never feel the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drive through urbanized areas like Albuquerque, sparsely populated trading posts, rest stops in the middle of the desert, lush forests and mountain ranges. New Mexico has a lot to offer in terms of landscape variety. Cross Rio Grande, visit Carson National Forest, Baylor Peak, Pyramid Rock and other natural landmarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spend your night, rest, refuel and repair your truck on one of the many unique truck stops around New Mexico's highways. Admire the red sunsets while driving past recognizable monumental rock formations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Mexico (Navajo: Yoot&amp;oacute; Hahoodzo) is the fifth largest by area and the 36th most populous of the U.S. states. This corner-state has diverse nature which includes deserts, high plains, and mountains. The climate is generally semi-arid to arid because New Mexico has very little water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
