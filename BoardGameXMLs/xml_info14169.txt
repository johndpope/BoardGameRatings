							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Toot &amp; Puddle Game</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Toot and Puddle are best friends. Toot is a traveler, and Puddle is a homebody. They both love adventures - just different kinds. In this game, you go along with Toot while he sees the world. But don't forget about Puddle, who is home having fun in his own backyard. Mail him a postcard, telling him all about Toot's adventures abroad. Travel along the path, from Africa to Italy, and all the way back home to Puddle. The game ends when all the players reach 'Home'.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with four postcards. Players roll and move along a track with some spaces that include a stamp symbol. If the player has the matching postcard, it can be mailed home. The game can be played in competitive mode or cooperative mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components include 4 stand-up player characters, two packets of miniature postcards, a miniature mailbox to mail the postcards, a single color swatch die, and the gameboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
