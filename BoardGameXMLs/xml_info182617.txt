							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BattleCON: Takeshi Kamikaze Promo</name>
									
			<description>A crossover promotional character created by Fabio Fontes, Takeshi Kamikaze has a stash of eight different weapon cards which he cycles through as the match progresses, each giving him radically different stat bonuses and penalties. With his various weapons giving him wildly different stats, Takeshi performs drastically different when wielding a baseball bat compared to a minigun compared to a butterfly knife, and this combined with the ease at which he permanently discards one weapon to pick up another makes a fight with Takeshi a dramatic and unpredictable affair to participate in. Pick the right weapon for the immediate situation and use it as a silver bullet -- or, pick the one that gives your opponent the most fits, and use it as a can opener to pry them open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
