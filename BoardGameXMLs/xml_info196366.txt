							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Footfall</name>
									
			<description>Footfall is a game which places the player in charge of their very own fledgling shoe shop. Aimed at a 14-19-year-old audience, the game focuses on entrepreneurship and financial literacy and is designed to demonstrate the social, environmental and financial impact of decisions made when running a small start-up business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of Footfall is to create a sustainable business through the careful management of budget and stock, the daring design of the shoes themselves and the sourcing of manufacturing. Get it right and the profits and the profile go up and up. Get it wrong and the press will have a field day and your reputation will be in tatters for using unethical materials and child labour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Footfall features eight shoe designers and sixteen manufacturing options where you can make over 100 never-before-seen shoes designs, including the Conker loafer, Candyfloss high heels and Steam-Punk snow boots. Select and stock the perfect window display and generate sales from a trend-obsessed public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
