							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Wilden Kerle: Tor</name>
									
			<description>A light soccer/card game with Die Wilden Kerlte theme. Players simultaneously select one card each turn from their hand (they have 7-7 cards there out of two identical sets of 14 cards). The player with the winning card advances the soccer ball on the play field, with the ball moving back and forth until one player scores. Comes with small soccer field game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a reimplementation of Tor with many important differences:&lt;br/&gt;- Instead of 13 cards (value 1-13) both player has 15 cards that are rather different from the original cards. These include 2 &amp;quot;Tor&amp;quot; (goalkeeper) cards that block movement of the ball, one &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; card that wins over &amp;quot;7&amp;quot;s and 12 cards with the values 2-7 (two of each). &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; cards have a special power: when they are played, the lower card wins.&lt;br/&gt;- In the original, players had all their cards in hand. In this version they have only 7 cards in hand and redraw their hand to 7 when the turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;- If two equal cards are played, the ball is not moved, but the given battle is not resolved yet - both players choose another card until one card dies. Then the ball moves as many fields as the number of cards played by one player in the winning direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
