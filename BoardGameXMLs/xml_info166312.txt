							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Triera</name>
									
			<description>Triera &amp;ndash; the dynamic vertical platformer with lots of bonuses and generated unique levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An error occurs on a huge interplanetary spaceship called Triera, with four levels of robot-inhabited cities. The error leads to weird changes of all cities. The robot-manufacturing plant starts to produce new robots with malfunctions. All survived robots have to hide on a zero level, while other levels are already inhabited with zombie robots. All service stations in the cities got destroyed. Triera is at the self-vanishing point. But there is a way out: the only service station still exists on a zero level. But will the mechanic robot have a chance to reach the central panel and find out the reasons of this failure? Will he be able to reset the spaceship&amp;rsquo;s control system?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
