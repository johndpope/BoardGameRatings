			<description>When a young schoolboy gets stranded on a remote old planet, a unique and eccentric journey begins. His search for a way off the planet takes him through cities and castles, attics and space stations into a dreamlike yet dangerous world. Along the way, he outsmarts a variety of malicious robots bent on stopping him and, befriends unlikely allies that start to shed light on a huge conspiracy that keeps the planet mesmerized and prevents him from ever reaching home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pid adventure&lt;br/&gt;Pid is a platform adventure game in which the player is given a rich set of features that he must use and combine to survive in the world. A wide variety of fast paced action, puzzles and precision platforming forces the player to creatively master the tools at hand. Gameplay situations can always be solved in tons of alternative ways and the rich contrast between the different locations challenges the player to adapt to enemies that demands new strategies and methods. &lt;br/&gt; Unique platforming moves&lt;br/&gt;The core feature in Pid allows players to manipulate a powerful force that can be used to maneuver around the levels in thousands of unique ways. To top it off, it completely changes the way you maneuver within a 2d world. It's also used to move enemies and objects, deflect bullets, activate machinery and change level layouts. Mastering the use of this core feature will turn everything you know about platforming upside down. &lt;br/&gt; Travel with a friend&lt;br/&gt;In Pid, two players can experience the adventure together. In coop-mode, players are expected to truly cooperate in order to safely advance through the levels. Both are highly dependent on the other, and even if friendly cooperation is a must, there is plenty of room to wildly compete and test your retro skills against your friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
