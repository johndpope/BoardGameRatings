			<description>Game rules postscript:&lt;br/&gt;We are the cursed of the world.  Forgotten gods in mortal suits.  May they never remember us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything they tell you are lies.  There are monsters out there.  Magic is Real.  There are places beyond this dimension.  The world is stranger than you think.  But there are no grand organizations ruling from the shadow, no secret society that uses nations as puppets.  The world is run by human hands, now we must find a place in it and hope they don't notice us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Cursed RPG you play a human who has not only learned the truth that the world is not as sane or structured as people want to believe, you play a human who can bend reality with his will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this is everything necessary to play the Cursed RPG including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Complete Rule System&lt;br/&gt;    Character Creation Rules&lt;br/&gt;    Seven Classes of Cursed&lt;br/&gt;    Description of Monsters, Other Realms, Organizations, and Secret Societies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Creature Stats, more Bonuses and Penalties, Variant Classes of Cursed, and other Extras go to [game website].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
