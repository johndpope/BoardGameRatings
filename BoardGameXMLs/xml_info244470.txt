							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">20 Clues: World Geography</name>
									
			<description>20 Question style cards based on world geography, including a window-board with the numbers 1-20, to keep track of guesses. Reader chooses a random card, reads the category (&amp;quot;I am a land region,&amp;quot; for example), and players take turns choosing a number. Reader reads the clue corresponding to that number (in this example, clue number 13 is: &amp;quot;The name the Indians gave me means &amp;quot;'Ground Afire'&amp;quot;), and that player takes a single guess at the answer. If wrong, play progresses to next player (if multiple players). If correct, the player wins points equal to 20-the number of clues required to guess the answer. Play continues until one player or team reaches 50, or some other predetermined point total. Alternatively, a set number of cards or a time limit can be set, and highest points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Target areas range from very obvious (Pacific Ocean) to slightly obscure (Denali National Park).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
