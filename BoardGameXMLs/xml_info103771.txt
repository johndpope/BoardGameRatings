			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tome of Devotion contains two brand new prestige classes along with additional feats and features designed to give spiritual characters the opportunity to delve into near fanatical frenzy in order to bring down their enemies and the unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included is the new prestige class of Zealot, a tank-y character who loves and seeks pain, and wants to share it with as many people as possible! If you ever wanted to be a religious fanatic who gains power from taking or inflicting damage upon yourself, you are in for a treat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If hunting ghosts, ghouls and demons is more your style, then pull out your shaky handicam and get ready for the new prestige class, the Exorcist. A truly devastating character against anything evil, corrupted or chaotic, the exorcist is a glass cannon of pain and holy blue flames! Tired of having things interrupt your slumber by going bump in the night? If life gives you possessed lemons, you DEMAND they take them back, and purge the land of all that would stand in your path!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are additional feats that can help Clerics fight the good fight, as well as an additional class feature!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give yourself up to your faith, and smite those who would laugh and call you names!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
