							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Organizations: Crime and Punishment</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do You Know The Secret Password?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modern world is filled with groups--social clubs, unions, political parties, professional organizations, and even secret cabals. Name any topic, occupation, or creed has and it is sure to have its own organization, perhaps several. Modern Organizations details dozens of organizations that heroes are likely to encounter in just about any modern campaign setting. In addition to the organizations, you'll also meet the personalities behind the groups and find rules materials that are thematically linked to the organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Organizations: Crime and Punishment covers groups on both sides of the law as well as some that straddle the line. Inside, you'll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Details on groups from the mysterious assassins of the House of Dusk to the vigilantes in the Shield of Justice.&lt;br/&gt;     Characters like Solomon &amp;quot;Big Solly D&amp;quot; Dimitriano and fourth-generation policeman Captain Anton Dwyer, each with character backgrounds and stat blocks.&lt;br/&gt;     New game options, including new rules for bribery, action points, and sneak attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
