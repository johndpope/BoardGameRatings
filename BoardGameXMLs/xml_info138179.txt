							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fuji&#039;s World</name>
									
			<description>The objective of Fuji's World is to be the first to obtain the required number of victory points. To obtain vicory points, players try to open branches of Fuji and put a number of products on the market there.&lt;br/&gt;There are four regions where you can open branches. Each region consists of several countries. The aim is to market a complete set of products in a country. A product set consists of photo paper, film rolls, offset plates and R&amp;amp;D.&lt;br/&gt;If you market all the products in a country, your competitors no longer have a chance and you gain a victory point. But until that moment, you can lose your branch at any time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Invest and conquer new markets for our Fuji Tilburg products! This is what Fuji's World is all about. This game has been specially developed as a Christmas gift for all personnel and temporary staff at Fuji Tilburg. Not just for them, either: it is also important that those at home feel involved with Fuji. We hope that Fuji's World will provide the basic for many exciting family evenings and perhaps it will lead to new inspiration for achieving our objectives.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
