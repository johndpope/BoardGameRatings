			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is  Everdark ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everdark is a 2-4 player semi co-operative rotating maze strategy game where teamwork is encouraged but by no means guaranteed. Players are given events to complete that are located around the city board. They have to navigate their way to these locations by moving their character and twisting the rings on the board. Any areas that are not defended succumb to darkness and the maze becomes harder to navigate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a mid-level game taking around 60-90 minutes to play. The length of the game can depend on the rule variation used by players. The key reasoning for that is that the use of the timer (whilst recommended) is not compulsory. This, among other rules, allows flexibility among players to play Everdark in a way of their own choosing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
