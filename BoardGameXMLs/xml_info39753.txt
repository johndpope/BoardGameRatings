							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doctor Who Weetabix Action Game</name>
									
			<description>Game given away free with Weetabix Cereal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple roll die and move game, with the addition of 'Action Zones' on the boards which may contain a different enemy every game that have different effects on a player who lands on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to get from a starting area to the Tardis first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game had a total of 4 different boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race Through Space&lt;br/&gt;With Skaro, Metebelis III &amp;amp; the Timelords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel Through Time&lt;br/&gt;With the Mandragoran Helix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover the Lost Planet&lt;br/&gt;With the Thals, dinosaurs and the Skarasen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escape from the Underworld&lt;br/&gt;With Silurians and U.N.I.T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also came with stand up character cards ranging from Wirrn to Krynoids. Most creatures are from the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who, with a few Jon Pertwee characters making an appearance. Such as an Exxilon &amp;amp; Aggedor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards were placed in the 'Action Zones' and may help or hinder the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forgetting the simple roll &amp;amp; move nature of the game, the art work by Gordon Archer was excellent. The game also had a number of monsters/characters that will not be found in the other Doctor Who games which normally come with the regular Daleks &amp;amp; Cybermen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least one of the game boards (Escape from the Underworld)was released as a seperate game by the BBC and could be found in Doctor Who Easter Show bags in Australia around 1978.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
