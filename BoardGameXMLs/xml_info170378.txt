							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Duplicitous Acts: The Masquerade Continues</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of the fey can be a wonderful and wicked realm cloaked in secrets no mortals are normally granted access, the Masquerade. This supplement introduces three new arcane archetypes, feats, spells and rituals that grants access to this world and the powers it contains. So whether you are an earnest mountebank or a beguiling harlequin, you have found a key to the realm of the fey and the powers and awe of the masquerade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement builds upon the idea of the fey mask first presented by Convergent Paths: Fey Archetypes with the introduction of the Masquerade Reveler archetype. It was later expanded by The Secrets of the Masquerade Reveler which reprinted the archetype and included several pre-configured masks and new powers that could be used for them. The mechanic introduced is expanded in Duplicitous acts to open the masquerade to the classes of the arcane including the sorcerer, witch, and wizard. Neither product from Rite Publishing is required for this supplement but both are reasonably priced and excellent products for players or game masters looking to introduce more of the mysterious realm of the fey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
