			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SMASH THE AXIS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Golden Age of Superheroes began in 1938, when a new kind of hero emerged from the pages of comic books in full color for a dime! Now you can experience high-flying adventure set in the days before, during, and after the Second World War, fighting for justice and freedom while armies march and cities burn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darren Watts&amp;rsquo;s Golden Age Champions 6th Edition expands the Champions Universe back to the earliest days of the Modern Age of Heroes, and includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; a thorough examination of the Golden Age as a genre, with discussions of the types of stories, themes and characters appropriate to the period (and how and why to break those rules when you need to!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; a detailed history and description of the world of the Golden Age, including a monthly timeline spanning from 1938 to 1949 covering Politics &amp;amp; War, Science &amp;amp; Technology, Arts &amp;amp; Entertainment, Life &amp;amp; Times, Crime &amp;amp; Weirdness, and the history of the Champions Universe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; an extensive section on creating Golden Age characters, including a thorough discussion of archetypes, seventeen character templates, and information on Skills, Talents and Perks for the era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; twenty-seven heroes and thirty-seven villains, from all sides of the war and every corner of the world (and a few other worlds besides!), along with information about the activities of characters from the modern Champions Universe during the period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; the guns, vehicles and gear of the Golden Age, both real-world and madly scientific!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; advice on how to run long-term campaigns set in the Golden Age, from a GM who has run several that lasted for years!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So buy some war bonds, plant your Victory Gardens, and Keep &amp;lsquo;Em Flying, Heroes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Note: Electronic version also contains character sheets for Savage Worlds and Mutants &amp;amp; Masterminds in a single Zip file!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
