			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martin is a bachelor and sculptor struggling to make a living in the city. He specializes in modelling human figures, and often hires people to pose for him in his studio. To him, they are just models, and his interest in them is solely for the purpose of his art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One evening, he receives an envelope in the mail. The envelope is unmarked except for the numbers 1011 scribbled in a corner. Inside is a strange photo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soon after, Martin finds himself in a different world, where time and space mean nothing, and ghosts from the past will not die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
