			<description>This is a trivia game all about history, which is why the name of the game is Clio, the muse of History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of three concentric circles, each with a track on it. Every fourth square on the track has an icon. If you answer a question correctly on an icon square, you get a marker. When you have three markers, you get to move to the next circle. The questions are divided into the categories Ancient, Medieval, 1500s, 1600s, 1700s, 1800s, and 1900s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The questions, like in most trivia games, range from pretty easy to downright impossible. The questions as such are usually OK, but unfortunately the quality of the proofreading is very low. There are lots of spelling errors, strange grammar, layout mistakes and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only three pawns included in the game, but there are no problems to play with more people; just add a few more pawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
