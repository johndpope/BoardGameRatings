			<description>Before the German blitzkrieg stormed across Europe in 1939-40, a group of elite soldiers prepared the way by seizing bridges and other strategic targets ahead of the attack. In the following years, these warrior-spies, known as the Brandenburgers, operated behind enemy lines around the globe, from Russia and Yugoslavia to Egypt, Iraq, and India, Often bending the rules of war while completing their daring covert missions. Trained to be mobile and independent, steeped in foreign languages and customs, and expert in numerous military specialties, the Brandenburgers influenced the world's special forces long after World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brandenburg is a tactical wargame for up to three players, depicting the actions of the German commando force throughout the entire WWII. The game's map is assembled using hexagonal tiles, a method which simulates the fog of war and increases the game's replayability over time. Counters represent individual units, with specialized infantry (soldiers, medics, engineers, scouts and snipers) able to pack, equip and use a wide variety of weapons and gear to carry out their missions. Civilians, agents and partisans populate the conflict zone, acting as influential factors capable of tilting the balance of power to either side's favor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
