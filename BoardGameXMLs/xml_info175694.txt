			<description>Feirmeoir is a simulation of the Irish Potato famine in game form. The object of the game is to build the greatest family by accumulating the most points by the end of the game (or beating &lt;br/&gt;your previous single player high score).  The year is 1844 and you are a young Irish couple. You have just been given your first plot of land as a wedding gift from your parents. There are many &lt;br/&gt;plots for sale, so be sure to pick the best spot! Your parents and neighbors can help you out by building your first two room Peat House, but from then on you are on your own. The nearby &lt;br/&gt;village will provide you with all you need to start your own farm, and hopefully a family.  Make sure you prepare well, there is no telling what hardships await you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
