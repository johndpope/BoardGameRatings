			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Birthday R.J. is a dinner party murder mystery game for 11 to 15 guests and a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us in a thrilling evening of scheming, double-dealing and big, big shoulder pads. You will be in the middle of the action and it will be up to you to wheel and deal with the other guests. Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive Happy Birthday R.J.? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is 1984 and the height of the oil boom. Harrington Oil is the most successful oil company in the state of Texas. Tonight is a lavish birthday party for R.J. Harrington held at his parents' ranch - SouthSpoon. What could possibly spoil such a joyous occasion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Birthday R.J. lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible, to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (95 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests, a copy of the Perm Creek Town Newsletter - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?60&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
