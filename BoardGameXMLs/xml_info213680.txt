			<description>Deep in the jungle there are a lot of adventures for the players. Hunt the ruby of the maharadja, rare animals and even more. There are 15 goals the children can choose for the game. To win the children have to discover secrets, hunt animals and catch criminals. Only if they read the hints carefully and understand they they&amp;rsquo;ve got a chance to get to their goal. They have to play as a team and read out the hints on the cardboards they get. The tiptoi pen always supports the players and plays authentic sounds and stories of the jungle to create a great ambience around the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
