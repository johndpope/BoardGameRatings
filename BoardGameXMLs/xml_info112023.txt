							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mad Wench Maelgatryx</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the face of nightmare. (It ain't pretty.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The words &amp;quot;that witch&amp;quot; are too nice to describe the walking calamity that is The Mad Wench Maelgatryx. She's a voodoo-practicing master of hexes, the booze-slinging proprietor of The Rotgut Cauldron, and a miscreant so outrageous she could make even the Khan of Nightmares blush. Whether she brings ruin to a party by unleashing a living hell of spells, or just by showing up, a few rounds with The Mad Wench Maelgatryx is sure to be an unforgettable experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Game Masters with details on an unruly and unpleasant character found amongst the Faces of the Tarnished Souk, ready for immediate use in any campaign - but especially for use within the Coliseum Morpheuon. Each entry features ingenious stat-blocks from multiple OGL sources, history, motivation, secrets, and insight into the NPC's most carefully guarded dreams, along with complete game statistics for low, middle, and high levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Mad Wench Maelgatryx, a vexatious voodoo villain.&lt;br/&gt;    CR 20 Female rune-carved rakshasa-spawned tiefling barbarian (drunken brute) 1/witch 16&lt;br/&gt;    CR 14 Female rune-carved rakshasa-spawned tiefling barbarian (drunken brute) 1/witch 10&lt;br/&gt;    CR 7 Female rakshasa-spawned tiefling barbarian (drunken brute) 1/witch 5 Manjamanja, her cacodaemon familiar&lt;br/&gt;    New feats for tieflings, witches, and anybody who wants a shrunken head&lt;br/&gt;    A new witch's patron, perfect for Coliseum Morpheuon&lt;br/&gt;    New, unique magic items for a girl just wanting to get a head (or two)&lt;br/&gt;    Rune-carved creature template&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for variant tieflings&lt;br/&gt;    And spells from Rite Publishing's critically acclaimed 101 Spells series!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
