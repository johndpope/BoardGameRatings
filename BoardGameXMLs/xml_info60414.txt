			<description>Players move their counters which represent automobiles along a track which represents countryside.  Landing on hazards delays their trip.  There is nothing original to the game itself but the incidental art and particularly the detailed die cast metal early autos create a nice feel for the early days of motoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book states it is printed in Germany, but is not clear where the components were manufactured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
