							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Warlord Games</name>
									
			<description>Warlord is a small set of rules and 5 different piece types that are used in a series of scenarios. Each scenario is a structured multi-move abstract strategy game of battle using a unique board and setup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Armies of 30 - 35 pieces are commanded by half a dozen leaders, any 4 of which may be active in a turn. Active leaders may move themselves or any friendly piece within 2 squares that has not already moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the 5 pieces has a different simple short range move, and each captures an enemy piece by legally moving onto the enemy square, stopping, then removing the enemy piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win by capturing half of your enemy's leaders before half of yours are taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
