							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Queen of the Drowned Ones: Driftwood &amp; Drowning-Pits</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The disturbing discovery of the first corpse adrift close to Waterdeep had provoked quite an impact when brought to port. On the pier was lying the bloated body of a man tied to a crude driftwood raft, a man who had been branded with a red-hot iron, ritually sacrificed to Umberlee by drowning. So the priest of the Moonmaiden who had examined the corpse and asked questions to the poor soul had said. Now, those makeshift rafts coming from the north with their grim burdens appear daily, the mariners and fishermen alike dreading the ocean and the Bitch Queen beyond measure. Few ships dare to set sail at all, which compromises trade with Neverwinter, Waterdeep&amp;rsquo;s closest ally. The fishmongers&amp;rsquo; carts stand empty and in the taverns seadogs tell the darkest tales. Who will boldly ride the waves northwardly alongshore the rugged Sword Coast to stop the ones perpetrating such abhorrent human sacrifices in Umberlee&amp;rsquo;s name?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2nd - 3rd level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
