			<description>A game within the Dablo(t) family. Related to the Sami boardgame Dablot Prejjesne and to Dablo Daares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theme: Abstract game with soldiers and kings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: Turnbased checkers type of game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal of the game: Either to capture the enemy king or reduce his forces so that only the king remains&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules: All pieces move by single steps and can capture, by the short leap, in all directions. The soldier (&amp;quot;d&amp;aring;rake&amp;quot;) can only step in the three forward directions. Promotion does not occur. For the soldier, capture is mandatory. For the king (&amp;quot;g&amp;aring;nneka&amp;quot;) capture is optional. One can only capture a piece of the same rank or lower. Where the king is of higher rank than the soldier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A piece moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy piece, of the same rank or lower, and the point directly behind is vacant, then one may jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a single turn. Dablo Frostviken follows the same rules. For soldiers a capture is mandatory. For the king a capture is optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
