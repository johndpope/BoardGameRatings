			<description>On The Green Golf is a hole-by-hole simulation that brings together the detail of a shot-by-shot game with the quick-play of a round-by-round game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golfers are rated for their ability to reach greens in regulation, going for the green, sand saves, and eagles.  Holes are rated for their effect on scoring, and have been painstakingly rated to account for the major hazards and features that will challenge golfers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes an optional (but highly recommended) weather system that modifies dice rolls for weather and wind, pin placements, and user setting of rough (although a die roll could also make that determination).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a QuickPlay system that allows players the ability to play a round in just three dice rolls for each golfer.  This gives players the opportunity to complete entire tournaments in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the best part about the QuickPlay system is that you can mix-and-match the three QuickPlay options (full round, nine-hole version, and six-hole version) to QuickPlay some of each round, then switch to the regular game to play out exciting finishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- 2005 men's golfer set (202 cards)&lt;br/&gt;-- Six courses (Augusta, Baltusrol, The Belfry, Pinehurst, Sawgrass, and St. Andrews)&lt;br/&gt;-- Weather and Course Condition Cards&lt;br/&gt;-- Suspense Charts&lt;br/&gt;-- QuickPlay Charts for all six courses&lt;br/&gt;-- Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available in two formats:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) E-Game Format via Hot Stove Games:  We send you the files, you print the components using your own equipment or local print shop.
