			<description>Steel Towers is a game of city building, monster attacks, and high profits! After years of relentless attacks by aliens, gorillas, and monsters, Scraper City has finally banished these nuisances to a holding facility in the next state, where they are controlled by electronic collars. Downtown is ready to grow again! As real estate moguls in this once-again booming city, players compete to make the most money by building Skyscrapers to attract rent-paying tenants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the Skyscrapers that make the most money are in the best Neighborhoods. Players hold cards which give them the right to build Skyscrapers along specific streets, while attracting valuable Businesses, knocking down unsightly Abandoned Buildings, and cleaning up Junkyards. However, the moguls try to foil each other by taking control of Mutant Monsters, Giant Gorillas, or Alien Attacks, making construction in Scraper City perilous at best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel game mechanic for determining revenue from Skyscrapers at the end of each turn means that the most thoughtful strategy will prevail! The winning mogul is the one with the most money after ten years (turns) of building and collecting rent. Steel Towers is a unique game with easy-to-learn rules, but deep strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
