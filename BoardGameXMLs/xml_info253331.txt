			<description>Originally these heroes were only available during the B-seiged: Sons of the Abyss Kickstarter campaign. For the 2018 CMON Expo 3 pack sets were given away as promo sets in the swag bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This box numbered BSG-KS04 includes the three heroes Eivor, Thorlak, and Donatto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BSG-KS04 promo introduces three brand-new Heroes to defend the Citadel of Modhelm: Thorlak, the barbarian; Eivor, the noble; Donatto, the cook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thorlak, the Barbarian is all about channeling his inner rage! With his Uncontrolled Wrath Special Ability, he's able to roll 2 extra dice when he attacks Zone 1 (for a total of 3 dice, as each Hero is able to roll 1 die innately) - enabling him to clear many Krohns storming the walls as he bellows savagely. His Base Strength of 3 ensures that he's strong enough to deal with Elite enemies and M&amp;ouml;lens without needing Bonus Strength. But all of his savagery comes at a price: Thorlak can't store Permanent Cards, and therefore can't equip Armor or Weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a veteran of many battles, Eivor, the Noble boasts a Base Strength of 2, which enables him to deal with the Elite versions of Krohns and Gargohs from the very start of the game. Eivor's Persuasion starting Special Ability grants an extra Gold when he visits the Palace - and this extra Gold may be given to another Hero if he chooses to do so. With this ability, the entire group of Heroes may benefit, as the extra Gold that's shared can make the difference, enabling a Hero to use a vital Resource Card! Lastly, as a lord of the city, Eivor can more quickly level up due to lower Food costs requirements, which will make him an even more valuable asset in the siege!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With his Cook Extraordinaire Special Ability, Donatto gains an extra Food everytime he visits the Barn in the Citadel, and this extra Food may be given to another Hero of his choice. Having the famous chef on the team will ease the pressure to get Food each Season for the entire team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
