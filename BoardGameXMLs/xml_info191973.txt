			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Shingal!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After years of persecution and discrimination on Earth, on the worlds of Earth Sector, and in the settled areas of Clement Sector, a group of Yazidis decided to leave the civilized worlds and colonize a new homeworld.  Setting in the AXO-305 system in the Solon Subsector of Ariel Sector, the Yazidi separatists founded the independent colony of Shingal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Worlds 27: Shingal comes with detailed descriptions and maps of the Shingal system and the planet itself.  UWPs and a map of the Solon subsector are also included to provide a basis for future adventures in this unsettled frontier.  It also features political, legal, and cultural details designed to get your characters directly immersed into the action as fast as possible!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Worlds 27: Shingal has been designed with the busy Referee in mind.  Shingal is an interesting and exciting place that can be easily added into any existing Traveller campaign.  While Shingal has been designed to fit into our Clement Sector setting, it can be easily adapted to fit into any Traveller campaign with ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
