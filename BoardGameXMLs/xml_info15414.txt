			<description>Tee it up- the funtastic game of golf for 2-6 players is a roll and move game that consists of 3 dice- blue driving dice, green fairway dice, yellow putting dice, tee markers, bonus trap pass cards, sand trap cards, a pad of score sheets, pencil, wooden trophy and game board.  The object of the game is to roll and move along the gameboard adding up strokes for each hole along the way and end the game by being the golfer with the lowest number of strokes.  Winner takes the trophy.  Scoring is determined by &amp;quot;tee-offs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fairway shots&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;putting shots&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;obstacles&amp;quot;. NOTE:  This game also features a &amp;quot;Sudden Death&amp;quot; playoff to break any ties. &amp;quot;Sudden Death&amp;quot; playoff is agreed upon between golfers aka players and then three consecutive holes on the gameboard could be selected for this purpose.  Lowest number of strokes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
