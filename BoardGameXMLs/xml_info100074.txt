			<description>From the manual:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It is the 31st Century The President of the World has died unexpectedly at the young age of 281 after nearly 200 years of peaceful rule,leaving the United World Federation in chaos. The World Party has been in control for almost four centuries, but now the International Party wants to take over. Rumours that the President's death was not accidental cannot be confirmed, but the World Party is on the defensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the conventional warfare of the uncivilized past is now obsolete,the two parties are gearing up to settle the dispute in a more modern way--an all-or-nothing game of ROBO-SQUASH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is your civic duty as Champion of the World Party to compete against the International Party's Champion. If you win, the World Party will remain in control and world unity will continue. If you lose,the International Party will divide the world into individual nations, setting up the same kinds of senseless petty disputes that nearly destroyed the world back in the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Federation Peace depends on your abilities. Can you handle the pressure? You must, otherwise civilization may be doomed.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
