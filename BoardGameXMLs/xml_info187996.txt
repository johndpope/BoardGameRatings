							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Admin Toolkit: Agency Uniforms</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the White Lies RPG, players can armor their agents with three grades of protective gear. While this is functional in game mechanics terms, it's not very interesting to imagine. Admins should encourage their players to describe their armor in ways such as &amp;quot;leather jacket&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bulletproof vest&amp;quot; or even &amp;quot;tactical military armor.&amp;quot; But being descriptive isn't the only way one can customize the protection their agent wears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spies like gadgets. In the equipment chapter of the core rulebook there are specific upgrades available to weapons and vehicles to add spy features to them, making them unique while expanding the capability of the agent. Armor should be no different. In this light supplement, agents can be provided or can purchase a new classification of protective gear: the Agency Uniform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What makes the uniform unique isn't just that it can look like anything the player wishes (bespoke suits, tactical security gear, even disguises). What makes the uniform unique is that it can be equipped with any number of standardized agency upgrades, such as gecko pads, faraday weaves, defensive bracers, concealed parachutes, and white noise emitters. Gadget up your agent with the Agency Uniform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
