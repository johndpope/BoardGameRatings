			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight Heroes Ready to Battle through Savage Science to the Stars!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal Heroes is our sixth set of 8 ready-to-play pregenerated 1st level characters created specifically to shine in a Metal Gods Adventure Path but ideal for any campaign venturing into the marvelous mash-up of the fantastical and the futuristic! Ideal for use as allies, cohorts, long-running NPCs, or replacement player characters, superstar author Neil Spicer brings you amazingly detailed and lushly developed characters including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Ander Six, android slayer&lt;br/&gt;    Bersaivius Mendren, human blood arcanist growing his own tumor familiar&lt;br/&gt;    Drunah Dagur, human bloodrager&lt;br/&gt;    Falston Katcherby, gnome preservationist alchemist&lt;br/&gt;    Tavarest Ivaine, oread cleric of the Goddess of Invention&lt;br/&gt;    Kheldric Lybrien, human steel hound investigator&lt;br/&gt;    Lyel Vergess, human pistolero gunslinger&lt;br/&gt;    and last but not least, the clever and conniving Rikka Nufhari, ratfolk burglar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built according to organized play specifications, using the 20-point-buy method and with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just piles of statistics. Each one is as much about story as combat, with robust links built in to each other as well as the official Metal Gods Adventure Path, though every one easily stands on its own in any setting where savage barbarians battle technological terrors. The crunch for every character more than measures up to its incredible flavor text, though, and when it&amp;rsquo;s time to throw down in combat none of these Metal Heroes will be stepping to the sidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character includes a detailed backstory, roleplaying tips, special equipment, and links to the published campaign, including a campaign trait selection from the Pirate Adventure Path player&amp;rsquo;s guide. Each also lists detailed level advancement information for their first few levels, with further suggestions for developing the character's long-term mechanical build. We haven't even mentioned the fantastic character portraits courtesy of Bob Greyvenstein, or the included foldable paper miniatures for every character!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking for terrific characters where sci-fi meets fantasy, download this 42-page product today and Make Your Game Legendary!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
