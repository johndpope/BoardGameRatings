			<description>ZOND, named for the Soviet manned lunar orbital program, is an easy to play game of worker/resource management and action selection, featuring an idealized view of the Space Race, beginning in 1957 and ending in 1987, by which time the Soviets had confidently predicted that they would be launching a manned mission to Mars. Players may represent the American, Chinese, European, Soviet, or Zambian (!) Space Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player interaction is based upon strategic action selection and the use of an Espionage Deck, reflecting various game altering events, conditions, and missions that may be used to assist or slow the progress of the various space programs represented in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a tongue in cheek game, based upon idealized history, and while many of the events and actions are based upon historical fact, it should not be misconstrued as a straight laced simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
