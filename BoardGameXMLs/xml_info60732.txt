							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thrash 1.8</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Violent fighting to begin again!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the book's opening:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Thrash is a book-and-dice RPG that deals with anime and fighting game style martial arts. This main rulebook presents only general rules, info on real-world martial arts, and some general fighting game info, though additional sourcebooks will deal with an assortment of popular fighting game worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thrash system is heavily based on the now out-of-print Street Fighter Storytelling Game from White Wolf, as well as Mekton Z, and, to a lesser extent, Ninjas and Superspies. The martial arts and the whole system are designed to simulate both fighting games and anime and manga based on them, the result being a highly cinematic game with lots of nifty special moves, energy blasts galore, and so forth.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
