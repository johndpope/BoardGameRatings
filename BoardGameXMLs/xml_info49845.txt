			<description>(from the back cover)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaming After Death&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creatures of the Other World are all around us. Some were once alive. Some were created by human imagination. And some are completely inhuman but thirst for our souls. GURPS Spirits is a complete guide to the spirit realm and its inhabitants. It includes a catalog of spirits from around the world: angels, demons, djinn, dryads, ghosts, loas, manitou, raksasha, and many, many more. It is also a campaign guide for characters who see spirits, serve them, use them... or fight them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included: an expanded version of the ritual magic rules first seen in GURPS Voodoo, as a system for spirit-mediated magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No horror roleplaying campaign is complete without a ghostly apparition, the rattle of chains in the dead of night, or a malevolent spirit wreaking havoc. And creatures of GURPS Spirits can be used in many other types of campaigns, too - from the questing knights of old to the galactic explorers of tomorrow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spirits Are Here...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
