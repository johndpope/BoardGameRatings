							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">50 Motivators for Pirate Era Characters</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pirate era flavored version of Fishwife Games&amp;rsquo; motivator lists. From the simple dock worker and tavern wench to pirate captains and local rulers, all characters are driven by some sort of goal, mentality, or other form of motivation. Is the motivator something as raw and basic as greed, bloodlust, or starvation? Is the character motivated by some greater cause, such as the quest to find a lost city, sworn loyalty to a ruler, or a mission to discover and map uncharted islands? Maybe perhaps the character is a wanted fugitive on the run or charged with acts of treason in their home land? Need a motivator for a character? Then roll the percentile dice a time or two and consult this chart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
