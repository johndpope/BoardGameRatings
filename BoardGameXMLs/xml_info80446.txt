							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Weimar:  German Politics 1929-1933</name>
									
			<description>October, 1929: The Republic is crumbling. With the death of Gustav Stresemann on October 3, 1929 and the crash of the American Stock Exchange, Germany's recovery from the devastating Great War now is in doubt. Communist, Fascist and Republican forces clash over ideology and erupt into a war of words and violence. Unemployment begins to spiral out of control while the German people grow restless. Rallies are held by charismatic leaders as lawmakers struggle to find answers. Amongst the chaos, a new figure will head the German nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weimar: German Politics 1929-1933 is a two-player political game that tries to simulate the chaos of Germany prior to Hitler's appointment to chancellor. Will you take the role of the Social Democratic leadership, staving off the extreme ideologies of Communism and Fascism? Using your political influence and paramilitary forces, will you try to gain control of the Reichstag, or send Germany to the brink of anarchy? Can you change history, or is Germany doomed to repeat it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weimar is a block/CDG in which one side plays the SPD and the other plays the NSDAP. A third Communist force is played by both players. Players hold rallies, street fights, build alliances, and try to win the hearts and minds of the German people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victory can be achieved in multiple ways, with both parties being able to gain influence in each electoral area and score them in each election phase. Influence is gained by holding rallies and bringing political and paramilitary forces to both &amp;quot;encourage&amp;quot; and intimidate the German people. Alternatively for the Nazis, they can use events to increase chaos and unrest in order to bring down the weak parliamentary government. For the SPD, they can use special actions to stop the Nazi political machine, including the elimination of its leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
