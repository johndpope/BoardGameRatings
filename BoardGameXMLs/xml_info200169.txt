							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dumpster Diver</name>
									
			<description>Dumpster Diver is a game of glorious trash digging, and turning that trash into treasure. This fast and easy card game is for 2-4 players and can be played in about 20 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players search, buy, sell, draw, and dive to create hands. The goal is to have the most victory points at the end of the game. VPs are earned during each game round by playing rooms and assortments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With colorful art and easy game play, Dumpster Diver is fun for the whole family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
