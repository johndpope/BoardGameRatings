			<description>Shotgun Slade has captured 4 outlaws in different locations around this frontier town. The players, his deputies, must bring them in and lock them up. The first player to get all four of his outlaws (marbles) around the board and into his four jail holes by exact count, wins the game.  Much like Aggravation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
