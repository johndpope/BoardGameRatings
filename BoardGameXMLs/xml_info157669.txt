			<description>1862: Beaver Dam Creek (American Civil War in 3D)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game 13 of 19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Beaver Dam Creek is the thirteenth battle in the series and is the third in our Peninsula Campaign set of 1862. The Confederates are attacking the Union forces on the north side of the Chicahominy River in a hope that they can defeat this much smaller force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a printable game board that can be constructed 3 dimensionally for an impressive realistic feel. Counters, rules and all playing aids accompany the game including a set of tile dice for those of you without any cube dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&amp;quot; - Wargame Shop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
