			<description>In Yoink! players must close their eyes or wear sleep shades and quickly pass tactile cards. Players are not allowed to use their eyes so all players, blind or sighted, are on an equal playing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must feel the cards to determine when they have cards with all the same or different attributes. In the center of the table there are totems (we use dice) enough for all the players except one. When a player has a set that is all the same(or all different) number of shape, type of shape and background fill they will reach for the totems at the center of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the first player has their trio they declare 'Yoink!' and the remaining players scramble to get the remaining totems. Players who don't get a totem are eliminated and play continues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
