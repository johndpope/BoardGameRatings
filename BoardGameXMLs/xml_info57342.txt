							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Permanent Character Folder &amp; Adventure Records</name>
									
			<description>From the Front of the Book:&lt;br/&gt;Look what's here! ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS PERMANENT CHARACTER FOLDER and ADVENTURE RECORDS especially designed for use with ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp;amp; DRAGONS! These two interlocking products have been designed to eliminate those major problems which commonly plague other character records, space and durability. Organized into a special format, information is grouped together under specific and easy-to-identify sections, while the most vital and oft-consulted information is boxed with eye-catching, easy-to-find displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All information which remains constant for a character, as well as sufficient space for record-keeping, are provided for on the durable four pages of the PERMANENT CHARACTER FOLDER, while all the information subject to change during an adventure is recorded on separate ADVENTURE RECORDS. When an adventure is ended the complete record may be stored in the PERMANENT CHARACTER FOLDER to serve as a file on past deeds of glory. If you find this product helpful you will want to look into the AD&amp;amp;D PLAYER CHARACTER RECORDS, NON-PLAYER CHARACTER RECORDS, and our other quality products and discover why TSR is called, The Game Wizards!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
