							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spelet om Gamla Linköping</name>
									
			<description>Spelet om Gamla Link&amp;ouml;ping is published somewhere around the late 1980s by Lions Club, to raise money for the Children's Diabetes Fund. The game is sponsored by a few companies from Link&amp;ouml;ping, including the local newspaper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a regular roll-and-move concept, with players moving through a map of Gamla Link&amp;ouml;ping (an open-air museum with lots of old houses moved from the center of Link&amp;ouml;ping proper). There are cards with information about some of the houses that players pass. These should be read when players stop on a card square. Sometimes there are actions to be performed. The first player to reach each square gets to keep the card, and at the end each card counts as ten crowns. The player with the most money at the end wins, not whoever reaches the end first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Game board with map of Gamla Link&amp;ouml;ping&lt;br/&gt; - 4 pawns&lt;br/&gt; - Six-sided die&lt;br/&gt; - 20 bank notes&lt;br/&gt; - 48 cards&lt;br/&gt; - A plastic wallet for the bank notes and cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
