			<description>A game inspired by Monopoly (at the command of the publisher) but has other interesting features. Virtually everything can be traded so there is more player interaction. There are auctions at key times in the game. And owning any five companies that are placed at three of the corners of the board means you have 'cornered the market' and you win. If nobody achieves this then the last player in the game, after all opponents have been made bankrupt, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
