			<description>Another game that use the Pop-o-matic dice facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player tries to remove their two pieces from the board. Each piece that lands on one of the Finish spaces is removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four wheels built into the board. When you land on a Star space, you must turn a wheel. If pieces are on the chosen wheel then they will stay there but may have to exit on to a different route than they intended. Thus you can help yoursef or hinder your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
