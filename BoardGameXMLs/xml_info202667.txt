			<description>Test your patience with this 2-6 player card drafting game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls a scientist that has one thing on their mind... Irritating the other scientists! This frustratingly fun card game takes aim at the family audience, and is most fun with 6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two decks (a community deck and an idea deck), and six 20 sided die that come in each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each game, a player receives ten cards. Each player will roll their die and whoever rolls the highest goes first. This will continue clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the community deck players find resources to help them along with making their awesome ideas come to life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To create an idea, each player will need 1 lab coat, 2 schematics, and 2 chemical sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the idea deck are patience testers. Everything from monsters, contraptions, to your favorite TV show!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When coming up with an idea, you never know what you'll get. Idea cards are marked with a + or - on them and can either be played against a player, or on yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When playing a - against a player, this will make their patience go down. Say you come up with a -3 patience card and you play it against someone. Their patience die will go down from 20 to 17.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also in the deck, are + patience cards. If your patience die is at 17 and you play a +2, you will turn your die back to 19. Players may not go above 20. If a player reaches or goes past 0, the player has lost all patience and is mad. (They are out)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
