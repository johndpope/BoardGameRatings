							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">DM Rewards: Ship Tiles</name>
									
			<description>From the publish's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This full-color, double-sided Dungeon Tiles sheet portrays both the main deck and below-deck areas of a longship, a pinnace, rowboats, and more! Each DM that scheduled and reported five sessions of play between January 1 and June 30, 2009 received two copies of the tile sheet &amp;ndash; enough to run a longship-to-longship combat or create a layout showing both main and lower decks simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user submission comment&lt;br/&gt;Doesn't look like much info on this. The name I took from the WotC website, the item has no name on it. &lt;br/&gt;I have them,  they literally came two tile sheets shrink wrapped together with no cover of any sort. They arrived in an envelope with a very generic cover letter thanking you for being an RPGA DM very similar to the one that came with The Witch-Hunter Cometh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
