			<description>Played on a 9x9 grid, each player has nine chips: each with a 2, 3 or 4 printed on it.  They begin the game adjacent to the play area set in any order the player desires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns moving one of their chips a number of spaces equal to the printed number -- turning as often as the player likes and even moving over other chips.  The chips are never removed from the board, but they are swallowed by stacks.  Stacks can be 2-4 chips high and the number on each chip must be equal to or greater than that on the chip below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all chips are in stacks and no more captures can be made.  At this point, all stacks are taken by the player of the color of the top-most chip.  All chips from stacks thus taken are then added up and the player with the highest total has won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
