			<description>This module provisionally introduces the Triangulum Galaxy as a new setting for the Star Fleet Battles game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It includes a look at the history of Triangulum through to Y122, a series of playtest rules governing the operation of numerous unique weapons and support systems found in that galaxy, and backgound material and playtest ships for three major factions: the Helgardian Protectorate, the Arachnid Worlds of Union, and the Mallaran Empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain's Log #23 includes additional Triangulum data, with four playtest ships for another major M33 faction, the Imperium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADB have posted Module E2 and CL23 on e23, offer a handful of additional playtest materials on their things-to-playtest web page, and have listed an updated errata file covering all four currently-available playtest empires. In addition, a set of prototype counters were added to Special Countersheet #1, which is available as a spare part on ADB's online storefront.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
