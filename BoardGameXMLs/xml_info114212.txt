							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vulture Men of Waukegan!</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ruling from a roost in the ruins of ancient Waukegan, The Vulture Men of Waukegan control a small territory of roughly 100 square miles just north of the massive ruins of old Chicago. The Vulture Men have a strict hierarchical society based upon the corporate organization of the company that once owned their ancestral roost, and they believe they are the rightful heirs of Lancaster &amp;amp; Penn Real Estate Development, Inc. The territory has little to offer the average mutie, being composed of only a few small settlements, but the ruins in the area are ripe for exploration by scavengers. Scavs should expect a tax visit from the Vulture Men however, so have gifts at the ready. According to our sources, Vulture Men love to eat pickled fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although useful information for the general traveler looking at the Waukegan area, it leaves much to be desired in the way of specifics. This area gazetteer rectifies that shortcoming and should provide a Sorcery &amp;amp; Super Science GM with a robust and elegant territorial framework within which to weave dozens of successful and interesting adventures. The Vulture Men of Waukegan is a border territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
