							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">El juego de la Luna</name>
									
			<description>A very simple roll-and-move game. Players roll a die and move their playing pieces through the board spaces, in some of which there is a humanized Moon in one of their phases (full, new, first quarter and last quarter). Depending on which phase of the Moon the players fall, they stay where they are, advance additional spaces or go back to previous spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The current info on the game is scarce and not fully accurate, as it dates from 1890. If anyone has additional information and more accurate data, please provide it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
