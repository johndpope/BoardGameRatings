							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tribes of Legend</name>
									
			<description>A hardback book featuring three games based on Greek mythology. The three sets are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tribes of Legend: This is a miniatures game involving armies of humans, centaurs and satyrs. Combat is dice-driven, movememtn is simple, and the basic grouping for all activities is the unit (as opposed to individual figures). Rules are provided for terrain effects, and each faction has its own special rules. The overall game rules are very simple, shunning the usual complexity of miniatures rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Heroes: a miniatures skirmish game for smaller battles. This is a playing card driven battle game, where individual figures move around the tabletop and draw cards to perform tasks and fight battles. Different fighting abilities and levels of armour are represented by differing card values in the game. Ordinary playing cards are used to play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trials of a Demigod: a solitaire quest driven by action cards.This is mostly an exercise in pulling cards and seeing the total they add up to - nicely presented but not very much of a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
