							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Troll Pits of Hextor (5e)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place in the Kingdom of Zeland. Zeland, an old member of the now-defunct Eastern Alliance, is ancient Irish in flavor. It has its own particular mythos, and its people are quick to fight and to live life to the fullest. Besides Kale, it has perhaps suffered the least under occupation, although the people have become considerably less&lt;br/&gt;industrious. In fact, industriousness is discouraged. As such, although the quality of life has suffered relatively little, the economy is in a shambles. The capital city is Zel City, with a population of 25,000. This kingdom is still ruled by Orax the Lord of Sloth. Western Zeland has it a little worse under Lord Dargon Skullcrusher. He is not slothful, and his tyranny is legendary. Dargon has had some time to fortify his fortress, the Troll Pits of Hextor, and thus the heroes should be prepared for a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An adventure for a party of 13th - 14th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
