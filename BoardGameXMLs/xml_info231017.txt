			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game has not been released yet, therefore some of the information above may change in the future. Until this game is released, please don't submit images for it unless given direct written permission from the publisher which must be noted in the image caption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb:Mega-thrusters are go! Taking adventure into the stars requires a sturdy vessel to get you there, and Paizo's latest Starfinder Flip-Mat provides you with two very different starships to pilot, explore, or raid! This line of gaming maps provides ready-to-use science-fantasy set pieces for the busy Game Master. This double-sided map features a sleek exploration and courier ship on one side and a militaristic dropship that doubles as an industrial freighter on the other, providing your players with a home base for their own explorations, or an enemy stronghold to infiltrate in the vacuum of space. Don't waste your time sketching when you could be playing. With Starfinder Flip-Mat: Starship, you're ready to meet adventure on its home turf, or burn sky and live to fight another day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special coating on each Flip-Mat allows you to use wet erase, dry erase, AND permanent markers with ease! Removing permanent ink is easy&amp;mdash;simply trace over any permanent mark with a dry erase marker, wait 10 seconds, then wipe off both marks with a dry cloth or paper towel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
