							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Generic Spell Effect Cards</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several spell effect card templates available for specific systems, but everyone I have seen were full color and for a game system I don't use. Instead of trying to fit a specificly tailored-card to suit my purpose I created these generic spell effect cards that should work for a wide variety of game systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included down the side of each card is a series of icons that are barely labeled. Depedning on your print settings you may not even be able to read the text, but it is visible in the PDF. My assumption is that eventually you'll have no need for the text anyway because you'd simply go by the icons, so why waste valuable card space on the text?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cards are specifically intended to be filled out by hand, but you can also use the Typewriter function in Adobe Acrobat to enter in your information. There is a simple card back, but I am assuming that most folks would either forgo printing the back and use it for extra information or just use the fronts and slip these into protective card sleeves. The Generic Spell Effect Card is the same size as a Magic Card to facilitate card sleeve usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is already a spell effect card made for your particular game system this product isn't intended to be any better...different, yes....better, no. In many ways it will be just a step up from using a note card. I'm not pretending this is anything fancier than that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
