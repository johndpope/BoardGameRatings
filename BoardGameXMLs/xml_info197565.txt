			<description>Tricky3 is a simple dice game in which players try to get three in a row on the 7x3 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spaces on the board show three or four circles in one of three colors (blue, red or yellow). The four dice are regular six-sided dice with colors on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn a player gets to roll the dice twice and they try to roll the same colors as one of the spaces on the board. If they do, they get to place one of their pawns there.&lt;br/&gt;If all four dice show one color you also have the option of removing a pawn of an opposing player. If you get three in a row, you win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
