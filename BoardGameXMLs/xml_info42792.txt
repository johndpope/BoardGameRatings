			<description>Mickey Mouse Canasta Junior is based on the Canasta card game with Disney cartoon characters. In the late 1940s, Canasta was a popular playing card game in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is for two to six players where they attempt to make melds of 7 cards of the same rank, and &amp;quot;go out&amp;quot; by playing all cards in their hand and discarding. It is commonly played by two players with two standard decks of cards, but many variations exist for 3 - 6 player games or teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
