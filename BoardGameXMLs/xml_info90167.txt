			<description>Nobody Is Perfect &amp;ndash; Kompakt features the same game play as the original Nobody is Perfect &amp;ndash; first released in 1996, then released in a new edition in 2009 &amp;ndash; but with more than 450 new terms for players to puzzle over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game play is similar to Balderdash or the public domain &amp;quot;Dictionary&amp;quot; game with players being presented with an unusual word or image that they're unlikely to know. All players write down a definition for this word/image, then everyone votes on which definition they feel is the correct one. Vote correctly, and you score points; have others vote for your definition, and you'll score then, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
