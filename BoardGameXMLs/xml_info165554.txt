When you slay the hero you take their place and it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to crawl!  Race to gain enough XP and loot to take on the hulking final boss!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEATURES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Local multiplayer arcade action for up to 4 Players!&lt;br/&gt;    Level up, increase your stats, amass powerful weapons and magic items, in each half hour game.&lt;br/&gt;    Evolve your monsters from spiders and rats to powerful demons, dragons and undead warriors.&lt;br/&gt;    Play with controllers, keyboard or mouse.&lt;br/&gt;    Hone your skills against bots while you wait for your friends to arrive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crawl is a roguelike, brawler indie video game by Australian developer Powerhoof. Up to four players and bots in local multiplayer advance through randomly generated dungeons with one player as the hero and the others as ghosts who possess traps and monsters in the environment to kill and thus replace the hero. The game was released through Steam Early Access for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms on August 6, 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crawl is a cross-genre game with roguelike, bullet hell, and brawler elements for up to four offline players and bots. The main player advances through randomly generated dungeons as a human hero while up to three other ghost players control the dungeon's enemies and traps to kill the main player. The ghost player who kills the human hero swaps roles to become the next main player. Players earn experience as they progress through the dungeon in both the human hero and the non-human ghost roles. Hero experience unlocks new attacks and spells, and ghost experience unlocks stronger enemies to possess.[4] Each player's human hero experience level, weapon, and stats progress is preserved between turns. Crawl was designed to be more fast-paced and arcade-like than strategic, and includes genre-standard activities like collecting loot and upgradable weapons and magic items. Once player ghosts possess &amp;quot;monster spawners&amp;quot; and traps in the active room, they cannot leave the form until they die or kill the main character. The players and enemies grow progressively more powerful over the course of a match. The game ends when a human hero reaches experience level 10, enters a portal, and defeats a final boss controlled cooperatively by the other players. Typical matches last about 30 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Crawl (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
