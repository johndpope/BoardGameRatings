			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An idol dice-rolling game based on the anime &amp;quot;Love Live!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a hand of cards representing idols. Each idol has 2 effects: one that is applied pre-dice rolling and one that can be applied after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a selection of possible concerts, players choose simultaneously which one to try on, and in turn, they roll 6 dice, trying to get as high a total as possible; the higher total, the higher points, depending on the concert card. Prior to rolling, the player can play one card from his hand to apply the &amp;quot;pre-rolling&amp;quot; effect (which essentially decides certain outcomes), and after rolling, the player can play any number of cards applying the &amp;quot;post-rolling&amp;quot; effect; which usually change one dice into another or adds to the total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the most points when all concerts are finished wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title is short for &amp;quot;Bokura no Live, Kimi to no dice&amp;quot;, meaning &amp;quot;Our live, the dice with you&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
