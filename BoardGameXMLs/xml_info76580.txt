			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Hulk is a 1993 real-time tactical video game for MS-DOS and Amiga. The game was based on Games Workshop's 1989 board game of the same name. Set in the fictional Warhammer 40,000 universe, the player directs squads of Space Marines, genetically enhanced armoured soldiers, in their missions to protect the human race from deadly aliens. Space Hulk was developed and published by Electronic Arts, with support from Games Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place aboard huge derelicts known as space hulks. Drifting in and out of the warp&amp;mdash;an alternate dimension used to cross interstellar distances&amp;mdash;these vessels are infested with the four-armed Genestealers. Using overhead maps, the player orders the Marine squads, and controls individual Marines via first-person shooter interfaces. The game features a time-limited option to pause the action while enabling the player to continue issuing commands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Hulk's theme of pitting slow and heavily armed Marines against fast, deadly Genestealers produced moments of frantic gameplay and a scary atmosphere for its reviewers, earning positive ratings for the game. A few reviewers, however, felt the game was too difficult and proved to be too frustrating. Space Hulk was followed up by Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels in 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From game back box cover&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLEANSE AND BURN!&lt;br/&gt;A derelict spaceship is infested with Genestealers. Immensely fast, immeasurably strong, these insectoid beasts from hell breed by planting their genes in living humans. Bolt on your power armour and awesome weaponry. You're going in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Terrifying real-time combat.&lt;br/&gt;     Lightning-fast FreezeTime strategy.&lt;br/&gt;     Over 50 deadly missions including Death Wing Campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     12 weapons including lightning claws and Assault Cannon.&lt;br/&gt;     Control single Space Marines, 5 man squads or multiple troops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
