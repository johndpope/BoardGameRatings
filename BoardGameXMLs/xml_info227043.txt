							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Donald Trump&#039;s Real Estate Tycoon</name>
									
			<description>Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon is a single-player video game. The player's goal is to beat Donald Trump by becoming the most influential business magnate. In the Windows version, the player must choose the best real estate location in one of five cities: Los Angeles, New York City, Atlantic City, London and Paris. The mobile version consists of only one city. Each city is viewed from an isometric perspective. Each of the five cities contain an office, which opens at 6:00 AM and closes at 10:00 PM. Because of this, the player will sometimes have to focus on other cities or wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%27s_Real_Estate_Tycoon Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
