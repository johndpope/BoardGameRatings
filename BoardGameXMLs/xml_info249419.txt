							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Random Coping Chess</name>
									
			<description>Best described as chess with a sprinkling of D&amp;amp;D, Random Coping Chess is the result of bedtime roommate chat being taken much too seriously and much too casually simultaneously. Randy (Our affectionate name for the game) adds components of storytelling and randomness to your average game of chess. You might encounter blizzards, landslides, or outlandish parties at which all your sliding pieces get drunk and their movement is best described as Brownian until they sober up. Assassins, tricksters, and temptresses may appear to thwart your plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you play a lot of chess, Randy can freshen the game with it's new spin. If people of two very different skill levels are playing chess, Randy can level the playing field and make the game exciting for all players. If you never liked chess, maybe... just maybe... you'll like RANDOM COPING CHESS!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random elements are added to the game when cards are drawn. Cards are not played by individual players - rather, a player rolls a die before each turn. If the die comes up a 1, a card is drawn. The card describes the elements that are added to the game, changing the rules of the game as it is played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
