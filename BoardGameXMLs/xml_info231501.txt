			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chariot races had, in the ancient Rome, lot of followers. Not only the people frequented the races, but emperors, senators, intellectuals, writers crowded the circus.&lt;br/&gt;The Aurigae, who drove chariots with two, three, four, sometimes eight or ten horses, where idols of the crowd, but the people didn&amp;rsquo;t support particularly the driver, but one of the four traditional teams.&lt;br/&gt;Quadrigae reproduces the Roman chariot races through a fast system which gives you the chance to revive a whole day at the races in an evening. The charioteers, each one with his own name and characteristics, assume the role of the captain looking for the victory or of a helper who try to facilitate his captain blocking and attacking the adversaries. Not all of them will arrive whole at the end: some will fall without damage but humiliation, some others will remain stunned and out of the races; the unluckiest&amp;hellip; will die. As the owner of a team (Dominus factionis) you&amp;rsquo;ll decide the tactics of the race and sign on your register the won races, good results and injuries.&lt;br/&gt;The quadrigae (chariots) move along a 100 x 28 cm board reproducing the Circus Maxcimum. Each chariot can make two phases of advance and one phase (optional) of aggression. The movement consists in an automathic advancement of 2 steps and a bonus of 1 step depending on the strengthness of the chariot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
