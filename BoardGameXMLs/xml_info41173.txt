							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Things</name>
									
			<description>The Things is a game for three or (ideally) more players, and simulates the paranoid members of an antarctic research facility being overrun by - or conquering - an invasive shape-shifting, human-killing alien. A standard deck of cards is used, with the different cards having different abilities. Players are either Things or Humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A random player is chosen to start, and turns progress in alphabetic or clockwise order. On each of their turns, a player may choose either to Search (draw a single card from the draw pile which they may or may not be able to keep), Converse (trade with other players), perform a Blood Test (force others to reveal cards)or Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game End and Winning:&lt;br/&gt;For Humans: A Human player may, at any time, decide that the camp has been cleansed and that it's safe to radio for a rescue plane. That player reveals their hand, and declares that the game is over. All other players then reveal their hands. If any Things are shown to be still alive, then they are unleashed upon civilization and win the game. If only Humans remain, however, then the Thing has been vanquished and the Humans win the game.&lt;br/&gt;For Things: A Thing player may, at any time, decide that the camp has been cleansed and that it's safe to build a two-seater flying saucer and head for civilization. That player reveals their hand, and declares that the game is over. All other players then reveal their hands. If any Humans are shown to be still alive, then they manage to sabotage the saucer and destroy the Things in the process. If only Things remain, however, then they merge into a single two-seater blob and fly off to conquer the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
