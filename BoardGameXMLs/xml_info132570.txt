			<description>Mayhem Mines is a card game in which 2-4 players compete to collect the most treasure before tremors collapse the mine. The game takes between 10 and 25 minutes to play. In the game, players mine for treasure, sabotage other miners, and avoid traps and monsters such as the infamous Greedy Dragon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mayhem Mines is an incredibly simple card game with the objective being that at the end of the game, be the player that holds the most Treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of of 4 types of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treasure Cards (Blue): These are what you are searching for! Have the most at the end of the game and you win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event Cards (Yellow): When you draw an event card its effect takes place immediately and you reveal the card and follow the text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions Cards (Green): An action card is held in your hand until you wish to play it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tremor Cards (Red): Tremor cards are revealed and stay on the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played by shuffling and dealing the entire deck of cards on to a play surface face down. Then on each of your turns you have two options, Search the Mine (pick up a card form the playing field), or Play an Action Card. Keep in mind, that some Actions Cards allow you to search as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This continues until 3 Tremors are caused by either revealing them in the mine or using the &amp;ldquo;Jack the Hammer&amp;rdquo; tremor causing card, the game ends immediately and a winner is determined. Add up the values of all your treasure cards. The player with the highest is crowned the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
