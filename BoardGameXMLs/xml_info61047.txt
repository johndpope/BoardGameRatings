							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prince of Doggs</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Babylonian cities were protected by stone lions. Medieval artists saw the lion as the epitome of honor, courage and power, and decorated tabards and coats of arms with the image of the proud cat. Ancient artisans recognized qualities they admired in themselves in the great cats. Today, the dog has replaced the lion as a symbol as nobility, loyalty and strength. Rappers and gangsters, most of whom have never heard of heraldry or totem animals or the ancient role of the lion, unconsciously choose the dog as their symbol. Inner city warriors breed and fight fearsome war-dogs; snarling pit bulls leer from silk-screened jerseys and tattoos. CGI special effects transform rappers into dogs as they rhyme about crime and honor. The dog ascends to power as an urban totem, supplanting the lion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prince of Doggs is a modern day werewolf, an instinctual shape-shifter. Though the Prince can be a being of primal lusts and passions, he is also a far cannier opponent than his enemies suspect. High finance and investment, art and poetry, geo-politics and the politics of the street, the Prince of Doggs knows all these things. He also knows ancient words of power that he integrates into his rhymes, and he knows the thrill of the chase and the foam-at-the-mouth joy of a righteous kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
