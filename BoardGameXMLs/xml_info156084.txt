							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Land Of Mithgarthr</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Land Of Mithgarthr offers a brief overall picture of Mithgarthr. There's a history from when humans first settled, a calendar, an overview of races and monsters (including a new monster, the &amp;quot;Ratten&amp;quot;), and information on the gods of the land. In addition to this, the focus of volume one is on The Kingdom of Karak, which was the first of the two human kingdoms to be established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expect follow-ups detailing the other human kingdom, the demihuman areas, the frontier areas including Die Piraten Inseln (pirate infested islands), and the broken lands which detail the lands to the north, ravaged for hundreds of years by dark magic and just recently reclaimed by the forces of good.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the setting material gives enough detail for the Labyrinth Lord to get a solid feel for the world, without having their creativity stifled by superfluous fluff. There will be adventures coming in the near future that will add story, depth, and detail to parts of the land for busy referees who don't have time to develop their own, but for those who just want a fun backdrop to base their own works in, Mithgarthr is perfect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
