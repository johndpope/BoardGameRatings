							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Vordis Scourge, Volume II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Terrifying Merger of Cold Steel and Undead Flesh!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vordis are a group of construct-like creatures that are part machine and part undead, preserved flesh. The vordis come in many shapes and sizes, and indeed, they are in many ways more of a culture or an organization than they are a race. Their numbers grow by harvesting the flesh of living creatures, which they incorporate into ever more strange and exotic designs The ultimate goal of the vordis is nothing less than to recreate all life in their own twisted, metallic image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book presents both mythic and non-mythic versions of two members of this terrifying race. The vordis surgeon (CRs 9 and 11) is not only the horrifying product of mad science, but is devoted to performing the same kinds of twisted and sadistic experiments that created it on other creatures. Its surgical claws slice and dice with horrifying ease, and its special serums can transform the living into the undead, or allow it to control undead already animated. The vordis harvester (CRs 12 and 15) has the upper-body of a humanoid corpse, and the lower body of a massive cockroach. It can remove its victims&amp;rsquo; limbs with its attacks, and then quickly graft those limbs onto its own body in order to gain a variety of benefits from them. Beyond these four monster stat-blocks, the book also contains a graft from each of these two types of vordis monstrosities, allowing players who harvest these parts to attach them to themselves in order to use the vordis&amp;rsquo;s greatest weapons against them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
