							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Shadowrun Supplemental (Issue 7 - Apr 1998)</name>
									
			<description>From the Editors Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to issue #7 of The Shadowrun Supplemental! This issue marks the first issue of our second year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue is early and late in a ways. I had originally planned to publish a compilation of the first six issues early in April, but I had enough submissions to put out #7 before that. The compilation will be constructed and released sometime also in April, most likely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again, we had to do a bit of splitting, due to the size. Within a few days after this section is released, we will be releasing a very large Necromancy supplement, which will tip the scales at over 100 pages, by our best guess. The author of this piece is Tim Bradley, among others. Check for it on the TSS Productions web site soon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the TSS Productions website has been awarded the &amp;ldquo;RPG TOP 5% ELITE AWARD&amp;rdquo;. Because this is a fairly prestigious award and I&amp;rsquo;m damn proud of it, I just feel the urge to talk about it a bit more.. : )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from that, there isn&amp;rsquo;t that much that&amp;rsquo;s very exciting to point out to you this issue. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked out Pocket Secretary &amp;rsquo;98, it may be worth your time to do that &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a new Shadowrun program that is a joint effort between Paolo Marcucci and I, and from all the positive feedback we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten, it seems like people like it. : )&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
