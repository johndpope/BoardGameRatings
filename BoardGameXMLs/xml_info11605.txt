			<description>This game was produced by Market Force Communications for AT&amp;amp;T Information Systems - it was designed as a training tool for their sales force on the features of the Merlin Communications System (office phones).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features an unusual mechanic - each player has two pawns, one which moves on an outer track and one which moves through the players' &amp;quot;offices&amp;quot; (rows of spaces in the center of the board).  On a turn a player throws two dice and uses one for each pawn.  Moving around the outside track can give you various cards, cartridges (upgrades for your phone system), etc.  Moving through the offices gives orders (money/VP) to the player whose office gets landed on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to have the highest level of Merlin system and get 50 orders.  Players need to cash in orders to upgrade from the lower-level systems, and the better your system the more orders your office produces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game came in two formats - a standard boxed game and a punch-out version in a large envelope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
