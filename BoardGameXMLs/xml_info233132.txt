			<description>Round and square - red, yellow, blue. Where are the square, triangle and circle hidden? &lt;br/&gt;The three friends, monkey, rabbit and cat invite you to a journey through the world of colors and shapes. With colorful toys, the child first learns the basic colors and gradually acquires the most important forms. The children sort the colors apart. In the next step, the small players assign shapes. They play on one of many differen game boards, which the child himself has chosen. Where do the circle, triangle and quadrangle belong? Now the monkey, rabbit and cat have their appearance: in the combination of color and shape knowledge, the children organize the forms on different picture boards appropriately. Depending on the development step, additional shapes or the dice will come into play. Through numerous game variations the children in Meine Farben und Formen strengthen basic basic knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
