			<description>Treasure Mountain! is an educational computer game published by The Learning Company intended to teach children reading and basic math skills.&lt;br/&gt;The player plays as a Super Seeker who must navigate the three levels of Treasure Mountain to collect treasures and keys to advance to the next level. In each level there are three &amp;quot;clue words&amp;quot;, numerous treasures, and terrain features. Dropping coins in front of terrain matching two of the clue word descriptions would reveal a treasure. The terrain feature matching all three words contained the key to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 separate levels needed to climb to the top of the mountain. Once you reach the top, you must enter and climb to the top of the castle to get your prize. The layout of ladders in the castle becomes more complex as the player earns more stars and at higher star levels the Master of Mischief will try to poke the player off the ladders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Treasure Mountain&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
