			<description>NBA Elite 11 is a basketball video game released by Electronic Arts (EA) for iOS. It is the first installment in the NBA Elite series, succeeding EA's NBA Live series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A release of the game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was scheduled for October 5, 2010, but was delayed until March 31, 2011 due to &amp;quot;concerns about gameplay polish&amp;quot;. The cancellation for these versions was officially announced on November 2, 2010 and development of the franchise was moved from EA's Black Box studio to its Florida-based Tiburon studio. EA has stated that it will instead release free DLC for NBA Live 10, including roster updates for the 2010&amp;ndash;11 NBA season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;NBA Elite 11&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
