			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fists of Resistance is a dungeon crawler beat &amp;lsquo;em up set in a post-apocalyptic World War II. It was created by Oxeye Games as part of the Humble Bundle Mojam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play the last survivor of a genetic experiment by the Nazi's to create super soldiers and you must fight your way out of a randomly generated Nazi base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was created in 60 hours over the course of the weekend from the 17th to 19th February 2012 as part of the Mojam Humble Bundle. The creation of the game was live-streamed over the internet using twitch.tv&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time the 60 hours was up the game was playable, but unfinished and still buggy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
