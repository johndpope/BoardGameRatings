							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mexican-American War</name>
									
			<description>March across the plains of southern Texas with the 4th US Infantry which included in its ranks the young Lieutenant Sam Grant. Accompany the elite US Engineers, its members including Lee, Beauregard, McClellan, Joe Johnston and other soon-to-be-famous officers, as they pry into the Mexican dispositions to find an opening that would lead to victory. Bounce across the arroyos at Buena Vista on the seat of a caisson in a battery commanded by Captain Braxton Bragg, or ride with the US Dragoons alongside Dick Ewell, back in the days when he still had hair. Mexican-American War is a grand tactical level simulation of this conflict using the Early American Wars engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war with Mexico presents some fascinating parallels and contrasts with our current history. Mexico in 1846 had a standing army of about 35,000 men, while the Regular Army of the United States mustered only about 7,000 soldiers, with most of them scattered across the western borders of the country, protecting settlers and battling Indians. Employing advanced tactics and superior technology, especially that of the artillery, the US prevailed. Luck, boldness, and skill had something to do with it, too.&lt;br/&gt; You have an opportunity with this game to rewrite the history of a forgotten war, fought in 1846 and 1847 between The United States of America and the nation of Mexico. In scope, in the sweeping panorama of deserts and mountains, from lush California to Mexico City's verdant basin, it is unrivaled in the Western Hemisphere, even by the American Civil War which began only fifteen years later. From Texas to the Pacific, from Northern California to Central Mexico, battles, skirmishes - and diplomacy - over a period of two years determined the ultimate outline of the continental United States as we know it today. You will also do battle in a conflict only slightly better known to Americans - the Texas War of Independence, fought in 1835-36. From &amp;quot;Come and Take It!&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Remember the Alamo,&amp;quot; you will fight until the decisive battle of San Jacinto settles the issue.&lt;br/&gt; Additional Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-72 stand alone scenarios and 5 campaigns to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;-A wide sampling of actions from small to huge actions.&lt;br/&gt;-14 unique maps ranging in size from 2600 hexes to 113,000 hexes providing ample ground for scenario designers to create their own actions.&lt;br/&gt;-An abundance of engine changes and enhancements that have been long-awaited for the EAW series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engine changes include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- New weather feature allowing visibility, ground conditions and fire modifiers to be modeled.&lt;br/&gt;-Several new weapon types, plus a new weapon.dat file allowing customization.&lt;br/&gt;-Multiple additions to the PDT file for weapon flags such as:&lt;br/&gt;-Can fire while mounted&lt;br/&gt;-Can retire by prolong&lt;br/&gt;-Can fire indirect&lt;br/&gt;-Has no bayonets&lt;br/&gt;-Small arms (50% melee bonus)&lt;br/&gt;-Ability to destroy and repair bridges with Engineers impacting effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;-Bridge strength requirements for various unit types to pass.&lt;br/&gt;-&amp;quot;Battalion Colors&amp;quot; display option, to help keep track of forces.&lt;br/&gt;-Enhancements to improve the defenders stance of fortified positions.
