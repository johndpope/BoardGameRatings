			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character sheet consists of many parts. I will describe the bottom of the character sheet first, then continue my description anti-clockwise around the sheet, and finally describe the centre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the bottom is the Hot Dog. The Hot Dog represents the city, its pleasures, its institutions and everything the character knows well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving anti-clockwise from the Hot Dog, we come to two Circles Of Descent: the First Circle is up and to the left of the Hot Dog; the Second Circle is further up and to the left. These represent the character&amp;rsquo;s descent into madness. They are blank and remain so throughout the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the top of the sheet are the Madnesses: a structure of blank circles linked by bars. The bars are marked with the names of cards: there is one bar for each Trump card and one for the Fool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Madnesses represent things that send the character mad: fears, repressed memories, obsessions and so forth. At the start of the game, the Madnesses are blank, but later, they will be filled in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving anti-clockwise again, we see two Circles of Recovery at the top right of the sheet. At the end of the game, these will represent the character&amp;rsquo;s recovery from madness. The First Circle is on the top; the Second Circle is down and to the right. These, also, are blank, and remain so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the centre of the sheet is the Golden Spiral. This represents everything that is outwardly known about the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is an entry for the Reverse Engineering competition, organized by Kevin Allen Jr. The game was designed around Mike Sugarbaker&amp;rsquo;s character sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
