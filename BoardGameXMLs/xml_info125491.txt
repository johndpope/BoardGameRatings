			<description>POPULATION: 4 is a fast paced Survival-Horror Board RPG with an unique premise: Get it, play it, write your survival story and have it published on the game's site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE GAME&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played up to 5 players (1 Zombie Controller and 4 Survivors, that's where &amp;quot;Population: 4&amp;quot; comes from), where the survivors are to get the neccesary items to escape the city while the zombies lurk the districts of the city searching for food. Cooperativism between survivors is essential to escape, although every player is free to choose if they are to cooperate, ignore or betray everybody else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITY, GUNS AND SURVIVORS&lt;br/&gt;The city has several locations where different items can be found (eg. You won't find ammunition at the Train Station), so the search strategy must be smart and coordinated. There is a wide variety of guns, just to mention some the classic Crowbar and Chainsaw, to the imperative Shotgun and Sniper Rifle.&lt;br/&gt;Survivors come in 8 classes: Soldier, Policeman (Riot), Fireman, Medic, Athlete, Explorer, Scavenger and Child). The way you use every class' talent and overcome it's weaknesses have real weight on the strategy development and use of items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORY AND STRESS&lt;br/&gt;Each match carries an excellent and different story, it is highly recommended for those who get the game to write their stories and send them through the game's website to have them published. The interaction between players is unique and spectacular. The stress, strategy and decisions to make are realistic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
