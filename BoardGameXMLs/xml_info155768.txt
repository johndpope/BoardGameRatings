			<description>The goal of the game is to get rid of all your card before anyone else does. However, it is easier said than done and players are limited in the ways they can play cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can only put down a card on a pile with the same design and color. Each card placed down needs to be higher then the previous one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with three open piles. Each pile is played until no players can put down any more cards. At this point the first player who was unable to put down any cards opens up a new pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 8 special cards in the deck. 6 closing cards, and 2 switching cards. A closing card allows a player to close any pile of the same color, and open up a new one at any point. The switching cards allows a player to switch the color of a pile with the same background color, and the design of a pile to anything they would like. The next card played after a switch card must still be higher then the number under it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
