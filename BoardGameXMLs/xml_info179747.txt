			<description>In DraftCraft, players draft a hand of resource cards that also have plans for objects that they can craft. After drafting, they craft one of their plans by spending the resource cards. The crafts generate effects such as an increase in hand size, additional resources, and discounts for future crafts. After seven rounds, the player with the highest total Victory Point value in crafts wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
