							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Magic: The Gathering â€“ Duel Decks: Jace vs. Vraska</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guilds vie for supremacy in Ravnica, creating a tenuous balance of power. Jace Beleren, a mind mage who has adopted Ravnica as his home, fights to maintain a delicate peace. But the deadly gorgon Vraska operates by her own arcane moral code. She serves no guild and owes allegiance to none. This assassin-for-hire could destabilize the entire plane &amp;hellip; but Jace refuses to let that happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in these two decks is black-bordered and tournament legal. They were designed to be played right out of the box, with no deckbuilding required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
