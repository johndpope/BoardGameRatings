							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Friend or Faux: A Game of Ridiculously Revealing Questions</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn points by correctly answering five rounds of increasingly revealing questions. The twist?  Players have to answer the questions about each other, ultimately determining whether you are Friend or Faux. Light-Hearted, often surprising and at times risqu&amp;eacute;, Friend or Faux uses the funny but all-too-real moments of your own life. Players will get personal, recall memories, share stories and will have you laughing until it hurts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
