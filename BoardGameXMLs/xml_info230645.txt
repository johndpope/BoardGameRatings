			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tact is the quick game of pure negotiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this 10-minute alternative to Diplomacy (One Night Ultimate Diplomacy, perhaps), players receive one colour card each and have one minute to talk to other players and submit their order cards detailing which player they will attack and with whom (if anyone) they will ally. When it comes time to submit orders, however, those alliances may count for nothing. Points are earned for successfully attacking and for not being attacked and are tallied to crown the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wheel, deal, backstab and betray. Make friends, make enemies. A winning strategy just takes a little Tact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
