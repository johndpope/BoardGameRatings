							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Werewolf in Town</name>
									
			<description>Werewolf In Town is a party game modeling a battle between an informed minority and an uninformed majority. Players are secretly assigned roles: either &amp;quot;Werewolves&amp;quot;, who know each other; or &amp;quot;Villagers&amp;quot;, who know only that there are Werewolves amongst them. During the night phase of the game, the Werewolves choose an innocent to kill. During the day phase, all players debate and speculate the identities of the Werewolves and vote to kill someone whom the majority suspects. Players are eliminated until either all Werewolves are killed or the Werewolves outnumber the Villagers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Werewolf In Town is partially derived from the original game called &amp;quot;Mafia&amp;quot; which was later given a Werewolf theme, and is being presented on The Game Crafter for the first time with all new, original 8-Bit style artwork and brand new rule variants for you and your group to enjoy. Also included on the cards is something missing from most productions of this game: explanations of the roles. No more running to the rulebook when you get a role you haven't had before or having to expose the fact that you have a unique role because you don't know how it works!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are some Blank Cards for you to experiment with your own new roles to liven up the game play after you have mastered what is in the box!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
