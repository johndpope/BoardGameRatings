			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battle for the hoop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a desperate attempt to stop inner-city gang wars, the city leaders organized a basketball league. The league is scheduled to play on three courts: a street, a junkyard, and a rooftop. The mayor figured that a friendly game of hoops would be a much more peaceful way to settle disputes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boy, was he wrong!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody could have predicted games like these. When rowdy gang members chased off the city-appointed officials, Scott &amp;quot;the Blade&amp;quot; Savage, a thug from a neutral gang, stepped in. And what a referee he turned out to be! He doesn't care about fouls. He doesn't care about rules. He doesn't even have a whistle. But he gets his kicks from throwing knives at the players. With no real referee, the players can do whatever they please. And they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Picture this play: Slash gets the ball and passes to Bruiser. Bruiser dribbles around a junk pile and breaks toward the basket while Slash mercilessly punches Vinnie. Simon steps in to protect Vinnie and punches Slash. Bruiser takes a knife in the gut as he shoots. The ball is up, but no! It hits the bent rim and bounces back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vinnie breaks free and gets the rebound. He runs for the basket. A swift left hook from Bruiser, and Vinnie crumples to the ground. The ball rolls loose. The three remaining players scramble for the ball in a fist-flinging free for all. Simon comes up with the ball. Slash pounds on Bruiser's face for not moving faster as Simon dribbles downcourt unguarded and shoots for two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No wonder the gang members nicknamed this game BasketBrawl. To them it's not a game -- it's a street fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
