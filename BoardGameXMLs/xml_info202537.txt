			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inlay for this game gives very little away as to what the game is about or how to play. It merely states &amp;quot;To win the game, you must be at Lumbago Seaport before the other players with the required amount of money.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It then gives brief instructions about the basic options open to each player on their turn. These are Travel, Sell, Buy, Discard or Hinder. Travelling involves moving to another location, for a cost and possibly requiring a particular item, or requiring certain items to be left behind. Buying, Selling and Discarding relates to items. Some items allow you to advance in the game, others are traded in an attempt to make money. Finally Hinder is used to slow down your opponent. Other options may appear as required in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inlay goes on to say &amp;quot;Like any true adventurer, the rest is for you to discover, and always remember, in this game, everything is 'Up for Grabs'.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Don Priestley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
