			<description>A wacky game of semi-controlled movement. Play cards to gain goods, but watch out that may send you into a teleportation wall! Teleport too many times and you might be found outside the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Dur Mur a problem solving Astronaut ready to &amp;quot;ready the ship&amp;quot;. D.A.V.E. the evil acronym computer is shutting down the human support systems. Stuff like... Air... and the equal Librium gravity are shut down. D.A.V.E. is now abusing the gravity system to throw you around the ship in order to stop you from doing anything productive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
