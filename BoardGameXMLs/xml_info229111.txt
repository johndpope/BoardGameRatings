			<description>Story&lt;br/&gt;SeaBed is a yuri-themed mystery visual novel told through the perspectives of three separate characters: Mizuno Sachiko, a designer plagued by hallucinations of her past lover; Narasaki Hibiki, Sachiko's friend and a psychiatrist researching the workings of human memories; and Takako, Sachiko's former lover who has been rapidly forgetting her past, including how or why the two women drifted apart despite being together since childhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All three live in different worlds, but seek the same goal. To separate truth from illusion. To make sense of their own lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I saw a ghost in the living room.&lt;br/&gt;But as I was already used to the phenomenon, I did not let it interfere with the preparation of my evening meal.&lt;br/&gt;The ghost ate my fried egg and commended its taste.&lt;br/&gt;As I listened to her talk, my memories drifted back to the days we were still together.&lt;br/&gt;Back when we were in school, she asked me what was necessary for the two of us to be together.&lt;br/&gt;A small workplace that we could make a living from without relying on anyone.&lt;br/&gt;A silent apartment where we would have the freedom to do what our hearts desired.&lt;br/&gt;I told her that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the late eighties &amp;ndash; during the economic boom &amp;ndash; the small design company we founded was doing surprisingly well.&lt;br/&gt;We visited all the places we talked about when we were in school &amp;ndash; the southern islands, the old European cities, the West Coast. We went wherever we wanted, seeing whatever we sought.&lt;br/&gt;Alone in that spacious living room, I attempted to figure out why it all ended this way. Why those days when nothing could stand in our way faded into the past.&lt;br/&gt;I no longer felt like I could do everything.&lt;br/&gt;The world had grown complicated. Even simple matters became difficult.&lt;br/&gt;The rules we had established in the past no longer seemed to apply, and the castle we built for ourselves crumbled to dust.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What is necessary for us to be together?&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; the ghost asked me.&lt;br/&gt;We need a make a new place for ourselves.&lt;br/&gt;A place no one can destroy.&lt;br/&gt;Let's make it a place that no one else can reach.&lt;br/&gt;And so, I inconspicuously proceeded with the plan.&lt;br/&gt;In a place so deep below the surface that no one else can find it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;Developed by Paleontology, and seems to be their first game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
