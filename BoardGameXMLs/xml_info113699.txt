							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Minnesota Trivia</name>
									
			<description>A trivia game focused around Minnesota, similar in style to Trivial Pursuit. Players roll dice to move around a map of Minnesota, and collect cards by answering questions correctly at starred cities. First player to six cards wins, although longer and shorter variants are suggested by collecting more or fewer cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions are separated into four categories: People, Places, Sports, and Potluck. All questions are related to Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
