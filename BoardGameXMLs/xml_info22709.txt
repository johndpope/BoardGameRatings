			<description>Button Wars is a strategic table top tactical spaceship combat game. Players use button-like disks to represent various ships within a fleet and smaller plastic tokens to represent fighters and mech  units, then take their fleet into battle against other players. The goal in each battle is to destroy as many ships as possible belonging to your enemies while losing a minimal number of ships yourself. This is basically a table top miniatures war game using buttons instead of miniatures.  The main box is designed as a 2-player starter set.  Players may add to their collection by purchasing additional button packs.  The game comes with 8 Spaceship Buttons, 7 spaceship tokens, rule book, score pad, 1D4, ruler and game counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
