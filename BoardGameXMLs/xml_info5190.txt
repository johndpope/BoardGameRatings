			<description>The Murder Mystery Party line of murder party games is the most extensive.  They were originally published by University Games in California, but are now produced in England, though they still carry a note that the rights belong to University Games (who, when you call them, have no knowledge of the recent episodes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These games play just like other main-stream murder party games like How to Host a Murder, Evening of Murder, Mysteries by Vincent, or Milton Bradley's Life of the Party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whose birthday party ended in murder?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time is the present, the place is The Crystal Club and Sir Montague Funtingdon-Smythe is celebrating his birthday.  His friends have been invited to join in the celebrations but before the party gets into full swing, Sir Monty is found dead in the study.  Who is responsible for giving him the full monty?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suspects include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Gaston Flambee -- French Restaurant owner&lt;br/&gt;    India Ganges -- Romantic Novelist&lt;br/&gt;    Givva Goodtime -- American Society Hostess&lt;br/&gt;    Rich Pickins -- Antique Dealer&lt;br/&gt;    Juke Box -- Manager to the Pop Stars&lt;br/&gt;    Satina Silk -- Accountant to the rich and famous&lt;br/&gt;    Jim Nastics -- Personal Fitness Trainer&lt;br/&gt;    Taka Hike -- (most people wish she would) Gossip Columnist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
