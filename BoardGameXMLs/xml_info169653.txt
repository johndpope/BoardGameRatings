			<description>Set in 8th century Northern Britain, Before Scotland: 750 AD - Empires is an epic economy-based tactical-combat strategy game. It is historical in nature with a rich context and set of mechanics drawn from original sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins in 750 AD and lets you play as one of four kingdoms who struggle for supremacy: the Angles, Britons, Gaels, or Picts. After choosing a Leader and Moral Cause that give special abilities to your kingdom, each player works through four seasons each year: planning, deployment, battle, and recovery. During planning season, you collect tax revenues, recruit troops, and identify battle targets. During deployment season, you muster Warbands, travel the environment, and scout the terrain. During battle season, you engage opponents in battle and resolve individual skirmishes. During recovery season, you pay maintenance, retreat units and reinforce adjacent territories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actions in each phase affect the outcome of the next phase. For example, by travelling the Environment and scouting the Terrain during deployment season; you will alter the engagements in battle season. The battle system requires each player to select up to 3 Warband Unit cards, from their hand, that face-off with competing kingdoms. After a simultaneous reveal, cards are resolved one-versus-one with additional Supply, Tactics, or Training cards from the Warband, and purchased during planning season, that are used to modify the encounter. Winning cards remain at the settlement. Losing cards are returned to the Kingdom Reserve and must be re-purchased to re-enter the game. The game ends after 5 (shorter), or 10 (longer), years of in-game play and the remaining player with the highest net-worth wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is targeted at the serious strategy gamer and it is an in-depth title that combines deck-building, a working economy and geographic constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
