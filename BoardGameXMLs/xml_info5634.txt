							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chicken Out</name>
									
			<description>This delightful children's game cosists of six contests, each requiring a player to take a chance and advance or &amp;quot;chicken out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bright plastic spinning chicken controls movement by bobbing its head until it suddenly stops and pecks a number (from 1 to 4)... players must move the number that was spun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players may stop at any time, call &amp;quot;Chicken!&amp;quot;,  and collect money equal to the space where their token lies; otherwise, they spin the chicken again to try and collect a higher reward.  If a token moves past the end of a track, it collects nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After six different tracks are played, the player with the highest total is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
