			<description>This is a two-player German war game published in about 1880. The playing board features a castle in the center surrounded by a two-layer multi-colored track running from 1-70. On each side is rectangular block of colored numbers, with 1-35 on one side and 36-70 on the other. There are illustrations of fighting in the four corners, with uniforms representing the then-recent Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start, the players each put an agreed amount into the pot to fund the war. They then take turns rolling a single die, and advancing that many spaces on their respective tracks. The first to reach space 70 wins the war and the pot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The color of each space has an effect on play. If a player lands on a green space, the opponent must drop back to the nearest red space. A player who lands on a blue space must pay one mark to his opponent. Landing on a gold space means paying a mark into the pot, while landing on a lilac space grants another roll of the die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a sheet of paper pasted onto thick cardboard. A second game is pasted onto the reverse side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
