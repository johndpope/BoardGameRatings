							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Revolver: Brady Logan Promo Card</name>
									
			<description>Originally from Ireland, Brady Logan had a chequered career before finding himself a deputy at Repentance Springs - he joined the navy in 1856 aged 15 years and 9 months, and spent most of his early career aboard HMS 'Royal Adelaide'. He also spent three months of his service in diving bells in the Mediterranean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The records show that he married on September 14th 1867 in St Senan's Church in Kilrush. It is not recorded if the couple had any children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brady was later discharged (referred to as a 'bad chicken dinner') from HMS Liverpool for reasons unstated, but guessed to be insobriety on duty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After his wife died of 'The Shakes', Brady sobered up and travelled to America, visiting his sister and her mining engineer husband - both were employed by the Cottonwood Mining Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brady worked at Rattlesnake Creek for a time, utilising his knowledge of rifles and explosives to make a few bucks - even completing a contract for Fort Murphy up at Lincoln County.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonel Ned McReady deputised Brady when the McSween brothers and gang kidnapped Jackie Peppin. During the gunfight at Peppin farm, on Sept 1st, 1891, Brady shot both brothers in the face at one hundred yards, and also 'Turkey' Joe in the buttocks. Ned is reported to have called Brady Logan 'The best shot with a rifle the Lord has ever seen.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noted to have an eagle tattoo on his left forearm, from his service days, Brady also sports a small scar on his upper lip - he insists it was cut by an Apache knife, others whisper that it was from years of playing the Mouth Harp. Badly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Married his second wife, Josie Hopkins, at St Ezekiel's Episcopal Church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Was also once struck by lightning during the summer of 1890.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
