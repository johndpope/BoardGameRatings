			<description>Interpoly (2 player)&lt;br/&gt;One player has 16 red pawns (policemen), the other player has 4 yellow pawns (gangsters). Movement is determined by a die. Red may share the die result between two or more pawns. The police tries to enclose the gangsters and the gangsters try to escape to the 4 home spaces in the corners of the game board. On the roll of a 6 red may roll again, yellow may take 1 red pawn off the board. 1 captured policeman counts 1 point, 1 enclosed gangster counts 2 points. After the game, the players switch their roles and after 2 games the player with the most points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kuddelmuddel (2 or more player)&lt;br/&gt;4 red pawns are placed in the center of the game board, the rest are placed near the board. The destination spaces are marked with the letters A-F. Each player is assigned to one destination space. Movement is determined by a die. Each player may move any pawn. If he gets one on his destination space he keeps that pawn and places a new one in the center space.&lt;br/&gt;The player who gets the most pawns to his destination space wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
