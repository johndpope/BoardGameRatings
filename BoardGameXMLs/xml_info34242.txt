							<name primary="true" sortindex="2">&quot;Inside&quot; Base Ball</name>
									
			<description>A tin lithograph board game displaying a baseball diamond with a large metal spinner in the center. The approximately 13x13&amp;quot; board is in the form of a tray, with the spectators and outfield fence (as well as the instructions) printed on the inside edges of the tray. The game includes 18 metal discs (3/4&amp;quot;) naming players from the 1911 World Series teams, the New York Giants and Philadelphia Athletics. The discs are used to track the competitors at bat and on base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players play the game by following the general rules of baseball and spinning the four-armed spinner to generate results which are specified by results boxes of varying sizes arrayed in a circle around the spinner. According to the publisher, &amp;quot;the percentages of plays spaced on the board have been calculated from the actual number of balls pitched, hits, put-outs, etc., from hundreds of games played by these leagues.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board has six metal arrows mounted to it which are used to track the inning, outs, balls, strikes, and the score for each team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
