							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Assault on Goblintown</name>
									
			<description>The Assault on Goblintown is a strategy dungeon crawling game for two players. The first player runs the adventurers - skilled, armored, magically enhanced, and freshly bathed. They are invading Goblintown to capture their treasure and drive them from the countryside. The second player plays the Goblins - sneaky, tunnel-digging, weak and utterly lacking in the social graces. They make up for it by their unending numbers and ability to make new tunnels to attack the adventurers from any direction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is made from laser cut wood - 20 Goblins, 4 Warriors, 2 Archers, 1 Wizard and 1 Priest. It also comes with 4 laser cut isomorphic boards that fit together in many ways to create a new Goblintown for each game! It is all contained in a hand made, laser cut red plywood box that looks outstanding on any game shelf!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
