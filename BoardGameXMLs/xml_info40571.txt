			<description>Stratocracy is a grand strategy empire building game.  2-8 players will construct a modular board that is unique from game to game and take turns exploring the board, and coming into conflict with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players have a limited set of moves and military pieces they may use during the game, and are trying to be the first to win via one of two listed victory conditions (one based on exploration, the other based on battle).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The turn sequence is broken into three phases (Treasury, Movement, and Battles) and each player completes his turn fully before it is passed to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules are provided which gives players access to a set of nine nation cards with unique abilities that will alter their play-style, as well as rules for faster play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stratocracy is part of a series of print and play boardgames published through Bell of Lost Souls.  This series is provided as a downloadable pdf which includes everything needed to play except dice.  Players may download, print out the pieces, and start playing.  The game is designed to be enhanced with common playing pieces found in other games for those would prefer to not use counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STRATOCRACY is available FREE at BoLS Board Games: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.bolsboardgames.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.bolsboardgames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
