							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fairmondo: das Spiel</name>
									
			<description>Fairmondo is the project to create a global online-marketplace - owned by its local users. This is realised through a network of independent local co-operatives in every covered country. The first prototype was launched in Germany in September 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The makers of Fairmondo have now turned their experiences into a co-operative card-game. The players have to hold their ground as operators of online-marketplaces against the market leader who is trying to install a monopoly.&lt;br/&gt;The player have to bring together supply and demand, build up a strong community and cooperate cleverly to establish their alternatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
