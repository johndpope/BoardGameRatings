			<description>9 Kingdoms is a miniatures adventure game that combines elements of roleplaying and wargaming. It provides a unique interpretation of the common fantasy races and monsters for game play. The game can be scaled from a small handful of figures up to several dozen.  Players can customize their own figures, individualizing them with skills and building them up with experience both within a single game and from game to game. The rulebook provides a variety of scenarios, including everything from straight up battles to dungeon crawls to an assault on a wizard's stronghold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike other miniatures games, a figure is not killed with 1 or 2 wounds. Each figure is given a specific set of points sources that represent both its health and effectiveness. As a figure is wounded, it becomes less effective throughout the course of the game.  The combat system is simultaneous and figures make opposed rolls for both offense and defense to determine combat results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the point sources, figures can be &amp;quot;trained&amp;quot; in different skills including weapons, armor, magic, and many other types of special abilities. Figures with different skills can be combined in an endless variety of ways to create effective combat and adventuring squads. Each of the 10 major species in the 9 Kingdoms has its own special racial abilities which makes the different teams original and dynamic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All scenarios also incorporate an element of exploration in the form of encounter tokens on the board.  These tokens can be flipped during the game to uncover treasures, traps, powerful artifacts and even wandering monsters.  This adds an element of risk and unpredictability to the game as an encounter could turn out to be either be dangerous or profitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
