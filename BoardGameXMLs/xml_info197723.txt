							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pusher Gnomes</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pusher Gnome is a specialist who has applied his or her innate racial talents to the manufacture and distribution of special Gnomish drugs. These drugs are so incredible that they can sometimes seem to have nearmagical effects, though they are in fact completely mundane in their nature and origin. Of course, being Gnomes, the Pushers are not always successful in creating the drugs and unforeseen and (sometimes) dangerous side effects are not at all uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Written for Lamentations of the Flame Princess, but compatible with all OSR systems, the world of Meatlandia is bloody and horrific and just a little gonzo. This is a modern OSR take on old Weird fantasy pulp worldbuilding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
