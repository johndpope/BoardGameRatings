							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">To the Aid of Falx</name>
									
			<description>To The Aid Of Falx was the first AD&amp;amp;D adventure module by the RPGA division of TSR. It was designed for use at Gen Con tournaments and was made available to RPGA members. It is a stand-alone adventure for 6 PCs levels 5-9, a straight dungeon crawl that can be dropped into a regular AD&amp;amp;D campaign. The pack is a simple 8pg booklet giving the GM all needed to run the adventure including 6 unnamed PCs to hand out. The cardboard cover acts as the GM screen with a grid map and an isometric map showing the depths of the dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The silver dragon Falx Templamut has called for help. Five potions of Silver Dragon Control have been stolen from his lair by underground forces. Falx offers wonderful rewards if you can return each of the potions, but you must face well organised foes possibly lead by a Vampire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title page blurb:&lt;br/&gt;An RPGA&amp;reg; AD&amp;amp;D&amp;reg; Tournament Module for 6 characters, levels 5 - 9&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falx, a silver dragon and nephew of old Bahamut himself, has a problem. He needs a hardy band of adventurers to explore some caves near his lair, for the dark powers lurking therein have stolen five potions -of silver dragon control! Can you penetrate the dangerous complex without triggering the alarms, to find and destroy all the potions before sundown?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first of the RPGA series of AD&amp;amp;D modules. Each RPGA module has been used at an official Gen Con&amp;reg; tournament and has been designed to provide maximum entertainment. TO THE AID OF FALX is usable in campaign or tournament play, and may be scored by points or using the RPGA Tournament system. This adventure is designed for a balanced party of 5-8 characters of levels 5-9, and 6 tournament characters are provided, along with standard AND isometric maps, scenario and character background information, and detailed encounter descriptions for the DM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
