			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small Problems, Big Fun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With GURPS characters, as in life, it's often the little things that matter most. Take quirks, for instance. At just -1 point apiece, you might think they don't count for much. That's one way of looking at things . . . but not the only way, and certainly not the most fun way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GURPS Power-Ups 6: Quirks shows you just how much color a few quirks can add to your characters. It collects all the formally defined quirks published up to February 2013 and adds a bunch of totally new ones, many inspired by NPCs from GURPS supplements dating back as far as 1986. The result is nearly 200 quirks &amp;ndash; most of them highly customizable, many with numerous examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volume also explores and expands the role of quirks. Ever wonder about what effects make a &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; quirk? What can and can't be a quirk? The five-quirk limit? Graceful ways to handle adding, removing, or changing quirks? Here are your answers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're looking for ready-to-go quirks, ideas you can quickly adapt, or just a little inspiration, GURPS Power-Ups 6: Quirks has what you need to populate your game worlds with interesting people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
