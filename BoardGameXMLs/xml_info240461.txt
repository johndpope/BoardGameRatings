			<description>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Wardens is a 1-4 player post-apocalyptic adventure set in a Lovecraftian steampunk universe, offering different types of scenarios such as One against all, Solo and Co-op mode. The Wardens co-operatively maneuver their steam-powered armies in search of Mythic Artifacts.  Along the journey they must fight the chaotic madness of Cthulhu and the growing forces of his Starspawn minions, in an epic battle for the survival of humankind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History:&lt;br/&gt;The annals of prehistory describe a time of peace and unprecedented enlightenment and creativity lead by a mysterious earthly race called, the Naacal.  A hostile and cosmic family of entities lead by Cthulhu invaded the world seeking to usurp the Naacal&amp;rsquo;s power and send humanity into madness.  The Naacal Elders, with the aid of powerful Artifacts contained Cthulhu and his Starspawn, entombing him in a Stone-city where he sleeps to this day at the bottom of the ocean, forgotten in history.&lt;br/&gt;The Elders retreat, allowing the world to set its own future but not before establishing a Naacalean bloodline of guardians to watch and defend, known as The Brotherhood.  The most powerful and trained of these guardians were known as Wardens, sworn to keep vigil over the cosmic threat that slumbers beneath the world through their superhuman ability and with the power of the Artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of years later an unearthed scroll warns of Cthulhu&amp;rsquo;s return to seek vengeance on the Naacal and humanity itself &amp;ndash; that warning comes to pass as an awakening Cthulhu spreads his tentacles across the world, this time imprisoning the Naacal Elders.  The Brotherhood is left in ruins as the world falls to madness and burns.&lt;br/&gt;Time is running out for humanity&amp;rsquo;s remnant and only our three remaining Wardens stand between Cthulhu freely roaming the world and humanity becoming enslaved to his madness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal: &lt;br/&gt;As Cthulhu&amp;rsquo;s dreams are beyond humanity&amp;rsquo;s ability to defend against, only the Wardens ​​are strong enough to travel the world in search of the powerful Artifacts that belonged to the Naacal.  If found, the Artifacts can release the Elders who will fight one last time to return Cthluhu to his submerged stone-city where his nightmares can no longer harm humanity.  &lt;br/&gt;To fight the Wardens&amp;rsquo; armies and stop them from finding the Artifacts, Cthulhu and his powerful Starspawns will spread madness, converting the Wardens &amp;quot;Insane&amp;quot; and turning them against each-other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: &lt;br/&gt;One player takes the role of Cthluhu and control his Starspawns minions as they rise across the world. Cthulhu spreads madness and corrupt the Wardens at his will while battling against their armies to prevent them from finding the Artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;During the Coop and Solo Scenarios, the Wardens will fight against the Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1-3 players are the Wardens, each controlling their own steam-powered army over land, water and sky. The vehicles can be upgraded with crafted components in order to take control of the territories they cross, fight Starspawns, call for reinforcement and go on Expedition, in search for Artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Warden has their own characteristics, abilities and strategies which differentiate them with three totally different gameplay, adding a lot of replay-value to the game. They must absolutely work in coalition if they want to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles in Wardens are diceless. Instead, opponents will engage in a strategic mini-game to read each other's mind by tossing Strategy Battle Coins using a rock-paper-scissor mechanic deciding your fate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, to prevent the Wardens from locating Artifacts, Cthulhu can spawn powerful Starspawns through various Portals across the map and combat the Wardens&amp;rsquo; three types of vehicles.  Cthulhu himself can move, giving his Starspawns an Over-Power bonus or if a Warden is present and increase his Madness level.  Cthulhu doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to kill the Wardens, he desires to corrupt them, making the Insane player fight for him against the other Wardens. Once all three Wardens become corrupted, Cthulhu wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wardens also includes different mechanics such as Prophecy and Ability cards, Expeditions and an integral Dark Star Alignment Track, which add yet another dynamic to gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the Wardens prove strong enough to prevail against Cthulhu, or will humanity be lost to madness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
