							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Germ Crazy</name>
									
			<description>Back of game box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Germ Crazy is a real-time medical battle set within the human body. You play the role of an adventurous (and very small!) doctor whose task it is to enter your brother's body to do battle with the common cold as you have never seen it before. Armed only with a box of man-sized tissues (and the latest medical technology) you must cure this virus before it makes a four-course meal out of his major organs. Panic as your medical support team discovers that $3.50 does not go far enough on private health care and that life support machines are in short supply on the &amp;quot;Black Market&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
