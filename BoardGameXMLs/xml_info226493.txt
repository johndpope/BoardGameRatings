It combines classical western elements with the cyberpunk style of the 80s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alternately Cy-Co and Crime Evil perform their actions. When both players have finished their rounds the civilians move with their own card deck randomly on the game board &amp;ndash; trying to escape the villain Crime Evil in panic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve their goals, the players have to strategically outmaneuver each other and thus thwart the machinations of their adversary.
