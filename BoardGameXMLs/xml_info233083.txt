			<description>Etchessera is a chess-based abstract strategy game that utilizes draft-able armies in a medieval fantasy setting.  Before each game, players build their own chess army from a collection of 17 different pieces.  All of the original pieces from chess and checkers are available as well as several new ones such as a wizard, dragon, or guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a player's turn, they choose to move or activate one of their pieces.  Many pieces are similar to classic chess pieces in which they capture others by moving onto the same square.  Some capture by jumping, and others capture via rolling a certain result on a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in chess, the ultimate goal of the game is for each player to capture their opponent's King.  Similar to the classic game, there are opportunities for stale-mates that result in draws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
