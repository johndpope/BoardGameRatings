			<description>The goal of the game ist to get points by enclosing opponent playing pieces. The players can set their pieces (with their faces down) on any free space on the game board. When all pieces are set, the players beginn to move their pieces one space per turn. If a piece is enclosed, so that it can't move, its face is revealed. It's eliminated from the game and the encloser gets the indicated number of points, but only if a black inscripted piece is caught on a space with a black center or a white inscripted one on a space with a white center. If this is not the case, the enclosed piece is put on any other free space of it's players choice. When a 6-eyed piece is eliminated, it's player too is eliminated from the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was published in the 1930s or 1940s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
