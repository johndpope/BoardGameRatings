You decide to sneak into the Royal Palace, break in its Treasure Room, and look for the mythical treasures rumored to be hidden there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among piles of gold, emeralds and precious jewelry you stumble upon a chest containing a mysterious Hourglass. As soon as you touch it you are filled with mystical energy and realize its true power: You are now able to see glimpses of your own future. By taking different courses of action, different paths unfold before you, allowing you to shape your future as you see fit. Unfortunately, everyone in the palace is now after you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Thief's Fortune is a card game for 1-4 players in which each player represents a different possible future of the same character.
