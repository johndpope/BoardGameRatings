							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bag of Holding</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most common items available, created, or discovered, as treasure is the bag of holding. Though this item is nearly mundane in its rarity, it has a great deal of myth behind it, having a long history that has seen the millennia pass by. Recently several scrolls were brought forth by Silytha apprentice of the necromancer Gul&amp;rsquo;Lugal shedding light on the mysteries of the creation of the bag of holding as well as several incidents when the bags were used for purposes that may have been a bit beyond the original intent of their creator. Whatever, the case, bags of holding have become an important and valued commodity throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creator of The Bag Of Holding&lt;br/&gt;     History of The Bag Of Holding&lt;br/&gt;     New Lesser Artifact: Non-Dimensional Robes&lt;br/&gt;     New Spells: Dimensional Mine, Two-Dimensional Storage And Two-Dimensional Sword&lt;br/&gt;     Variant Rules: Astral Rifts&lt;br/&gt;     Variant Rules: Ethereal Bag Of Holding&lt;br/&gt;     Variant Rules: Other Containers Of Holding&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
