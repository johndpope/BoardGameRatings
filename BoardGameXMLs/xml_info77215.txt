			<description>Link's Crossbow Training is set in a world in the style of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and in the game the player assumes the role of the protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link. To perfect Link's crossbow marksmanship, the player must pass a series of tests, starting with stationary bullseye targets, before moving onto moving targets and actual enemies. After every level, the player gets a medal depending upon their score. The types of medals range from bronze to platinum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Link's Crossbow Training features 9 playable levels, and the goal in each is to achieve the highest score possible within the time limit. These levels are divided into three main gameplay styles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In Target Shooting levels, players fire their crossbow at targets, which start stationary, but move as the difficulty increases in later levels. Hitting the center of the bullseye earns more points, and the points earned multiplies if the player hits subsequent targets without missing.&lt;br/&gt;     In Defender levels, players remain stationary, whilst retaining the ability to shoot and aim through 360&amp;deg;. Here, Link must fight off hordes of enemies, including Stalfos in a desert-themed level, and defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.&lt;br/&gt;     In Ranger levels, the player assumes complete control over Link (via the control stick on the Nunchuk), in levels including a siege on an enemy encampment, and fighting through a forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some levels, Link battles bosses, most of them having weak spots that the player must hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Link's Crossbow Training,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
