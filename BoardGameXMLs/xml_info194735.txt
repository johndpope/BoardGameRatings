			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kerak is a two-player, abstract strategy board game.  Players take turns moving their pieces across the 62 space hexagonal board, with the goal of capturing their opponent&amp;rsquo;s castle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls 18 pieces: 9 infantry, 3 archers, 2 cavalry, 2 knights, 1 hero, and 1 castle.  Pieces are distinguished by their movement and strength values.  Pieces also support each other, meaning that attacking and defending pieces are &amp;ldquo;strengthened&amp;rdquo; by those around them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, Kerak plays in two strategic dimensions: that of individual pieces, and larger strategic groupings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, since players set up their pieces one at a time, in any order or configuration, no two games of Kerak start the same. Every game starts and ends uniquely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
