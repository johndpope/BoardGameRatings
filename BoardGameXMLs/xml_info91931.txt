			<description>Ape Escape Academy, also known as Ape Academy in Europe and Piposaru Academia: Dossari! Sarugee Daizenshuu in Japan, is a game for the PlayStation Portable system that consists of a collection of 45 mini-games, many of which borrow from elements of Ape Escape 2. The game was first released in Japan and later in Europe and North America. By utilizing the PSP's Wi-Fi capabilities, up to 4 players can play at a time.&lt;br/&gt;Playing as a monkey working for Specter, the player must work up from junior class to senior class by playing mini games and meeting the criteria for each class. In each class, there are 9 mini games to complete. Failing to meet the criteria rewards you with an X, while meeting the criteria rewards you a O, similar to naughts and crosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each level has a certain number of lines required to pass the class (one line consists of 3 naughts, either horizontally, vertically or diagonal). The game also offers review lessons, for players that have almost met the requirements. Usually, these are mini-games that the player has failed previously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Ape Escape Academy&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
