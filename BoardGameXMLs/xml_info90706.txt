							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Meteos: Disney Magic</name>
									
			<description>Meteos: Disney Magic follows the same basic concept as Meteos, but makes many distinct changes, the most notable being that it features Disney characters as opposed to the various alien species from Meteos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player must hold the Nintendo DS sideways &amp;agrave; la Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!, creating a taller playing field on the touch screen. The top screen shows a particular scene, which changes when launching a certain number of Meteos off of the screen. Such scenes include Lilo and Stich, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Pirates of the Caribbean. One of the biggest changes in gameplay is the ability to drag tiles left and right, unlike the original Meteos whose tiles could only be moved up and down. This only applies to Easy, Medium and Hard modes; in Expert mode, only up and down movements are allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Meteos&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
