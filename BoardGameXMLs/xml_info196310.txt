							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Delicate Operation</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two roles players can have in A Delicate Operation: Doctors, or The Spy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctors are skilled medical experts who are working to save the King in order to prevent war and save Pangaea. Doctors can play any card during the Operation, and they have the ability to undo a mistake during play (the full details appear on their character cards). If that weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, the Doctor has been tasked with making secret alliances with other nations. This is done by exchanging a secret word with contacts during play. The full details of the Doctors&amp;rsquo; abilities are written on their character cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spy is not a medical expert, and he has a disadvantage while participating in the surgery (this is explained on the character card). The Spy is present to hinder the life-saving operation, to tamper with alliances, and to make alliances of their own. Like the Doctors, the Spy is trying to build alliances by exchanging their secret code word with other nations, except any nation that allies with a spy is penalized instead of rewarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game requires the use of a stripped pack of French playing cards, a timer, and special cards.  The special cards and character sheets are included as print-and-play components in the document.  The card game involved in play is not trivial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
