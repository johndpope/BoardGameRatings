			<description>&amp;quot;Transformers: The Headmasters (トランスフォーマー ザ★ヘッドマースターズ) is a 1987 Family Computer Disk System video game by Takara based on the toyline of the same name and released only in Japan. The game stars the Autobot Headmasters as protagonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You play as one of the Autobot Headmaster through four planets &amp;mdash; Earth, Cybertron, Master, and Jail &amp;mdash; fighting the Decepticons. Unlike it predecessor, Convoy no Nazo, players cannot switch between robot and vehicle mode, as they are predetermined by level. Players also cannot choose which Autobot to play. Players must collect them throughout the game, as they will be flown in by helicopter and will replace that Autobot when they die. Due to Headmasters being for the FDS, the game came with a save game feature similar to those found in early Zelda and Metroid games.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;The_Headmasters,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
