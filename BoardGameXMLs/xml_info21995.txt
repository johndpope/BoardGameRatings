			<description>The goal of this little roll-and-move game is for players to work together to make it to the finish line.  Along the way, they have some choices to make as to whether to which path to take and whether to remain together or to go their separate ways.  Depending upon where they land, they can draw Gold, Disaster, or Frustration cards that affect them depending on whether they are still with their partner.  The goal of the game is to be the player holding the least chips when the finish line is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per manufacturer advertisement:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Cooperation? is a hilarious experience. It lets you scheme, practice being crafty, have fun with disaster. Once you've betrayed your partner - and you probably will - watch out! If you choose to cooperate . . . beware!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooperation? stands unique among games. It's aim is to beat you, and, since all players are facing this same obstacle, someone has to be the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score Cooperation? high in entertainment. It's the kind of a game you will want to bring out at a party . . . and all ages can play. Four to six players, in teams of two. You will experience hours of fun and relaxation. &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
