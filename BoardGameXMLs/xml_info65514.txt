			<description>This game uses a standard deck of cards containing three jokers. It is split into two separate packs. One of them is contains the showcards. They are turned face up one at a time after everybody guesses what that card will be. Players get scorecards (the other pack of cards) for correctly predicting the suit, the rank or both. The round continues till the last showcard is revealed (which can be known if a player remembers all the previous cards), and then other rounds are played till a player reaches 173 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
