							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guardtower</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This lonely guard tower sits at a small cliff side harshly dividing the landscape. Its purpose is not only to provide warning if someone scales the cliff, it is the easiest way to get from the higher part of the plane to the lower or the other way around for miles in either direction. This makes the tower a valuable asset both in a military and an economic sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The towers thick walls are built from sturdy stones unlike the rock that can be found along the cliff side. It is divided into three floors. The first floor features a doorway to the countryside below the cliff. A wide wooden stairway connects it to the second floor which in turn has an exit to the land above the cliff and a stairway that leads up to the third and last floor. The third floor has no exit other then the stairs leading down, but a number of arrow slits provide  a good view of the surrounding land to both sides of the cliff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
