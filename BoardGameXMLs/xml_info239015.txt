			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Table Buddy is a standardized implementation of a non-player character companion to accompany parties of three players during Legends of the Shining Jewel organized play events.  Adventures in the series were optimized for four or more adventurers; often only three players were available.  In that situation, a Table Buddy accompanies the party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four standard Table Buddy builds - a Cleric, a Ranger, a Rogue, and a Sorcerer.  These classes are intended to &amp;quot;fill the gap&amp;quot; of the &amp;quot;standard four&amp;quot; classes typically used in adventures.  Each of the standard Table Buddy characters was built at levels 1, 3, and 6.  They all are presented as a standard two-page build on Legends of the Shining Jewel Character Sheet.  Additionally, a two-page &amp;quot;instruction&amp;quot; document was included with the document suite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The documents are distributed singly or in various groupings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
