			<description>Dugout Dreams is a baseball simulation that used one 20-sided die and two 10-sided dice. The game comes with 17 pitching charts on 5 pages, a color playing field on which to keep track of outs and base runners, score sheets, and various charts, including: fly outs, hit &amp;amp; run, hitting direction for left- and right-handed batters, runner advancement, ground outs, hold/steal, errors, and steals. Teams are available from various seasons, including some recent ones and 1926, 1948, and 1971. Players' ratings are listed on 8.5 x 11&amp;quot; card stock, one page for each team. (There are no individual cards in this game.) Ratings are based on actual performance from these respective seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play, roll a d20 and cross-reference the result with the Batting Rating on Player's Batting listing with that of the Pitcher's Chart, where the following results are found: blank (an out), W (a possible walk), or H (a hit). Each of these results requires an additional 2-4 rolls of two d10 dice to resolve a given play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitchers are rated for Start/Relief effectiveness, walks, strike outs, home runs yielded, ground balls, fly balls, stamina, hold ability, and fielding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Batters are rated in the following categories: Batting, HR, 1B, 2B, 3B, W, K, Fielding, Range/Arm, SAC, BS (base stealing) and BR (base running).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
