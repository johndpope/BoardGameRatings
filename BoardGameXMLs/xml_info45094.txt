							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Slayer&#039;s Guide to Sahuagin</name>
									
			<description>The Sea Devils&lt;br/&gt;For those that live far from the sea the sahuagin are unknowable creatures of the deep, used by parents as bedtime cautions to wilful children. Or perhaps they are told of around the campfires by adventurers, their tongues and imaginations loosened by mead, in electrifying deeds of bravado. These deeds are the product of an alert mind and an ear for a good story, for few away from the gentle lapping of the briny sea have ever met, let alone bested, the sahuagin and lived to tell such a rollicking tale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside You Will Find:&lt;br/&gt;- Sahuagin Physiology: Discover the sahuagin&amp;rsquo;s amazing natural senses and their ability to track blood scent through over a mile of ocean. Great concentrations of blood in the water drive them into an unstoppable frenzy that lays&lt;br/&gt;waste to their enemies.&lt;br/&gt;- Habitat: Delve deep into the sea to find an entire kingdom hidden from the eyes of the surface-dwellers.&lt;br/&gt;- Sahuagin Society: Never before seen information on how the sea devils endure day-to-day life. The religion of the sahuagin drives their culture and society, arranged into an unholy trinity dedicated to the annihilation of all life but their own. Here you will find full details on the sahuagin Royal Guard and High Priestess prestige classes.&lt;br/&gt;- Methods of Warfare: Though crippled by exposure to air, sahuagin are nevertheless a lethal enemy, able to lay waste to entire coastal settlements. Beneath the waves, they are truly without equal.&lt;br/&gt;- Role-Playing with Sahuagin: Games Masters are provided with complete information on who to portray sahuagin within their campaign, in a way players will never forget.&lt;br/&gt;- Scenario Hooks &amp;amp; Ideas: A series of jumping points to introduce sahuagin into a campaign, in a manner that reflects their unique way of life and style of fighting.&lt;br/&gt;- Sahuagin Village: A complete lair for sahuagin - a small part of an immense undersea kingdom, but a place lethal to any surface-dweller.&lt;br/&gt;- Sahuagin Reference List: A ready to go list of characters and enemies for players to face, should they ever dare venture into the domain of the Sea Devils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
