			<description>The game consists of 50 number cards and 60 numeral cards. There are various ways to play with these, aimed at children with dyscalculia issues, but grown-ups can also play this. &lt;br/&gt;The main rule set requires players to just use the numeral cards. The game starts with one card on the table. Now the players take turns either adding a card from their hand or replacing a card with one or more card(s) from their hand. The only condition is that the numeral on the table has to get bigger each time. A player who cannot increase the number on the table loses a point and the cards are dealt again. The maximum number that can be achieved with the included cards is nine hundred ninety nine thousand eight hundred and ninety eight (which is one word in German).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
