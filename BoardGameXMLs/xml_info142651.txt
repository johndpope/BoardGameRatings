The object of the game is to consume all the pips in the maze while avoiding being eaten by the chasers who are constantly attacking and trying to eat you before you eat the pips. When ever you eat the long lines in the maze the chasers can then be eaten by the GOBBLER and you will receive a randome number of points from 100-700 while the chasers are not one solid color. Becareful because the chasers can only be eaten for a short time after each time you consume the long solid lines.
