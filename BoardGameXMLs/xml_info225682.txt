			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who seek to gain power from a specific demon lord are known as demoniacs. All demon worshipers understand that sinful mortal souls become demons once the Abyss digests them, but the demoniac begins the transformation while he yet lives. The drow are particularly fond of this path, but typically refer to demoniacs as demonic initiates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prestige Class: Demoniac&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build Classes: The demoniac is built on the wizard, but the following alternate build classes are described below: arcanist, cleric, oracle, psychic, sacerdote, sorcerer, or witch. Other class builds have different options, see page 6, Alternate Build Classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Role: A demoniac is filled with abyssal energy, which he uses to shape himself, his comrades, and the world around him in the image of his demon lord.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sample character will be available on the Purple Duck News blog and will be later added at levels 1, 5, 10, 15 to this file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
