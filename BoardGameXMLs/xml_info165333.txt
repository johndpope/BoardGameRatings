			<description>The Game of Roaches is a beginner RPG that allows players to play as roaches who are trying to take over the house for themselves. Players will battle the everyday dangers in the house, such as the bug spray or chancla, in order to get into the rooms, like the kitchen or bathroom, to battle it out for ultimate control of the house. Players will roleplay as the various characters of roaches (cowboy, luchador, spy, etc.) to practice their roleplaying imagination skills. The game offers three levels of play which allows for very young gamers to play with experienced gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
