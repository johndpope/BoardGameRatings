			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The StarCluster 2 Guide to Starship Crew focuses in on the most important part of any starship: her crew.&lt;br/&gt;A crew on a starship is not just a group of individuals doing their job. &lt;br/&gt;The ideal starship crew is almost a family, a tightly knit team of specialists, each working for and with the others in a synergy.&lt;br/&gt;The crew live together in cramped quarters for years at a time, and personality is as important, if not more important, than expertise.&lt;br/&gt;The starship is their home as well as their office, their playground as well as their workspace. &lt;br/&gt;This Guide covers the crew at work and at play, because the play bonds them more tightly into the team, as the work provides them with a focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Guide to Starship Crew features 15 crew professions. It also covers the crew's leisure time activities - Eating, Drinking, Watching, Gaming, Dating, Excercising, Gardening, and Creating; as well as special types of crews, such as Military, Family, Married, Company, and Communal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
