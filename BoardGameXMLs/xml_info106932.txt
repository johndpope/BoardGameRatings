			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the commander of a submarine force using any one of twelve submarine designs representing four nationalities, your mission is to locate an enemy convoy, attack, and inflict maximum damage without risking the loss of your precious subs.  Directing a Mark VIIIB German U-Boat, you must quickly fire a spread of torpedoes and then utilize your ability to dive to a depth of 600 feet to avoid damage (which your old sub can ill afford).  Later, you may choose a Mark XXI, with its maximum underwater speed of an incredible 17 knots, to help demolish American convoys.  You will be hard pressed to fully exploit your fleet's distinct advantages...and avoid its fatal hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the opposing role - commander of the escorting destroyers and frigates - you must protect your convoy from the enemy below.  Using ships like the destroyer escort U.S.S. Buckley, you employ active sonar to locate and destroy enemy subs with depth charges, K-guns, and hedgehogs.  If you can force the submarine to surface, it will be easy prey for your guns.  At night, you must deal with the added possibility of facing a surface sub attack since darkness allows submarines to move in like PT boats.  By firing starshells to illuminate a suspect area, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the enemy and force it to dive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TORPEDO FIRE takes all battle factors into account...from the use of sonar to the periscope view seen by the sub commander.  The excitement and tension of underwater warfare have been carefully built into the game.  With attention to historical accuracy, each ship is rated for everything from maximum speed to maximum &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; underwater depth (although subs can exceed their maximum depth if you are willing to accept possible damage).  Further simulating real battle conditions, once a ship has received orders for course and speed, it will continue moving accordingly until otherwise directed.  TORPEDO FIRE takes you as close to ASW warfare as you'll wish to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By John Lyon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
