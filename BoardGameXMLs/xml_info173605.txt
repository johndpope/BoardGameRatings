			<description>From the instructions:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Vowel Bingo is a fun-filled way to strengthen and reinforce vowel skills. Each playing card contains eight labeled illustrations of objects having long or short vowel sounds in their names. The purpose of game play is to match each object's game with its correct vowel.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vowel Bingo is similar to standard bingo, but in order to place their markers, players must know and match short and long vowel sounds. Each player has a card with as series of pictures labeled with the corresponding words. The caller calls out a vowel sound--long a, for example--and players must search their card for a word/picture with a long a in the word. When a player has a complete row, their card is checked by the caller to make sure the vowels are identified correctly. If so, the player wins. If not, play continues until someone has a correct row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
