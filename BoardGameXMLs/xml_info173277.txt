							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Presidents Poker</name>
									
			<description>Did you know that nine U.S. Presidents didn't attend college? Or that six Presidents were born in Ohio, more than any other state? And that one President was stopped for a speeding ticket while riding a horse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Presidents Poker, players assemble a hand of President cards with the Presidents that have the most in common, including names, birthplace, college attended, number of children, height, and hair color. Each President card also has a fun fact about that President so that these historical figures really come to life. Chips are included for those who like to bet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
