			<description>Operation World Party Gaming introduces GETSOME, GETSOME: Bad Decisions, and GETSOME: Ladies night, which are a series of naughty games for normal people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GETSOME is a 2-4 'player' non-collectible card game, expandable up to 5-6 players with purchase of the expansion, Bad Decisions, and the deck can be enlarged through purchase of the first booster, Ladies Night. The goal is simple: earn yourself 10 Bed Notches while avoiding the consequences of your actions such as lost turns, Clingy Exes, STDs, and babies. The dialogue is both horrible and hilarious. Play is quick as everyone has the ability to play cards on another person's turn. A player will have seven cards in their hand and can GETSOME, become PREGGOS, gain a Status Effect, heal a Status Effect, or block a player from a GETSOME or PREGGOS encounter. Don't forget to call in your Wingman when the time is right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the game is the story telling, where you'll create the details of your deeds and how you overcame difficult challenges presented by your so-called friends in pursuit of your next conquest. Your evening will be filled with buddies, belly laughs, and blushing cheeks of the newly acquainted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heart of the replayability is in the multifunction design of many of the cards to perform different tasks depending on your needs. There are an unlimited number of ways for rounds to play out. There's an amazing breadth of crazy things you'll hear yourself say over the course of the night, and a card for just about every occasion. Once you GETSOME, you're definitely going to want to GETSOME again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
