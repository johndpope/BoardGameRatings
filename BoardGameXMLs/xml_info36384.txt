			<description>&amp;quot;Ikko&amp;quot; - one, a fragment, single&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Zendo&amp;quot; - the way of Zen, a mind-expanding game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ikkozendo&amp;quot; - a whole game of Zendo in one pocket!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ikkozendo is a variant of Zendo that is played with a limited number of people who all are present at the game start. All must be present at game start because Ikkozendo is a single stash game and, as such, there will not be enough pyramids for the Students to build koans to seek the secret rule or for the Master to build koans to disprove a rule guess. Because no more than two koans are made during a game, the players' memory of previous configurations of the koans is critical to finishing the game. Thus, if players come and go, as is allowed in Zendo, then the game can get stuck in &amp;quot;cycles,&amp;quot; as the same configurations are reused over and over again to disprove already-attempted guesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
