			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hollywood Lies is a dinner party murder mystery game for 16 to 22 guests and a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[NEW! -- this game now includes a FREE special version written for kids and younger teens.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us in a thrilling evening of scheming, intrigue and skulduggery. You will be in the middle of the action and it will be up to you to wheel and deal with the other guests. Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive Hollywood Lies? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's award night and Tom Speed's latest film, Dazzled to Death, has just swept the board and garnered five Erics - for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Sadly, Tom Speed's award for Best Actor was accepted posthumously by his wife, Zara Vicars, as Tom was killed in a driving accident late last night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite this note of sadness, celebrations are in full swing at the Dazzled to Death post-award party. Deals are being cut for future productions and everyone is having a good time enjoying the atmosphere and mingling with Hollywood's movers and shakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is there anything suspicious about Tom Speed's death? Who will win next year's Erics? Find out at Hollywood Lies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hollywood Lies lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory pdf file (37 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a cast list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
