			<description>Space War is a strategic space conflict game. The 2-4 players each start with a single home planet and must accumulate resources to build ships, capture additional planets (obtaining more resources), and eventually conquer the other players' home planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three types of ships that can be built, plus immobile (but transportable) star bases. Somewhat unusually, players must keep track of each ship's fuel and weapons, and have a ship stop off for refueling when it gets too low. The deck of cards adds events and such to the long version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The components consist of a board, 4 record sheets in plastic folders, crayons for the record sheets, a reference chart, a set of rules, a deck of cards, and 4 sets of pre-cut counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was also published (presumably with revisions) as Space War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
