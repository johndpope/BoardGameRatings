			<description>From daVinci website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taxi Driver is a board game for 3-7 players, who drive around the city looking for passengers. The map of the city is different every time you play, because it is composed by placing at random a grid of 16 tiles. Each round, five &amp;ldquo;destinations&amp;rdquo; are drafted; all the players, at the same time, try to mentally find the quickest route to drive five passengers home, starting from the taxi parking lot. The player declaring to use the least amount of time possible may win the round, but before he needs to take his taxi and drive his way through streets and traffic lights in order to prove he really is the fastest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
