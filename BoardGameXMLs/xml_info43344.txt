							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Puzzling Pastimes: &quot;Bothered Butcher&quot;</name>
									
			<description>A simple anagram game from the 1920s, produced by G.Delgado Ltd of London as part of the Union Jack series of &amp;quot;Puzzling Pastimes&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The games consists of 8 identical cards (games), each of which is printed with 20 anagrams of common cuts of meat found in a butchers shop. The purpose of the game is for each player to have a card, and identify as many of the anagrams as they can within a set time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good production values - cards are heavy duty and well printed - but limited replay value, as once you have worked out the anagrams on the card there is no point in playing the game again as you know all of the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of a series of similar games which include &amp;quot;Half hour in a Fairy World&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A Grocer's Mistake&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Careless Chemist&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Jollyfolks Supper Party&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Sportyboy Game&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Humorous Haberdasher&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advertised as &amp;quot;a clever and interesting game. For afternoon and evening parties&amp;quot;. Simple pleasures for simple folk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
