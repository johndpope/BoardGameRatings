			<description>&amp;quot;Conker's Bad Fur Day is a platform game developed and published by Rare, and distributed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The game stars Conker the Squirrel, a Rare character who had previously appeared in other games marketed towards children, such as Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64 and Conker's Pocket Tales for the Game Boy Color. Marketed as an &amp;quot;adult platform game&amp;quot;, Bad Fur Day features graphic violence, sexual themes, toilet humor and several film parodies. The game received very positive critical reviews, despite its limited advertising, and earned a cult following. A remake of the game was created for the Xbox in 2005, titled Conker: Live &amp;amp; Reloaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single player&lt;br/&gt;The visuals of Conker's Bad Fur Day were highly praised by critics.In the single-player mode, the player takes on the role of Conker and plays the game in a free-roaming environment. Conker can duck and jump a high distance vertically, as well as jump at least twice his height in any direction. Conker can also spin his tail around quickly like a helicopter for a few seconds. Rather than give it an official-sounding name, as is the unofficial 'tradition' in the video game business, Conker just calls it the &amp;quot;helicoptery tail thing&amp;quot;. This allows him to jump a little higher, navigate in the air to accurately land, and slow his descent when far from the ground. After a few seconds, the tail slows down, and he drops and is unable to do it again until he has landed and jumped again. Besides this, he has few other physical powers. He can swim underwater for a while until he runs out of breath, jog indefinitely and not get tired, and is strong enough to push heavy round objects, which in one of the later levels are a &amp;quot;big bourgeoisie boiler's brass bollocks&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conker can eat pieces of &amp;quot;Anti-Gravity Chocolate&amp;quot; to regain lost health and incidentally his life bar is represented by six-square chocolate bars. In a parody of similar platformers with unexplained floating pickups throughout levels, they were originally created by the Professor, but he threw them out the castle window when he started a new project. Afterward, Conker can eat up to six of them. There are two types of chocolate; regenerative chocolate and one-time chocolate. One-time chocolate disappears after eaten, and doesn't reappear until Conker re-enters the game world. Regenerative chocolate reappears 10 seconds after being eaten. Antigravity chocolate does not provide protection against certain things, such as falls from especially high heights, being hit by spinning blades, or being dismembered in a grinder. However, it does protect against being hit with a heavy object from above, such as a large dollop of feces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conker has a limited number of lives. The ability to do this in the context of the game is explained in a cutscene the first time that Conker dies; according to the game, squirrels have as many lives as &amp;quot;they think they can get away with,&amp;quot; similar to cats, and the Grim Reaper is willing to grant Conker another chance if he picks up squirrel tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Context-sensitive Zones&amp;quot; allow Conker to do things he could not normally do; he usually pulls a far-too-big thing out of his far-too-small pocket, although sometimes he turns into an anvil and slams into the ground. Zones under beer kegs can give him &amp;quot;drunken&amp;quot; abilities as well. For instance, he is able to stagger around and urinate on stone people and fire imps. Although most zones only work once, some can be used more than once, or even indefinitely. However, most of the context zones lose their purpose after being utilized, even if they are continuously usable. These context-sensitive areas usually take the form of &amp;quot;B-button pads&amp;quot;, and sometimes activate while Conker is in mid-air. However, they are always activated by a press of the B button. A light bulb appears over Conker's head when he is in a context-sensitive zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the gameplay in Conker's Bad Fur Day features parodies of various movies and games, such as Reservoir Dogs and Super Mario 64.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has a lot of strong language in it, but only censors a few words, with the subtitles of the speech containing the word being flashing symbols in red, blue, and green, like skulls, spirals, lightning, and stars. More words are censored in the Xbox remake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiplayer&lt;br/&gt;Conker's Bad Fur Day has a multiplayer option as well, featuring seven different minigames: Beach, Raptor, Heist, Death Match, War, Tank, and Race. It also has eight different levels, one for each mode. Health is measured in chocolates just as in the single player mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beach: The player controls either the Frenchies or the Tediz. As the Frenchies, the player must guide a french refugee up through the beach and into a waiting escape vehicle without getting killed by the Tediz. The Tediz fire down on the Frenchies from three different fixed positions located above the escape vehicles, utilizing either a sniper rifle, a bazooka, or a mounted machine gun in order to prevent the refugee's evacuation. The Frenchies are unarmed, but can retaliate by setting off a detonator switch, blowing up the Tediz who are preventing their escape and giving them a window of time to make the beach run uncontested. Though in any case, as the Sergeant, who has gotten the Frenchies to the beach, warns in the intro cutscene, within several seconds, if one of the Frenchies does not get killed by the Tediz or escape, they will be instantly killed by an off-map laser weapon, thus forcing Frenchies to move quickly and not wait too long. Frenchies score points both for kills(with the detonator) and by escaping, while Tediz score by killing Frenchies. &lt;br/&gt;Raptor: This involves up to two players playing as Velociraptors who are trying to feed a baby dinosaur, while the cavemen want to steal the eggs for breakfast. Both teams score points for kills, but Cavemen get extra points for returning the eggs to their frying pan. Raptors may also gain extra points by feeding swallowed cavemen to their baby. The cavemen team is much larger, as the raptors are far more capable in combat. &lt;br/&gt;Heist : This involves a parody of Reservoir Dogs in the intro. Four teams (either two per team or one player each, depending on how the game is set up)--Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow all take place in the robbing of the Feral Reserve Bank. The objective is to retrieve cash bags from the center of the level and run it all the way back to their corresponding vault without being damaged (in which case they lose the bag and it returns to the center). &lt;br/&gt;War: War can either be a large Team Death-match or Capture the Flag with all of the game's weapons scattered between each level. Each level has two bases, a large field between them, each with multiple access points and places for different tactics for example sewers where a gas canister can be planted to kill all unprotected soldiers in Total War (Death-match) or Sniper Towers. &lt;br/&gt;Tank: Players all spawn in their own bunker and go around a large canyon with optional, pickup upgrades and battle to the death. Players have the option of also grabbing a gas canister, much like in War, and returning to their bunker where they are protected. &lt;br/&gt;Race: It is simply the multiplayer version of a minigame within Single Player. Here, players must go around a volcano with their hoverboards. They can attack other players and, if not careful, crash into walls and die. The first one to make a certain amount of laps, determined before the start of the game, or is the last man standing, wins. &lt;br/&gt;Deathmatch: The deathmatch has all of the multiplayer maps available to play in, except for the ones used in Beach, Tank, and Race. Players may select their own characters, with some characters available only after entering cheat codes. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Conker's_Bad_Fur_Day,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
