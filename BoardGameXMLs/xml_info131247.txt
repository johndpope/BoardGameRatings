							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroes of Pinnacle City</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world teeters on the brink of disaster! Madmen with doomsday devices, countless alien races poised to invade, meddlesome time-travellers, interdimensional conquerors, vampires in government, and demons in coffee shops. The superpowered heroes of Pinnacle City are all that stands between the earth and total annihilation. Now if only they would do something about it instead of arguing with each other and hiding behind their secret identities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pinnacle City is the center of heroism, villainy, politics and catastrophe. Hardly a day passes without someone holding the city ransom or blowing up a large portion of it. Maybe you're a hero trying to have a normal life while keeping the world safe. Maybe you're an official trying to make those damned heroes get over their egos and petty squabbling and help, or to expose them for what they really are. Perhaps you're the villain with his finger on the button, poised to show the world what you're capable of. Or, just maybe, you're an ordinary citizen caught in the middle of it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
