			<description>That&amp;rsquo;s Wizard is a two-player simultaneous-action card game about dueling wizards. Both players will design a deck of seven spell cards to defeat their opponent with. Spells are organized into seven different schools of magic, such as Transfiguration, Charms, Divination, etc. There are over a thousand possible combinations to create your deck with!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have two resources to manage, stamina which represents your health, and power which is the magical energy that allows you to cast spells. Each spell has a range of power that you can use to cast it, such that it has a greater effect the more power you use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also have access to the two special action cards; Focus and Counterspell. Focus will bring you back to full power, while counterspell will prevent your opponent&amp;rsquo;s spell from have an effect, causing them to waste the power they used to cast it. Counterspell costs a bit of your own stamina however, and that cost increases the more you use it! Knowing when to focus, and when to counterspell is the key to victory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a simultaneous action mechanic. Each round, both players secretly choose a card from their hand to play, and secretly set a special dial to show how much power they are using with their card. Both players reveal their cards and dials at the same time. Spells that use less power will go before spells that use more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will play best two out of three matches. As the game progresses, you will learn more about the cards in your opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand, and be able to better guess when to counterspell and stop them! No matter how many powerful spells you bring a wizard duel, the key to victory is understanding your opponent!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-description from designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
