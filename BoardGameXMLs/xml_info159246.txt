							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rock Science: Festival</name>
									
			<description>Rock Science: Festival is a travel version of rock and metal trivia game Rock Science. The game covers hundreds of bands, from Classic Rock to Nu Metal via Trash Metal and many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to collect most point chips through answering questions. Question categories include rockers, albums and songs, and players may also be asked to hum riffs. All questions have three different difficulty levels - the higher difficulty a player chooses, the higher the possible reward in point chips. Other important game mechanics are betting (you constantly bet on the knowledge of co-players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes question cards (around 800 questions in total), die, point/betting chips and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
