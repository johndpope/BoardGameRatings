			<description>&lt;br/&gt;The Story Continues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heart of the Swarm continues the story of StarCraft II: the conflict between the humanoid terrans, the ravenous zerg, and the psionic protoss. As these races struggle, the specter of alien gods threatens to sweep aside what fragile stability still exists in the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sarah Kerrigan, the former zerg Queen of Blades, has seen her humanity restored by an ancient artifact, but she remains a threat to all she encounters. The memory of her time as the mutant leader of the swarm lingers &amp;mdash; as does her yearning for revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lead the Zerg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the zerg surge through the galaxy, you&amp;rsquo;ll control their vengeful avatar, and destroy your targets with Kerrigan&amp;rsquo;s powerful psionic abilities and years of spec-ops ghost training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kerrigan will continually grow stronger while she fights to reassemble and change the zerg swarm. By completing missions and advanced bonus objectives, you can unlock powers that strengthen the Queen (like regeneration and destructive psionics) or bolster the swarm itself with the ability to spawn banelings from beneath the ground or reconstitute slain zerglings at your base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kerrigan&amp;rsquo;s presence on the battlefield demands a clash of the titans. You&amp;rsquo;ll send her brood crashing against whole armies, but you&amp;rsquo;ll also pit the former Queen of Blades and her retinue against immense threats &amp;ndash; ancient zerg who refuse to swear fealty, tank-destroying overmechs, and more &amp;ndash; in intense &amp;lsquo;boss&amp;rsquo; battles unlike any we&amp;rsquo;ve deployed before in StarCraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Change the Swarm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zerg swarm is ever-growing, ever-evolving &amp;ndash; and you can shape it to your whims in Kerrigan&amp;rsquo;s evolution pit. Digest biomass on planets you&amp;rsquo;ve dominated, and you&amp;rsquo;ll unlock the ability to evolve zerg strains in one of two directions. You might transform your zerglings into leaping raptors or proliferative swarmlings, focusing your army on harassment or pure numbers&amp;hellip;and leaving the swarm forever changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to tweak zerg strains on the fly by mutating your units between missions, like making your zerglings attack faster if you&amp;rsquo;re going up against armored targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Battle.net, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/heart-of-the-swarm-preview/&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/heart-of-the-swarm-preview/...&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
