			<description>Fro the publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Calixis Sector, while not exactly considered a Warzone, none the less has a number of Mercenary Companies or organizations operating regularly within its borders. &lt;br/&gt;Mercenaries, or their representatives, can be found on most civilized worlds in the Sector, and their services are available for a price. Typically, they perform one job, or mission, but for those with the resources, Mercenaries can also be used as a standing force on a planet. &lt;br/&gt;Many Mercenaries have experience from the Imperial Army, but many are also trained from the ground up by the Mercenary Companies themselves. &lt;br/&gt;Mercenaries, being lone individuals or part of a large company, all work for the same cause; Imperial Thrones! This may not always be money though; sometimes they accept payment in arms and the like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
