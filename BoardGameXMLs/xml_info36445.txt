			<description>A card game of competing lords who must expand their control over the lands and fill their treasuries with gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players acquire and support various Resources, each of which are rated for revenue, defense points, and support requirements, if any. The Resource Cards include Villages, Towns, Mines, Castles, Cities, Knights, Ships, and Trade Routes. These efforts can be aided by Leader Cards and Advancement Cards. However, Invasion, Disaster, and Event Cards can hinder a player's efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last card is drawn from the deck. The player with the most gold wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
