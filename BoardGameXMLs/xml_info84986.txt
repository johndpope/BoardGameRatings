			<description>In Micronomic players bid for the initial class A buildings that will produce commodities (food, raw materials, money, basic workers, energy) and soon after, they will auction and build some of the class B ones. Once the University is operative, class C buildings come to the available pool. Once the Foundry is operative, class D buildings become available and whenever a class D building is operative, class E buildings will become available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every building is different and produces or transforms some commodity into another (skilled workers, manufactured goods, machines, Victory Points). Some buildings upgrade existing ones and players can force upgrades on unwilling building owners by investing in them and taking over the original building, leaving the original owner with the upgraded one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First player to reach or exceed 50 Victory Points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micronomic is an economic game that can play in under an hour and it's also small in box size, unlike most economic games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
