							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">BEGIN: A Tactical Starship Simulation</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game represents an unlicensed use of elements of the Star Trek franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Documentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin is actually a simulation of a simulator that tests your ability to command a fleet starship. For the first time, you will actually have the feeling that you are commanding a real starship, against real enemy captains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike almost all other space games of this type, Begin does not employ the unrealistic &amp;quot;quadrant-sectors&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;Mass Hoard of aliens&amp;quot; approach. Instead, all ships are created equal with intelligent enemy strategy being used to defeat the unsuspecting human player. For the novice player even a one-on-one scenario is quite a challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin also features four different nations, Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Orion, with the human player becoming the nation of their choice. The program also provides for numerous ship classes of varying design for each of the different nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are not any artificial &amp;quot;difficulty levels&amp;quot; in Begin. Instead if a player wishes for an easier scenario, they may command a fleet of up to seventeen ships against a smaller enemy force. For a more difficult scenario, one-on-nine is a more likely challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of Begin is (as usual) to destroy the enemy fleet before they destroy you. You will receive an evaluation of your performance at the end of the action. Your enemy is tough and experienced. He will do his utmost to destroy you with whatever fleet you give him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy this new level of sophistication in computer entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
