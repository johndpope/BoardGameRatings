							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends: Cargo Fun!</name>
									
			<description>Each player chooses to be one of the engines on the island of Sodor: Thomas (blue), Percy (green), James (red), and Duncan (yellow).  Each train starts in the roundhouse in the center of the board, loaded up with four pegs of their color.  On a player's turn, he rolls the die, which will direct him to the next blue, green, red or yellow section of track.  When a player lands in a corner section of track (all colored blue), the player can unload one of their pegs if there is not already a color of their peg in that corner.  The first player to unload all of their pegs and return to the roundhouse is the winner!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
