							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hangar Control</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product is a full-color, 16 x 10 inch map of a Hangar Control Room, and includes the VTT (Virtual Table top) files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you want me to alert hangar control to pull in the derelict ship with the tractor beam sir?&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Bridge Comm Officer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangar Control is a small two page map of a small science fiction hangar and corresponding control panel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hangar Control is intended for use in far-future science fiction. It could also be useful in a SciFi horror capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure hook for use with this map:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last Transmission: The last transmission of a small alien craft was a broadband distress signal. The group is in control of the nearest space ship in the sector. They could go to help the aliens or to salvage their vulnerable ship depending on their heroic or villainous leanings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they arrive on the scene, they find a derelict ship. Sensors indicate no life signs on the ship and complete life support failure. The group is too late. The group may wish to take the ship to give the aliens a proper burial or to take the ship for scrap and look for alien artifacts on board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the group decides to take the small derelict ship aboard, they head to the hangar control room to inspect the ship. As they inspect the ship, some of their crew is attacked by objects on the ship which seem to be animated and moving of their own accord. Is it a ghost ship? Or is there some sort of previously unknown alien life infecting the ship such as a small silicon-based life form bonding with the objects and willing them to move? And worse will these creatures move into the group&amp;rsquo;s ship and start infecting its systems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
