			<description>Wakkawakka is a turnbased two Player game. The goal is to capture as many cherries (victory points) as possible. Therefore players move their adventurer token in a pacman styled labyrinth. &lt;br/&gt;But just collecting cherries would be to easy. That's why each player also has a hunter to stop the enemy adventurer. Hunters cannot collect cherries, but when they capture the enemies adventurer it is reset to its starting position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So players have to decide how to spend their 3 move actions each turn on their hunter or adventurer token.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect 11 points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
