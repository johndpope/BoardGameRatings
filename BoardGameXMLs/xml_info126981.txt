							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sixth Tackle</name>
									
			<description>Possibly, probably even, the only statistical game based on Rugby League. (For those that don't know, at the end of six tackles the ball possesion passes to the opponent and he now has six tackles to try to advance up the field).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the designers familiar style, teams are rated based on their performances in recent years. Various charts are used as dice rolls are compared to the action in that turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think you could buy more team statistics from the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
