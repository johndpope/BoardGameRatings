			<description>A family game from the pre-war times (estimated).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players move their pawns round the railroad track according to the throw of two dice.&lt;br/&gt;The board is part of the game box basement.&lt;br/&gt;The track is colour-coded, so every time you land on a given colour you have to put a passenger chip (from your starting amount) into the station of the corresponding colour. &lt;br/&gt;To add some decision making you can choose if you want to do this on your own colour or not.&lt;br/&gt;Every time 10 passengers have amassed on a station, the complete board (all stations) is swept by the owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a pre-game agreed number of sweeps the game ends and the winner is the player with the most passengers in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little added spice are some red lights (wooden chips), which are placed in front of a train when the player throws a 2, 3 or 12.&lt;br/&gt;It can only be removed by throwing a 7, 11 or double.&lt;br/&gt;As long as the red light is on, the train thus blocked cannot move nor can the owner sweep the board should his station contain 10 passengers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
