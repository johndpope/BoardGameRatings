			<description>From introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Westbound is the game of epic adventure in the magical wild west. It is a game of imagination and improvisation, where people collaborate to create legendary stories of gunslingers and wizards. Westbound is typically played with one Game Master and several Players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Westbound is takes place after the industrial revolution of a classical fantasy world, where humans, elves, dwarves, and even goblins and Ogres are presented with the challenge of wrangling an age that is transitioning between archaic traditions and&lt;br/&gt;by technological marvels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Westbound is designed to integrate with ongoing campaigns, as well as being a jumping off point for new campaigns. Its rules are designed around gun-based combat, with grounded character creation rules that will keep players challenged and excited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
