Players move around the city answering trivia questions about the city and receive the letters N.E.W Y.O.R.K by answering at least one question correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must travel in each of the outer boroughs (the bronx, Queens,Brooklyn and staten island) and in the outlying counties (Nassau, west chester and hudson).  After going to these seven areas, they must then return to Central Park in Manhattan to answer a final question chosen by your opponent to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
