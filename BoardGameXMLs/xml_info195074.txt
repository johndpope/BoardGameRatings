							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Brotherhood (2004)</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game, submitted in several posts to an online competition forum, is a fusion of a particular setting with a fairly lightweight rules system.  The setting is a typical fantasy world, but one in which good has lost and evil triumphed.  But the evil has subsequently become listless and without energy, yielding an overwhelmingly negative but banal existence.  The characters - members of The Brotherhood adventure within this setting.  Characters have basic attributes and several spell-like powers.  Action resolution uses a d6 minus a d6, yielding a -5 to +5 spread that compares to a target difficulty.  The dice must be of identified colors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is ambitious and includes a brief bestiary and some advice for game masters.  However, the rules are fairly subtle and probably would require an experience game master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
