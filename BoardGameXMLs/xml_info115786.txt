			<description>Truck Racer brings you racing like you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before!

They&amp;rsquo;re large, brutally fast, and will pummel anything that gets in the way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this intense racing competition, you&amp;rsquo;ll choose from 8 unique circuits in unique areas of the world.

Nothing is safe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compete against up to 7 opponents, win trophies and unlock extra features including new trucks, tracks and a bonus game mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three main game modes to be played in Truck Racer &amp;ndash; Race, Truck Challenge and Track Challenge. There is also a special mode to be unlocked &amp;ndash; Dirt Track: Time Trial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-    Race Mode: Compete against seven other trucks in an unlocked truck of your choice on an unlocked track of your choice to score points and win trophies.&lt;br/&gt;-    Truck Challenge: Choose a locked truck and an unlocked track. Compete against the truck you chose and if you win, you will unlock that truck to be used in any mode. &lt;br/&gt;-    Track Challenge: Choose an unlocked truck and a locked track. Beat the set lap time to unlock the track you chose. &lt;br/&gt;-    Dirt Track &amp;ndash; Time Trial: Unlock all trucks and tracks to reveal this special mode.

Feel the thrill of high-horsepower, no-holds-barred trucks! Fast, massive, and unstoppable &amp;ndash; this is Truck Racer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
