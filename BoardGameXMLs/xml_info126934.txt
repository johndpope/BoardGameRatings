			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module for the Savage Worlds system has been specifically written so that it stays as honest and true to the show that inspired it, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. As such, several key rules presented below have been added to those normally found in the Savage Worlds Explorer&amp;rsquo;s Edition to facilitate this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tenet Against Violence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many roleplaying games prominently feature violence as one of the most important tools, if not the most important, at the disposal of the player characters. While this is a perfectly valid path (and makes for some exciting action and adventure) to take in a game, The Savage World of My Little Pony is meant to stay true to the show that created it. As such, the rules emphasize creative problem solving, storytelling, roleplaying, and teamwork over physical violence. In the show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, the characters defeat terrifying monsters and villains all without the use of violence, even in the face of similar danger. Every instance of violence in response is quickly shown to be futile, and the characters eventually triumph through their own skills, force of will, and teamwork. It is this spirit that The Savage World of My Little Pony seeks to capture, and in order to do this, an important rule has been added to the ones presented in the Savage Worlds Explorer&amp;rsquo;s Edition, called the Tenet Against Violence:&lt;br/&gt;In any game session in which one or more of the players resorted to violence, whether it is physical violence or other actions intended to cause deliberate physical or mental harm to themselves or others, all players receive no experience points for that session. This is ultimately up to the Game Master&amp;rsquo;s discretion, but it is intended to punish players who violate the spirit of the show and of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In place of the normal combat system featured in Savage Worlds, this module presents an alternate re-flavoring of the mechanics of combat in order to stay true to the show. These alternate rules allow for the same fast-paced action present in Savage Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
