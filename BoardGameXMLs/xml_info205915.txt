			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Annexe is a two player strategy board game built around the subject &amp;lsquo;Colonization&amp;rsquo;. It throws light on the nuances of discreet exchanges taking place in the process of colonization and the hidden transactions that happen inconspicuously. It is these unseen exchanges that define the future of a culture, hence constructing its crux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two player represent the native leader and the conquistador each and while the conquistador tries to claim their land with the power of money and army, the natives try to counter them by using their indigenous wisdom and the knowledge about the natural resources. But the play can take overturn if any of those two can manipulate the heritage in the process to their own favor by strategising well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
