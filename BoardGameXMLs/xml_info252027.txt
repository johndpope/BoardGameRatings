The winner gets the World Cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matches are played according to team&amp;rsquo;s features: Team Power, Fans Power, Mood, Luck. Each of the four features is compared. If a team has a higher level of a particular feature &amp;ndash; this team scores a goal. If the level is the same, nobody scores. During the game players will have many chances to increase levels of these features, and they should use them wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
