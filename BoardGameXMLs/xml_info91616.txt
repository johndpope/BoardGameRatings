							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grabbed by the Ghoulies</name>
									
			<description>Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a video game released on October 21, 2003 by Rare for the Xbox gaming console. It was the first Rare game to be published by the notorious Microsoft buyout from Nintendo, having originally been in development for the Nintendo GameCube. It is forward compatible with the Xbox 360. It was also re-released on the Xbox 360 as a downloadable Xbox Originals title on February 16, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghoulies follows a young man named Cooper Chance who sets out to rescue his girlfriend, Amber, from Ghoulhaven Hall. This mansion is full of supernatural creatures, and Cooper will receive help along the way from the many hired hands that work there. The game is well known for its scathing criticisms and low sales after the Microsoft buyout of the company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a break from tradition from previous Rare games the gameplay is simple in design, utilizing the simple premise of moving through the game's mansion and completing the required 'beat em'up' challenges for each room. Such challenges include killing all the Ghoulies in a room, beating only a specified kind of Ghoulie while avoiding killing the rest or defeating a boss before you can move on. All combat is maneuvered by a simple swivel of the control stick in the direction that you wish to attack. Any challenge failed or completed over the time limit results in the Grim Reaper coming after you (who will kill you if touched) until you exit the room. The main kind of Ghoulies in the game include Zombies, Mummies, Imps, Skeletons and Zombie Pirates. There are also various bosses that must similarly be defeated. As weapons most objects in the game are interactive similar in the fashion to the influenced &amp;quot;Dead Rising&amp;quot;. Soup cans can be used to upgrade abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Grabbed by the Ghoulies&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
