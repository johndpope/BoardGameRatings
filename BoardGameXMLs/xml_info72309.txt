							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Warlocks of the Dark Star</name>
									
			<description>Warlocks of the Dark Star is a strategic space wargame pitting the eponymous Warlocks against a group called the Technoids or Techlongs (the rules use both names). The Technoids, as suggested by their name, use technology, while the Warlocks use magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic system is not especially complicated but there is a fair amount of chrome. For example, the Warlock player receives magic points which can be used to build new units and create effects (such as moving a star system). The Technoid player can't create new units but can scavenge the wrecks of old ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, the Warlock player chooses an alien race to play (some of which have special powers) and chooses a home system and colonies, along with a decoy race; all of this information is kept secret. The object of the game for the Technoid player is to find and destroy the Warlocks' systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game should not be confused with Warriors of the Dark Star: The Age of the Neutron Wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
