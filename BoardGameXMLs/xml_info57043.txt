			<description>Endless Quest #28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;Ever since the Red Death cult murdered our parents in a raid, you have been responsible for your brother and sister's safety.  Now your sister lies near death and you must find some way to save her, in spite of the dangers that lie everywhere in this desolate future world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are about to enter the exciting world experienced by the players of the popular DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Game. It is a fantasy world filled with enchanted castles and fearsome monsters. Are YOU brave enough to meet its challenges?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other ENDLESS QUEST Books, you can combat secret agents skilled in espionage, journey to the corners of the galaxy, or attempt to survive in a future world ravaged by wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ENDLESS QUEST Book is based on an exciting role-playing game, but you don't need to know the game to enjoy the book. Just make your choices, and accept the consequences!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember! Only your choices lead to success in ENDLESS QUEST Books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
