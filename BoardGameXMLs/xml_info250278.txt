			<description>Honestly? is a bluffing game. Players win by lying to friends about whether or not they are actually a liar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player is dealt a single card stating whether or not they are a liar. Clockwise, they state if they are a liar or not, of course not having to tell the truth. After the statement, the next player either states &amp;quot;I believe you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I have concerns&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If concerns are expressed, the active player has 10 seconds to make their case that they are telling the truth. Then the accusing player must either respond with &amp;quot;I believe you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;honestly?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the accusing player says &amp;quot;honestly?&amp;quot; then the active player must reveal their card. If the active player was telling the truth, the accusing player is eliminated from the game. If the active player was lying, they are eliminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play continues until all players have been the active player or until only one player remains. If all players have been active and multiple players are in the game at the end of the round, then all players must reveal their cards. If any player(s) successfully lied, they win. If no players lied about their cards, everyone loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
