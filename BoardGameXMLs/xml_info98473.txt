							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spectra PR-1200</name>
									
			<description>A trivial-like game with an sci-fi touch. Each player start on the earth, and must travel thru space answering general knowledge questions, until they reach a planet, where they must answer questions about specific matters. If they answer correctly, they get their visa and can continue travelling until the next planet, and so. The first to reach planet Spectra wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like other Cefa games, there are two editions of the game: The cheap one, wich comes in a small, square box, and the more expensive one, which comes in a rectangular box. This one offers a better gameboard and includes an small black robot figure that didn't come with the other edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
