							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Devil Dogs: Belleau Wood 1918</name>
									
			<description>An easy to learn, fast-playing (1-4 hours) card-driven game for two players. The play map covers the historical French battlefield geography. The 300 counters and markers represent the historical units and incidents involved along with chits that determine initiative and order choice. These company sized units move using 180 meter hexes. The game is unique in that it captures the tension and high rate of casualties without ever casting a single die, relying more on planning and issuing orders as the active or reactive player. Each side will have a 30 card deck that is faction specific. The Devil Dogs of Belleau Wood has involved a great deal of research and play-testing, the result is an intense and satisfying game that keeps you on the edge of your seat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
