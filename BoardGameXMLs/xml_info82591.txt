			<description>Super Monkey Ball: Step &amp;amp; Roll is a platforming video game developed and published by Sega for the Wii.  It was released in North America on February 9, 2010; in Australia on February 11; and in Europe on February 12.  It was released in Japan on February 25.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is similar to the previous games in the Super Monkey Ball series. Players must guide the ball using the Wii Remote to the finish line in 60 seconds without falling off the level.   Along the way, players can collect bananas to help increase the number of extra lives remaining.  There are 6 worlds, with the addition of one secret world which can be accessed by completing the other six worlds without using a continue.  Players can also use the Wii Balance Board and shift their bodies to control the monkey ball.  The new control scheme was an effort by developer Yasuhito Baba &amp;quot;to find a new way for players to experience Super Monkey Ball in order to increase the 'party feel' of the title&amp;quot;.  The game features 21 minigames which provide different scenarios for players to overcome.  The minigames were developed for players to play with three Wii Remotes and one player with the Wii Balance Board; they were designed so that players battle against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Super Monkey Ball: Step &amp;amp; Roll&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
