			<description>Publisher's website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to find prophecies and their matching fulfillments for six famous Prophets. When a match is made it scores a point for the player who made the prophecy. The first player to make three prophecies is the winner! Throughout the course of the game, Trials and Tribulations stir up trouble. Angels and Guardians may be able to help protect your Prophets from time to time, and Divine Interventions can help you as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
