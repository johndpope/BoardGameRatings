			<description>Given a fraction, the player will be able to reduce the fraction to its lowest terms. The learner will then multiply the reduced fraction by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 to produce an equivalent fraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game design is similar to that of the children's game, &amp;quot;Go Fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If the player has pairs of equivalent fractions he/she can start their own &amp;quot;count&amp;quot; of pairs. If the player can find no matches he/she will ask any player by name, for an equivalent fraction. For example: &amp;quot;Adam, do you have an equivalent fraction to 1/2?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Adam does have the equivalent fraction, Adam must surrender his card. The player continues asking the others until one player has no match and will have to reply, &amp;quot;Go Reduce.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The player will then take a card from the face down pond. The next player is on his/her left.&lt;br/&gt;     The play continues until all cards are matched. If players run out of cards, the game has ended for them. They will have to wait until all players have played their hands.&lt;br/&gt;     The winner is the player with the most pairs of equivalent fractions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;48 cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
