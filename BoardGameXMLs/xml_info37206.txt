							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon in Italy</name>
									
			<description>Napoleon in Italy is a simple two-player strategy game of maneuver and combat that simulates a portion of the campaign in November 1796 between the Austrians and the French in northern Italy.  Players move their forces and have combat across the map in an effort to occupy key areas at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game, published in Issue #3 (Spring 2008) of Panzer Digest, comes with a mapsheet, set of unit counters and markers, and rules (printed within the magazine).  The map represents a portion of northern Italy where the original campaign was conducted.  Movement on the map is regulated via a series of areas, usually representing towns.  Areas that are connected by a line are adjacent to one another.  There are no terrain effects in the game, and any one area is the same as any other, though some areas are designated with a star to represent victory areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;French and Austrian units represent divisions, and each combat strength point represents approximately 1000 men.  Units take losses in combat by marking off lost strength points from a unit roster.  The overall commanders, Napoleon for the French and Alvinczy for the Austrians, are also represented by counters.  Napoleon has a number of special benefits, to help balance the massive numerical advantage of the Austrian army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the game begins, players bid the number of victory points they claim they can earn playing the Austrians, and the player with the highest bid must earn at least that many to win.  Each turn represents three days of campaigning, and the game lasts six turns.  Playing time is about 20 minutes solitaire, about 45-90 minutes against an opponant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
