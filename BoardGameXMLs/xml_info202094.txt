			<description>Ferocious Fantasy&lt;br/&gt;Issue 1&lt;br/&gt;June 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside you will find a short adventure called &amp;quot;Into the Tundra&amp;quot; by Slade Stolar where a group of sourdoughs must travel across the Bighorn Mountains to fulfill their contract as pallbearers for a fellow panner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then we have 20 spells based around survival in the winter months or in the farthest northern reaches. Also, a new type of character called the Snow-Speaker, who was born from a glacier and was baked by the sun from an ice block to become a person in appearance (but far from a human in ability).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last article is a rundown on transitioning from the eternal summer to a harsh winter in the setting and what little bits should be thought about before making a purely aesthetic shift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
