			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Glory is a fan-made game based on the Europa Universalis II engine published by Paradox Interactive, the makers of the original game. You take the role of a country's government from the late middle ages through the renaissance and into to the early modern era. This is done by determining domestic and foreign policies. You engage in diplomatic, religious, trade, exploring and military ventures in the struggle of furthering the means of your nation. Wars will be fought, countries extinguished with the stroke of a pen. New continents will be discovered and claimed by the power-hungry European countries. Technology will advance from knights and archers to the level of the Napoleonic Wars. Religion will threaten to tear the known world apart forever and in the end lead to modern ideas of tolerance and acceptance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 10000 scripted historical events help set the scene. Press through the Treaty of Tordesillas. Expulse or integrate the Huguenots. Declare Moscow the third Rome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as the centralized Swedish state during its days of greatness. Conquer the New World as Spain. Rule the seas as Britain. Join the struggle for continental supremacy as either Habsburg Austria or Bourbon France. Try your hand at playing Poland through her golden age and preventing its decline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Over 180 playable countries.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Pausable realtime gameplay from 1419-1819&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Tremendous mod-ability with an unlimited timeframe and 1000 different nations&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Updated graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included mods:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Age of Timur &amp;ndash; campaign in the 13th century&lt;br/&gt;&amp;middot; Alternative Grand Campaign / Event Exchange Project (AGCEEP) &amp;ndash; 10,000 historical events and a vast number of historical leaders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
