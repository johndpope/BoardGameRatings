			<description>Cassette Inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Story&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After weeks of waiting the Space Freighter has nearly reached your settlement on Planet C5, light-years from your home planet. But, disaster...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sudden meteor storm has devastated the ship, and its cargo of Resource Blocks has been scattered over the Planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people have elected you to journey outside the settlement and round up the Resource Blocks; unfortunately, this is unexplored terrain and there are many dangers...so you will have to collect the Blocks on the Matter Transporter Pads at the bottom of each level. Erupting volcanoes throw you up to the first bridge or level you reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can drop bombs to kill aliens, but there is a delay before they explode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
