							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse Game</name>
									
			<description>Lacrosse Blast is an &amp;quot;old-school&amp;quot; card-chart-and-dice simulation of pro lacrosse. Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've taken our original lacrosse game, Crash and Scramble, and made it even better by adapting it to the same game engine that powers our popular hockey game, Hockey Blast. The result is a fast-playing, fun board game simulation of this cutting-edge pro sport that captures everything fans love about it: bone-jarring hits, acrobatic passes, rocket-fast shots, and amazing saves. YOU can re-create all the thrilling action of this &amp;quot;ahead-of the curve&amp;quot; sport, right in your own home, with Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse Game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lacrosse Blast uses a possession-by-possession system of play that keeps things moving fast. The game uses the same easily-memorized chart structure and no-nonsense method of rating players as our hockey game. Players perform based on the presence--or absence--of various qualities like speed, power and skill. Each player is also rated for his ability in creating and/or taking away scoring opportunities, as well as for shots and assists, penalties, face-offs and injury. That means you'll get table-top performances which echo each player's real-life abilities without a bunch of calculations or math gymnastics. You'll see the great assist guys dishing it off for goals and the powerhouse shooters firing the ball into the net, while the less-talented players defer to someone else. You'll be caught up in the action as you &amp;quot;watch&amp;quot; players use their power, skill and savvy to make plays. Goalies have their own special ratings, designed to make the real-life star net-minders shine on your table top the just way they do on the pro league floor! Easy-to-play, but amazingly detailed--THAT'S Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse simulation board game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
