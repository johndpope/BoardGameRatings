			<description>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;AbraKIDdabra is a card game of crazy spells and rules that you play on each other.  If you make three mistakes and get caught you are out of the game.  Last person left is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic Play:&lt;br/&gt;Each player has two parts to their turn:&lt;br/&gt;Part 1:  Draw a &amp;quot;Simon Says&amp;quot; card and answer the question or follow the directions.&lt;br/&gt;Part 2:  Draw a &amp;quot;AbraKIDdabra&amp;quot; card and give it to another player.  That player must follow the directions on that card for the duration of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players caught not following the rules or &amp;quot;AbraKIDdabra&amp;quot; cards in front of them are marked for the mistake and must turn the appropriate card face-down.  When a player gets 3 marks or face-down cards, he or she is out of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published by Play All Day Games (makers of Curses!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(information from the rules card inside the game.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
