			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOOT! PILLAGE! BURN!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;From the fury of the Norsemen, oh Lord, deliver us!&amp;quot; So prayed the Irish monks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the victims of a Viking raid, the Norsemen were bearded giants with bloody axes.  But the Viking was much more.  He was a skilled navigator and a brave explorer and trader.  He was a fighter to whom honor and reputation were far more important than life.  He was a free man in an age of petty tyranny.  He was a dreamer whose songs and stories live even today.  And yes, he was a bloody-handed sea rover who took what he wanted!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book is a complete guide to the Norse world.  It includes maps, historical background, and details on society and religion.  A separate chapter discusses Norse magic and runes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can game any sort of Viking campaign, from fully realistic to magical and cinematic.  Create a historical campaign, with sea battles, duels and bloody raids &amp;ndash; or become a legendary berserker for mythic adventures with Thor and Odin!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may live, you may die.  No man knows his fate.  But act bravely and the skalds will sing of your deeds forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
