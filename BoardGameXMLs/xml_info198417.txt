			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a shared setting that is created collaboratively.  The setting is assumed to be a huge space ship that is suffering frequent mechanical failures due to lack of maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The society aboard the space ship is fractured in a complex series of factions, each with different - possibly competing - goals.  Characters belong to a faction depending upon which types of biotechnology they have been infected with.  This biotechnology also determines many of a character's abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opposed actions are resolved with a dice roll mechanism.  Difficult actions use a similar mechanism, though it will result in failure at least half of the time.  The game suffers from poor organizational structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
