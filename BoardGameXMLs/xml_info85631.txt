			<description>The game compares the everyday life and environment of children from the Arctic, Africa, Europe, South America, and Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of five boards depict and number twelve environmental aspects of one of the five continents.  Each player receives a board &amp;amp; eight tiles.  A player asks a specific person for a tile that corresponds to a location on his board.  If the answer is yes, the player takes the tile and places it on his board.  He continues to ask as long as his requests are successful.  The game is over when all the boards are filled, and the winner is the one who first completed their board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules are provided for an easier and a harder game variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the sides of the board, the numbered locations are named in thirteen languages.  The rule book also comes in thirteen languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
