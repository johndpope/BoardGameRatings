			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conflict PvP: Tactics and Teams rulebook adds advanced player vs. player mechanics to Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&amp;copy; and d20 fantasy games. Offering gamers a slew of dynamic new Match types, traps, boons, build kits, and over 30 pre-made combat optimized characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whether you're looking to step up your combat, test your insane character build, or simply grind your table-mates into the dirt, Conflict PvP: Tactics and Teams has the tools you need to show your friends a bloody good time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like conventional Pathfinder or D20 campaigns, Conflict PvP uses a game master to run the matches smoothly, handle meta-gaming, hidden movement and ensure everyone is having a good time. Conflict PvP has dedicated chapters to the art of GMing, where any  Gamemaster can find great nuggets on improving their craft. Moreover, the Conflict PvP: Tactics and Teams rulebook offers up many ways to sprinkle player vs. player competitions into existing campaigns. Several well-organized lists of plot hooks, magic items, artifacts, rule adjustments and dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts are added in, which means not only can GMs shake their campaigns up with PvP, but they also have another great resource for their traditional campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict PvP is chock full of light-weight rules like the Battlepoint system, which allows players to measure their crazy character builds. Each match is assigned a maximum number of points. Participating characters' total values must be under the match maximum in order to be part of the match. This simple structure keeps combat fair and consistent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By adding easy-to-use coordinates to official battlemaps, and providing double-sided passcards, the game designers of Conflict PvP have finally cracked the age-old problem of hidden movement in tabletop RPG games. This means opposing players will be unaware of each other&amp;rsquo;s movements when using stealth or magical effects like invisibility. In these cases, the players' miniatures are actually removed from the battlemap. Their characters' map&amp;rsquo;s coordinates are shared through a passcard until a revealing attack is made; making surprise sneak attacks truly a surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;included are&lt;br/&gt;two full-color 24&amp;rdquo; by 36&amp;rdquo; Battlemaps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
