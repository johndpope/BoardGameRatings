			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Konosuke, once the most powerful ninja of the Asakura clan, now resides as a soul outside of time in ancient demon armor animated by the energy of evil spirits.

Add +2 to Attack for each Power Counter left on him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ikusaguruma (Ki, Attack) - Konosuke attacks all enemy units within 2 Inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rasetsu (Ki, Ranged Attack) - Distance (12 Inches).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousand Broken Bones (Ki, Attack) - Can only be used immediately after making a Charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pewter figure is unpainted and unassembled.
