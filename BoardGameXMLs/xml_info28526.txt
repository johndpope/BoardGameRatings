			<description>One of Australia's many contributions to the world of gambling. The game is conducted in a flat circle of approximately 20 feet (6 metres) or larger. The only equipment required (aside from materials for tracking bets) is two coins (by tradition pre-decimal pennies), and a flat piece of wood called the &amp;quot;kip&amp;quot; approximately 8 inches in length which has holes carved in it to fit the coins neatly but loosely enough for the coins to come out when tossed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is run by a &amp;quot;boxer&amp;quot;, who calls the first &amp;quot;potato&amp;quot; (one of the players around the circle) in to toss the coins. The spinner wagers an amount of their choice on either &amp;quot;heads&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tails&amp;quot;. Other players around the ring can then also bet on either &amp;quot;heads&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tails&amp;quot;. .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all bets are taken, the boxer calls &amp;quot;no more bets&amp;quot;, and the player tosses the coins in the air using the kip. To be a valid throw, they must go above the head height of the spinner, be rotating sufficiently and land entirely in the ring - if they do not the boxer calls &amp;quot;barred&amp;quot; and the throw is retaken. Ideally the call must occur before the coins settle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coins land both on the same face, the round ends and non-spinning player's bets are paid off, with people who bet on the same face as that landed winning. A new round of non-spinner bets is then taken before the spinner throws again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the coins come up with one tail and one head, the spinner spins again. If 5 &amp;quot;odds&amp;quot; come up, all players lose and a new spinner is selected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the spinner throws his nominated face three times before either 5 &amp;quot;odds&amp;quot; being thrown in a row, or a spin with both coins being the opposite face, the spinner wins and is paid at 7.5 to 1 (in most modern games).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
