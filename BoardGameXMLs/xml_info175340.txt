							<name primary="true" sortindex="4">An Average Modern Ranger Station</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob hated summer camp when he was a kid. This trip did nothing to change his opinon. This was supposed to be a weekend alone at a great camping spot near an old summer camp. However, he now found himself in a game a tag with a pack of werewolves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jacob ran with only the light of the full moon to help him navigate through the dense forest. He could hear them loping behind just toying with him and waiting for the moment that he could no longer run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the distance, he spotted the old ranger station and it gave him hope. He ran for the old structure with a renewed vigor. His heart sank as he saw the mangled corpse of the ranger on the porch. The glowing eyes in the treeline told him that he had no where else to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where do you go when the action starts? To the battle map, of course! If you need a map of a modern structure, you need Modern Floorplans. The Modern Floorplans series from Fabled Environments offers gamers high quality maps in a variety of configurations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5x11 map as a guide.&lt;br/&gt;     Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use either the full-scale map (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper and assemble a full-size version yourself in a matter of minutes. Both versions are scaled at 1 inch equals 5 feet.&lt;br/&gt;     In addition, each floorplan also comes in versions without room labels and without furniture.&lt;br/&gt;     This flooplan take advantage of both the Layers feature and the Tile Large Page function of Adobe Acrobat X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: All floorplans are rendered in black and white.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All maps are created by an architectural drafter using AutoCAD. This gives all of the maps the realistic feel that your players crave. Grab a copy of Modern Floorplans: An Average Modern Pool Hall today, and keep an eye out for future releases!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This free download is of a two-story ranger station with a submerged garage area. It boasts only one bedroom, but plenty of room to relax and welcome visitors from the neighboring summer camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
