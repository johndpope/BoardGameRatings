			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battle had been short but intense, with a cloud of flying lead marking a no-man&amp;rsquo;s-land between us and the pirates we had tracked down. The girl the outlaws had kidnapped was nowhere to be seen, however.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;What now, boss?&amp;rdquo; Berlin asked, holstering his pistol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now,&amp;rdquo; The Colonel replied, &amp;ldquo;We see if any of these varuuds has a clue as to where they might&amp;rsquo;ve taken that girl. Everyone pick a body and check the pockets. Remember, we don&amp;rsquo;t find that kid, we don&amp;rsquo;t get paid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, I thought, making for the nearest foe, maybe they&amp;rsquo;ve got some cash on &amp;lsquo;em&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a trope as old as the Original Role-Playing Game published in the 1970s: kill an enemy, go through his pockets or his stash and see what he was carrying. It might be just junk&amp;hellip;or it might be something valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Referee, such behavior can represent a chance to improvise&amp;hellip;or it can be a big hassle. And parties aren&amp;rsquo;t going to continually accept the answer &amp;ldquo;Uh, well&amp;hellip;you don&amp;rsquo;t find anything.&amp;rdquo; For the Ref whose improvisational skills may not be quite up to the task of coming up with interesting pocket/pouch contents on the spur of the moment, Minor Loot (or, What's In This Guy's Pockets?) can help. Rather than a long list of possible items that other publications offer, we&amp;rsquo;ll mate the flexibility of 2D6 with the Referee&amp;rsquo;s imagination to create a few spurs that (s)he can use on the fly, or to help in prepping for a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avoid the major hassle of stuffing NPCs' pockets with Minor Loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
