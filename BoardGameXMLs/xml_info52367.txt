							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Test of the Demonweb</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delve into more Year of the Drow adventure! Designer Ramon Arjona spins a tangled web in this new minimodule. Two weeks ago, a group of four 4th-level NPC adventurers set out from the small town of Lerick and have not been heard from since. The missing adventures were the town's only protection, and their protracted absence is very unusual. None of the villagers can guess their fate, and all fear that horrible peril may now be visited upon Lerick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's up to the PCs to find out what happened to the group. But will they make it back alive from the Test of the Demonweb?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This terrific side trek adventure is easy to insert into an existing campaign any time the player characters are traveling through a small town or village. Alternately, the drow cleric/arachne Arda Pharn behind this scenario can become the central antagonist in a longer story that you devise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test of the Demonweb is suitable for four 6th-level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
