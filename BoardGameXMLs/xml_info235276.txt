							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Broken Temple Statuary</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evil sea goddess Umberlee had always hated the sight of Sune&amp;rsquo;s temple dedicated to beauty by the sea. Why should anyone waste their time with such frivolous baubles and simpering preening? So, one day, Umberlee reached out with a bolt of lightning and cursed one of the worshippers, transforming her into a medusa. Within minutes, everyone in the temple had been turned to stone, leaving the cursed woman to stew alone in her hatred and sorrow. With the worshippers gone, the temple was free for the taking. All Umberlee needed now was to trick someone into killing the medusa and sanctifying the temple in Umberlee&amp;rsquo;s name. Surely, Umberlee thought, no mortal would realize who the temple really belonged to and seek to restore it to its rightful owner...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 3rd - 6th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
