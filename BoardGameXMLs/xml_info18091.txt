			<description>Clever einkaufen(translates to &amp;quot;Shop cleverly&amp;quot;) is a promotional game for the German mail order company Neckermann, produced by Ravensburger and designed by Wolfgang Kramer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 5,000 DM and tries to buy as many products as possible with this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do this you move your pawn around the board which depicts the 20 products, of which only 5 are available at any time, connected by branching paths. If you reach one of the available products you may place one of your wooden markers, of which you have 4, on the product card. These cards show a price track for each player that allows them to reduce the price in five steps. At the end of your turn you may advance up to 2 of your markers one space on their price track. If you reach the end of the price track all players have to buy the product, even if they have no marker on that card. Each player pays the price that his marker indicates. The game ends as soon as one player is out of money. The player with the most money left wins. The game also includes random event cards and 'Stop' markers that may be used to block player movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
