			<description>S.A.B.O.T. stands for Simple Armored Battle in Oversized Terrain. It's a fast-moving futuristic land battle, meant to be played on a big game map. Each player spends his/her build points on various vehicles and soldiers, sets them up on map tiles from my M8 Map System, and fights until his/her foe has been wiped off the face of the earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game's movement and combat rules are set up for large-scale battlefields with dozens of vehicles and soldiers. Ever want to fill a ping-pong table with game maps? This is your game. Got a door-sized folding table for game day? Play with a wide front and a shallow battlefield. Better yet, make a big square table from two folding tables. You can play this game on a small map, but it won't be as much fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S.A.B.O.T. is a complete game, with counters, markers, and maps. All you supply is a couple of d10's&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
