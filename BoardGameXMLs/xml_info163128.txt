							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Missing Mythic Magic Volume VIII</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncover Forgotten Arcane Lore!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone knows that knowledge is power, and that having options is better than not having them. It should come as no surprise, then, that wizards, witches, and other powerful spellcasters are always on the lookout for new and exciting spells to add to their repertoires. While many spells from the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook received a facelift and an upgrade in Mythic Adventures, the sourcebook that introduced mythic power to the game of Pathfinder, dozens of spells were left behind. Missing Mythic Magic Volume VIII, and its predecessors, aim to give each and every spell from the core rules a full-fledged mythic upgrade, all the way from A to Z, with a special focus on making mythic spells that feel as over-the-top and larger-than-life as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This installment includes 18 mythic spells, from divination to false vision. A mythic divine power does more than just make you more formidable on the battlefield: it causes you to exude a holy (or unholy) aura of divine wrath that strikes fear into the hearts of your deity&amp;rsquo;s enemies. A mythic dominate monster can truly allow you to gain control of anything and anyone, with the ability to affect even creatures that are normally immune to compulsions and mind-affecting effects, although doing so is costly. Mythic elemental swarm summons continual reinforcements to replace elementals that have been slain, and expands the selection of elementals you can choose from. Even the lowly erase becomes potent with mythic power, allowing you to erase magical text, but also allowing you to reproduce any text you erase perfectly, and eventually even store magical writings in your mind. This tome contains all that, and much, much more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
