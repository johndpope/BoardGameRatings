			<description>In the Home Alone game for the PC, the player is given from 8:00 to 9:00 (approximately 5 minutes of real time) to set up traps in order to hurt the Wet Bandits once they arrive. No further setting of traps is possible after this period. Each trap can only be triggered once and they all inflict the same amount of damage.&lt;br/&gt;Marv and Harry arrive separately at the two entrances to the house. If the player touches either of Bandits, he is caught and the game immediately ends in defeat. Hurting a Bandit ten times will permanently incapacitate him. The ultimate objective is to incapacitate both burglars.&lt;br/&gt;The player can trigger his own traps, resulting in no harmful effects, but the trap will instantly disappear. If the player has too few remaining traps to sufficiently hurt each Bandit, the game will continue, but victory will be impossible. Following a game, the player may enter his name into a high score list. The player's position on the list is determined by whether the game was a win or a loss; by the time taken to defeat the Bandits; and by the total damage the player inflicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Home Alone (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
