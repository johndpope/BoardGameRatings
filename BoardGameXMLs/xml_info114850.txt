							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fuzion Jazz</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuzion Jazz is a variant of the Fuzion role-playing game system. Fuzion is the FUZION Labs Group trademark for its multigenre game system. Fuzion Jazz differs from its parent system in that the number of characteristics has been reduced, the manner in which damage is inflicted has been simplified, and the Powers section has been considerably expanded (largely adapted from Hero System, one of the parent systems of Fuzion and a wonderful game system in its own right).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
