			<description>Source: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.kemco.jp/sp/games/yodanji/en/index.htmlThe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.kemco.jp/sp/games/yodanji/en/index.htmlThe&lt;/a&gt; Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;Yōdanji is a coffee-break roguelike themed after Japanese folklore tales. Roguelike part is responsible for procedurally generated levels, permadeath and turn-based combat. Folklore tales are responsible for everything else, from the appearance of the dungeon and items that can be found in there to playable characters. Speaking of characters...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 20 characters to choose from, each with their unique abilities, strengths, weaknesses and a playstyle. At the beginning, you have access to only 3. Sneak, fight and dash through the dungeon to collect scrolls with each yōkai's lore and summon more! Find your favorite and delve into the Challenge Dungeon to see just how deep you can go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Description: &lt;br/&gt;Yodanji is an 8-bit style graphics turn-based Roguelike. It lacks the usual XP collection mechanism; level up is by finding specific items. Classes/races are replaced with a yokai type, and play goal is to find the right items to open up more available yokai to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
