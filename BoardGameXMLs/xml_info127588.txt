							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Benjamin Blümchen: Einkaufen macht Spaß</name>
									
			<description>Benjamin Bl&amp;uuml;mchen says &amp;quot;Shopping is fun&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets a board with 16 squares, all illustrated with things Benjamin needs at the supermarket. The item tiles are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. A turn starts when the player reveals the top tile. If he thinks he needs it, he pays to the bank the cost (in Deutschmarks). If he doesn't want to buy it, the next player can, and at a saving of 50 Pfennigs (half a Deutschmark). If not wanted it is offered to all the other players, knocking off 50 Pfennigs each time. If it gets down to zero, that player will get it for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to buy goods that will form four boxes in a row on your board, so four across, four down and four corner-to-corner are all acceptable choices. The first to do so, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few tiles are what you might call Event tiles. If one of these is drawn, it is read out and takes place if the drawer wants to make use of it. Example: You may take one item off the board of the player to your left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
