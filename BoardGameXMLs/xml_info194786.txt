			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After dinner at a local restaurant, you and your friends find that no one has their wallet. The manager is none too happy about it, and proposes a small competition. The first one to wash enough dishes gets to walk away, while everyone else will be turned over to the police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players must decide whether to 'carry' or 'wash' dishes. If 'carry' is chosen, up to two cards are played face down to the table. 'Wash' simply allow you to add cards to your hand at the end of a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have taken a turn, 'carry' cards that have been played are simultaneously revealed. These are then checked against the carry rules and resolved. Finally, player's who chose to 'wash' draw 2 cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This continues round after round until a player successfully washes 10 dishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
