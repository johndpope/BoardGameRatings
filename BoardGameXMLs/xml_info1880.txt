							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Armour Quest: Quæstro</name>
									
			<description>A &amp;quot;Talisman-like&amp;quot; game, which target is to get all the six artifacts which are spread out &amp;quot;outdoors&amp;quot; (in the middle of the game board). Meanwhile becomes the characters better on fighting and defending themselves against monsters, guardians and opponents.&lt;br/&gt;You play two different fractions and with more than two you play co-operative. According to the rules one player should be an &amp;quot;administrator&amp;quot; if you are 3 or 5 players! Probably it's best to play with 2 players.&lt;br/&gt;The combat system is pretty complicated, with a lot of dice rolls.&lt;br/&gt;There's an expansion (expert game) with some more monster quest cards, money tokens, but most important character dial-boards with all statistics about the characters, so you don't need to use paper and pen for this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
