			<description>Four fighters are gathering to contend for supremacy. Each of them has a unique supernatural power to utilize: Air, Fire, Earth or Water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Psychic Fighters is an ABSTRACT fighting game. In this game, players choose their fighters, take the Character boards and 36 Battle cards for the characters. To take an action with his cards, the player places a card on his board so that the icons showed on the cards in an action space are connected in a row.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game round consists of many offensive and defensive turns alternately. In an offensive turn, the player has 3 action points to spend for the Move, Attack and Power-up. During a defensive turn, he may only react to his opponent's Attack, with Dodge, Block and Counter-attack. They may also accumulate Qi, which is used to increase the strength for Attack or Block or to power up for activating their special abilities and actions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player make his opponent's life points 0, then he wins the round. The first to win two rounds will win the match!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also see the rules: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://mountedcloud.tistory.com/50&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://mountedcloud.tistory.com/50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
