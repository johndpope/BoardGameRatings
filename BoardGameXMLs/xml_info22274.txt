							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Mogul: Ruins of an Empire</name>
									
			<description>Star Mogul:Ruins of an Empire is a rule set for 28mm tabletop miniature wargaming sci-fi campaigns.  The publisher supports the game with a line of miniatures.  Accept the challenge of the distant stars and set up your own company on the frontiers of deep space...dare to become a Star Mogul!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's site: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.alphaforgegames.com/starmogul.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.alphaforgegames.com/starmogul.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game depicts the desperate struggle for survival following the discovery of a pan-galactic alien civilization, long since crumbled into ruins over 400,000 years ago...&lt;br/&gt; Large amounts of money were to be had by successful prospectors and salvage groups, if they could overcome the harsh and arduous environments, and return home with their alien trophies which might yield unexpected bounties to the human race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first wave of settlers and exploiters that mankind sent forth to the stars unwittingly unleashed an ancient pathogen that spread throughout the colonies before it fully revealed itself. Now the pathogen has played itself out, and it is time to rebuild what was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With enough money to buy a salvage starship, and employ a rough and ready crew, you can see the opportunities that await someone who can survive on the Outer Rim and gather the resources left behind from the ruins of two empires, one human, one alien.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-implemented as Salvage Crew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
