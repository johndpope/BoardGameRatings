			<description>Polar Base is a storytelling game in which the players must find a way to explain how all the members of a polar base met their grisly death, based on the cards they are dealt. Each player is a screenwriter in charge of a different character. Together they narrate the screenplay for a film which unfurls the story in reverse chronological order (&amp;agrave; la Memento), scene by scene. After all the players have told a scene each, voting occurs. Then a new round starts. The game ends with each player providing his own version for the final scene. The last round of voting will provide extra points for the best ending.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced variant, players can interfere with the narrating player by imposing some elements to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
