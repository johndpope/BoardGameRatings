			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;No introductions are necessary for I know well who you are my intrepid adventurer. Have a seat my friend before you enter the Graffenvold and traverse its byways. Have you come here to rest, to leave the muddy tracks and sharp edges of the world behind? Is that it my fine fellow? Or have you come to beat down the lords of this Land and submit them to your will? Which is it fellow, the easy or the hard road you are after?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;I fear you have gone beyond yourself, and here in Inzae your mistake may be your doom. For beyond yonder door is a fearful world clinging desperately to life. Its denizens struggle against a vast array of malignant forces that seek to drag them deeper into the pits of the Maelstrom. And even here, in this backwater called the Rentier, you will find no respite from the struggle. So take heed traveler, take heed as you enter the Graffenvold. It will do you well to remember that this is a deadly world and lest you take care, you will be engulfed in its dying spasms.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel south into the goblin kingdoms is always frought with danger. Many go only as far as the Baron's outpost, Vakhund, the Watchdog Tower, and reside there in safety while merchants and others fare their way further down the road. But what happens when Vakhund Tower is attacked by goblins, ores, and bandits? A noble is kidnaped, and only a dangerous trip into the dark, infested goblin kingdoms will reveal the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A d20 System adventure intended for 4-8 characters of levels 1-2, Vakhund: Into the Unknown marks Part I in the thrilling Death on the Treklant Trilogy and introduces the grimly realistic World of Inzae. Those brave enough to enter her Maelstrom and become heroes shall linger long in the halls of valor and memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
