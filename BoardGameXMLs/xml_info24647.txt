			<description>The game represents whale hunting in the village of Ozette (a prehistoric settlement on the American West Coast which was buried in a mudslide around 1500 A.D. and excavated in the 20th century).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game mat depicts a whale. Prey stones are placed on the ribs. Players spin an unusual spintop, resulting in 1-3 red and 1-3 blue arrows pointing up. Depending on the number of red arrows, players move their playing pieces from rib to rib and collect prey stones, but only if the hunting stone is showing the whale. The hunting stone can be flipped instead of moving. When all prey has been collected, the player with most prey wins. However, if three blue arrows show six times during the game, the whale wins and the player loses. Depending on which arrow they spin the spintop with, players can influence the outcome of their spin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
