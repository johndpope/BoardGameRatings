It is played on a chessboard, which is a square-checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in &amp;quot;check&amp;quot;) and there is no way to remove or defend it from attack on the next move. (wikipedia.org)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TIP: To castle, select king and move 2 cells left or right. If castle move is legal, you will see possible moves to cells next to ajacent one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
