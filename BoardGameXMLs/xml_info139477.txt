			<description>A fast strategy and tactics dice game for 2&amp;ndash;4 players. The game comprises 36 dice than can be placed in a 6&amp;times;6 grid on a playing board. Each player considers the outer row of six dice which he is facing (his 'home row') and will try that either a) all six dice show the same number, or b) the dice be placed in ascending (1-2-&amp;hellip;-6) or descending (6-5-&amp;hellip;-1) order. For this, 35 dice are placed in the playing area leaving an empty space, and the 36th die is used as action die: the active player rolls it, and the rolled value can be split into several sub-values (for example: 6 = 3+1+1+1) to perform one or more of several possible actions, such as turning a die, swap files, etc.&lt;br/&gt;DICE provides several options to build the starting dice grid, as well as advanced rules for a longer and more challenging game experience (additional dice moves and a more challenging winning condition). &lt;br/&gt;DICE is available in several colored sets: Natur (36 white dice); Regenbogen (6&amp;times; 6 dice in each of the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet); Devil Dice (black dice with red pips, and the pips are randomly placed on the die faces, making it impossible to predict which value will show after turning a die); and also two- or three-color dice sets.&lt;br/&gt;More colors means a more complicated game and more possible tactical variations, as additional winning conditions can be established (for example, a home row with alternating black and white dice, if a two color DICE set is used).&lt;br/&gt;According to the rules leaflet included with the game, there also exists a set of 121 dice called MARATHON DICE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
