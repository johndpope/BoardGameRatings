			<description>From the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;Crime Fighting Was Never Such A Blast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Save the neighborhood from Harry and Marv!  Kevin's been left home alone, and the two sneaky crooks are prowling his street.  Who's in danger now?  Kevin- or the bullying housebreakers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Race from house to house on Kevin's sled, keeping your eyes peeled for the villians (sic).  Dodge stumps and slick ice 'cuz time's running out.  Arm yourself with a BB gun and all the home-made weapons you can find and assemble.  Keep the robbers running before they can loot the goods!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-5 different houses to save!  Set and launch a variety of attacks and ambushes to snare the thieves.&lt;br/&gt;-Assemble household items to make and use hilarious weapons like a flashbulb shotgun, a snowball bazooka and a glue-bomb launcher.&lt;br/&gt;-Comic animation and slap-stick action relive all the fast, zany humor of the hit movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the other games titled Home Alone on other systems which were developed by Bethesda Softworks, Home Alone on the Genesis was designed exclusively for the Genesis by Brian A. Rice incorporated.  The other games with the same name are side-scrollers where Kevin is limited to defending his own home like in the movie.  In the Genesis Home Alone, however, Kevin must defend all of the houses on the block.  He moves from house to house on his sled and installs a preset number of booby traps upon his initial entry into that house.  When in the houses, the game plays like a side-scroller and it is Kevin's duty to inflict enough pain on Marv and Harry that they decide to leave each house before they are done robbing and flooding it.  Kevin also collects common household items to form zany weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
