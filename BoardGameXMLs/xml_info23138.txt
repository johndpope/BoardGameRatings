			<description>From the Publisher's web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dead Man's Chest is a dinner party murder mystery game for 12 to 16 guests and a host.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us in a thrilling evening of piracy, intrigue, heroism and skull-duggery. You will be in the middle of the action and it will be up to you to wheel and deal with the other guests. Can you achieve your goals, keep your secrets hidden and survive A Dead Man's Chest? It's up to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two pirate crews descend upon the sleepy Caribbean island of Santo Oloroso - to avenge the death of their former master Captain Flint, or to find and grab his treasure?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;A Dead Man's Chest was a great success. It's well thought out and so kept us all active the whole time. It's very good for getting everyone talking and having fun. None of us had played a mystery before, so we took some time to get started, but once we got going it went well.&amp;quot; Keith, Whitby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old enmities will surface, deals will be made and broken, and some folk will swing from the yard-arm while others receive the dreaded Black Spot, before these affairs are settled, for good or ill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will fortune favor the brave? Will faint heart ever win fair lady? How many Pieces of Eight make a Doubloon? Find out all this and more at A Dead Man's Chest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Dead Man's Chest lasts for about four hours and is suited to an evening. It is often played over a meal - a finger buffet if possible to allow guests to circulate and talk in private.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The free introductory PDF file (127 KB) contains an introduction to the game, a cast list of all the characters, an invitation to send to your guests - plus details of how to buy the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home Page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?19&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
