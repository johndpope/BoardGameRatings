			<description>This is one of a series of educational games published early in the 20th Century by Cincinnati Game Co. The 52-card deck is made up of two each of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; three each 6 and 7; four each 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; and two each 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules booklet describes two group games and a class exercise for Addition; three group games for Subtraction; and a game and additional exercise for Addition and Subtraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first game, two cards each of 1-9 form a table deck, with three cards laid out and a fourth face up on top of the deck. The rest of the cards are dealt to the players. Each player in turn must try to use two or more of the table cards to equal a card held in hand. The player takes all of the cards in the set, new cards from the deck are turned over to fill any gaps, and play continues until the deck is exhausted. The player collecting the most cards through sets wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
