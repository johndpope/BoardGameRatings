			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monster of the Week product line takes its inspiration from the television trope of the same name: a convention by which a weekly television production might introduce a new freak, villain, or beastie in every episode, allowing the episode&amp;rsquo;s themes and topics to revolve around the latest &amp;ldquo;big bad.&amp;rdquo; Monster of the Week aims to arm GMs with creatures and villains perfect for such a role. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to populate a memorable encounter or a villainous story arc, our Monster of the Week is made for maximum creepfactor and memorable &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo; power!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this installment&amp;rsquo;s pages you will find the true and terrible description of the mucoroth &amp;ndash; an alien visitor possessing a novel (and nauseating!) flavor of immortality. Perfect for horror-themed adventures or encounters, the mucoroth is an alien terror that caaame&amp;hellip; from outer spaaace! Bizarre by its behavior and vile by its description, the mucoroth are sure to unsettle your players, who will not soon forget their first foray into a mucoroth colony, only to find themselves... utterly ignored by the indifferent natives? Take a seat by the fire and read on, my friends, and learn why the mysterious, murderous mucoroth have more important things to do than engage your intruding, intrepid band of bumblers&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
