			<description>Prepare your stool, draw your cards, and get ready for Tavern Trouble &amp;ndash; the fast paced card game that&amp;rsquo;s easy to learn and highly fun. You&amp;rsquo;ll play your cards to control the many travelers of the well-known establishment the Crowned Frog and use their special powers in great brawls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elements of the game&lt;br/&gt;A deck includes 27 characters cards with power from 1 to 9. To keep the scores, each player has a card squared from 0 to 25 (these go by the original name of &amp;ldquo;life points&amp;rdquo;). At the beginning of the game, each player put his life token on the 20 square(during the game it is not possible to go with a score higher than 25 life points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Win the game&lt;br/&gt;There is only one way to win the game.

The game ends when there is only one player with life points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walkthrough&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a succession of turns, where the players will try to reduce the life points of their opponents.
