			<description>Introducing Battleheart - a real-time tactical RPG coming to iOS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battleheart incorporates elements from RTS, tactical RPGs, and the simple &amp;quot;line drawing&amp;quot; games that the App Store has popularized. You take control of a party of heroes of various classes and engage in hectic real-time battles with evil creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You give your party commands by tapping and dragging them. Draw a line to tell your heroes to move somewhere, or attack or heal someone. It's all very quick and simple, and with a bit of practice you'll be directing your little army like a pro!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to basic movement and attack commands, you can also tell your heroes to use certain special moves unique to their class. Select a party member by tapping them and their special moves are displayed in the top left corner. These include summoning meteors from the sky, powerful healing magic, turning your enemies into frogs, and other fun unique powers to help you fight against unrelenting waves of attackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can customize your party of 4 heroes from a selection of 8 classes. Your allies grow in level and accumulate funds after each battle which can be used to upgrade their equipment. There is a skill system for customizing each class as well, where you choose between various powers (both active and passive) to suit your playstyle. There's a truly insane amount of possible party and power combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Adapted from The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
