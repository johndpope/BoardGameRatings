							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Itsy The Spider goes to China</name>
									
			<description>Itsy The Spider goes to China is a highly addicting game. We cannot be held responsible for the fights that may occur between boyfriends and girlfriends and/or husbands and wives. Don't be fooled by its appearance as a children's game, although they are going to want to sneak off with it too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Itsy The Spider is the best way to ruin a get-together with friends. You'll see how everyone will get hooked on trying to beat the top score (we've proven it). It won't even occur to you to take away the iPhone during these attempts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
