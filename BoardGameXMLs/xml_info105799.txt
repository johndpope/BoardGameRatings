			<description>Reds is a trick-taking game for 2-6 players played with a standard deck which has the suit of hearts removed. Reds uses some interesting mechanics, including an anti-trump suit which will almost always lose a trick, bidding which encourages risk-taking and rewards skill, and variable exchange of cards which leads the game through several different stages of luck and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Called &amp;quot;Reds&amp;quot; due to diamonds being trump, this is an interesting use of a three-suited deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round is 5 tricks, and each game is 9 rounds.  The deal is a straight rotation, moving clockwise every round.  Each round, players bid before a pre-determined amount of cards in their hand are passed to another player.  This allows for interesting strategy and even an element of bluffing.  As the game wraps up, fewer and fewer cards are passed, lending the game a transition from heavily luck-based to heavily skill-based.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playable with a standard deck (hearts removed), a pad, and a pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
