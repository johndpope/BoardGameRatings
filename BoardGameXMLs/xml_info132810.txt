			<description>Author's description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Serpent&amp;rsquo;s Tooth is a story game about an old King in the twilight of his life, watching his power give way to the ambitions of youth. We will create principal characters to portray in our story. You will take on the role of King, who begins the game with vast powers of creative authority, the other players take on members of the King&amp;rsquo;s family and court, each with their own agenda&amp;rsquo;s and ambitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play you will need 3-5 players, and about 2.5 hours of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will act out a cycle of scenes around the table, each of us taking up these roles, and creating other supporting characters when needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of the game the King loses his power to the younger generation, until, Kingdom divided, he fades into history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
