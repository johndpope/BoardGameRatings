			<description>This is a standard memory game with the added twist of having to make matches in a certain sequence. Each player takes a board that depicts two picture sequences, each telling a story. On your turn, you flip over a card so that all players may see it. If it matches the first picture for either story on your board, place it over the picture and then try to match the second etc. The first player to complete both story sequences on his or her board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
