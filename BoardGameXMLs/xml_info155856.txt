			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind Every Villain is a Horde of Minions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somebody has to clean up the dungeon while the master plots his next evil scheme. Fortunately, that is where the underlings come in. These groveling bootlicks live to serve their evil lord, hoping only to curry favor and avoid his wrath. Unfortunately, representing these lesser foes in combat can be a chore, especially if there are a lot of them. Tracking their hit points, conditions, and abilities can turn an exciting combat into a real grind. Rule Zero: Underlings gives busy GMs a way to incorporate a horde of these lesser monsters into any combat without slowing the game down to a crawl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside this PDF, you'll find a new system for including a new type of monster, the underling, into your game. Underlings are made using simple statistics that don&amp;rsquo;t bog down the GM with unnecessary statistics and details, while still providing a threat to the players. The system includes complete rules for creating thousands of different underlings, suitable for any adventure. In total, this PDF contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     21 Underling Statistics, ranging from CR 1/2 to CR 20&lt;br/&gt;     47 Unique Underling Types, from goblins and kobolds to demons and devils&lt;br/&gt;     4 New Universal Monster Rules, unique to underlings&lt;br/&gt;     6 Simple Templates to customize your underlings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
