			<description>Each player has four small pawns and a larger pawn called Ciblux.&lt;br/&gt;In his turn player roll dice and move one of his smaller pawn accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 areas in the game board to move.:&lt;br/&gt;- A white area where small pieces can move &amp;quot;with impunity&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;- A yellow box called 'danger zone' where small pieces can be ejected by the Ciblux of the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;- A central area which is the goal for small pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to bring all his small pawns to the central area first. Alternative end is if player catches with Ciblux opponent's smaller pawn and wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
