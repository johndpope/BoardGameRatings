							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cities XL 2012</name>
									
			<description>Imagine and conceive cities of all types and sizes. From a several million citizens megalopolis to a hyped seaside resort, to an industrial city, everything is allowed in Cities XL 2012! Take advantage of an incredible collection of more than 1000 buildings and structures (over 300 new buildings), and 62 different types of maps (15 new maps) featuring realistic environments. Enjoy never seen before freedom in a city-builder, allowing you to create your cities in every detail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a virtual mayor, find the right balance between economic development of your cities, attractiveness, transportation (road traffic, bus, metro...), pollution, social services, taxes and even leisure activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Create a proper economic development by setting up trade between cities; you can specialize certain cities in specific areas to fill in the needs of the others. This will ensure large-scale financial success and allow you to develop an increasingly complex network of cities!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
