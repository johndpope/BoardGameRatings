			<description>From the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You and up to two other team members will take command of one of the three theaters of operation for the Union or for the Confederacy. Although you have your own armies to command, and generals to oversee, you will need to work closely with your other theater commanders. Together you must decide which generals should command which armies to best take advantage of their unique talents. You must also decide who will control armies as they travel from one theater to another. Will you retain control of an army outside of your theater or relinquish control to your teammate? Each side has it's advantages and disadvantages, so carefully consider your decisions.  The fate of the Union and Confederacy hang in the balance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic mechanism for resolving combat is similar to the one found in Axis &amp;amp; Allies.  However, the overall rules are designed to represent the American Civil War, and have quite a few differences from both A&amp;amp;A and Risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following is provided in the game box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 panel map/board of the USA &amp;amp; CSA during the ACW&lt;br/&gt;45 general cards&lt;br/&gt;52 event cards&lt;br/&gt;general and territory control markers&lt;br/&gt;rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dice and game pieces are not provided.  One must provide their own game pieces similar to those found in Risk (infantry, cavalry and artillery), for up to six players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
