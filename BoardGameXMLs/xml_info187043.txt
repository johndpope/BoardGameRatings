			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pollies is based around a simple &amp;quot;Level&amp;quot; chart of six stages ranging from simple to difficult.  Pollies uses a single task resolution mechanism of rolling two dice.  The dice selected will be d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20, depending upon a) the character's Trait Rating and b) the Difficulty Rating, correlated on the &amp;quot;Level&amp;quot; chart.  If the Trait roll equals or beats the Difficulty roll then task is successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that combat in the game is not resolved with dice but instead the players and Game Master &amp;quot;are expected to resolve combat through narrative and description&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters have Descriptions (demographic data) and Methods (roughly analogous to Skills).  These are narrative elements.  Characters also have four Attributes:  Perception, Health, Athletics, and Cool.  Each Attribute has a Rating of 1 to 6 represented with a narrative tag which, ultimately, resolves to a polyhedral die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) that will be used to resolve tasks based on that Attribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
