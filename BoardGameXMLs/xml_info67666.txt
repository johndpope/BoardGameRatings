			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The door opens easily to the sound of a music box and the humming of a lullaby. The room appears to be a nursery, there is an elderly elf woman seated in a rocking chair in the north east corner. Two wooden dolls cavort about the room with toys in their hands. Another wooden doll tugs at the old woman&amp;rsquo;s skirt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She stops her humming, &amp;ldquo;what is it Leigh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Momma Idril, there are strangers here,&amp;rdquo; the doll explains.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s okay Leigh. I won&amp;rsquo;t let anyone take you away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover The Corrupted Nursery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 33, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
