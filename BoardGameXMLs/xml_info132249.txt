			<description>Each player has a wooden sheep that must jump four hurdles first to win the game.&lt;br/&gt;The hurdles are dice-sticks. The first player rolls the first stick. Whichever result is on top is the result the player has to fulfill by rolling five dice, setting aside dice and re-rolling up to two times. If successful, the player places his/her sheep in front of the next hurdle and the second player rolls the first hurdle, etc. The first player to jump the fourth hurdle is the winner (the hurdles have more difficult tasks the further one gets).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
