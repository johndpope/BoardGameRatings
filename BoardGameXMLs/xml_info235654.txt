			<description>NeoParadise: Rampage is a card game set in a science fiction, dark fantasy, post-apocalyptic world where 4 factions slaughter each other for &amp;quot;survival&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The 4 groups have different play styles but that's not all. Each faction either adds or changes a rule of the game to their advantage, but that's not all! Each faction also possess a different resource system!&lt;br/&gt;     How to win, during the match players will play buildings (one of the 3 card types) to form their &amp;quot;base&amp;quot;. This constructions can be damaged and the moment your enemy has no more of them in the field, you win.&lt;br/&gt;     We have 2 ways of playing, one in which you play with your deck in 1 pile, and another in which you separate your deck in 2 piles. You can choose from which pile you draw your card each turn. This decreases luck and increases strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comments from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big part of the game is that all factions are broken and fragile at the same time. All of them can win or lose against all of the others in a ridiculous way, specially when you get the hang of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game we have 3 card types, Units, Buildings and Interventions. Units represent your &amp;quot;troops&amp;quot;, Buildings make your base and Interventions are standalone effects. You can't cancel enemy effects in this game, only normal attacks from &lt;br/&gt;Units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it's not difficult to learn, specially if you have played other card games, the fact that every faction is so different might make you feel you are learning 4 games at the same time...Might.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, when it comes to playing times, the one registered is the standard. But sometimes, specially when you really grasp the game and you get top level luck: you can get a 3 minute match... This happened only once during testing, quite a funny thing it was. And also, if you have no idea whatsoever and get terrible luck it can stretch up to an hour and a half. Only in those circunstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
