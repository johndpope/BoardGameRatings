			<description>Cheeky rabbits race around the field, hiding behind bushes to outwit the sharp-eyed fox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roll and move, players choose three rabbits of the same colour and place them on one corner of the field on the START hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The starting player throws the dice and does two things in the following order: &lt;br/&gt;a)Moves the fox to the sector of the centre circle corresponding to the number,&lt;br/&gt;b)Moves one of his Rabbits in a clockwise direction on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E.G. If a 2 were thrown, the player first moves the Fox onto sector 2; secondly, he moves one of his rabbits two places in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. If the fox can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; any rabbits in that sector of the board, they must go back to their START hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. If a rabbit is in the same sector as the fox BUT is behind a bush, then it is hidden from view and does not go back to START.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Play moves in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. On their first three turns, each player must bring out all three of their rabbits. If a rabbit is sent back to his START hole, it must be brought out onto the track on the player's next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Any number of Rabbits may occupy the same space on the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. If a six is thrown the player may have an extra turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. A player does not have to throw the exact number to get a rabbit HOME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same rules apply for a two or three player game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
