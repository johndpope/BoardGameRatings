			<description>F-22 Total Air War, also known as Total Air War or by its acronym TAW, is a fighter jet flight simulator game released in 1998 centering around the F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft. The game was published by Infogrames Entertainment and then later by Atari and was developed by Digital Image Design. The notable features in the game include the ability for the player to dynamically alter their flight campaigns and the realistic physics engine. The storyline in the game revolves around a war campaign over the Red Sea between two ambiguous fighting forces which both feature modern air-combat sorties that are launched against each other in an all out total aerial war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F-22 Total Air War,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
