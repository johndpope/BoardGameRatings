			<description>One of the lesser known board-/card games from the Dujardin publisher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name heirs from the shortcuts depicted on the cards showing the plate numbers from the French districts of the time edited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game consists of 96 cards, 90 of them showing the shortcuts and are numbered from 1 - 90 also. 6 cards show a &amp;quot;Fakir&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules for three different games to play are submitted with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main game is &amp;quot;Crypto-90&amp;quot;, where you have to lay out your 9 pre-dealt cards in ascending order from left to right.&lt;br/&gt;They are laid out per 8 one at a time, from left to right, and the 9th card is kept secret in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;Then you try to be the first to achieve your above mentioned goal.&lt;br/&gt;This, in fact, is a RACKO-clone, but it differs by the fact that all but one of the cards are open to view, and the clever use of the &amp;quot;FAKIR&amp;quot;, with whom you can hinder heavily the opponents gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;Game ends after the pack is used up or if anybody gets his street of cards.&lt;br/&gt;Calculating winning points is clever, you can get bonuses among others by laying out only odd or even numbers and for unused FAKIRS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the second game, a map of France is provided with the countries' districts. Aim of the game is to lay out your cards according to districts clinging together.&lt;br/&gt;This way you have an educational effect in order to learn the French districts and where they are situated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third game is a variant to get rid of your cards as fast as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very stylish game components: Top quality cardboard box insert for all the gaming stuff, and every player gets a coloured felt mat to lay out his thick, linen finish cards, and even the two card stacks get their own felt mat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fun game for the whole family, even by modern standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
