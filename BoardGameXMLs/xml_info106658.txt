			<description>Knuckle Heads (ナックルヘッズ) is a 1993 weapon-based fighting arcade game developed and published by Namco. It was created during the fighting game trend of the 1990s that began with Capcom's 1991 hit, Street Fighter II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player; however, when both are knocked out simultaneously in the first round, one of them will win the second round. The player has a character roster of six fighters to choose from, each with their own weapons and special techniques. After the player knocks out five different characters, the player will fight against two characters at once instead of one. The most notable features are the jump button and multi-player that allows up to four players to play simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Knuckle Heads&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
