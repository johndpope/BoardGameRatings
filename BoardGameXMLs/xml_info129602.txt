							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shout For PIATS: The Battle Of Normandy 1944</name>
									
			<description>A game in the ASLComp series by Critical Hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subject: the Allied Operation Epsom (aka First Battle of the Odon), Normandy, France 1944. Centered around battles near the town of Grainville-sur-Odon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a remake of Scotland the Brave II. It contains 12 scenarios, and 2 campaign games, mostly the same as in the original, but with additions (most notably scenarios #21 and #22) and some minor alterations. The game features new map and counter art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game allows you to recreate firefights between British and German troops in Normandy 1944, on a tactical scale: individual vehicles, artillery pieces, support weapons, squads and leaders. Combining this game with Orders For The Major, you can play on a large area (campaign games), like in the original combination of Scotland the Brave I + II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terrain lends itself for a mixture of close quarter battles around villages and bridges, coupled with long range tank duels, due to the relatively flat, open area with little or no hedges (bocage).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the designer's research and availability of detailed sources on the depicted actions, the scenarios have a highly historically informative value, backed by information and pictures of some of the landmarks in the designer's notes booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
