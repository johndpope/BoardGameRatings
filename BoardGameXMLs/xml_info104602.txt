			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thrill Kill is an unreleased game that was finished and ready to ship in 1998, but cancelled when Electronic Arts Pacific acquired the publisher, Virgin Interactive, and decided that the game was too offensive and sadistically violent to ever be released. The game originally received an Adults Only rating (ESRB: AO), but the game was toned down to receive an M rating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was packed with gore and sexual content. After the cancellation of the game, the developers released the disc image to the internet, where it can be downloaded and played using an emulator or by burning it to a disc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plot of the game is that ten damned souls are sent to hell and given the chance to fight for reincarnation by the god Marukka. Thrill Kill is a multi-player 3D fighting game with ten playable characters. Each fight takes place in a room where the players all try to build up their kill meter. Kill meter is built up by attacking your opponents. When a character is at full kill meter, they can finish off an opponent with their Thrill Kill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
