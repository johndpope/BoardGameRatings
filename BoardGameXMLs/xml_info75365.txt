			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world is about to fall into turmoil, the likes of which it has never faced before. The Magus, Mordicain, is dead, found in his tower with a dagger thrust deep into his chest. The Magus is dead and he has left no heir to the title.  The ten Magi now stand alone, none ready or powerful enough to challenge their brethren for the title and the power that comes with it.  So now the realms of the world ready themselves for the wars to come, the chaos to flow and the blood to spill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Arcana, a new RPG world where players will take on the roles of a hero, king or in is some cases, even one of the ten mighty Magi.  These heroes and lords then will live and have adventures in the world of Tifnarra, become involved in grand adventures, intrigue and danger, or for others, the fate of their kingdom lies in their hands.  Some few may even take on the role of one of the great Magi, vastly powerful mages, who through tradition and might have ruled the world since the dawn of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcana is generic world, designed for use with any Fantasy RPG System, and so the information presented here and in other Arcana expansions will of course be a bit vague as to stats, levels and powers.  The intention is to give the GM and players a world rich in personality, history and depth, one where they can seek adventure, but use any RPG system they feel most conferrable with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basics of the game world are presented here in this core book, but as expansions are released, the complexity of the world will grow as more and more of its history, dangers and wonders are explored.  When it is all said and done, Arcana will become a vast world of detailed and expansive depth, one where that you and your friends can full explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully booked marked for easy use, this is a must if you are looking for an expansive game world filled with magic, fun and excitement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
