							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Puchi Puchi Virus</name>
									
			<description>In the game,a planet much like Earth has been affected by a horrible viral outbreak. Anybody infected turns into a weird monster with a pun for a name,such as the Flying Panduh, a panda with a jetpack, a frying pan and an aversion to country music. As the outbreak worsens, Dr. Kevin and his two assistants decide to take a stand against the disease using their newly invented vaccine, made by pure awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game challenges players to link geometric viruses together to erase them before they turn into stones. Links are created by linking three viruses together into a triangle; and then 'popping' this triangle to remove the viruses. Combos can be created by overlapping two triangles and then popping the first triangle created. There are 102 levels within the game, each having a different objective (a certain score, a certain number of combos etc within a varying time limit).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Puchi Puchi Virus, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
