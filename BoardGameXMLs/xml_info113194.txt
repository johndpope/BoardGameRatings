			<description>Plutocracy is a game with elements of business and politics. You are a serial investor starting and building companies. You can also collect political favors in various ways, and use those to gain an advantage to your own companies, or to slow down your competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plutocracy is a card game. The opportunities available to you in a given round is represented by your hand. Your resources are collected separately, as money and political tokens ($ and poli-chips).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are free actions you can use each round if you cannot (or will not) play any of your cards. Events add some uncertainty. One event is the &amp;quot;End Game,&amp;quot; which you can use to adjust the length of a game, by placing it in the deck either near the top for a short game, or near the bottom for a long one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
