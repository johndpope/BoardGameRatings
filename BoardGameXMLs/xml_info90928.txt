							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">It Counts to Win</name>
									
			<description>Another self-print game from David Simpson (Tug of War).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It Counts to Win is an abstract game of dice, numbers, strategy and probabilities.  Players roll dice and place them in either their pots, or other players' pots.  Players attempt to make a total of '15', but beware, if you exceed 15, you'll have to start all over again, and your fellow players aren't going to let you make your 15 so easily.  Players can either build their points or cause other players to bust by managing the dice rolled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every time a player makes 15, they score a point.  First player to acquire 5 points wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
