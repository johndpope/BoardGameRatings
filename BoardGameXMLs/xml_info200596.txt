			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;双六丸忍法帖 畳地獄 (Sugorokumaru Ninpoutyou TATAMIJIGOKU) means &amp;quot;NINJA girl in TATAMI INFERNO&amp;quot; in English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sugorokumaru Ninpoutyou TATAMIJIGOKU is roll-and-move style board game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 18 cards placed on the table, forming a triangle. Each of these squares represents a tatami, Japanese flooring material made of woven straw, and has two sides: black and white. Players take turns rolling a die and moving their Ninja pawns along the triangle. If the white pawn lands on a black square that is forming a line of three or more black squares, the white player takes damage, and vice versa. The longer the line of cards, the more damage that player takes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before a player rolls a die, that player may play one card from their hand to flip a square specified in the card, and may spend one tatami power to play an additional card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a Ninja character who can use their special abilities spending tatami power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player's life is reduced to zero, in which case the survivor wins, or when any player goes around the triangle three times, in which case the player with the most tatami power remaining wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;カードをマス目に見立てた二人用対戦双六。&lt;br/&gt;畳の色を連鎖させて呪いで相手のニンジャを殺す。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
