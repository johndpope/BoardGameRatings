Counting your first million credits hit the market from the bridge of your fleet flagship. Watching opposing governments scramble to make a higher bid over your services. Sound nice? You want to live that life? Then come on in the market&amp;rsquo;s fine. Or would you rather ride fire with your cellmates, ripping open commercial holds and taking whatever you want before the authorities come and try and stop you? Make your mark and your fortune on the success of others with piracy in the space lanes and strangling every credit from your informants.

Now they can influence the universe like so many have before them with the power of the almighty credit! Will you become a trade mogul and create your own corporate empire?
