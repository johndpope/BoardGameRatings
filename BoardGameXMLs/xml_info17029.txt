			<description>Three to Five players compete in making the most money bartering about used cars. &lt;br/&gt;Everyone sells and buys some and you *try* to make the most out of it. This is not easy since every player has several cards depicting upgrades (few) and defects (PLENTY) that are played face down on the cars that are currently traded. &lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; winner of a bid collects the depicted worth of the new car from the bank plus any present upgrades, pays the agreed price to the car dealer and then he needs to pay for all the defect cards played upon this card. More often then not he has less money then before the deal. So now he's eager to sell one of his cars to someone else, the only way of getting &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
