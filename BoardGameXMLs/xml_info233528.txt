			<description>Chicken Invaders: Cluck of the Dark Side (or Chicken Invaders 5) is the fifth game and is very similar to the previous ones. On 26 July 2014, InterAction studios announced that the beta team for this game was opened, and that they were now accepting applications. This meant if anyone was interested, they could fill in and submit their applications to this company. In October of that year, InterAction reviewed the applications and selected participants. On 20 October 2014, InterAction announced that the first beta team would be finalized within a week. Four days later, the first beta team was finalized, and InterAction stated that the second and third (final) beta teams would be finalized. The beta version was only made for Microsoft Windows PCs, and not for Linux or OS X. On 22 November 2014, Chicken Invaders 5: Cluck of the Dark Side was released. The game is for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. The game also has a Halloween Edition and Christmas Edition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Invaders&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Invaders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
