							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The New Howard H. Jones Collegiate Football Game</name>
									
			<description>This football game was created By Howard H. Jones who was not only the President of the Municipal Service Corp., Ltd. which produced the game but also the Coach of the Southern California 1931 National Championship team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kickoff's, Field Goals  and Punts use a special mechanical device that kicks the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Offense the player chooses one of 8 possible plays to call and then spins an arrow which stops on letters. Then the defense spins the arrow and gets a letter result. The result of these two spins determines what happens to the ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an aside here is a couple of words of advice from the head coach about football strategy from the times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question: With 4th down and a foot in a scoreless tie shall I attempt to make the foot or punt the ball. ANSWER from COACH: You should have really punted on 3rd down. By all means PUNT, failure to make a 1st down would put your opponent in good position to score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question: Is it safe to attempt a forward pass while still within ones own 40 yard line. ANSWER: Usually it isn't. There are times when this play is worked with success. One can only depend on ones own judgment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question: With the score 9 to 7 against me with 3 minutes to go in the game and the ball on my opponents 28 yard line what play would you use?  ANSWER: A wide end run to get the ball in the center of the field on 1st down and then I would try a place kick on 2nd down&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
