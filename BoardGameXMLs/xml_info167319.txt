							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tiamat X</name>
									
			<description>The evil Choazid Empire has launched a surprise attack on your homeworld, establishing a heavily fortified base from where their forward assault group burrows deep underground, capturing subterranean lifeforms and transforming them into vicious biomechs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With it being only a matter of time before the Choazids start converting your people, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to take the controls of one of the few remaining Tiamat dragonship prototypes: the X class fighter, a craft capable of immense firepower &amp;ndash; provided you pick up enough upgrade caches during a mission where you must dodge and blast like there&amp;rsquo;s no tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring six levels of intense shooting action, Tiamat X is a rip-snortin tribute to the side-scrolling shooters of yesteryear, and would be right at home blazing away on the screen of a booming, beer-stained arcade cabinet. As such, your PC, phone or tablet will have to do, and it is much to the designer&amp;rsquo;s regret that he can&amp;rsquo;t plumb a coin-slot into his rig for that truly authentic seaside amusement-park experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get some big speakers, though. Really, we do recommend them for this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Auto fire &amp;ndash; this is primarily intended as an accessibility option and allows the player to not have to worry about using a fire button.&lt;br/&gt;     Quick fire &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t like mashing buttons/keys, then this is for you. Press and hold to fire.&lt;br/&gt;     Colour blind filter &amp;ndash; this filter adjusts the game thereby making it more colour blind friendly. We just hope we have got it right!&lt;br/&gt;     Six levels of intense shooting action&lt;br/&gt;     Original music score&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
