			<description>This is a card game where the object is to collect the largest number of complete sets of Peanuts comic strips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with 2 cards.  Each turn, the player will either draw a card or pick up a discarded card, then must either discard a different card, start a comic strip by laying down two of the matching color cards in front of them, or adding a card to one of their comic strips.  All discarded cards are available for pickup, not just the top card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other players cannot play on one's comic strip, each player individually builds on their own.  A player can have up to two comic strips of two cards each, but cannot start a third until one of the two has at least three cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When all of the draw pile and discarded cards have been picked up, any remaining cards in the player's hand that match one of their own strips is laid down.  The largest number of complete strips wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An advanced variant is to collect the comic strips in the correct order, and only those in the correct order are counted at the end of the game.  The correct order is not shown on the cards, but a solution card is included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
