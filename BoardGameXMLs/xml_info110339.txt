			<description>The aim of this word game is to find words that fit into a specific topic and comply with either being a &amp;quot;High&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Low&amp;quot; word. With A=1 and Z=26 every word that you come up with will score you a certain amount of points.&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 topics and and you have a minute to come up with an answer for each, either an answer with as many letters towards the end of the alphabet to score you most points; or a short answer with letters towards the beginning of the alphabet. After the time has run out you go through topic by topic, &lt;br/&gt;you decide whether you answer is unique, an answer that no-one else has chosen; then you think if your word is the highest or lowest depending on which was chosen at the beginning of the game. If you choose to move onto the &amp;quot;Showdown&amp;quot; you can then text in the number to find out your words score. You can, if your good at maths work out the number yourself. &lt;br/&gt;The winner of the showdown gets 20 points, if you had a correct answer but didn't go into the showdown you get 10; and if you didn't think that you had a unique answer but it was still a right answer you get 5 points. &lt;br/&gt;After 5 rounds, totaling 20 minutes you work out your overall score and the winner is the player with the most points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
