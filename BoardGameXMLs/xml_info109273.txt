			<description>A &amp;quot;Tri-Level Game for Ages 7 to Adult&amp;quot; described on the side of the box as a &amp;quot;Fast Game of Fun and Strategy for Two&amp;quot;.  The board has some similarities to that of games in the Morris family, though piece placement is guided by die roll.  The game's objective is to form sets of three pieces in a row, either via direct placement or via moving the pieces along lines on the board, with victory coming when a player reaches 16 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
