			<description>Afterlife is a god game released by LucasArts that places the player in the role of a semi-omnipotent being known as a Demiurge, with the job of creating a functional Heaven and Hell  to reward or punish the citizens of the local planet. In order to do so, the player must keep tabs on these citizens' sins and good deeds. Players are accountable for the job that they do, however, because their bosses, The Powers That Be, check in from time to time. The player also has the assistance of two advisors, Aria Goodhalo, an angel, and Jasper Wormsworth, a demon. Aria and Jasper provide warnings when things are going wrong with the afterlife, and offer tips on how to fix the problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Afterlife (computer game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
