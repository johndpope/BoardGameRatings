			<description>From the publisher: Players attend the Clown School &amp;ldquo;Grimassimix&amp;rdquo;, where making faces is subject matter instead of maths and languages &amp;ndash; to the student&amp;rsquo;s delight. Sticking out their tongues and wrinkling their noses; everything&amp;rsquo;s allowed when players try to imitate the faces on the cards. After all, they are trying to trains their facial muscles, aren&amp;rsquo;t they? The game comes with a little mirror to control your funny faces. The player, who recognizes most of the faces, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grimassimix is a unique board game to tackling the topic of speech therapy. The game focuses on the training of facial motor skills and has been developed by a team of four speech therapists with years of professional experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
