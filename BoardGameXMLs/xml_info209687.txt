			<description>Become COSMIC bounty hunters. In a SCI-FI, Board &amp;amp; Card game Hybrid; created by Aaron Bonkowski.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The craziest, toughest bounty hunters the galaxy has ever seen will collide in this game.

And a relaxing retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the game is to be the first hunter to collect 3 bounties.
