			<description>&amp;quot;It's something to talk about&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;   All you have to do is get the &amp;quot;guesser&amp;quot;to SPEAK one simple word. Sounds easy doesn't it? In getting the &amp;quot;guesser&amp;quot; to SPEAK the word, you or your team can say just about anything, as long as it is in the form of a sentence and does not contain the &amp;quot;mystery word.&amp;quot; Still sounds EASY doesn't it?&lt;br/&gt;   The rules are straight-forward. You're in a team of three or more players. Pick a team mate to be the &amp;quot;guesser.&amp;quot; You and  the remaining team mates are given a mystery word. It is your job to create a sentence together, using one word at a time - one player at a time, with the goal of leading your &amp;quot;guesser&amp;quot; to guess the mystery word.&lt;br/&gt;   For instance, if the mystery word is &amp;quot;ESCALATOR&amp;quot;, one team mate might say &amp;quot;THIS&amp;quot;... The second team mate might go on to say &amp;quot;MOVES&amp;quot;... Then, from player to player, they continue the sentence ie. &amp;quot;YOU&amp;quot; &amp;quot;UP&amp;quot; &amp;quot;AND&amp;quot; &amp;quot;DOWN&amp;quot; &amp;quot;LIKE&amp;quot; &amp;quot;STAIRS&amp;quot; until your &amp;quot;guesser&amp;quot; says the word - ESCALATOR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(text from the bottom of box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
