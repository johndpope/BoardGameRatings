			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to The Promised Land, the tutorial adventure for Symbaroum. Our aim is that it should provide a balanced introduction to the rules and setting of Symbaroum, suitable for both experienced role-players and beginners. The adventure deals with a perilous journey through the Titans. The player characters can be Ambrians about to make their first contact with Queen Korinthia&amp;rsquo;s new realm or travelers from the north who so far have kept some distance from the newly established civilization. In that way none of them know much more about Ambria than what is detailed in the first section of this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This scenario is included in Symbaroum Core Rulebook and is also made available as a standalone, free download from the publisher's site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
