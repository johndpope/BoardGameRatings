			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surviving as a god is tough, and no one can last without the best tools available. The right followers can enhance your way of life and your power base. Possessing a powerful artifact can help to show your strength. Reinforcing your territory makes sure other gods know where the line in the sand is drawn. Divine Instruments is the first sourcebook for Part-Time Gods, expanding on the most vital of these tools at a god&amp;rsquo;s disposal: Worshippers, Territory and Relics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rules for a more intimate approach to worshippers and their effect on a god. Also, rules for making and playing as Champions or God-Killers from among your flock.&lt;br/&gt;     New info on how divine territory is collected, distributed and fought by in the daily struggle between gods for power. Includes new Divine Improvements, like Temples, Shrines and Sanctums.&lt;br/&gt;     New options for starting Relics, as well as rules for how modern gods can become Relic Crafter themselves. Also includes rules on relics that house the souls of the old gods, the Soulbound.&lt;br/&gt;     Three new Theologies for your gods to follow&lt;br/&gt;     New Adventure Included!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
