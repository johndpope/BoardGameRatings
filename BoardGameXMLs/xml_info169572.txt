			<description>Symtactics is a simulation of tactical urbanism set in the Hong Kong region in the year of 2047. It involves both tactical as well as strategic decision making. It was printed in an edition of 20,000 for the Hong Kong edition of the New City Reader which was created specifically for the 'Uneven Growth' exhibition on view at the Museum of Modern Art from Nov 22, 2014 to May 10, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ideally, Symtactics is played with 5 players. All players must complete tactical interventions at 8 sites around the Hong Kong region while dealing with catastrophic events. Players can either play for a collective win, working together to beat an ever increasing inequality meter or they can play individually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interventions are created by matching resource cards to icons printed on the site hexes. A player must successfully match three icons or use wildcard resources as dictated by the current round's market situation. Once an intervention is completed, the resources used go into a pile as marked on the board. There are 8 piles that correspond to the sites on the map and another 8 towards the north of the board, corresponding to the development of global inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
