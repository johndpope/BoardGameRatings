							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">City  of  Tishrei</name>
									
			<description>Sourcebook introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because Fire and Sword has a somewhat unusual and innovative system for representing institutions, it seemed wise to create a demonstration setting, to show how to write up a setting for use with these rules.  Thus was born the idea for the City of Tishrei.  The institutions described either be used intact in your own setting, or edited to conform to the requirements of your setting and reused.  The Anti-Ork League, and the City of Tishrei, is released to users under the same Free Art License as the Fire and Sword Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of Tishrei is a vaguely North Indian city, with Rakashas, great orks and orks to the north of the valley the city sits in.  There is a jungle with Nagas and other demonic monsters to the south.  It is the biggest city in a river valley, at the mouth of the valley.   To get a feel for what the City of Tishrei is like, read the Mahabharata or the Ramayana.  Please note that in recommending these epics I am neither accepting nor rejecting Hinduism as a religion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second iteration of this document.  Later versions, adding noble houses, the New Market, etc are planned.  A couple of sample campaigns are also intended to follow this document, but since the author is not being paid, they may not come out as quickly as either you or I might hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
