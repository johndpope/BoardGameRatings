							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Asphalt: Urban GT 2</name>
									
			<description>Asphalt: Urban GT 2 is racing game developed and published by Gameloft for the Nintendo DS, N-Gage and PlayStation Portable. A 2.5D Java ME version for mobile phones was also released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Urban GT 2 is often compared to Burnout, Need for Speed and other titles because players can eliminate opponents by bumping them, as well as avoiding the police. There is a wanted meter which determines the awareness level of the police, much like the wanted level system in Grand Theft Auto - if the red &amp;quot;WANTED&amp;quot; light flashes, it usually means that the players must do what it takes to avoid the police - otherwise they might be forced to pull over and lose their money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nintendo DS version was released approximately a year after the N-Gage version, with improved graphics, sound, and dual screen compatibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Asphalt: Urban GT 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
