							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Space Goblins</name>
									
			<description>Space Goblins is a wargame of man-to-man combat aboard a spaceship.  The premise is that goblins are real, humans drove them away from Earth a long time ago, and now that humans are space faring, goblins learn the same technology and are out for revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game map depicts a human spaceship which has been rammed and boarded by a goblin ship, part of which is also depicted.  The ships are divided into corridors and compartments.  The two forces fight over this map until one side is eliminated.  The system is a fairly simple one, but has some interesting elements, for example the stacking rule, which is that as many counters as can fit in a space without overlapping are allowed.  There are also a number of special unit types, such as witch doctors for the goblins, robots for the humans, and technicians for both, which have various abilities (technicians can create and remove barriers, unjam weapons, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;1 6-page rulebook&lt;br/&gt;1 map, approximately 17.5&amp;quot;x22.5&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;198 counters printed on heavy paper&lt;br/&gt;1 sheet of rules clarifications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
