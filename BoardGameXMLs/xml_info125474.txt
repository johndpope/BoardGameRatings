			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;This is a compilation of six articles &amp;ndash; methods for building situations for tabletop roleplaying. Each of the six methods is a procedure; by working through one of these procedures, you'll generate the core 'stuff' needed for a session or two of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Long Knives is used to create situations for intrigue that the characters are tied to.&lt;br/&gt;    Broken Places builds situations where a villain of some sort has taken over an organization.&lt;br/&gt;    The Quest is used to generate adventures that will take the characters out on significant journeys&lt;br/&gt;    Transgression is a generator for social movements and the resistance to those movements.&lt;br/&gt;    Predator Souls is a means for making monster-hunting scenarios for your games.&lt;br/&gt;    Nine Rooms is a method for setting up dungeons, the classical limited-space perilous situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The record sheets are also available full-page sized, in a second file that is part of this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
