			<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The Game of 21st Century Undersea Warfare Based on the Classic TV Series.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A miniatures game of combat between underwater craft. The game is played on a hex grid. Each move equals about 15 seconds in game time and each miniature represents one craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rulebook:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;These rules are an attempt to simulate the undersea combat portrayed in the 1960's TV series Stingray.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;It tries to be true to the original, and we have resisted (as far as possible given the requirements of game design) the urge to embellish the original too much.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The rules are divided up into three parts, The General Rules, the Titan Terror Fish Rules and the Stingray Rules. These can be divided up between player teams as appropriate (see below). It is recommended that players who use these rules regularly stick to one or other of the protagonists on a permanent basis. This will encourage greater identification with the cultural and technological characteristics of the two sides.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
