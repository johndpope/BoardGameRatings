			<description>Pairs of cards are laid out on the table. One card in each pair shows a body movement/gesture and a phrase, the other one a letter or number. Some of these pairs are open, some are concealed after everyone had a look at them. During the game, additional pairs are added.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns flipping open cards from a personal pile of cards. When a letter or number appears that is in one of the pairs, everyone has to either do the gesture or say the phrase or both (depending on the agreed difficulty level) on the matching card. The last player to do this has to take all the open cards. The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
