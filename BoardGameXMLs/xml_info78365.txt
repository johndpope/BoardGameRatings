			<description>In Questron the player takes on the role of a young serf who tries to make a name for himself by traveling the realm in order to gain the power and experience necessary to defeat the wicked &amp;quot;Mantor&amp;quot;, ruler of the &amp;quot;Land of Evil&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay and graphics are very simple. The view is mostly in top-down style for the world maps and town encounters, but switches to a 3D first-person style in the dungeons of the Land of Evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some features were novel for a game of its type at the time of its release. First there are two &amp;quot;games within a game&amp;quot; that allow the character to permanently increase dexterity or intelligence attributes if completed successfully. Also, various casinos about the towns allow the player to gamble for gold pieces in games of Blackjack, Roulette or &amp;quot;Double or Nothing&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The moral tone of the game is strange. You can rob and kill merchants, and to progress in the game to the Land of Evil you must storm a castle and kill the guards. The king of that castle will knight you for your courage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another aspect of the game is that various monsters and foes are immune or more vulnerable to different weapons. The player would occasionally have to switch weapons depending on which enemy they faced in order to defeat them. Magic spells can also be cast, but only in the dungeon levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original game was written by Charles Dougherty and Gerald Wieczorek and published in 1984 for the Commodore 64 and Apple II computer systems. The structure and style of the game were licensed from Richard Garriott, author of Akalabeth and Ultima. This game was the first foray by SSI into the fantasy RPG genre and its release was followed by the more expansive Phantasie series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, Questron , available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
