							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cathedral City</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;rdquo;In the distant we could see the enormous cathedral towering over the largest trees in the forest. There was still nearly a day&amp;rsquo;s travel left until we reached the gates of the city but we could already imagine the splendor of this miracle created by man.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve called this map the Cathedral city and this is my first city map to be released here on RPGNOW. The map comes in two versions, one colour and one grey scale. The map is in 300 dpi and Tabloid sized. So you can really print this out in a size that will take up the larger part of your gaming table. I&amp;rsquo;ve also added a smaller version of the map in the pdf. This is mainly for you who wants to preview the map. The map itself is distributed as a JPG file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map is made in City Designer 3 from Profantasy and then edited in Photoshop. I&amp;rsquo;ve aimed to make the city as believable as possible, but now it is your city to fill with content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What lies beneath the sky in this fantastic city in the middle of the forest with an enormous cathedral in its center? I see conflicts, politics, crime, adventure and many exiting places to discover. What do you see?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
