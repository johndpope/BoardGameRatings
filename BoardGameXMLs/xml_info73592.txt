			<description>from the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness is a role-playing game designed with emphasis on roleplaying not dice rolling. Dice and Rules have their place but not if they slow the action down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting allows GM's to cross genres, future, fantasy, horror and any combination in between. Giving plenty freedom for writing and creates plenty of surprises for the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in a world that has forgoten its evils. A world thrown into a dark age with no hope of escape the ignorance maintained by wizards and computer controled governments. A world where forgotten evils lurk and wait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darkness is a dark future role play game set in a world that has advanced too far and destroyed itself. Then returned from the ashes. It is not a phoenix, but rather a beast, twisted and confused. A dark future world of fantasy, magic and demons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;per the website:&lt;br/&gt;the game was first introduced in 2001, with updates into 2010&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
