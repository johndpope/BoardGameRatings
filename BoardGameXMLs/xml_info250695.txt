							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Year 57: Scavengers</name>
									
			<description>In Year 57: Scavengers, you will take on the role of one of six nation leaders in a wild and dusty post war apocalypse. Your goal is to collect resources, improve your nation, and go on raids, all the while exploring new territory, warring on other nations, trading goods, and establishing your presence in Year 57.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flow of the game is built around gaining 'Resources', which are used to purchase 'Recipes'. These Recipes give your peoples new 'Nation Strengths' which can then be used to go on 'Raids'. 'Raids' are worth victory points at the end of the game. In addition to 'Raids', you can also excavate to collect 'Artifacts'. Different sets of these will also be worth victory points at the end of the game. In addition to collecting and purchasing cards, a large aspect of the game is discarding the 'Recipes' you've built, as each one has a unique effect that can be used AT ANY TIME. That's right, in this game you can immediately discard recipes and use effects out of turn, constantly attacking and defending against the other players with effects such as 'Gain a Victory Point', 'Cause Immediate End of Turn', or even 'Swap Hands with Another Player'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
