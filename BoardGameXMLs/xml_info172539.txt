							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">All-Star Baseball Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The All-Star Baseball Card Game is a system for using your own collection of baseball cards to simulate a game, a series, or an entire season. Teams are only limited by your collection and your imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a 10-sided pitcher's die, and a 12-sided batter's die to determine outcomes based upon the players' statistics and the included tables. Each roll of the dice represents a single at-bat; the game information is then recorded with your own pencil and paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced rules are included to permit for stolen bases, extra bases, and double plays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
