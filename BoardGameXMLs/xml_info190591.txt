							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Legend of Dragoon Storytelling System (Version 1.2)</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place on the continent of Endiness from the original video game. It can take place at any point in history, allowing players to participate in the original Dragon Campaign, or deal with a new threat 100 years after the events of the original game (the Dragoons appear whenever legend needs them). The game was designed to be ideally played with seven players, so that each element is represented. [The rules] assume a certain amount of exposure to both Legend of Dragoon and the [White Wolf] d10 Storyteller System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Version 1.2 document varies from the Version 1.1 document primarily in refinements such as corrections, improved formatting, and minor additions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
