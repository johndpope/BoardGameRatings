			<description>The object of Wabbits is to win four carrots by forming words fast. You form four-letter words by pairing up word bit cards or tiles from your hand and/or from the supply pool in the middle of the table. Word bits are fixed two-letter combinations that can form words when combined correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WO   +   RD   = WORD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PL   +   AY   = PLAY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It takes two word bits to form a word, and you must use all of your cards/tiles. At any time and as often as you want, you can discard any unwanted word bit by putting the card/tile face up in the pool and picking up a new or discarded one. Go fast; up to a dozen others are forming words at the same time as you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you are a BUNNY, RABBIT, HARE, or JACKRABBIT! When skill levels differ greatly, level the playing field by using the skill cards which are numbered from 1 (beginner) to 8 (expert). The number in one&amp;rsquo;s card is the number of words one has to form.  Less experienced players can win because they need to form fewer words. Whoever finishes first gets the carrot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the more you win, the harder it gets to keep winning!  After winning a carrot, your target number of words goes up by one for the next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players leading during a game have to work harder for the next carrot, and so the others always have a good chance of catching up. The game is never over until the last carrot has been won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
