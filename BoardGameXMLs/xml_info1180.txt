			<description>from translation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object: To play correctly and quickly while building a tower. The winner is the player who plays all of his rods and scores as many points as the other players have rods remaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Course: One player shouts to begin, and plays one of his rods down on the table. All players now start to play frantically onto the same tower. Each player should consider building so that other rods in his hand may be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of calling colors as each rod is played, players may wish to use the ancient Babylonian computer numbers to represent the colors:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
