			<description>Fun survival board game that is set in a cartoon-like environment. The game board is compiled from 37 individual tiles, which are placed randomly and face down. The turn system is fast paced. During your turn you can carry out the following actions in any order:&lt;br/&gt;A. Move to any adjacent tile (1x). If hidden, the tile is revealed instantly.&lt;br/&gt;B. Pick up a new card from the deck corresponding to your tile (1x).&lt;br/&gt;C. Use cards in combinations or on their own (unlimited times).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 200 game cards divided in 5 tile types (40 each). Each zone has different possibilities of cards to find. There are 23 different game cards. Some of these cards can be used on their own, but others only in 10 specific combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has different rule variations and the main game modes have somewhat opposite goals, which are: &lt;br/&gt;1) Survivor - the goal is to be the least hungriest when someone loses.&lt;br/&gt;2) Last Survivor - the goal is to stay in the game for as long as possible. So it is played till everyone but one loses.&lt;br/&gt;3) Forage - the goal is to be the first to reaches 20 forage points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game-play you can place traps to protect your territory against other players or to hunt (each deck has 6 wild boar cards - which start their movement on the board). Also each deck has 3 Depleted Tile cards - which means that you cannot stay in one place all the time. The game board will get more and more depleted as the game advances. It's also possible to play long enough to have all the tiles depleted. At this point you still carry out your turns as you normally would, only there are no cards to pick up so you have to play with what you got left in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected gaming session highly varies depending on the player count, their luck/skill level and the game mode you have chosen to play with maybe including also some optional rules.&lt;br/&gt;For 2 players the Survivor mode can take as long as 2 hours to play out while the Forage mode can take as fast as 30 minutes. With 5+ players it's quite the opposite - the more players you got the faster the game will end in Survivor mode, while in Forage it will go on much longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
