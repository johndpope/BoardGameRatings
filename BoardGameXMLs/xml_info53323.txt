							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mythos of the Maori</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fantasy RPG set in the pre-European contact mythic history of the Maori peoples of Aotearoa (New Zealand). Enter a world in which the tribes of the people struggle for power and where explorers wander lands that no human has ever seen before, a mythic landscape of strange beasts and uncanny spirits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And from the free pdf section, What Do Characters Do?:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...primarily the idea of the game is that each Character will have ties to a Tribe and family that are both mundane and spiritual, and most of the story will revolve around engagement with these two spheres of the world: the world of people and the world of spirits. Encounters with the world of spirits are likely to be dangerous, weird and frightening. The gods and monsters of Mythic Aotearoa are ancient and terrible. They are not to be trifled with lightly, though they often decide to trifle in the affairs of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of people is more mundane but equally dangerous: wars, petty rivalries, illicit love, tribal one-up-man-ship, revenge, betrayals and requirements to pay - sometimes complex or dangerous - homage to ancestors will make up the bulk of the stories that occur in the lands of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
