			<description>The game board depicts a birthday pie, garnished with various pins and sticks in different colors. The players hold rings on a kind of flat board and blow them towards the cake. If the ring lands on a pin of the same color as the ring, the active player can take it and blow again; a different color, take it and pass the turn to the next player; a black pin, return one pin; the large stick, take all pins of the color of the ring.&lt;br/&gt;When all but the black pins have been claimed, the player with most pins wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
