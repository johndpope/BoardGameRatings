			<description>First published as part of the Stonehenge: Bonusspiele #1 anthology as Erbaut Stonehenge!, A Grand Endeavor has seen subsequent development.  (For example, as originally published, it was for 3-4 players.)  This Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game game focuses on the actual construction of Stonehenge.  In each player's turn, she has a construction phase, a draw phase, and a commit phase during which she may commit to a project.  There is opportunity for spite in A Grand Endeavor, as a player may choose to defame another faction's character, setting that player back a little.  Once Stonehenge is completely constructed, the game ends, and players are awarded points for their works, with some bonus points for adjacency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
