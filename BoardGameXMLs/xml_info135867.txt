			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue #1: Artifacts, Manuals, and Toolkits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most entertaining aspects of a post-apocalyptic RPG is the many sorts of artifacts that can be found. Simply put, artifacts are the &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; weapons and items of the science-fantasy genre and, as such, both players and Game Masters are always on the hunt for new items that can be used both by characters and against them. Mutant Future and other popular post-apocalyptic role-playing game rules have decent rules for figuring out and repairing artifacts and, with an eye to providing players and Game Masters with some new and interesting rules to add to their game, we have taken these to the next level in this issue of the publication. Accordingly, this first issue of the Wasteland Weekly covers several new rules, from optional bonuses on figuring out artifacts, to manuals and toolkits. There are also rules that cover saving throws for artifacts and how much damage they can sustain before being damaged or destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
