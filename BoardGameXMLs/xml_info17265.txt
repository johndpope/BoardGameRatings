			<description>From the Kidult website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KokkoKid is a very easy game with some surprises in store!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4 hungry fearsome crocodiles go about in a lagoon that separates the stormy river from the lake of tranquility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hunting has began, but our crocodiles are not very smart...that's right, they are only able to go straight and imagine this, they do not know how to stop... to do this they must go to the opposite side. Now it is your turn. Will you be able to help your little fish arrive to their destination safely with your die, some cunningness and a touch of luck? The player that will save the most fishes wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
