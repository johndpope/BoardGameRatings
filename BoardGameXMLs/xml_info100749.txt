			<description>F-1 Sensation (Ｆ－１センセーション?, &amp;quot;F-1 Sensation&amp;quot;) is a Family Computer video game that allows players to compete with up to eleven other Formula One greats. They are divided into three levels based on real-life skill; A-level, B-level, and C-level. Each track and driver is based on the 1992 Formula One season. Pit stops are included and the crew chief tells each player when to go to his pits for tires, wing repair, and even body repair. Each race has less than ten laps - allowing for an arcade-like experience. The player can either race in a single race or an entire season. Players must qualify in order to get in the race. There are twelve positions that must be filled in each race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real world sponors are placed on the billboards that are in the background of each race course. The player can select the official Formula One track that he or she want to race. Cars are custom made; the player can select the body type of the car, the body color, the chassis. He or she can even select his or her rival drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game users mapper #4 and the TSROM board. The only difference between the European and Japanese version of the game are the locations of the screen where to look for lap and position information. All the music in the game's soundtrack sound similar to Blades of Steel and the 1989 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is called Formula 1 Sensation in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;F-1 Sensation&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
