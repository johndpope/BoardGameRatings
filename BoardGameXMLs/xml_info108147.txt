							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Deadlier Than The Male</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have a threatened population, you'll find members of that population evolving into a response to that threat. When you're threatening the Hot Chicks of Earth in 2015, you're going to eventually have to deal with some truly bad ass Hot Chicks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are ten of them. Suitable for use as Player Charcters, allies, adversaries, contacts, complications... when you need dangerous hot chicks in your Hot Chicks game, here they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything from the magic-using arsonist to the combat-ready cyborg, these ladies will mess you up something fierce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've seen a lot of dangerous people In the world of Earth in 2015 - aliens, demons, robots, ninjas - and they've all proven dangerous, even deadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the female of the speicies is more deadly than the male.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These characters can be used in a number of ways. They're balanced to be reasonable starting characters, so they can even be used as PC's. They make excellent allies and contacts, perhaps as potential relationships for PC's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then again, they can also be used as opponents - complications and even campaign villains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also included are some glamour shots of a number of the characters, because it wouldn't be a proper salute to Hot Chicks without seeing them in all their glory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
