			<description>This is a card game that is played while traveling in a car or bus. Each player is dealt 7 cards which depict various roadside objects. When a player sees an object that is similar to the picture on one of his cards he calls &amp;quot;Caw&amp;quot;, shows the card to the other players and discards it. The first player to dispose of all his cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quote from the rules... &amp;quot;DO NOT PLAY IF YOU ARE THE DRIVER&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards also have numbers that can be used to play &amp;quot;Go Fish&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
