You can use Hallowed Ground to play a skirmish between Texans and Mexicans in 1836 up to the large battles of the American Civil War and Franco-Prussian War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific sequence deck compositions and army ratings for each period and army, combined with three unique sets of rules that cover different scale games, gives Hallowed Ground 2nd Edition unparalleled flexibility in gaming the vast array of conflicts of the 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
