			<description>Subtitle: Rodent Playing Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mouse Tails is a lite story telling RPG designed to help role playing parents introduce their hobby to their young children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are sentient mice living in our own real present day world.  A sentient mouse is a mouse who thinks with human-like intelligence.  Well, you think like a human thinks a mouse would think anyway.  But beyond that, you are still simply a normal mouse.  Not a cartoon or humanoid mouse who wears clothes and drives a car, just a real every day little mouse. You can use and manipulate items around you to your advantage (if you can come up with ways to do so) but, you don&amp;rsquo;t carry around a bag of tools and you certainly don&amp;rsquo;t wield a sword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
