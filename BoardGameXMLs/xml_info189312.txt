							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Enemies Without Character Creation Supplement</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome, Acolytes, to the Dark Heresy Enemies Without Character Creation Supplement! Here players can find a plethora of new options to make their Acolytes created from the Enemies Without supplement even more unique, plus provide inspiration for building backgrounds and memorable histories. These are in no manner a required part of crafting a new Acolyte, but merely offer suggestions to aid in the character creation process as described in Chapter II of the Dark Heresy Core Rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Master can also use the tables on the following pages to aid in crafting the Acolytes' Inquisitor or other especially important Non-Player Characters the Acolytes will meet in their adventures across the Askellon Sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These tables on the following pages can provide additional inspiration to players to flesh out minor personal details for their Acolytes, such as appearance and minor physical peculiarities, special homeworld beliefs, and mementos from their lives before joining a warband in service to an Inquisitor. Players are encouraged to explore using these as launching points to create additional narrative for their characters' upbringing and prior service, such as lost loved ones, cherished childhood memories, pivotal encounters, and other events that helped shape them into the persons they are now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
