							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Commander</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some leaders are more than just people in charge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are leaders that are followed because they are given authority by society. Then there are those that command through respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They might be able to turn an untrained and untested group of downey bearded youths into a crack squad of workers or warriors with a rousing speach alone. Or able to motivate groups to perform arduous tasks under even the most harsh of circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best of leaders might become a Commander. As with any position of authority, they are likely to lead from behind, making others take risks on their behalf. But in times of struggle, a leader can become the true soul of heroism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
