			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, men and women, as I told you before, there are some cases in which a recommendation of mercy might do, but not this one, not this one. Either this man is the filthiest and vilest snake that ever crawled through the grass, or he is entitled to an acquittal. If you bring in a recommendation of mercy, a wishy- washy decision, yes, it is your province, I will not say a word about it. I will not say another word. But it seems to me that you have the courage. If you are convinced, as all of us are - you must find him guilty of murder in the first degree. &lt;br/&gt;--David T. Wilentz, Attorney General of New Jersey, in his summation to the jury, February 13, 1935.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the crime of the century. The kidnapping and murder of Charles A. Lindbergh III was one of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century and its verdict is still hotly contested to this day. It is the subject of dozens of books as are many of its key participants, especially considering one of the central figures in this case was one of the most famous men in the world at the time: Charles A. Lindbergh, the famed &amp;quot;lone eagle&amp;quot; who had flown the Atlantic alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This issue contains details information on the Lindbergh Kidnapping and adventure ideas for a 1920s based or a Time Traveling campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
