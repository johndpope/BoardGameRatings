			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pits &amp;amp; Perils is an &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; old-school role-playing game.  One modeled after the numerous war games-turned-fantasy RPG campaigns that proliferated during the early 1970s.  Back then, it was crappy little rule books typed in someone's basement.  Well, those days are back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pits &amp;amp; Perils has:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Classic character types, but with a twist (check out a FULL preview of the character rules on this page).&lt;br/&gt;     Extremely simple mechanics (perhaps the simplest ever) that can be tailored to nearly any situation.  Most of what the players do is decision-making, exploration, and role-playing.  The rules don't even try to do this for you.  And you know what? They shouldn't!&lt;br/&gt;     Nearly 100 monsters to fight and 200 magic items to win and wield.  All of them fully explained.  That's a lot for an 80-page rule book!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An amateur look and feel that captures the way things used to be. In those days, each group had its own homemade rules based on word of mouth and the historical war games they were already playing.  Pits &amp;amp; Perils is designed in this spirit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pits &amp;amp; Perils is NOT a retro-clone, but an original system designed for those who want an old-school experience without excessive rules.  This book contains everything needed to get started, including how to create a character, build a dungeon, and run a campaign in a world where magic still works and monsters are real. So live and die by the sword. Or magic, if you prefer. Dark dungeons await...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
