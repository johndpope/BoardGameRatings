			<description>ROLL YOUR OWN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A constructible dice game using NESTORtiles.&lt;br/&gt;Players construct custom dice then roll them in head-to-head combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2-???&lt;br/&gt;EQUIPMENT: One or more sets of standard NESTORtiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Each player builds a custom D6 die using tiles from a common pool. The pips on all 6 of each die's sides must initially total no more than 21. (This will change throughout gameplay.)&lt;br/&gt;     Players then ROLL their dice, with high roll winning. Ties are ignored in a two-player game; if more than 2 are playing, ties for high number are re-rolled until there is a winner.&lt;br/&gt;     A ROUND continues until one player has won six* ROLLs.&lt;br/&gt;     The loser of a ROUND may elect to either: (a) increase the total number of pips on his die by ONE by replacing one of its faces, or (b) have the winner decrease the total number of pips on his die by ONE by replacing one of its faces (winner's choice of face). In a multiplayer game, losers engage in a single roll-off to determine who gets to choose, with the LOSER winning that right.&lt;br/&gt;     A GAME lasts until one player has won six* ROUNDs.&lt;br/&gt;     A MATCH lasts until one player has won three* GAMEs.&lt;br/&gt;     Between GAMEs, each player must build a new custom D6 whose pips add up to no more than 21.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* This number may be reduced to shorten the game if more than two are playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For information on the interesting properties of custom D6 dice, search the Internet for 'Sicherman Dice' and 'Non-Transitive Dice'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
