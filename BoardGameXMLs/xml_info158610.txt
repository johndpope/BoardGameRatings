							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Social Media: The Collective</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the eighth issue of Going Postal, a series of supplements for the Mutant Future role-playing game by Goblinoid Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first issue that delves into a post-apocalyptic societial structure, the Collective. Built upon the idea of the hive mind, collectives share a communal mind where all members are intrinsically connected to each other on a mental level. In game terms this is handled by a few new mutations and some guidelines to handle these types of societial structure. In addtion, four NPC races are included (one also gives a PC option) that range from peaceful agrarians to cyborgs that seek to integrate everyone they come into contact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF is book-marked and includes layers so that the backgrounds can be turned off for ease of printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
