			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All's fair in love and identity theft in this funny bluffing and deduction game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Money can't buy love, but you can win it on a game show! Millionaires from around the world come on Stolen Hearts to find their True Love. But they better watch out for Con Artists bluffing their way into hearts and bank accounts! Will the Millionaire find their True Love and live happily ever after? Or will a Con Artist make off with the money?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game one player is the Millionaire, but the other players' roles are secret. The Millionaire will ask questions over three rounds, trying to find their True Love while the Con Artists try to instead steal the riches through bluffing or hacking. While the Millionaire and True Love are working together, the Con Artists are each in it for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
