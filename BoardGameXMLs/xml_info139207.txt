			<description>from the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Full Contact Magic, a high fantasy setting for use with Risus: The Anything RPG where anything can, and likely will, happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;designer's comments:&lt;br/&gt;FCM sprang into being as an excuse for something else. A while back I took a break from gaming (for a lot of different reasons) and turned to my childhood pastime of LEGO as a creative outlet. Let's just say I had an odd sensibility when it came to creations. Heavily inspired by fantasy gaming, and anime (specifically a lot of Miyazaki films) I started to create flying skyships, fantasy mecha, and so forth. As LEGO released more and varied figures of fantasy or sci-fi races (orcs and dwarves for example), I incorporated them into these creations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a gamer at heart though, the one thing that I needed for these creations was back story. So, creation, by creation, built as a love letter to fantasy RPGs, movies, books, and anime, constricted by the choice of available LEGO pieces, a back story, a world that would become Full Contact Magic was built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arcanomancy was a direct need to address the magical vehicles, while Ethermancy was created new for the setting. The thing about Full Contact Magic is that there is actually so much more created for the setting then 10 pages would allow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
