							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heavy Panzers at Kursk, July 1943</name>
									
			<description>HEAVY PANZERS covers the brutal and epic battle of Kursk tactically near Snovo on July 5th, 1943, with hourly turns, 400 yard hexes, platoon level units, armor strengths by tank type, aircraft, and engineers, in two scenarios using a chit-draw system so the game plays different each time.  The Firefight website describes the battle: &amp;quot;The Germans sent in their most powerful armor and even to their own surprise, broke through the first defensive line by 0930. The surrounded Russian regiment fought well and bled for it. The Tigers, Elephants and Brummbars became the King of the battlefield until met by the Russian Beast-eaters. Once the Germans had encircled the Russians in the first defensive line, there was a slight problem: their supporting infantry lagged far to the rear and what infantry had arrived was far too few to destroy the pocket. Immediately ahead was the 2nd Russian defensive line, manned by a Guards infantry division with armor. The first defensive line had crumbled under the classic German pincer movement, but German reserves were not ready to be committed. Nevertheless, piercing the 2nd Defensive belt and reaching the critical hills further south was not the same animal. It was nothing less than a head-on, in your face, battle. After regrouping, the German animals gathered in a armor wedge and began their breakthrough to the other side.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;You must mount and cut out the counters and provide your own d6 and d10 to play this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
