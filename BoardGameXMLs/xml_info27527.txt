			<description>Listed on the box as a game for little people. This game featured very unique player pieces. Each piece was shaped like a little boy and a little girl either staring up into space or singing. The pieces were made out of some kind of plaster. If handled with some degree of care the pieces lasted, although they did have a tendency to flake their paint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
