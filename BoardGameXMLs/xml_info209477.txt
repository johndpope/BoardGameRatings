			<description>Simple dice game,normally played for drinks. Every round one of the players is the active player. The active player rolls three dice and is allowed to reroll them up to two times. He then adds the dice' values, which are 100 for a 1, 60 for a 6 and pip value for all other numbers. Then in turn all other players must try to achieve a higher number with maximal as many rerolls as the sctive player. If a player rolls a Chicago, which is a 300, all other players loose and he proceeds to be the active player&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
