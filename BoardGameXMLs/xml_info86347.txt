			<description>From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with game board (ice rink), 2 pawns and a dice. The regular pawns has black lines across them, which shows the movement direction.&lt;br/&gt;In this ice hockey game, penguins and bears are competing against each other.&lt;br/&gt;Blue squares are for penguins , yellow for bears and white are neutral.&lt;br/&gt;Before rolling a dice you need to decide your direction, but be careful, because you do not want to go against the boards (lose the ball) nor you want to end your movement on the opponents square.&lt;br/&gt;In front of each goal there are two circles that cover each 4 squares. These are places you can hit a goal. From yellow, you lose the ball, if you are blue player. From blue you hit a goal if goalie is set on blue as well. From white both players roll the dice. Higher wins and ties go to the attacker.&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to score from the center of the field.&lt;br/&gt;The game length is determined before the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
