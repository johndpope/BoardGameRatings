							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Universal Adventures Tunnels of the Ratlings</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beneath the streets of human towns and cities, beneath even the holds of the dwarf lords, legends tell of twisting tunnels and dank chambers, of vast caverns and inhuman cities, where a wicked race of rat-like humanoids dwell. Vile and vicious, the ratlings are said to have an extensive civilization in the deep places of the earth. And there their leaders plot the conquest of the surface world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Universal Adventures Tunnels of the Ratlings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delve into the tunnels beneath the settlements of the civilized world in search of an elusive foe. Legends tell of a vile race said to be responsible for plagues and abductions, fires and engineering calamities, and sudden attacks on settlements where both the populace and attackers have vanished without a trace. Seek ye the foul ratlings in Universal Adventures Tunnels of the Ratlings. Universal Adventures Tunnels of the Ratlings includes 18 Encounter Cards, 18 Event Cards, 9 Spell Cards and 9 Search Cards. With the cards you can generate encounters, events, and the results of search actions as adventurers explore the tunnels or any other adventure you care to use the cards with. In addition, you can use the spells with the ratling warlocks, or any other spell casters that cast spells of darkness. The Spell cards are also a preview of the upcoming Ogres and Underwords Realm of Darkness. For use with any fantasy adventure rpg, Tunnels of the Ratlings can be used independently or in conjunction with other Universal Adventures products. Use the Dungeon Deck to create the tunnel complex or use a map of your own. With Universal Adventures products you&amp;rsquo;ll always have a way to play your favorite fantasy rpg&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
