							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Astro-Nots</name>
									
			<description>This is a children's motorized action game. Part of a series of games entitled T.H.I.N.G.S. or Totally Hillarious Incredibly Neat Games of Skill. This is the outer space themed game Astro-Nots.  The mission is to rescue the Astro-Nots from the moon surface by lowering the arm of the space ship. A magnet on the end of the space ship lifted the &amp;quot;Nots&amp;quot;. The game was started by pulling the alien monster (attached via string) to wind up the game. When the monster was pulled back the game, the round was over. From the box: &amp;quot;Save the Astro-Nots from the Angry Alien!&amp;quot;Ages 5 and up for 1 or more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
