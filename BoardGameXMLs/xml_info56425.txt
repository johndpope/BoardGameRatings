							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">LARP Pocket Players Guide</name>
									
			<description>[from the Introduction]&lt;br/&gt;When you're playing a Live Action Roleplaying Game (LARP), you don't want to have to go find a game master every time you want to do something, or have to carry around a big rulebook or a binder full of notes.  All of this gets in the way of the roleplaying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This guide will help you in many ways.  It's a handy rules reference.  It's a place to record your character's STATs and Abilities.  It's a notebook to keep track of the people and clues you come across during the game.  And it's got hints for building characters, preparing for the game, and how to have the most fun while you're playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
