			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some the mind is a closed chamber and a locked box, full of secrets a-plenty, but with no way for one to unlock the potential unless they choose to study for many years...rigorously and diligently in the arts of psionics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet there is a group of Wizards who use the raw powers of magic to beguile, control and enchant the minds of their chosen subjects. Simply known as the Enchanters, they can draw your darkest fear from the depths of your mind or drag out your deepest fantasy and let it live in breathing colour and passion. They are the Wizards who have unlocked this dimension of the most private places imaginable, and now use it for their own ends - some for good and some for ill...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You too can now open the secrets of the Pandoras' Box of the mind and lay them bare for the first time. We present Enchanters from Dark Quest Games and published by Natural 20 Press. The book presents a look at this elite group of Wizards and their powers, specialist items and their ways. All their secrets are open for you to delve into and use for your own ends - master your own mind and the minds of others. Packed with new feats and prestige classes, lavishly illustrated and laid out. Enchanters is the guiding tome for all those who dare to peer into the murky depths of this class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
