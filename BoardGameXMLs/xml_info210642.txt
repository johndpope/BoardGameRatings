			<description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing to you in hopes that you will reconsider your behavior. You know I always have and will continue to support you, but let me speak my mind on your life&amp;rsquo;s choices. I didn&amp;rsquo;t protest when you entered the academy. I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak up when you chose to have cyberimplants to enroll at the unit whose name you forbade me from uttering. But I implore you, think this through. Your job is dangerous, of that I am aware. I also know you always strive to be the best in what you do, you&amp;rsquo;ve been like that since elementary. However this time, the price is simply too high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t tell whether you do this out of ambition or sense of duty, but please reconsider. Would you really renounce your flesh and all that comes with it? For me, as your father, it&amp;rsquo;s a terrible blow. Will you be the same person afterwards? The anxiety. I have just by thinking about it numbs me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a letter found in Lt. Justine Clevel&amp;rsquo;s private quarters during the RAID 44 verification procedure sanctioned by the Governor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
