							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Europa 1400: The Guild Expansion Pack</name>
									
			<description>Hunger taught people new arts...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Europe 1400, &amp;quot;the golden age of discovery and free spirits&amp;quot;, had a dark side to it as well. In the shadow of acceptable occupations such as tailors, who knew how to clothe polite society, there existed those who eked out a living by ministering to the Dark Arts. Many people died in these hard times, but the peace of the dead was no longer guaranteed. At night, strange lights could be seen in the churchyards, as strange as the noises that the wind carried from these final resting places. Yet even the best story-tellers have not been able to tell everything about these sinister goings-on... for fear? See for yourselves...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;Three new occupations - roam the streets as a travelling entertainer, manage graves and tombs as a churchyard warden or manufacture tunics as a tailor&lt;br/&gt;Three new titles, five new offices and many privileges expand your sphere of influence&lt;br/&gt;Three new levels and three new locations, such as the cannon tower, await you in your new &amp;quot;dwelling&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Nuremberg, the Emperor's town - almost three times larger than all previous towns&lt;br/&gt;Impressive artefacts and arcane s&amp;eacute;ances are at your disposal&lt;br/&gt;Completely done-over graphics and character animations as well as T&amp;amp;L support&lt;br/&gt;Almost double as many sound recordings and extended movie sequences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
