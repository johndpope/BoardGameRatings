							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The False Treasure Room</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While exploring a dungeon, the players stumble across a secret door leading into a room filled with treasure. The group has hit the jackpot, or have they? Nothing is quite what it seems, as treasure after treasure causes trouble after trouble...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sample:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boots of Soggy Walking&lt;br/&gt;Appearing to be a well crafted pair of boots of water walking the effects of these cursed boots are quickly discernable once placed upon the wearer's feet. The boots will immediately start to grow damp, to the point of becoming completely soaked in one round. Walking results in the player making loud 'squooshing' sounds and leaving behind a trail of wet footprints. Acts such as moving silently and running are impossible. Extended wear of the boots may result in fungal growth and other adverse effects associated with prolonged contact with water. A remove curse preformed by a caster at 6th level or higher will cancel out the effects of the curse long enough for the boots to be removed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A line of unique and challenging chambers, designed to be dropped into an already existing adventure; Add-A-Rooms are quick and easy ways to add a little something extra to your game. Each Add-A-Room features elements that can be re-used in other adventures, such as magic pools, fake treasures, or ingenious traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
