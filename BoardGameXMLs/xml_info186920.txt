			<description>It is said that the bones of the past should have been left alone, but these are desperate times and thus desperate measures were taken.&lt;br/&gt;The Ashmogh was resurrected from the ashes of an Urugal necropolis long buried under the desert sands, and now people wonder if it wasn't buried with good reason.&lt;br/&gt;The reckless indiscrimination with which the Ashmogh destroys both friend and foe in its hunger for destruction leave many Urugal wondering if the old ways were not in fact better left resting in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ashmogh comes with two new Relic Cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seal of Kanak cripples the magic of enemy or allied Knights to heal the Colossus&lt;br/&gt;    The Storm's Eye pulls Golems inexorably closer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
