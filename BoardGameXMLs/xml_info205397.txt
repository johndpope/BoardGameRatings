			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title Goes Here is a role-playing game of exploration and meaning. Like most RPGs, Title Goes Here has layers, the top being the players gathered together to play the game, and lower in the layer of the roles, in this case scholars who have, likewise, gathered to delve into a great work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many RPGs, however, Title Goes Here adds a few more levels beneath the world of these scholars. The next lowest level is that of the great work, usually a book, but it could be an epic poem, a movie, or a shadow puppet play. Here the story of this work is taken and retold, from different perspective, different decodings, and different meanings. At this level each player has a character from the work, championed by a scholar played by that same player. The lowest level, is that of truths, fundamental ideas which are represented by the arguments of the scholar, the actions of the character, and by the decisions of the player. Indeed, this truth brings the layers full circle, acting as player commentary on the game in progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a character sheet, which when correctly folded can reveal one of three faces to the other players. You show which layer you are currently working in, by the face of your sheet. If your introspects face you, then you are in the layer of the scholars, commenting on the fictional work. If your inspects face you, then you are in the layer of the characters, acting within your own version of the story. If your aspects face you, then you are in the layer of truths and players, speaking about the game itself and what you wish to accomplish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each layer it is important to keep within your role, but there are ways during the game that you can change which layer you are using and there are ways for other players to shift your layer as well. This happens when your sheet rotates to show the correct face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
