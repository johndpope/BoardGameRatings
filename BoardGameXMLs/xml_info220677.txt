			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEAD SCARE is a tabletop roleplaying game by women, about women and children killing zombies in McCarthy-era America. It's based on Apocalypse World by Vincent Baker, and combines subverted 1950s American idealism with a blood-spattered zombie apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It began when President Truman was the first public target of a Russian bio-weapon the Russkies designed to turn people into flesh-eating zombies. Everyone watched it on TV that night, and nothing in the good ol' US of A will be the same ever again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How will you defend yourself when the shambling dead break down your white picket fence?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your husband is a cop, there's a revolver in your nightstand. What do you do when your husband isn't a cop and your nightstand is empty?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your ad man or professor husband sure provided for you before, but what are you going to do now that it's just you and the kids and something wants in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are weapons all around you, you just never thought about your household goods that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your knitting needles are spears. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your kitchen knives are good for more than slicing chicken. Though you probably don't want zombie meat for your casserole or hotdish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even that old vacuum can find new life as a zombie killing death dealer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the kids? They're not powerless either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junior's finally going to have a use for all that batting practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Sally's jump rope can make a zombie snare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're all in this together. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defend yourselves. &lt;br/&gt;Fight back. &lt;br/&gt;Don't give up. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
