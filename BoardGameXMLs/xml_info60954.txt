			<description>Game created and produced for GALP Energia.&lt;br/&gt;Its main purpose is to demonstrate how we can use our car in a responsible commitment with the environment, through the sharing of our means of transport with other people. If we all go to the same spot, why will we take several cars when we can take only one? This way we pollute less and contribute to a better planet!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funniest in this game is to be able to combine the characters to see whom we can give a ride and how to drive the shortest way possible to reach every destination. The more people we transport in the car the more energy we save and that is the attitude that should be followed by all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a game about sharing our car and how to use energy more accurately.&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played by 2 to 6 players. At the beginning of the game each player will receive 9 trees.&lt;br/&gt;Wins the first player who plants all the trees on the game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
