			<description>A one round Living City Adventure for Characters of Various Levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Procampur Scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t remember which of the six of you suggested a trip to Procampur to search for a little adventure. But here you are in the city--a place that seems to run very strictly by the book. The town is split into districts patrolled by a city watch called the Diamond Legion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems that at least someone in your group has a reputation as a sellsword, for a courier arrived a few moments ago with a sealed letter containing a job proposal. The note is simple and to the point. (Give them Player Handout #1.) &amp;ldquo;If you wish to earn a good deal of coin, meet me in the Port District at The Mercenary&amp;rsquo;s Loft, a place called Sneaky Pete&amp;rsquo;s. Introduce yourselves to the owner Ryken, and he&amp;rsquo;ll show you to your table. This is only if you're interested in making a good deal of coin. Be there at midnight.&amp;rdquo; It is signed One-Eyed Morrian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have about an hour to prepare for this meeting, assuming you are interested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
