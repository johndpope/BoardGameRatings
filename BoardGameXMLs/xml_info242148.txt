			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of different items that could be found in places such as do-it-yourself shops, builder's merchants and similar places, including such as workshops and hardware stores. These items can be used as a source of loot following an apocalyptic event, or can simply be used to flesh out a location's details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do-it-yourself shops are full of many potentially, and actually, lethal items that can be used by players. Many items are useful; others, not so much, depending on the players' creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;88. Voltage Tester (Either pen or screwdriver, with built-in bulb that lights up when the tester is used on live wires)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
