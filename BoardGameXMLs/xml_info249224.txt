							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cepheus Engine Science Fiction Role Playing Game</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cepheus Engine RPG  comprises the core rules for a Classic Era Science Fiction 2D6-Based Open Gaming System. Inspired by the original three books of the oldest 2D6-based science fiction roleplaying game, the Cepheus Engine system incorporates elements of Open Game Content from previous releases of that game of intergalactic drifters and wanderers to create a basic system that will allow players and Referees alike to create their own science fiction universes or play in the ones they are already familiar with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll find the core essence of your favorite sci-fi game here. You can explore interstellar space, make a ton of Credits on speculative trade, find yourself halfway across the sector after a serious misjump, or blow people up with your mind, if you can find training. You can even die during character creation. This stand-alone manuscript provides all the rules you need to play the game. The Cepheus Engine rules were intentionally designed to integrate well with other 2D6-based science fiction gaming systems, especially your favorite Classic Era modules and supplements. All of the material in the Cepheus Engine rules is considered Open Game Content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note this set of rules is the same as the Cepheus Engine System Reference Document.&lt;br/&gt;There are a few minor changes and fixes. It also includes a blank character sheet, blank sub sector sheet, combat reference sheets and a complete index. There is no internal art, except for the cover art and the blank sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
