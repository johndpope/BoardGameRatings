							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Macy Drapes: The Medium Mechanic</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two souls in one body. Macy the mechanic and Bobby the gangster. It's Macy's body and she is doing all she can to stay in control, including using her new powers that allow her to see and speak to ghosts, as well as her ghost disrupting touch. Always fearful that Bobby will gain control and go back to his old ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    Savage Worlds&lt;br/&gt;    5e&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
