			<description>There are task cards which show four of the five pictures in the game. One of them is put on the table.&lt;br/&gt;The active players flips open picture cards which contain one picture each. If the picture is not on the current task card, the player puts it down. Subsequent pictures are put on top of the first. When the third picture is on the stack, all players have to perform an action that is assigned to the fourth motive. The first player to correctly do that gets the task card. The first player to collect five task cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;The actions are Pippi Longstocking-related and include grimaces and other theatrical actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
