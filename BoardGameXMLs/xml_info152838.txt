			<description>Two to four player deck builder about developing and testing software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With help from your pool of talented developers you seek to develop stories, forging them into the epic you aspire to construct. However, even the best developers make mistakes, and therefor bugs do occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building up your software development factory helps you keep your processes under control. Or you can just hope to get away with your low quality product and heap all the misery on to your unsuspecting customer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player starts with a draw deck containing money, developer and epic cards, from which you draw a hand. During your turn, you can use cards to recruit new developers, special programming or testing tools, fix bugs, outsource or build towards completing your epics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you complete an epic, you can hand it over to another player. The epic is tested for bugs. Bugs discovered during the test will cause damage to your epic or the other player's deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your final score is determined by the value of the epics you have successfully handed over, the bugs in your deck and being the first player to finish three epics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
