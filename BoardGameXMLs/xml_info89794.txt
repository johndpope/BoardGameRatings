			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Romance of the Three Kingdoms VI is the 6th installation of the successful and still ongoing Romance of the Three Kingdoms series by Koei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Romance of the Three Kingdoms VI is a multiplayer game, able to take up to 8 players. Players take on roles of a ruler/warlord and manage their respective territories. This includes recruiting officers, improving agriculture and economy, drafting and training armies, maintaining diplomatic relations with other rulers and waging war. The ultimate goal of the game is to reunify China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few discerning features that depart from the past five editions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i) Each general has a main goal/ambition in life. If assigned to tasks that are not in line with these goals, their loyalty will decrease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ii) Each general possess a set of battle skills. Dueling now involves picking the correct skills to use during the 5 rounds of a duel. The War statistic still plays a crucial role in the duel, i.e. success and damage of the battle skills is related to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;iii) There are different types of troops to recruit, depending on the location of the fortress. These troop types excel on different types of terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
