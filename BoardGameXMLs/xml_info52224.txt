			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Among the Stars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STAR*DRIVE Campaign Setting offers a wealth of epic ALTERNITY game adventures in the distant frontier region of the Verge. Yet amid these bewildering opportunities, even the bravest need a place to call home. The Lighthouse stands as a base of operations, a site for adventure, and a means to travel the Verge in style. Listen to her mighty stardrive roar across the light-years, and know that this mobile station is a force to be reckoned with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these pages you'll find details on the station, her occupants, and a description of life and adventure aboard the Lighthouse:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* A comprehensive list of the dignitaries and luminaries who call the station home - station commander Wakefield, Concord minister Thayne, ambassadors from each of the stellar nations, journalists, bureaucrats, engineers, and the powerful AI known as MINA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Deck plans, section descriptions, and compartments for two hundred decks, with over one hundred distinct station locations described, including the station's reactors, living quarters, social environment, docks, and the Orlamist Temple that rises above it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Adventure opportunities aboard the station, plus a short adventure series centered near the Aegis star system at the heart of the Verge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
