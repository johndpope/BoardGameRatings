			<description>Knot so very far away - is a 'Special' place.  A warm and wonderful place.  &lt;br/&gt;It is known as &amp;quot;The World That's Knot&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;It is home of all the Knots that have abandoned their place in the trees - and lumber - in search of their family.  The &amp;quot;Knot Family&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;The Dogknots are a precious pet of the Knot family. They are sweet and playful, however very protective of the Knots.&lt;br/&gt;The Dogknot's only flaw - they are fascinated by the 'Butterknotfly'&lt;br/&gt;They are easily sidetracked when a 'Butterknotfly' is present, and are very likely to forget what they were doing adn wander off to follow the 'Butterknotfly'.&lt;br/&gt;Dognkots protect the 'Knot Family' from the 'Termiknots' as their long tongues can lash out in a heartbeat and snap them up.&lt;br/&gt;The Dogknots often lose their way back to &amp;quot;The World That's Knot&amp;quot;, and the Knot that collects the most Dogknots to return to &amp;quot;The World That's Knot&amp;quot; is honored as the 'Knot Hero'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogknot consists of 3 individual games which can be played separately or together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dogknot: Return the lost 'Knot Hero' to the &amp;quot;World That's Knot&amp;quot; and celebrate becoming the 'Knot Hero'.  Roll for a Dogknot card or retrieve them by landing on a draw card square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knotdoing: Add even more excitement and challenge by combining the fun of charades using the &amp;quot;Knotdoing&amp;quot; cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knot Poker: Substitute the draw cards with &amp;quot;Knot Poker&amp;quot; cards.  At the end of the game each player exposes his best five cards to strive for the best &amp;quot;Knot Poker&amp;quot; hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
