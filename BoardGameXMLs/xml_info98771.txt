			<description>Game Manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Darkness Is Upon You!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're on a dangerous treasure hunt, deep in the underground world of Dark Chambers. Wraiths, wizards, and moldering skeletons surround you. As you move through this meandering maze, you are stalked by the grim reaper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exits you see only take you deeper into the maze. If you find the strategically placed weapons, you can fend off your enemies while you search for the hidden treasure. The secret potions you find along the way will renew your strength. But watch out for hidden traps and deadly poisons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your strength will help you outlast the weaker ghouls, but are you a match for the strongest? Enter the underground world of Dark Chambers and find out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing the Game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are lost in Dark Chambers. Enemies, treasures, and curses are scattered throughout all levels from A to Z. Your goal is to survive all 26 levels and maybe beyond while taking as much treasure as you can. You can descend from one level to the next only by finding the escape holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your enemies, the dangerous ghouls, are everywhere. At times, they'll chase you. Other times, they'll back off. Don't let this fool you, though. It's just a ploy to lead you farther from the escape holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Search each chamber for treasures and weapons. Stay away from the curses: traps and poison. If you touch them, they'll take away some of your strength. Potions and food are also hidden in the chambers. When you find one, pick it up to renew your strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find the hole to escape from a level and descend to the next one. As long as you have strength left, you can go through all 26 levels. If you lose all of your strength, you collapse and the game is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a two-player game, if one hero collapses, the other player must find a heart and shoot it. This will revive the hero who collapsed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
