			<description>DiceFight! is a multi-genre dice fighting game. Each player chooses a faction with unique dice which include modified numbers and a special ability symbol, and uses this to capture objective cards. The factions in the base game include wizards, aliens, giant robots, superheroes and fairies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you choose and roll one of your dice, plus every horde die that has previously failed to capture an objective. Objectives either have one or more dice that must be matched, or a goal like 'a 3 die straight' or '3 dice with a sum greater than 15'. Dice that are used to capture return to their owner, other dice stay in the horde and continue to be used by other players to try and capture dice. The first player to capture 10 points worth of dice wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
