							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">TOM: The Origins Metagame</name>
									
			<description>Cards for this CCG were distributed for free at the 2002 Origins convention.  Each card depicts a real game, creator/gaming personality or company.  (The cards are paid ads.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players secretly select cards from their collection and simultaneously reveal them.  Normally a company beats a person, a person beats a game and a game beats a company.  However, if one card lists the other (i.e., the person worked for the company) then the victory is reversed.  Ties are broken according to the star, diamond and shield stats on the cards.  (Compare stars, diamonds and shields in that order until the tie is broken.)  The star statistic is dependent on the Origins awards and is equal to nominations + 2*wins + 5*hall_of_fame_listings.  Every autograph on the card that matches a name listed on the card is worth an additionally 5 stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second set of cards should appear at the 2004 Origins convention (the 2003 Origins convention was supposed to have the second set, but there were problems).  Cards for inactive games, companies and designers can be requested cheaply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    2002 Origins Award Nominee: Best Trading Card Game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
