			<description>From Playroom Catalog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first to reach the Temple of the Monkey in this Action packed card game of jungle adventure!  Each player takes on the role of a daring explorer racing along a unique path to the temple, battling raging rapids, dangerous predators, and most importantly, each other!  Every step along the path comes with its own challenges, and explorers must be prepared for whatever comes their way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must travel down their own set of path cards, representing the obstacles standing between them and the Temple.  Use your equipment cards to overcome the hurdles in your path, and your tactics to foul up your opponents efforts, but most of all, use your wits as you race to the Temple of the Monkey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
