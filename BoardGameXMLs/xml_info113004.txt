			<description>Starfarer Basics&lt;br/&gt;Starfarer has these features (at least, what is done of the game does):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Characters are generated by buying skills, attributes, advantages, and drawbacks with character creation points (a major divergence from my favorite published SFRPG, MegaTraveller.)&lt;br/&gt;    While character creation is skill based, the buy scheme and templates help prevent the abuses inherent in many skill-based games.&lt;br/&gt;    The task resolution system is percentile based, and has a success level system in place.&lt;br/&gt;    The combat system is designed to lean towards the realistic, tempered by a slight bit of the cinematic. Damage is handled primarily by recording individual wounds, but there is an overall system shock and bleeding system in place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
