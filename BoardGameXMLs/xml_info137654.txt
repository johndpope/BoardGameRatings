							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tee-Kesselchen</name>
									
			<description>A children's game where two players take a Teekesselchen card. A &amp;quot;Teekesselchen&amp;quot; is a term with two different meanings. Each card depicts two homonymous pictures. The two players choose which side they are in charge of and they begin describing the pictures. The first player describes her picture and then the second explains how his is different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;First player: My Teekesselchen is something you can eat.&lt;br/&gt;Second player: Not mine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players can ask yes or no questions and are trying to guess both the term and two different meanings in order to earn the card. The player who guesses is then part of the team that describes the next card. After all the cards have been guessed the player with the most wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
