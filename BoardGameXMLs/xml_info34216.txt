			<description>Meridian is an easy-to-learn strategy game for two players, played with a normal deck of cards (without Jokers). In many ways, it's a simple race game like Chutes and Ladders or Candy Land. The first player to each the center of the board (the Eclipse) and return to their starting point (the Meridian), wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, when the game begins there is no way for the players to reach the Eclipse at all. The board must be built by the players by playing cards. The game becomes a struggle to craft a path for yourself while still blocking your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not to be confused with Meridian by Leo Colovini.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
