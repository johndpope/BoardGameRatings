							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Dulse</name>
									
			<description>Publisher (Designer) Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Dulse is a game about relationships, ideals, and the choices we make to preserve or destroy them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being the name of the game, Dulse is also a character &amp;ndash; one who is literally central. The events that inform play, and the other three characters, revolve around Dulse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across five life-changing events, you and your friends will explore the sacrifices and betrayals of four people who&amp;rsquo;ve known each other their entire lives, and who have deep-seated needs that they can&amp;rsquo;t fill alone. Along the way you&amp;rsquo;ll make hard choices between competing ideals, and have more choices made for you. In the end, you will face an uncertain future guided only by a shared past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
