							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Myron Cope&#039;s Official Triple Yoi! Game</name>
									
			<description>This game is a trivia game bearing the name of Myron Cope, former color commentator for the Pittsburgh Steelers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instructions say this game is to be played while watching football, and when &amp;quot;your favorite team&amp;quot; does good things listed in the instructions (touchdown, interception of other team, first down, etc) to spin the spinner and contribute a chip of the color of the region to a kitty. There are 6 regions, 2 of each color red, yellow or blue.  However, on half of the six regions, one for each color, the spinning player is supposed to also take trivia cards, and save them until a commercial break or a penalty in which that player will be asked the questions by the player to his left. For each question the player answers he gets chips from the other players if correct, gives chips if incorrect. The color of the chips exchanged are based on the difficulty of the trivia question, with yellow being the easiest , red in the middle, and blue the hardest. Once the questions are asked, play rotates to the next player to be in charge of the spinner during the next bit of football action. Chips are given and gotten, but no one is ever eliminated, just the balance of chips sways. Player in charge of the spinner when time expires also gets the contents of the kitty being collected through the game.  Chips won from the various rounds of trivia, as well as the kitty are totaled.  The chips yellow, red and blue are worth 1,2,and 3 point respectively.  Player with the most chips is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having heard sports commentators, including Myron, I believe this game is supposed to feel like being a color commentator, where during the football game you do not say much, but then when nothing is happening, the color commentator sweeps in with his trivia, stories, or other banter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
