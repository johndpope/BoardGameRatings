							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation Candy Bomber</name>
									
			<description>It&amp;rsquo;s 1948, and World War II has left Germany divided between Ally and Soviet powers. Because Ally-controlled West Berlin is locked behind Soviet borders and cut off from all land transport, the people of the city must rely entirely on air support for all their supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play as a pilot in&amp;nbsp;Operation Candy Bomber&amp;nbsp;and work cooperatively with the other players to strategize how best to use each character&amp;rsquo;s strengths to fly missions in and out of West Berlin and help the people avoid starvation under the threat of Soviet control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, the players draw a card to see which area of West Berlin eats their rations. It is up to the players (with a limited number of actions) to drop off rations or candy to the people. Candy will be taken at the same time as rations and when enough candy is taken, players get rewarded in the form of postcards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While players are trying to keep the people alive, winter is slowly creeping in, making the game harder and harder. Eventually it becomes too cold and the planes can no longer take off, which will end the game unless players have completed the required number of operations, which are essentially missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
