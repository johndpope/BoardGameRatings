							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Milk Run</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Milk Run&amp;rdquo; is a short, single session D&amp;amp;D adventure designed for a party of three to six characters of levels 1-2 (about six total levels). A good mix of characters is important, and a Ranger would be helpful, but not necessary, and a Wizard or Sorcerer is almost essential. The party&amp;rsquo;s alignment should tend towards good to preserve the intent of the adventure.&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place along and near a trade road that travels through a humanoid infested forest and may easily be adapted into most campaign settings with only cosmetic changes. The set-up of the story easily allows for this adventure to be a group&amp;rsquo;s first adventure together.&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is combat heavy and is designed to pull a group of inexperienced heroes together in a trial by fire. The adventure requires a bit of finesse on the part of the characters, and imprudence may result in failure to defeat a group of kidnappers and, in the worst case, may lead to the murder of innocent hostages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
