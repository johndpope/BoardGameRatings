							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jet-Alert Game</name>
									
			<description>A full color game of skill in which you pilot your own jet airplane through exciting maneuvers with life-like jet replicas. There is no dice and no luck. Your skill brings you victory or defeat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game uses a board with irregularly shaped playing spaces where the player moves his aircraft a certain number of them changing altitude at the same time. It is therefore difficult to be sure where the aircraft will end up since some playing spaces are much larger than others. There is terrain which is at a given height. The game uses color coded bases to indicate altitude. Planes are equipped with missiles which automatically hit aircraft at a certain range. Aircraft can also bomb cities (presumably with nuclear weapons) and destroy them but must be at certain altitudes to do so. It's a little like chess with aircraft based on the only documentation I have which is the patent application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original publisher is listed as MGK but as far as I can tell that company does not exist. It's possible this was a self-published game. The designer was listed as Garcia-Kuenzli. I do not know if this reflects 2 designers or what country he or they were from. This is the only copy of this game I have ever seen. Neither the designer nor the publisher is in the BGG database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
