							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mr. Creepy&#039;s Geisterschloss</name>
									
			<description>Fans of spooky games, look out! In Goliath's family game Mr. Creepy's Geisterschloss a ghost is creeping through the rooms of an old castle. Ghost hunters are getting ready to help him find final peace by closing his coffin lid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exciting adventure takes you through this spooky castle, in which there is danger around every corner. At the beginning of the game the castle is built up, after which the ghost hunting can begin! Who will manage to get up the tower stairs first? Of course, along the way there will be numerous tasks, of which the skull is perhaps the most difficult: once it starts to roll, who knows which trap will go off. Whoever gets past all the traps and makes it up the tower stairs to close the coffin lid will put an end to the spookiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
