			<description>You may, by now, have ascertained this is not a normal deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not French suited, though it has a Heart suit, nor is it Italian suited, though there are swords on a few cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Truth be told this deck does not come from any place in the world you know, this is a deck from another place altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Detestable Deck is a fantasy deck, for fantasy games, and the cartomancy of fictional peoples. But here it is today, in your very real world, and resting... waiting... for your very real hands... So what are you to do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Detestable Deck is a collection of 2 identical 36 card decks and a set of rules that will let you use them to play the kind of unique gambling game that may have evolved in worlds without the decks you know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck comes packaged with rules for playing the titular game Detestable plus all the gold colored chips and dice that game requires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
