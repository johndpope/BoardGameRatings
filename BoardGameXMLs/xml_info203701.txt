							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saga of the Elder City 1: Random City State Events</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement is devoted to turning your game&amp;rsquo;s largest fantasy city into an epic locale for adventure. This book is not about running encounters with people, beasts, or monsters, specifically (although I have developed tables for those topics as well). Rather, it is designed to fill your game with random events and witnessed scenes of interest, where the adventuring Player Characters might choose to do something completely random which leads to an evening of unpredictable play. These events could each easily lead into further urban adventures, criminal misbehavior, rough-and-tumble melees, amusing roleplaying scenes, or haunting moments of pure atmosphere. Using this book as an improvisatory idea engine, the Game Master can turn a boring and lifeless city (e.g., one which is never described in game any more than, &amp;quot;You guys need to heal for seven days before you can go back into the dungeon&amp;quot;) into an intriguing destination that your players will learn to love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
