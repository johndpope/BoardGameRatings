			<description>A card and dicing game for two players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Money Baseball is divided into two phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase One - The draft.  Each player gets 100 dollars to spend on drafting a team of players.  The player card deck is shuffled and the first five cards are laid out.  Each player card is assigned a position, a set of statistics and a minimum bid amount.  The players draft a team of baseball players (at least nine, to fill every position, but bench players are encouraged) by bidding against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase Two - The game.  Players field their teams and roll dice to determine the outcome of each at bat.  Play begins with a pitcher's roll, which is checked against a results chart.  Play then continues with a batter's roll and a fielder's roll (if necessary).  Play follows normal professional baseball rules.  The game can continue for either 3 or 9 innings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
