			<description>For any number of players. Players used a spinner to race each other to the finish and collect &amp;ldquo;gift&amp;rdquo; cards along the way. &lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;All Present cards are shuffled, and divided equally among the players. The players all use the same piece, spinning the indicator, and starting from Santa Claus' head-quarters, they moving the piece called Santa Claus, in turn, until he is carried over the entire road, and back to his home again. &lt;br/&gt;At the end of player's move, if Santa Claus stops at a house, the player takes the presents called for, from his pack of Present cards, and lays them aside. A player may not always have all the presents called for and, in that case, he lays aside all that he can. &lt;br/&gt;When a player lands on dot marked &amp;quot;Go Back to Fourth House&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Seminary&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Orphan's Home&amp;quot; Santa Claus is placed back, as directed, and the player delivers the presents called for, and Santa Claus starts on his travels again, from that place, as before. &lt;br/&gt;The player who first runs out of &amp;quot;Present cards&amp;quot; or the player who has the smallest number of &amp;quot;Present cards&amp;quot; in his hand, after Santa Claus has reached his home again, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;Components: spinner, 20 cards (pairs of 10 different), and one wood game piece (Santa Claus).&lt;br/&gt;Size: 15&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More about the box design:&lt;br/&gt;In the 19th century, Americans fell in love with Santa Claus. Clement Moore first published his poem &amp;ldquo;An Account of a Visit From Saint Nicholas,&amp;rdquo; which he originally wrote for his daughters, Margaret, Charity, and Mary, in 1823.&lt;br/&gt;German immigrant Thomas Nast who created the familiar image of the white-bearded man in the red suit that was reinterpreted by unknown artists for these box tops. During the Civil War, Nast drew on the German tradition of Saint Nicholas for a Harper&amp;rsquo;s Weekly cover depicting Santa Claus as a &amp;ldquo;spirit of Christmas&amp;rdquo; visiting lonely soldiers in camp. The image proved to be a turning point in the popularity of Santa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
