			<description>Top Deer is a race game in which 2-4 players try and breed and race the best reindeer for Santa's sleigh team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chief stablemaster at Santa's North Pole lair has announced his upcoming retirement, and Santa is holding a contest to decide who to promote. Whoever can win the most races - or most-accurately pick the fastest reindeer most consistently - will get the top job, but there are a number of less-than-nice-list tactics your opponents might employ to bump your career off the track!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each reindeer is represented by a hand of five regular French-deck playing cards. In each race player stack these cards in a pre-determined order and turn them over to move their reindeer around the track; after each race players have a chance to selectively breed the best traits from their current reindeer into the next generation of racers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Top Deer is a single-sheet game that doesn't need any construction and just requires a few tokens per player and a couple of decks of cards, intended to be included in a Christmas card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
