							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Pfadfinderspiel: Wir wollten mal auf Gro√üfahrt gehen</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Scouts play - We wanted to go to Great ride&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;A game for two to four players of game Author Jens Karkosz calls strategy and luck equally, offers fun, wit and the original illustrations by Michael Brux. Karkosz processed years of experience as a child and group manager in this game. So its clear-ambiguous allusions hit precisely the special atmosphere that can only offer a large warehouse.&lt;br/&gt;Cubs, scouts and rovers are thrilled - Head infected by gambling fever. Thus, &amp;quot;The Scouts play&amp;quot; holds real potential for cult game and permanent companion in camp. But also a must for those who can not wait for the next camp and seeking to shorten the days of the year to do it again big ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I try to describe the game:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to win six scout badge. The badge I get through certain cards or by completing tasks. These tasks are also on the cards.&lt;br/&gt;First, by the nature of the character cards of the players is determined. Then, each player receives two cards preparation, 2 storage cards and 2 equipment cards. These 6 cards are my cards in hand. The entire card will be divided into three types (preparation, storage and equipment) set ready as separate pile.&lt;br/&gt;By pulling the card out of these stacks, the game evolves and I can by completing tasks or by the pull of certain cards to collect the required badge.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever collects the first six badges, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
