			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Of the Flesh, the characters are tormented undead, fighting to return to normal after an infection has ruined the world. Each has suffered from a horrible disease ripping them from the living world, but not laid it to rest completely. Some undead have languished for decades, while others have returned from the grave, unsure of how much time has past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After years of penance, these undead creatures want nothing more than to be whole again. But the world is a darker version of its old self. The streets are littered with reminders of the fight to stay alive. Boarded up windows. Checkpoints. Armed guards. People are wary of anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t right. Passing for human among skeptics and hunters isn&amp;rsquo;t easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But how can humanity be found in this detritus? How can something reclaim its humanity without losing all that remains?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Praxis is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters into dramatic situations and is based on the principles of the Protocol game system. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start-points, roles, plot twists, and finales. Praxis does not play like a traditional roleplaying game. It does not require a gamemaster. There is no script. No endpoint. No cumbersome or extraneous mechanics detracting from the story. An entire epic can be played in under four hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
