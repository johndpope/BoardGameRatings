			<description>Morbid Curiosity is a unique party game that creates a delightfully dark evening with friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using trivia and conversation cards, players explore and ignite their curiosity about the greatest mystery of all &amp;ndash; death. Contains 162 cards... all of them about death. Takes only minutes to learn to play, provides hours of curious, deep, and irreverent conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morbid Curiosity is not a harsh look at your own mortality, or some delicate, awkward conversation about the end of life. Rather, it is a unique, well crafted game that lets people look at death while having a good time. So kick off your shoes, sit down, and get to know Death a little better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn a player (the reader) draws a card from either the conversation deck or the trivia deck and reads it aloud for the group to answer. Trivia cards are awarded to the player who gives the correct answer, for conversation cards the reader chooses their favourite answer. The first person to collect 7 cards wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
