							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Holdenshire Chronicles Act One: The Ills of Hengistbury</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the county of Holdenshire. The villages of Hengistbury and Thornbury are peaceful, but  odd things have been happening of late. Strange things are afoot in the Weirwood; howls have been heard from the Fogmoor; and what's going on over at Murray's Folly?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A county and a dozen quests make up this sandboxy adventure for the WOIN roleplaying game system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jack of the Wierwood. Children are being lured into the Weirwood by satyrs under the control of Spring-Heeled Jack, who intends to perform a ritual to bring a blight across the county.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hound of Fogmoor. A werewolf dwells on the Fogmoor, primarily preying on frogfolk, but is moving closer and closer to human populated areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troll Under the Bridge. A troll lives under a bridge near Thornbury and is attacking travelers. Most escape because, strangely, the troll does not pursue those who run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memories of Brockendale. A poltergeist haunts the ruins of Brockendale Castle. Deep within can be found the scabbard of Lord Pemberton&amp;rsquo;s sword&amp;mdash;a scabbard that will be essential if the heroes are to defeat the dragon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frog's Lament. The Cavernsnappers, a particularly aggressive tribe of frogfolk, have been attacking fisherman, and recently claimed half a dozen more victims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escort Service. Village blacksmith Rorus Klain has a shipment of masterwork daggers which need to be sent upriver to the neighboring county of Lancashire, but there have been reports of bandits. He needs someone to protect the shipment as it makes its three-day journey to the border of Holdenshire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pandora's Box. The Mortimer brothers have obtained a curious box and have made the mistake of opening it. Unfortunately, the box is designed to summon a rather bad-tempered raskillon devil called Kazyk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manhunter. Brand Torek needs help to apprehend a pickpocket named Tila, who just escaped from her Hengistbury jail cell. She&amp;rsquo;s had a one-hour head start, and the clock is ticking!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Safari. Tales of a strange creature roaming the hills northeast of Brockendale Castle have attracted the attention of local veterinarian Albert Wright who sees this as an opportunity to make his dreams come true by capturing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Troublemakers. Another adventuring party has shown up in Thornbury, and have been nothing but trouble. No one is quite sure why they are here or what they want, but they would definitely prefer them to conduct their business and leave&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peculiar, Most Peculiar. Something odd is happening at a place called Murray&amp;rsquo;s Folly. No one is exactly sure what, but some of the local residents in Thornbury are worried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblins of Thornbury. Gobins attack, and steal away young men and women from the village! Is this a random attack, or is the valley feeling the taloned influence of the dragon of Skull Mountain?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
