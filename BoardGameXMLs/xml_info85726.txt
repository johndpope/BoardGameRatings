			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No longer must a character's past and present be one in the same. Now you can play a rags-to-riches beggar-turned-fighter, a soldier who has taken up the ways of a ranger, a lifelong criminal who has changed his ways, or a lonely scholar seeking out adventure. Add new depth to your characters with Background Levels! Inside this book you will find information on 14 different backgrounds with which to enhance your character's past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you tired of shallow 1st-level characters? Do you wish that the background you developed for your character could have some game effect beyond a few ranks in a skill or two? Do you wonder why an aristocratic fighter receives the same amount of money as one who grew up on the streets?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this 33-page PDF, your character's background can have real game effects, even at 1st level. Perhaps your wizard was once a craftsman's apprentice, or comes from a merchant family. Maybe your cleric grew up in the saddle, or on the seas. Background Levels allows the details to truly become a part of your character. What's more, a character can opt to &amp;quot;go back to his roots&amp;quot; and advance levels in his background!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
