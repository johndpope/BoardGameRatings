			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure is designed for characters in their first or second career, and has been written in a descriptive style that would allow a first time GM to get a feel of the Warhammer world without having to do too much additional work themselves. Having said that, an experienced GM should be able to alter the adventure without too much effort so that it presents more of a challenge to advanced characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adventure is set in the aftermath of the Storm of Chaos and can be played during any journey to or from Middenheim; the village involved is an inconspicuous one and so can be placed at a suitable point along the journey. Again, with a little work, the timing and setting can be altered to suit a GM's needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
