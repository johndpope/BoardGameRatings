			<description>Each player begins the game with a set of tiles. Each set contains every letter of the alphabet with the vowels repeated for a total of thirty one. Players alternate turns playing tiles in a three-by-three grid. Players score for each two and three letter word they make during their turns. The player with the most points when both players have used all their tiles is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
