			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters in the game are theater managers trying to produce a play.  The game involves, principally, budgeting dollars though that is not the main rationale for performing the play as it is expected to (hopefully) just break even.  The game uses a series of decision points followed by random event resolution.  Thus, money can be spent to give better odds in subsequent stages; though money must also be budgeted for future events.  The game is set up to allow for solitaire play though a mechanism does allow for multiple theater managers to play in tandem - operating, as it were, competing venues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
