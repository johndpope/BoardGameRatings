							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Counties of Britain</name>
									
			<description>Counties of Britain consists of groups of cards representing various counties of Britain. A group is comprised of a key card, listing all the towns (or districts) of a county, as well as a card for each of the listed towns, each having an illustration of the town and interesting, town-specific facts about industry, attractions or population.&lt;br/&gt;Players compete to complete groups of cards, thus having a full county. The player who completes the most counties wins the game. In this sense, the game plays like 'go fish'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was sponsored by the London and North Eastern Railway of the time and has reproductions of famous railway posters on the back of each card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counties of Britain is similar to Counties of England, also published by John Jaques of London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
