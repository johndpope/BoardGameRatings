			<description>Lunch Swap week has been declared! You and your friends gather around the table each day, trade lunches, try avoiding getting the worst lunch each day, while still accomplishing your dessert goals. At the end of the week a Lunch Swap winner is declared!  &lt;br/&gt;The game is played over five rounds. On their turn a player plays a single card. Once each player has 5 cards in front of them the game is over. Players then tally their score to determine a winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
