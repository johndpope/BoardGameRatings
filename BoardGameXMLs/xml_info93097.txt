			<description>From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty years ago, Hanse Davion and Melissa Steiner were joined in holy matrimony, reflecting on a personal level the joining of their two realms. The superstate formed through the union of the Federated Suns and the Lyran Commonwealth was meant to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity, eventually leading to the creation of a new Star League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But it was not to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now the eldest children of Hanse and Melissa are battling for control of their parents' legacy. This sourcebook details the long struggle between Victor Steiner-Davion and his sister Katherine, a struggle which raged across two realms and affected many others. Complete unit listings and wave maps show the progression of the war from its initial sparks to its devastating conclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BattleTech expansion uses the same format used in earlier expansions that detail major conflicts within the Inner Sphere. At 216 pages it was the largest expansion for BattleTech that had been produced at the time. In addition to giving descriptions of the various battles within the war and the associated Clan Jade Falcon invasion, it provides details of all th eunits involved and rules on running games and campaigns set within this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
