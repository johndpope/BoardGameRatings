			<description>You go around the city several times with your pawn to get Aliens tokens which score most points of influence, so you can become the Master of Kurios&amp;iuml;t.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player will have to move cunningly his pawn around the edge of the board to get Aliens tokens scoring most points, without neglecting the others, that can be used to make some special moves (see in front page, the special actions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On every turn, the players will necessarily have to move their pawns from at least one space to be able to get an Alien token. If you think it is not interesting to take the token, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to. Because every time a token is taken, another one is going to move on to its space and if this last one is very interesting it is the player behind who may get it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
