			<description>Fallout: Adventures is a fan made card game set in the Fallout universe. Players traverse the lands of post-apocalyptic United States of America, visiting places known from all of the Fallout games. During their adventure, players will meet familiar characters from the game, create teams of followers and gather equipment to aid them in their quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features all original art by Oskar Potocki, which immitates the style of the PIP Boy 2000 in-game display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-4 players start the game by selecting their starting characters and equipment. The health of characters and the condition of equipment is determined by placing a D6 dice on the card with the amount of pips showing the current state of the character/equipment. Players also choose their starting perks, and mission cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Missions comprise of three elements: the mission, location and faction (i.e. Fight Ghouls at Tenpenny Tower). Each part of the mission has a check that must be completed by the player in order to complete the mission. If the player can't meet the conditions of the check, they can flee and discard the mission (then they choose a new one). Most of the checks are die rolls which use dice from a wide range i.e. D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 and D20.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player parties traverse the radioactive lands of North America. The game map shows most of the locations from all of the Fallout games. Locations are interconnected by roads used by players to travel from one site to the other by means of spending action points. Each location lists all of the actions that can be performed there, ie. Trade, Gamble, Easy/Medium/Hard Mission, rest etc. A player may perform one of the actions in their current location, before their turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travelling through locations, players will gather followers, who can be recruited in a number of ways, but most often by means of selecting a recruit action if it is available at the party's current location. Players will purchase party members with caps (the game's currency) and add them to their play area. A D6 dice will be then placed on the follower card, showing their current state of health. Players will also gain equipment the same way and will also level up their characters in order to prepare their team for the final mission. The final mission is hard to complete and will require a trully great ensemble of characters which are well equipped and levelled up in order to complete the assignment. Once a player completes their final mission, they win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
