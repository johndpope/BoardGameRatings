			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's you against a barrage of enemy lazers that are aimed at your ammo dumps.  Sight in on the targets and score as many hits as you dare.  As your skill increases so does the difficulty - (10 levels to select).  This is an arcade-style game with great graphics and sound effects.  A must!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole West Coast is being bombarded and only you can save it.  You are at the controls of the missile launcher and hold the destiny of our country in your hands.  It takes a cool head, hot hand and fast reflexes to zap those missiles right out of the air.  Get ready to pulverize - atomize and vaporize them.  Oh, those warheads are heading right for our ammo dumps.  They are everywhere.  No one can save us - except you.  You must move your laser into position and fire as fast as you dare.  Time limit with arcade style excitement.  Protect your ammo at all costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially marketed as Lazer-Attack, the game was renamed to Target Command shortly after release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
