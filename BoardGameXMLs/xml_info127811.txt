							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thinking Races: Diverse Humanity</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thinking Races Series provides new takes on the familiar races of fantasy gaming, and over the course of the line, will introduce several dozen new player races and sub-races to the game. This volume takes a look at the most familiar (yet least described) fantasy race: Humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans are among the greatest summoners and magic users in history, ascending to arcane mastery in a single lifetime; while many of the longer lived races require generations, or even centuries to make similar discoveries. From the moment of their birth, the ambitious human race is ascending towards something greater. Great liches and powerful, god-touched heroes hail from the various races of mankind with greater reliability than they do from among the other races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Thinking Races PDF gives you new things to do with the &amp;quot;same old&amp;quot; humans! Various tribes that exist with the Human family are presented here, along with new racial traits, civilizations, Gods, feats and flavor. You'll never play the same-old Human again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
