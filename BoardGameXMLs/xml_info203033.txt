			<description>Luck &amp;amp; Logic (ラクエンロジック Raku en Rojikku) or Lucklogi (ラクロジ Rakuroji) is the newest trading card game by Bushiroad. It was first released in Japanese on January 28th, 2016 and in English on June 24th, 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luck &amp;amp; Logic is a two-player card game. Players are able to call allies, known as members, to the battlefield. By using the power of trance to combine regular humans called Logicalists and creatures from alternate worlds called Foreigners, players are able to call on Tranceunions to defeat their opponents and their differing logic!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players build two decks to play with, utilizing cards from the trial/starter decks and booster packs: a 50 battle deck and a 10 card Gate deck.  At the beginning of each game, players shuffle the Gate deck and place 6 randomly face down. Players then take turns utilizing the characters and tactics of their main deck to defend the 6 gates.  First player to have 6 destroyed gates loses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
