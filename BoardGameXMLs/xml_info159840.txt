			<description>Explore The World is a board game journey that takes players all around the man-made world vs. the natural world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to be the first player to make a round trip back to his/her start square.  Players advance around the board by correctly answering from the Question Cards or by following the directions on the Travel Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The type of card used on a turn is determined by the flick of a spinner.  Play continues clockwise around the table, with each player taking only one turn at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
