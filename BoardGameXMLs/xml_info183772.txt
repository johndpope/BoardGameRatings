			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Car chases and heroic battles atop speeding vehicles have always been a staple of action movies, and it seemed only fitting that a game like Inquisitor should be able to do something like this. Graham McNeill takes a look at how you can use vehicles in your games of Inquisitor.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A PDF supplement for Inquisitor covering vehicle rules. This was originally published as an article in Fanatic but was later made available as a separate PDF for free download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
