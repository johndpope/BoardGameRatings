			<description>This game is played with a standard deck of cards. The game consists of three phases as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Melds. In Phase 1 you both try to improve your hands by bidding for new cards from the stock. When none remain in stock, you score for any melds (card combinations) contained in your revised hands. This phase is rather like Gops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Tricks. In Phase 2 you play out your revised hands to 13 tricks, aiming especially to win an odd number of tricks (1, 3, 5 etc). This phase is rather like Piquet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Play-off. Finally, you each pick up as a new hand the 13 cards you used for bidding in the first phase, and aim to be the first to play out all the cards from your hand. This phase is rather like Arsehole / President / Trouduc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
