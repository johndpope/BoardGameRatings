							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Black and Tan War</name>
									
			<description>Black &amp;amp; Tan War is an historical simulation of the Irish War of Independence, 1919-1921. Each player has a unique deck of cards that &amp;ldquo;drives&amp;rdquo; nearly all game procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAP: Map depicts all of Ireland divided into 16 different regions (plus Dublin)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCALE: Operational. Turns are bi-monthly. Irish units represent 12-100 men. British units are army battalions, auxiliary police companies, and local constabulary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS: Two decks of 55 cards each, 22&amp;rdquo; x 34&amp;rdquo; map, 280 &amp;frac12;&amp;rdquo; counters, 77 5/8&amp;rdquo; counters, 24 page rulebook, and 3 player aid cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPLEXITY: Medium. Somewhere between We the People and Wilderness War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player controls the forces of the British Crown &amp;ndash; regular battalions of the Royal Army, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), its elite Auxiliary Division, and the English &amp;ldquo;Black &amp;amp; Tans&amp;rdquo; who filled the RIC&amp;rsquo;s vacant ranks as native Irish policemen resigned from the force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card in the Crown Player&amp;rsquo;s deck may be played for 5 different purposes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) To conduct Operations with a number of units determined by the card&amp;rsquo;s value. These can be Patrols that aim to &amp;ldquo;show the flag&amp;rdquo; and catch the foe unawares; small-scale Raids to capture known or suspected Republican activists; and large-scale military Roundups intended to encircle and trap guerrilla units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) To cause an Event, of which there are many different types, including: Army Reinforcements, Blockade, Spies, Black &amp;amp; Tans, Motorization, Armored Cars, Mass Arrests, the RAF, and various new laws &amp;ndash; just to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) To recruit an Informer in one of the three regions listed on the card. These greatly boost the effectiveness of local Crown operations &amp;ndash; and impede the activities of Republican guerrillas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crown forces other than the Irish-born RIC may take revenge for guerrilla attacks and the generally hostile attitude of the natives by destroying civilian property. Such &amp;lsquo;reprisals&amp;rsquo; can play a significant role in eroding both the British and Irish peoples&amp;rsquo; will to continue the struggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
