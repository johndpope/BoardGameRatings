							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spin for Sin</name>
									
			<description>Players spin a spinner to select a category (&amp;quot;Sexy Sayings&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Gidgets and Gadgets&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fantasies&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Opponents Choice&amp;quot;).  The opponent then draws a card with a phrase on it and must list out the number of words and letters with a series of dashes as if it were a game of hangman.  The player then gets to select five letters of the alphabet, which the opponent must write in place in the phrase (if applicable).  The player then gets an opportunity to guess the phrase. If successful, the player gets five points.  If not, the player has the opportunity to select more letters, but decreasing the number of points awarded.  The first player to 20 points wins, and is entitled to cash in a &amp;quot;Fantasy favor&amp;quot; check.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phrases range from flirtatious to naughty but manage to avoid obscenity.  This 'adult' game is for two, however there are references in the rules to &amp;quot;team&amp;quot; play as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
