			<description>From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Island of Kesmai was an early commercial online game in the MUD genre, innovative in its use of roguelike pseudo-graphics. It is considered a major forerunner of modern MMORPGs.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;After logging into Compuserve and selecting to play Island of Kesmai, the user was allowed to create a character. After creating a character, the next step was to enter the chat room. From the chat room, the user could enter the virtual world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game interface was two dimensional and scrolled unless you downloaded and installed a GUI. The interface has often been called roguelike in that it borrowed features of game-play from a game called Rogue. The game used a Dungeons and Dragons-like turn-based play. Players moved in tiles on a grid utilizing short commands or key presses. Items could be found on the floor of the dungeon as symbols &amp;mdash; as could mobs to fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the notable game play systems was the ability to perform quests for various rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
