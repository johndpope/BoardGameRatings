							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Poles and Russians</name>
									
			<description>Abstract game for two players. One takes the Pole playing pieces, the other the Russians. The Poles are lighter in appearance, the Russians darker. Each player puts his men on the spaces marked with an X on his side of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to capture all your opponent's pieces.The men move forwards (or sideways I suspect but the rules are not clear on this) one space at a time. The Captains can move backwards or forwards. No Captains are in play at the start. You capture men by jumping over them, as in Draughts or Checkers. When either player gets a man into the Battlefield (up the centre of the board) that man is changed into a Captain and is placed at the uppermost spot on the outside of the board. Now he can move backwards or forwards but still only one space at a time (unless jumping to capture). Capturing must be done if you are in place to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
