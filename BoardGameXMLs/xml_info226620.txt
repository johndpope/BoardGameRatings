							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Feaster from Afar</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cottage has for some years now been the focus of the activities of one Alan Westinghouse, a Cultist from London. He is the leader of a small but dedicated band of people who are determined to open a gateway for their master, Hastur the Unspeakable. In doing so, he must however provide nourishment for his Lord, through the avatar the Feaster from Afar. To this end, Westinghouse has created a gateway foci for the Feaster from Afar using the cottage and a series of carvings of the Yellow Sign. Through this portal, the Feaster from Afar can travel to Earth and attack all that he finds on the hillsides of Lumb Moor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
