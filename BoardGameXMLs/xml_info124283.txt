			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;curse the darkness is a roleplaying game about loss, remembrance, and fighting for what&amp;rsquo;s really important. Part of that is deciding &amp;mdash; or discovering &amp;mdash; what&amp;rsquo;s worth fighting for. curse the darkness is a post-apocalyptic game, and as such involves themes of reclamation and building a new world from the wreckage of the old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playtest document is designed to allow you and your players to play a game of curse the darkness with minimal preparation or reading. As such, this packet uses a simplified version of the game system (not that the actual system is all that complex anyway) and a minimized version of the setting. I&amp;rsquo;ve included some of the fiction snippets that have appeared as part of the lead-up to the game, just to provide some flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
