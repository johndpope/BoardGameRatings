							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thinking Races: What Savage Beasts</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thinking Races Series provides new takes on the familiar races of fantasy gaming, and over the course of the line, will introduce several dozen new player races and sub-races to the game. This volume focuses on the most savage and brutal races in the campaign, those player races who have felt the lash of a master&amp;rsquo;s whip and know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to fight for their lives on the arena sand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clash of steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scent of blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict and pain; muscle and power. Life and death, separated only by the thin edge of a broadsword.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The savage races are defined by conflict and tempered by violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The races in this book all have one thing in common: they are all monsters of one breed or another. They battle in the arena, pitting their lives against one another for the thrill of the gathered crowd. They wage great wars and lay waste to entire kingdoms; they burn, rape and pillage where and when they choose. Some monsters in humanoid shape find work as mercenaries or rise to become savage warlords, their brutality only increasing with each new conquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power defines a monster&amp;rsquo;s existence. Might makes right makes might. The savage power in their limbs and running through their veins defines these monsters&amp;rsquo; existence, and separates them fundamentally from the more civilized races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of these savage races share a special connection to humanity. The Brass Men should have been human, until it became more profitable to transform these powerfully built slaves into something inhuman. The Deershee are a legion of cloned warriors born from human blood and ingenuity. Half Orcs are humanity&amp;rsquo;s bastard children, sometimes feared, sometimes loved. And the Vier&amp;hellip; the Vier hate us with all that is in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
