Now within these pages, he shares his findings with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riyal's Research: Haunts brings you two dozen new haunts for you to endanger your player characters' very lives. These haunts range in CR from 1 - 15 and include haunts inspired by movies and books throughout the fantasy/urban fantasy genre.
