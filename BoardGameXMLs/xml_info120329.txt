							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Battleship: Surface Thunder</name>
									
			<description>From the instruction manual&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classic game of naval strategy reaches new levels of fun and excitement in the Battleship: Surface Thunder game.  Get read for fast-paced action as you take command of your very own battleship.  In the Arcade Adventure, set sail for hostile waters where you'll fight a renegade navy intent on overthrowing a peaceful kingdom.  You'll have your hands full as you blast shore emplacements, attack shipping convoys, and match your wits with enemy ships, planes and submarines.  Power-ups will give you the health, speed and weapons you need to fight your way past enemy forces.  Also, enjoy an updated version of the classic Battleship game, where wits and strategy count for as much as sheer firepower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
