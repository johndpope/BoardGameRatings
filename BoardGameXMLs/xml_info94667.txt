							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hive Mind</name>
									
			<description>The Hive Mind has invaded!  Two to five Humans must do battle with this alien invader to save themselves and the world.  But be careful!  The Hive Mind could Infect you, and force you to fight against your former friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hive Mind is a semi-cooperative card game for three to six players.  One player uses the Hive Mind deck to fight the other players, who start the game as Humans with Human decks.  Human decks are split down the middle to have a Human side and an Infected side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hive Mind will try to attack the Humans' mental and physical health.  Once a Human's mental health is zero and his or her physical health is three, he or she becomes Infected.  An Infected character uses the Infected half of his or her cards to battle the remaining Humans and spread the infection!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans win if they locate the Hive and manage to kill the Hive Mind.  The Hive and Infected players win if all Human players have been Infected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
