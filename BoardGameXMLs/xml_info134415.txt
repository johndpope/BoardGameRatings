			<description>What is Infinite Warrior?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IW is an &amp;ldquo;infinite runner&amp;rdquo; game relying on a very graphical and cinematic experience. Using simple gestures, swiping and tapping, the player controls a character as he walks down a battlefield and defeats endless wave of enemies, collects gold, and raises his highscore, shared with the world via GameCenter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is Infinite Warrior so different?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphically, IW is presented in full 3d with high resolution environments and characters. The characters&amp;rsquo; animations are also recorded with Motion Capture, performed by Hollywood Stunt Actors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also features Voice Over and very orchestra like music.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay wise, instead of dodging obstacles by jumping, sliding, strafing or flying above/under, the player follows cues appearing on screen to have his Warrior dispatch the enemies. When the player performs the right swiping motion, he is rewarded by a cinematic sequence, featuring slow-motion and movies like cameras panning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How much content is in Infinite Warrior?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At launch, IW will feature 4 locations (unique background settings), with a &amp;ldquo;night&amp;rdquo; version for each location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, one location will be unlocked and the 3 other locations will have to be discovered during gameplay. When the other locations are unlocked, the player has to spend soft currency (gold coins picked during gameplay or earned by completing quests), to &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo; and play on these locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player&amp;rsquo;s character can also be equipped with 8 different costumes, with different pieces of equipment that are used as Bonuses: 6 Swords, 8 Helms, and 8 Shields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
