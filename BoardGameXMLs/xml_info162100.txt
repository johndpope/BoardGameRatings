							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Modern Home II</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part two of a larger collection of modern homes for use with any modern gaming system. This is a four bedroom, two and a half bath, two story modern home set in a rural suburban neighborhood meant to be used in any generic setting, up to and including the break out of an apocalypse of some sort. Perhaps this home is occupied by one or more of your players and they must defend themselves against attack by their enemies who have hunted them to their own sanctuary? Or perhaps the players themselves are hunting someone and have tracked that individual here, to this house. Maybe your players are surviving the early stages of a zombie apocalypse and you need a house for them to scavenge supplies (...and encounter a few zombies...) in? Whatever your needs, any modern setting needs houses, which is what the Modern Homes series is all about. Stay tuned for more homes (big and small) in the near future!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     15&amp;quot; x 20&amp;quot; in size. Perfectly sized for any playing surface!&lt;br/&gt;     HEX and SQUARE grids for each type of map listed below, as well as a NO GRID version for people that prefer to set their own scale. Grid sizes are 1&amp;quot; = 5' of gaming space.&lt;br/&gt;     Full Color Version &amp;ndash; This is a printer intensive, full color version of this map.&lt;br/&gt;     Black and White version &amp;ndash; A black and white version, meant to be the least printer intensive.&lt;br/&gt;     Daytime lighting complete with shadows to give the map depth.&lt;br/&gt;     VTT Map - Sized for use with any virtual table top software.  Both the first and second floors are included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
