							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War of the Dead: Chapter One (Collected)</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHERE WERE YOU ON THE DAY THE EARTH DIED?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unexplained cataclysm is infecting the world. Millions are dying and rising as flesh-consuming ghouls. Entire cities are roaming graveyards, and even the countryside is overrun with creatures in search of living flesh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin in the first days of the outbreak, trapped aboard the maiden voyage of a state-of-the-art cruise ship that quickly becomes a floating graveyard. As you manage to escape back to land, the world around you is just about dead. The military can&amp;rsquo;t stop the spread of the infection, the government has relocated to the Rocky Mountains, and those remaining are banding together for survival - some seeking safety in numbers and others seeking to use their numbers to overpower and dominate the weak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you survive in a world looking to eat you and turn you into another walking corpse? Can you trust other survivors not to kill you and take your supplies?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More importantly - when you discover something that could save the world, will you be strong enough to deliver it to the right people?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;War of the Dead as a four-chapter adventure series that takes you from the first stages of the outbreak, and all the way into a world forever war torn and changed by the advancement of the Living Dead!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
