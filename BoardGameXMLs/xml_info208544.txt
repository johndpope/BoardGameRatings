							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Red Shield &amp; Gold Eagle</name>
									
			<description>A Roleplaying Game of the Napoleonic Wars&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Shield &amp;amp; Gold Eagle fills...an enormous gap in the world of roleplaying, specifically, a game which encourages adventure in the age of Napoleon. Be advised that this game is only a supplement, and not a complete game in itself. It is designed to be compatible with Swordsmen &amp; Skeletons, Swords &amp; Wizardry, Labyrinth Lord, other, similar clones of the Original roleplaying rules and, of course, Dungeons &amp; Dragons (Original Edition). It is also compatible, with minor adjustments, with other editions of Dungeons and Dragons, and similar games. You will need at least one such roleplaying game to make use of Red Shield &amp;amp; Gold Eagle. As such, this book contains only the rules and campaign suggestions as are helpful in modifying one of the above listed rule sets for play in the Napoleonic Era. We will not give rules or descriptions on such roleplaying necessities as the use of polyhedral dice, encounter tables, descriptions of spells, magic items and equipment, except as such things are modified for this setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note also that Red Shield &amp;amp; Gold Eagle is not a fantasy roleplaying game as such. It is more &amp;quot;Hollywood historical&amp;quot;. Characters cannot fly, but sometimes make daring leaps that stretch the bounds of credulity. No magic items or spells exist, but Charlatans certainly do, and some of the things they can accomplish with their mesmeric powers is pretty amazing. Don&amp;rsquo;t despair, however, if you are a big fan of vorpal swords and rings of  invisibility, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find enough adventurous analogues to keep you happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[A] fantasy supplement for Red Shield &amp;amp; Gold Eagle [is] located in the appendix to these rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
