			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past week, three young couples from across the village have gone missing! The most recent pair to disappear were seen exiting the town together, walking hand-in-hand. A skilled ranger has discovered their tracks lead all the way to the entrance of Heartplunge Cavern! Worried family members and local authorities beg anyone capable to help find the lost youths, and discover what led them to such a dangerous place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't Get Struck By Kulpid's Arrow!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kulpids - that is, kobolds that have been transformed into fiends - run amok in Heartplunge Cavern. These winged demons can cause all kinds of chaos - humanoids shot by their arrows may fall deeply in love with the next person they see! Statistics for kulpids and another new monster are provided in Breaking Hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
