			<description>from Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Vito's been shot. His blood splatters your faces and hands as you apply pressure, desperate for the Capofamiglia to&lt;br/&gt;hold on just a bit longer, until the ambulance can get here. The gunmen were well armed, and well informed, hitting him leaving his private apartment on the way to the sit-down: there was nothing you could do. It was lucky that more of you weren't caught in the flying death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sirens approach, but his blood covers the curb, his breath is ragged. Vito is gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The king is dead, and your enemies will act swiftly. Some for power, some for revenge, some simply seeking to take what's yours. Tonight a wave of blood and retribution will flow into the streets, and the new king will be coroneted in blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This is a non-linear game with no predetermined outcomes or plot path: the decisions the characters make will determine entirely what happens in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Intra-party conflict is expected, as those with different agendas determine who's way is right, and who will be left bleeding&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;This one-shot scenario uses a modified form of the system from The Mountain Witch.  Familiarity with the mechanics used in that game are recommended by the designer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
