							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rocketship Dynasties</name>
									
			<description>Rocketship Dynasties puts you in control of a dynasty of decadent hedonists. Played on a board made of hex-tiles, players must settle, develop and defend colonies while breeding children and researching new technology, all in the pursuit of victory points. The first player to acquire 15 wins. Each dynasty has it's own special abilities, the mastery of which is the key to victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tone of the game is irreverent and strange. The family members which can be acquired are largely portrayed as inept hedonists, while the technologies have a retro flavor to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Battles are fought by rolling dice, with special abilities granted by certain technologies and occasionally even family members. The game can be played totally peacefully, and combat is usually a risk to both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
