			<description>There are six boards showing the 6 continents (Australia also shows Indonesia and Papua New Guinea). The boards show the maps of the areas. With each boards comes a set of tiles that can be placed on to the map to form a grip. These tiles show a nice drawn version of the map in front (with some scenes and tourist attractions of the area) and on the back there is a reference to cities or other landmarks corresponding to the tiles place on the board. &lt;br/&gt;Each player now gets a board and tiles, shuffle the tiles and start to be the first to complete the grid. If you do this by the front side (puzzling) or by the backside (looking for the places and using the front only to see where its correct) is up to you. Player finishing first wins. Of course, everybody should play with every continent.&lt;br/&gt;And of course, quite a lot of the countries have changed since this game was published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
