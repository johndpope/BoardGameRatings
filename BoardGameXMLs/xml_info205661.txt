							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hannibal: Terror of Rome</name>
									
			<description>Hannibal: Terror of Rome covers the epic wars waged from 230 to 201 BC by the two superpowers of the Ancient World: Carthage and Rome.  You will be able to relive the Second Punic War and the face-off between Hannibal with his elephants and the Roman general Scipio Africanus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannibal: Terror of Rome offers a comprehensive level of detail and historical accuracy. This is a true simulation that puts you in the place of the main commanders of the Ancient World. You&amp;rsquo;re in charge of building, managing, organizing and maneuvering armies, whilst taking into account the economic, military and political situation. And do not forget that other factions are following their own interests and are likely to join conflicts or take benefits from the wars you will wage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion is particularly focused on the smaller states and tribes (Capua, Taranto, Macedonia, Numidia, Syracuse, and Gallic and Hispanic tribes) which were key allies to the biggest factions vying for supremacy in multiple theaters of operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the successful and well-know AGE engine, Hannibal: Terror of Romeis a turn-based strategy game with one turn corresponding to one month. The map depicts the Western part of the Mediterranean with the cities, mines, roads, fortifications, realms and tribes of this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are hundreds of historical leaders, units, options, events (hypothetical or real), and five campaigns from 230 to 201 BC that ensure hundreds of hours of gameplay in the solo or PBEM multiplayer modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannibal: Terror of Romeis a stand-alone expansion and does not require Alea Jacta Est to run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
