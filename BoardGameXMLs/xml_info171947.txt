							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Easy Business</name>
									
			<description>In Big Easy Business, 2-4 players are aspiring business moguls in New Orleans buying up businesses and attracting tourists in order to prove their savvy and best the competition. They must compete to buy and utilize nightclubs, popular restaurants, tourist attractions, trinket shops, street bands, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players begin the game as one of several possible businesses, all with unique abilities. During a round, custom dice are rolled to create the action pool for all players. As players take their turns, they select a die for its action and execute it. Depending on what you choose, you'll be attracting tourists or cashing them out, buying new businesses (with new abilities), hiring new employees, etc. Combine that with blocking opponents out of actions, taking advantages of citywide events, and playing in a high-stakes poker game using the tableau you build...and you have Big Easy Business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
