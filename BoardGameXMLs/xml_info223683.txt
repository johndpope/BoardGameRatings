							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">No Mercy</name>
									
			<description>Based on the card game &amp;quot;War&amp;quot;, but with a twist. Take part in the epic battle between gun-toting kitties and power-hungry aliens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have ever played the game of &amp;quot;War&amp;quot;, then No Mercy will be instantly familiar. &amp;quot;No Mercy&amp;quot; follows the same game mechanics, in which each player turns over the top card of their deck, and the player with the highest card wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there is a twist: the player with the lowest number has the option to pull the facedown card from the top of the modifier deck; modifiers can add or take away from your card's number, and can also be an action that has a positive or negative result on your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with war, the winner is the first person to lose all their cards, or, optionally, the player with the largest deck when a time limit is reached.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each card contains an imaginative drawing by the children's book illustrator and comic artist Travis Hanson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
