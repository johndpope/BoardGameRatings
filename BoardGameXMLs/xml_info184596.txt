			<description>Let's Race Home is a roll-and-move game with a Puppy in My Pocket theme. It is included in an issue of the British children's magazine Sparkle World. Players represent puppies trying to get home.  Each player starts in the center of a spiral track and rolls a die to move forward on the track. Most spaces on the track are color-coded.  Players consult the key at the bottom of the board to find out if they move forward or backward or gain or lose turns. Near the end of the track, it splits in two, and each player follows a separate path, but both paths are identical so game play is not affected. The first player to reach the end of the track wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
