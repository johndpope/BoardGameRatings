			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TW2 &amp;ndash; Path to Windy Peak is this week&amp;rsquo;s offering in Filbar. With their first adventure under their belts, the newfound associate Gelbo Green, needs to get his alchemist shop back in order AND find some needed supplies for his potion business. As he can&amp;rsquo;t do both he has asked the party that saved his shop if they would be interested in an ingredient search. He has offered a comfortable sum and has described the items he is need of. Will your party help the Gnome out?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 5th Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Wagovian Campaign, but is easily adaptable to most any game and system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
