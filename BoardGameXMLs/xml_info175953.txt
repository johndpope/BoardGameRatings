							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Wander</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WANDER THE WORLD! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It stretches and winds through the Ninth World, seeking unknowable facets of a landscape already touched by the dangerous refuse of the past.  The Wandering Walk is a path known only to a few and trekked only by the brave and the foolish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wander is a supplement for Numenera detailing strange locations, unfathomable encounters, and useful equipment for those adventurers and explorers seeking the bounties of the prior worlds along the Wandering Walk.  As an extension of the Numenera corebook adventure The Beale of Boregal it is a perfect place to start for a fledgling party of explorers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included you&amp;rsquo;ll find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Four detailed sites along the Wander, including the people and places that make it special and dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;    A deck of strange encounters for embellishing on the Wandering Walk, or spicing up nearly any Numenera campaign.&lt;br/&gt;    A deck of new Cyphers for use and excavation along the Wander.&lt;br/&gt;    Four organizations that make the Wander their home, and the powers they derive from the unusual bloodscar that they develop in their travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wander represents a return to what Numenera is all about- exploring a world full of odd people, strange pseudoscientific effects, and powerful relics of the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
