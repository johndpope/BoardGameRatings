			<description>Farmlands is an old style trick-taking card game set in the ancient land of Keldabore, often played in Keldabore's murkiest pubs and taverns through the long winter months.  Farmlands pits farmer against farmer, battling for the best harvest, using a modified standard deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, one of three cards is placed on any one player's land.&amp;nbsp; When these cards are harvested, which may occur at various times throughout the game, they are removed from play and scored at game end. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple and quick, draw one card, play one card, stick it to your opponents trick-taking card game. It is a modified standard deck of cards, all the RED suites are now Crops, all the BLACK suites are now Weeds, all the FACE cards are now Workers and the JOKERS are Thieves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 separate Base Game 54 Cards decks, &amp;quot;Farmlands - Darkness &amp;amp; Ice&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Farmlands - Fire &amp;amp; Earth&amp;quot;.  Both are individually 2-4 player games, same rules, just alternate artwork and characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
