			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, all you need to have fun with a class for another few months is a few new ideas to tinker around with. Class Expansions is a series of lightweight supplements for The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that takes a base class and offers alternative class features that, handily enough, each fit on one page or less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following in this vein, Class Expansions: Barbarian Rage Powers introduces, funny how this works, twenty-one new rage powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of these descriptions as fortune cookies, but use &amp;quot;...while raging&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;...in bed&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Aligned Fury - Your attacks carry your alignment.&lt;br/&gt;     Bone-Hewing Strike - As a standard action, hew bone and stagger a foe.&lt;br/&gt;     Burning Hatred - If dealt enough damage by a single blow, your next round of raging is free... if you attack whoever hit you that hard.&lt;br/&gt;     Burning Hatred, Greater - If dealt enough damage by a single enemy, your next round of raging is free... if you attack whoever hit you that hard.&lt;br/&gt;     Crushing Blows - You treat your base attack bonus as 2 higher for the purpose of Power Attack.&lt;br/&gt;     Crushing Blows, Greater - As Crushing Blows, but 4 instead.&lt;br/&gt;     Extraplanar Embodiment - Gain a bonus to your DR, but the type changes from / - to one based on your alignment.&lt;br/&gt;     Fearful Display - Intimidate everyone in a radius around you.&lt;br/&gt;     Fury Made Placid - You gain a bonus to saving throws while using your moment of clarity rage power.&lt;br/&gt;     Grip with the Teeth - Hold onto ladders, ropes, walls, and the like with your teeth so you can use that greataxe midclimb.&lt;br/&gt;     Inexorable Advance - Treat difficult terrain as standard terrain.&lt;br/&gt;     Lingering Fear - You don't always demoralize, but when you do, the shaken effect lasts 1 round longer.&lt;br/&gt;     Momentum Charge - Leap into a charge, gaining a bonus to hit based on your Acrobatics skill.&lt;br/&gt;     Reprieve from Rage - Moment of clarity can be used for any number of consecutive rounds.&lt;br/&gt;     Schadenfreude - For one round per day, gain a temporary hit point whenever a creature is damaged.&lt;br/&gt;     Spellsiphon - Retroactively take a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; on a saving throw against a spell to be the sole target of the entire spell.&lt;br/&gt;     Swim through Anything - Swim through anything remotely liquid and substitute your Swim check for other checks used to escape the clutches of remotely liquid hazards.&lt;br/&gt;     Uncultured Savage - Resistance to art, culture, and literature-themed spells.&lt;br/&gt;     Unexpected Retaliation - Throw your melee weapon at a ranged attacker as an immediate action.&lt;br/&gt;     Unyielding Passion - The Diehard feat becomes Diehard-er.&lt;br/&gt;     Vital Blood- +2 bonus to saves against sleep effects. +2 morale bonus to damage for 1 round whenever one is resisted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
