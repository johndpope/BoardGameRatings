							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Doom and Bloom SURVIVAL!</name>
									
			<description>Doom and Bloom SURVIVAL! is a board game for 2-4 players. It takes place in a post-pandemic world where there are few survivors. Your mission is to have your character accumulate supplies like food, fuel, weapons, and medical kits, as well as scout locations that may serve as a haven in which to start over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start off in once-peaceful center city, now controlled by raiders out to get what you have. There are plenty of resources out there, but you have to get to them and survive various encounters and attacks to reach towns that have potential as safe havens. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to plan your route to include spots that have the assets you&amp;rsquo;ll need to stockpile. Some of these spots are controlled by raiders, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have to survive attacks to gain the items you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve scouted locations, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to return to center city for your family and more supplies.  You then pick a location as your final destination. If you can get there with the required supplies and survivors before anyone else, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game dynamic revolves around the management of assets while you are traveling to your destinations. You'll be tempted to use them to gain an edge in an encounter, but you have to stockpile them to be able to win the game. Different gameplay styles and a unique route traveled in each game, coupled with game-changing Bonus cards, make Doom and Bloom SURVIVAL! a fun and challenging game. It is easy to learn but has multiple levels of complexity. Originally tailored to survival enthusiasts that wanted a real survival scenario (no zombies), gametesting has shown us that the game has appeal to all gamers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
