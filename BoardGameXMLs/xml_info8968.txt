			<description>Actually, it's a &amp;quot;spin-and-move&amp;quot; game instead of &amp;quot;roll and move&amp;quot;, but that is essentially the same thing.  Players take turns moving around the board, drawing letter tiles from the face-down pile in the center of the board (the &amp;quot;alphabet soup&amp;quot;).  If they draw a letter that can be used to spell the name of one of the six animals on the board, and that letter hasn't already been placed on the board, they place the tile in the appropriate spot.  If they place the tile that completes the name, they take the name off the board and put it in front of them.  The first player to have three different animal names in front of them wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
