			<description>Schoolmaster Kees is still an intern, and he doesn't yet know what a schoolmaster is supposed to do. Luckily, he has a class full of experts! In his class, everything is a little bit different: a dictation becomes telling jokes, geography becomes portraying countries, and during biology, the children watch Spiderman or Kung Fu Panda. He tries very hard, especially when the head of the school comes around to check if everything goes well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, the players score points by playing several mini-games. When it is a players turn, he rolls two dice and moves his pawn around the school. If he enters a classroom, a mini-game is started:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Language class: The players have to come up with a word that matches a certain description (such as 'a country starting with the letter A'). The description is given by an assignment card combined with a spinner. The first player to shout a matching word wins the mini-game.&lt;br/&gt;    Math class: The player picks one opponent. He takes a regular die and a special die (which only rolls sixes). His opponents get two regular dice. Both players start rolling their dice. The first player to roll 7 wins the mini-game.&lt;br/&gt;    Geography class: The player is assigned a country that he has to depict. The other players have to guess the country. If someone guess correctly, both the guesser and the player score points, otherwise only the player scores.&lt;br/&gt;    Gym class: Each player receives a number of cards with the values 1 to 5. Then, the first player has to play one or two cards with the value '1' (facedown), the second player has to play one or two games with the value '2', etc. After the '5' has been played, the game continues again with the '1'. The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are allowed to play non-matching cards, but other players may accuse you of bluffing. If you are accused and were bluffing, the accuser wins the game. If you are accused and were not bluffing, you win the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Schoolyard (playing hide-and-seek): The player picks an opponent. Both players receive a set of schoolyard cards. Each card has an picture of a schoolyard scene. Then, a random item is determined. The first player to find that item in the pictures wins the mini-game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is over when each mini-game has been played four times. Now, the scores for each player are added up. The player with the highest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
