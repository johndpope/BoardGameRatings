							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Qwikscore Volleyball</name>
									
			<description>Unusual to find this sport in a statistical game. Designed around results for over 100 Men's and Women's Olympic teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teams are rather basically rated but it only needs a dice roll or two to decide a result, meaning that a complete Olmpic Volleyball event can be replayed in an evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
