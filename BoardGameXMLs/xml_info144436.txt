			<description>From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;Back to the Future: The Game is an episodic point-and-click adventure role-playing video game based on the Back to the Future film franchise. The game is split up into five episodes. Telltale published the series as retail products for the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii consoles for North America. Deep Silver published the retail Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 3 versions for Europe on May 4, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back to the Future: The Game is a point-and-click adventure role-playing video game, played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Marty to explore the 3D environments using either the keyboard, mouse or game controller to move around. The player can have Marty examine objects, talk to non-player characters (initiating dialog through conversation trees), and perform specific actions in order to solve puzzles and progress the game. Some items can be picked up and stored in Marty's inventory, and then can be used later to interact with other characters or objects. The game provides a list of current goals for the player to complete to advance the game. The player can access a hint system, revealing one clue at a time from a number of cryptic clues for how to solve a specific puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Back to the Future: The Game,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content Descriptors: &lt;br/&gt;Drug and Alcohol Reference, Language, Mild Blood, Mild Violence, Sexual Themes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rating Summery:&lt;br/&gt;This is an adventure game based on the Back to the Future movie franchise. Players assume the role of Marty McFly, a teenager who must travel through time to rescue his friend and restore a dystopian version of his hometown. A variety of sequences contain brief instances of violence (e.g., men threatening each other with pistols; a character getting punched in the face; a man being slapped while tied to a chair). One scene depicts a small puddle of blood, though no related violence is shown. Some sequences contain dialogue that is sexual in nature (e.g., &amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;ehaviors that excite your privates should be kept in private,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;They weren't. . . hookers?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;[L]ook! Girlie mags!&amp;rdquo;/Boobies?&amp;rdquo;). In one scene, a magazine stack is identified as &amp;ldquo;porn.&amp;rdquo; During the course of the game, the dialogue references alcohol (e.g., &amp;ldquo;Booze,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Beer, rum, whiskey, wine coolers, you name it, I drank it,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;. . . drunken bums,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Under the influence of alcohol, my mom made a pass at me.&amp;rdquo;). In one scene, a police officer asks if a character is &amp;ldquo;on the pot.&amp;rdquo; The words &amp;ldquo;sh*t,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;b*tch,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;a*s&amp;rdquo; can be heard in dialogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: ESRB ratings, &amp;quot;ESRB Ratings: Back to the Future: The Game,&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
