			<description>Well, it's finally happened.  It might have been a plague, some sort of crazy military experiment, or just a freak mutation of some virus; but it doesn't matter, the dead are walking and they are hungry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZOMBIES!  You Won't Survive The Night is a Zombie-themed card game where you and your friends make up a party of survivors who are doing their best to simply survive.  The only problem...  They won't!  You cannot survive this night!  Everyone WILL DIE!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you and your friends are trying to make it, you will go into houses and businesses looking for food and weapons.  On occasion, you might just find a Zombie...  Of course, dealing with the Zombies in a large group (Up to 10 players) might seem easy at first but eventually you lose people... and when you do, they become Zombies too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play doesn't end when you die, your priorities simply change.  Once you die and become a Zombie, your goal is simple: Kill all the living and eat their brains!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you be the last to survive?  Will you be the last Zombie standing?  Each play-through will be different in this game of tactics and chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
