							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Spring Heel Jack</name>
									
			<description>Action board game. The board has 16 holes in it. The player loads a spring device and places it on the table, as far back as he wishes, and catapults a ball onto the board. If it settles into one of the holes, a score of 2 to 10 points will be scored. The one with the most points when the game ends, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spring device will cause the player to experiment. Two factors are involved - how far back to reach the board and how much to hold the device down before releasing it. It must be easy to over-shoot or under-shoot the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
