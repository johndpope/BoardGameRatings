			<description>Each player represents a drop of oil, which travels from the oil fields of Kuwait to Hambug harbor and gets turned into various consumer products. Movement is determined by a die. On arriving in Hamburg the players have to chose a production line. The first and second players whose oil drops are turned into consume products get bonus points that are added to the point-worth of the products. The player with the most points wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
