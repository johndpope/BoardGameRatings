			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let the Adventure Begin!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crypts &amp;amp; Creatures was designed as an easy-to-learn trimmed-down version of the most popular fantasy RPG. C&amp;amp;C can be used to introduce absolutely new players to role playing games using easy-to-learn rules that provide a smooth transition into the larger more complicated games. C&amp;amp;C can also be played by experts and experienced players as quick-fun/experimental games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever wanted to run an experimental or quick game? Ancient Greek setting with the players as demi-gods? Evil campaign with the forces of Good and the agents (Paladins)of the God of Light everywhere? An all one-class campaign: The Thieves' Guild, Master Everrhas's Wizards College? All of this can be done with Crypts &amp;amp; Creatures! Live the Adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Easy for GM's to adapt to and players to learn.&lt;br/&gt;     Simple system based from the SRD.&lt;br/&gt;     Only 17 pages of rules.&lt;br/&gt;     Adaptable, most supplements (generic or mainstream) can be added with little or no conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
