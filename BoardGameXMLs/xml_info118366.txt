			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: You enter the large dining hall. A giant spread lays on the table in front of you and portraits of all kinds line the walls, giving a feel of opulence to the place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: I examine the portraits; what do I see?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: They are a collection of various people of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Yeah, but do any stand out to me?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Ummmm...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paintings - they decorate the walls of haunted houses, lavish estates and are often suggested as a good alternate form of treasure, instead of money. Unfortunately the details of pictures are often glossed over with a simple description relating to the item's value, such as its quality. However, giving these items a unique description can add to the atmosphere of a location or the perceived value of the item itself. For this reason, we at Healing Fireball Publications have created Two Bit Tables: Paintings For All Your Walls. This is a large 6 page collection of tables that will allow you to generate unique paintings to liven up your decor. All this and it's only 50&amp;cent;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
