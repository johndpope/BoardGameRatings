			<description>From The Texas Instruments TI-99/4A was an early home computer, released in June 1981, originally at a price of USD $525. It was an enhanced version of the less-successful&amp;mdash;and quite rare&amp;mdash;TI-99/4 model, which was released in late 1979 at a price of $1,150. The TI-99/4A added an additional graphics mode, &amp;quot;lowercase&amp;quot; characters consisting of small capitals, and a full travel keyboard. Its predecessor, the TI-99/4, featured a calculator-style chiclet keyboard and a unique style of ASCII that lacked lowercase text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;TI99&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
