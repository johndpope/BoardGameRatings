			<description>Food for thought is a nutrition themed board game. The emphasis is on eating a balanced diet exemplified by 6 food attributes of Fat, Carbohydrates, Fiber, Vitamins, Minerals and Calories. It is part chance (dice) and part strategy (players decide whether or not to 'eat' the food card they land on) based. The theme in general is also to introduce younger players to the above mentioned food attributes and make them more informed about nutrition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players start off with all food attributes on the 'good' row of the 'nutritional grid'. Depending on the food choices they make, their counters move up or down the grid until one of the food attribute counters reaches the &amp;quot;lose a life&amp;quot; row, at which point they lose a life. Players can also un-balance other players nutrition grids via the &amp;quot;Payback time&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;switch identity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Chance&amp;quot; events. Interspersed with the food cards are &amp;quot;exercise&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;catch some rays&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;regular doctor's visit&amp;quot;c cards that teach the importance of these attributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the game is to stay alive (by not having any counter reach the &amp;quot;lose a life&amp;quot; row on the nutritional grid) by 'eating' the 'right' (balanced) foods. Another goal also is to make your opponents die by making them eat the 'wrong' foods as a result of a &amp;quot;chance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;payback time&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;switch identity&amp;quot; event. The player who is the last to stay alive wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please visit &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://foodforthoughtgame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://foodforthoughtgame.com&lt;/a&gt; for a complete description of the game as well as a picture of the actual game board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
