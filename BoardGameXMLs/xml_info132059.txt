			<description>Sprec (Stacking + Pyramidal + Recursive) is a Spred derivative (that is a LOT derivative itself) that rescues LOT's winning condition and adds a 4th ball colour to the Shibumi set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It features a simple ball-removal game mechanism that makes loops impossible, but at the same time, produces potentially long games in a very small playing area. The game can last from 9 turns to around 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be played in any board size, but 5x5 or 6x6 is recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RULES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player A uses white balls as the base colour and yellow balls as the upgrade colour. Player B uses the red bals as the base colour and the black balls as the upgrade colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board starts empty. Players take alternate turns placing a ball of their base colour (White or Red) on an empty position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, after a player's move, there is at least one straight line of three connected* balls (touching) of their base colour (the lines can be orthogonal or across levels), the player does the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Chooses any of those lines of three.&lt;br/&gt;2. Removes the maximum number of movable balls from that line. This means that the player must find out the correct order to remove them so he removes the most. Balls may drop as a result of these removals.&lt;br/&gt;3. Places one ball of their upgrade colour on any of the empty spaces that composed the removed line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player creates at least one straight line of three connected* balls (touching) of their upgrade colour (the lines can be orthogonal or across levels).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the pyramid fills up without reaching the victory codition the player with most upgrade balls on the board wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(*)- Note that flat diagonal lines are not connected!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
