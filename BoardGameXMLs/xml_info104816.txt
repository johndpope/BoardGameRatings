							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Riverworld</name>
									
			<description>Riverworld was a PC game released in 1998 by Cryo entertainment, based on the series of novels by Philip Jos&amp;eacute; Farmer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game, the player takes the role of Richard Burton, the nineteenth century explorer. The game begins with a lengthy cinematic sequence, showing what happens to Burton after he has died - how he comes to enter Riverworld.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is similar in concept to real time strategy games, such as Microsoft's Age Of Empires. Although Burton is the central character, it is seen from a third-person perspective, and other people within the game can be moved and controlled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverworld_%28video_game%29,&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverworld_%28video_game%29,&amp;qu...&lt;/a&gt;; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
