							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hot Streak!</name>
									
			<description>Hot Streak is a roll and move game combined with a variety of different gambling sub games.  Players move on an inner or outer track and land on properties.  Based on the property they land on players can take a lottery ticket, play a casino game such as slots, bet on a horse race, or acquire one of a handful of Keno parlors.  Players compete to gain the most money without going bankrupt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of actual game play, there is very little decision making other than the amount of particular bets though even this is fixed for some of the games.  Occasionally players have the option of switching between tracks.  All games are determined by random spins, dice rolls, or draws.  For example, the horse race has six horses starting at the same point and all players bet on a horse; a die is rolled and the corresponding horse advances one space; this continues until one horse has advanced to the finish.  As another example, lottery tickets are simply distributed as one lands on the spot with a random winner drawn later in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board is a thin cardboard, the chips and horses are generic plastic pieces.  Generally the quality is below average even for a mass market game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Box --Made by the makers of Nick the Greek Official Casino Gambling Games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most exciting strategy board game about casino gambling ever made!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contains: Beautiful casino board game, authentic roulette layout, dice, poker chips, keno parlor ownership cards, roulette/slot machine spinner, six molded race horses, six game tokens, lottery tickets, odds cards, cashier checks, NICK THE GREEK money, plus complete easy-to-follow instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great fun for the whole family&lt;br/&gt;For 2 to 6 players&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the glitter and fast action of a trip to any one of the world's glamorous gambling casinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get to Play&lt;br/&gt;9 Great Casino Games&lt;br/&gt;Including: Roulette, Blackjack, Poker, Craps, Slot Machine, Horse Race, Chuck-A-Luck, Baccarat, and Keno plus A State Lottery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
