							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rebel Yell (Demo)</name>
									
			<description>A game that came free in Vol 5 No, 4 of Old Soldiers magazine. The game is a demo version of the game, Devil's Due, Brice's Crossroads. This will allow you to test drive the Rebel Yell system in general and the upcoming game in particular, at no cost.&lt;br/&gt; Tha game is about one of the most lopsided victories in the war for the Confederates. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a threat to General Sherman's vulnerable and strung out supply line during his Georgia March to the Sea in 1864.&lt;br/&gt; A detachment of 8000 Union soldiers, a mix of cavalry &amp;amp; infantry, were sent to eliminate Forrest's troops.&lt;br/&gt; The over eager young Union officer, Samuel Sturgis, sent his cavalry over 7 miles in front of his infantry.&lt;br/&gt; Forrest predicted the battle's outcome early that day to one of his generals. He stated that their Confederate cavalry would drive the Union cavalry back in a rout and push them into the tired Union infantry slogging their way towards the battlefield. His prediction was true as the Union cavalry quickly broke and retreated right back into the confused infantry. The infantry could not organize a stand in the panicked retreat of the horsemen. The Union troops were routed and suffered casualties that exceed the CSA losses by 3 to 1.&lt;br/&gt; In the end though, Forrest was not able to interfere with the supply line of Sherman's army, so in this, Sherman's goal was accomplished.&lt;br/&gt; This game comes with 2 scenarios, the simplified rules, 2 maps (in four pieces), counter images and needed charts. A 10 sided die will need to be supplied. The counters will need to be mounted on cardboard.&lt;br/&gt; Scenario 1 is Forrest Attacks! It depicts the initial routing of the US cavalry and is played on map 1.&lt;br/&gt; Scenario 2 is Drive on Brice's Store and is played on map 2. &lt;br/&gt;The 2 scenarios can be played as a 'campaign' game. This would require the CSA player to win both or the Union will be victorious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
