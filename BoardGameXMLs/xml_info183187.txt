			<description>Grow Fairy Kingdoms is a Competitive Plant-Growing Game for 3-6&lt;br/&gt;players, ages 6-and-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player starts with a Base on which to grow their plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two phases: the Day when each player chooses tiles to grow their plant, and the Night, when each Thorn on your plant is a chance to prune your rivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four main types of tiles: Stems which cause the plant to branch, Flowers for victory points, Thorns for night-attacks, and Leaves for shielding against attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rare tiles include powerful gold Flowers, Thorns, and Leaves, as well as tiles to place on opponent plants: Caterpillars (to eat opponent tiles) and Rot (to prevent growth).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Night phase, Thorns allow players to roll six-sided die to target the ends of rival plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when at least one player survives a night with at least 5 victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game comes with 98 tiles and one 6-sided die.
