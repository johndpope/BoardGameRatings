			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exquisite Beast is a board game of mad scientists, minions, monstrosities, angry peasant mobs, lightning bolts, and wanton property destruction. Each player takes on the role of a mad scientist, sending minion pawns around the board to collect cards which represent the body parts of fantasy or horror creatures. Each part has specific stats and may provide a unique special ability. Each player then constructs a beast out of these collected parts and can use their assembled beast to score victory points by either defeating other players monsters or by capturing locations in the town centre on the board. The first player to reach 15 victory points wins. Beasts that fall in combat lose one of their limbs, but may have new ones stitched on and be sent back out on to the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town also fights back through a special pawn on the board: the angry mob. Each turn a card is drawn from the villager deck which determines how the mob will act for the turn. Generally these cards strengthen the mob and send it to attack the players beasts and minions as well as occasionally scoring victory points for the board. If the board reaches 15 victory points before any of the players, the villagers have successfully stormed the castles of the mad scientists and the players lose. The players can steal victory points from the board, but this usually requires cooperation between at least 2 players in an otherwise directly competitive game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
