			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategis Analysis...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over ten years ago, as the second Star League died, the Word of Blake unleashed its wrath against the combined realms of the Inner Sphere and the Clans. Using every weapon in their arsenal, from strategic misdirection and the exposure of state secrets, to biological, nuclear, and chemical attacks, the Word&amp;rsquo;s war struck every power where it hurt most. Factories were razed, capitals fell, and loyalties were shattered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But eventually, the leaders of the Inner Sphere's ancient warring factions recognized the true threat, and united behind a bold new freedom fighter to bring down the Word of Blake's bastion of power: Terra. Though the war still rages on, and the Blakists' Master yet lives, the followers of Devlin Stone know all too well that victory today may only pave the way for the wars of tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field Report: DCMS describes the state of the Draconis Combine in the wake of the events described in Jihad Hot Spots: Terra, including the overall military and logistical condition of one of the Great Houses who stood against the Word of Blake menace. Battered, but unbowed, by enemies both within and without, the armies of House Kurita remain a force to be reckoned with, as a new age dawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
