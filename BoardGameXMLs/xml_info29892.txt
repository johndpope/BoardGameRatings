							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Helping, Sharing, and Caring Game</name>
									
			<description>From the rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The therapeutic game has enjoyed widespread utilization throughout North America and abroad. The Helping, Sharing, and Caring Game is a derivative of the therapeutic instrument-- specifically designed for children, their siblings, their parents, and other adults with whom children may be involved. The cards that Dr. Gardner considered most directly relevant to the therapeutic situation have been replaced with cards that are of educational value, especially with regard to ethics and values that are important to impart to children. The cards also facilitate interpersonal communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
