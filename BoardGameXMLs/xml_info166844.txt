			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rolemaster is a detailed role playing game, providing the means to create all kind of characters and resolve maneuvers of any kind, all by following a consistent set of rules and tables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA (Electronic Roleplaying Assistant) is the ultimate companion for Rolemaster campaigns. Just by running this free application players can create their characters using a step by step wizard, then level them up and configure all details in stats, skills and special abilities, even overriding the automatic calculations. Afterwards, they can be added to a running campaign in the adventuring module. From there, the game master can control all aspects of the game: resolve maneuvers, resistances, resting, and of course, spell casting and combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can also oversee the current status of their characters as the adventure progresses, simply by accessing the application with their mobile devices. This also allows them to check all known spells with full descriptions, current skill values and more. Inventory and game master-to-player communication also have their own systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get ERA for free and try it out using the included Rolemaster Classic sample races, professions, spells, attacks and criticals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complete datasets for Rolemaster Classic, namely Rolemaster Classic Arms Law, Rolemaster Classic Spell Law, and Rolemaster Classic Character Law, can be purchased from OneBookShelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
