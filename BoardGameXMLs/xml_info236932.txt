			<description>Beard Wars is a game played with 2 or 4 players. &lt;br/&gt;The object of Beard Wars is to collect as many of your opponents Beard Cards before the deck runs out. Some of the cards contain abilities to help you carry out this objective. Read them carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup:&lt;br/&gt;Each player has their own deck. There will be a draw pile, discard pile, and trophy pile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw Pile: This is your main deck of cards. At the beginning of each turn, you draw until you have 7 cards in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discard Pile: This is where your used cards go. Including Instant Plays and your own used Beard Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trophy Pile: When you win a card from your opponent, place it here so you can count them up at the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
