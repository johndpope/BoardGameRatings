			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The human race extends its reach into the stars, looking for new earthlike planets on which to settle and trade. On some planets we find Galactic Hominids &amp;ndash; humanoid lifeforms with a variety of features, possibly descended from the same panspermia that gave rise to humans on Earth. But along the way we find other lifeforms, big and small, with biological properties we haven&amp;rsquo;t evolved alongside, and against which we have no defenses. We discover new and incomprehensible diseases, sometimes requiring new and incomprehensible cures.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PCs visit a troubled colony on the distant planet of Van Daamas, where inhospitable storms and freezing weather have led to an environment containing animals quite like those on earth - and yet quite different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CURIOUS CURE is a DayTrippers Adventure from the GOLDEN AGE ADVENTURES anthology.  If you have that book, you don't need this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DayTrippers uses a descriptive scale which can easily be converted to other game systems.  Conversions are included for 2-12, 1-20, PbtA and percentage-based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
