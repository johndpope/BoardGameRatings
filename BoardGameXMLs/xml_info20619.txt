							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Bloomsday</name>
									
			<description>A racing game that simulates the 10k Bloomsday race in Spokane, Washington.  Players simultaneously choose a number of Endurance Points to &amp;quot;burn&amp;quot;.  Players burn these points to move along the board, but if you don't burn more than your opponents, you only move one space!  Be sure to keep something in the tank for the final stretch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board consists of a long track labeled with the different stages in Bloomsday.  The board spaces can also make the player go forward or backwards or lose turns.  Some spaces give you special cards, like &amp;quot;injury&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;special training&amp;quot; that you can play on yourself or your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
