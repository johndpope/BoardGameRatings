			<description>User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game you will be stacking small wooden blocks upright or flat on top of each other. The goal is to have your pawn reach two apple tokens on a 3D tree and then unstack your blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you will roll the die and perform an action:&lt;br/&gt;1- Place a block flat on top of your stack&lt;br/&gt;2- Place a block upright on top of your stack&lt;br/&gt;Apple Crate - Play one block on your stack either upright OR flat&lt;br/&gt;Songbird- Lose a turn as you listen to the songbird sing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the apple on your pawn reaches the same height as an apple token on the tree you may take the token. Once you have two apple tokens the race is on for you to unstack you blocks. You must roll the correct number in order to take the top block off of your stack (1=flat, 2=upright, crate=either)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to get two apple tokens and unstack their blocks wins!&lt;br/&gt; From publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climb High Enough to Pick Two Apples!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The orchard is ripe for the picking! Tibbar and his buddies race to stack their wood blocks, pick two juicy red apples, and unstack their blocks! Who will be first?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
