			<description>A co-operative game for children from 5 years up. The &amp;quot;Robber Hotzenplotz&amp;quot; from the well known book by Otfried Preu&amp;szlig;ler, has stolen pieces from the grandmother`s cake and trying to get them safe in his hiding place. The players try to catch him and the pieces first.&lt;br/&gt;There are four figures walking along square fields, in which the board (looking like a landscape)is divided. The Hotzenplotz-figure is independent from a single player. It walks after all four players rolled their dice and walks along a spiral way from the outside to his hiding place, crossing the squares. He always walks to and fro, stealing another piece of cake and gets it to his hiding place.&lt;br/&gt;If he comes to a square with one of the four figures on it, he captures it. But if the players manage to place two figures on the square with the robber (otherwise it is forbidden to place two figures on one place!), then he is captured in prison and the piece of cake saved. Of course, the robber starts from the prison right away again to steal more ...&lt;br/&gt;There are different variants, making it easier or more difficult for the players to reach the goal of saving four pieces and winning the game together.&lt;br/&gt;Nice co-operative game for the youngest gamers, starting discussions after every dice-roll where the figures should walk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
