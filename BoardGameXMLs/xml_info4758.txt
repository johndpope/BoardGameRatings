			<description>LIFTS AND RUNS is a board game based on the world-famous Sun Valley mountain trail maps. It is packaged in a 4 mil, 9&amp;quot; x 18 1/2&amp;quot; clear zip bag, with an open board size of 18&amp;quot; x 27&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECT OF THE GAME &lt;br/&gt;Each player has 2 pawns that represent family members, and your family begins their ski day in Ketchum, Idaho. Deciding which pawns to move, you roll the dice and proceed to ride the KART bus to the mountain, ride ALL the chairlifts, and ski the corresponding runs -- SWOOSH to the bottom of the mountain! The winner is the first family to return its pawns to Ketchum after skiing all the runs on &amp;quot;Baldy&amp;quot; mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While on the mountain, you pass through lodges and restaurants where &amp;quot;LODGE OPPORTUNITIES&amp;quot; happen. At lodges and restaurants, you have experiences typical of a ski day with rolls of the dice. For example, a roll of &amp;quot;8&amp;quot; means that you have successfully skied &amp;quot;Easter Bowl&amp;quot;, a Black Diamond run, and may move your pawn ahead 10 spaces!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
