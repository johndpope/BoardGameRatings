							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Big Pharma</name>
									
			<description>You and your investors have worked long and hard to scrounge together enough cash and loans to purchase the rights to three drugs (one in research, one in development and one in production) to develop and produce at your small pharmaceutical company.  With a little luck and a lot of hard work you hope to grow your company into an international conglomerate and take your place among your peers in Big Pharma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big Pharma is a game of balance.  You must balance your cash flow, efficiency, research, development and production, and manage the flow of your drugs from the research lab all the way to the production facility.  To complicate matters, the FDA is constantly looking over your shoulder to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re doing things right.  If they find you out of compliance, you could be paying some heavy fines or even face plant shutdown!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;amp;D Cards are available on ArtsCow here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.artscow.com/gallery/playing-cards/big-pharma-revised-kywqcg1kv23k&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.artscow.com/gallery/playing-cards/big-pharma-revi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
