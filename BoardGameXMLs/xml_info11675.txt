			<description>Each player, in turn, removes a brick from the wall.  Once a player starts to remove a brick, he must continue removing the same brick even though it causes Humpty Dumpty to fall.  The player causing Humpty Dumpty to fall is eliminated from the game.  The remaining players rebuild the wall, Humpty Dumpty is put back on the wall again and play continues as before.  The last player remaining in the game is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
