			<description>&amp;quot;Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 (GRAW 2) is the sequel to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. It expands on the game play of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and is the fourth installment in the popular Ghost Recon tactical shooter video game series, published by Ubisoft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in 2014, immediately after the events of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (GRAW), just south of the United States border, and deals with the conflict between a Mexican rebel group, Mexican loyalists, and the U.S. Army for a time span of 72 hours. A wide array of location types are included, featuring mountains, small towns, urban environments, and a large hydro-electric dam just north of the U.S.-Mexico border.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Tom_Clancy's_Ghost_Recon_Advanced_Warfighter_2,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE (1 May 2015): The console (Xbox 360 and PS3) versions of GRAW2 are entirely different in gameplay to the PC version despite both having the same overarching story set in Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PC version is more appropriately a &amp;quot;tactical shooter&amp;quot; with the player controlling his own character and managing individual members of his squad.  The console version is more an &amp;quot;action shooter&amp;quot; with limited tactical control over the remaining squad members as a group, not individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single player (SP) campaign on the PC uses much larger maps and feels more open which suits playing in a playing a tactical style.  The console SP campaign uses much smaller maps for the equivalent missions with a greater density of enemy making it seem like enemies are around every corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The console versions were developed by Red Storm Entertainment, while the PC version was developed by GRIN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It may be worth considering having two separate entries for GRAW2 given the fundamental differences between the console and PC versions.  It's very much a case of same title, different games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
