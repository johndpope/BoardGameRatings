							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Barney&#039;s Follow the Egg Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a simple track game featuring an electronic Barney the Dinosaur. On your turn you spin the spinner and advance your pawn across the game board to the next open space of the color spun. When you reach an Egg Token Space you must stop and spin the dotted wheel next to the space. When it stops, you take the electronic Barney wand and press down on any one of the dots on the wheel. If Barney's light blinks and he makes a happy sound, you collect an Egg Token and can move on next turn. If Barney's light doesn't blink and he makes a sad sound, you don't collect a token and must try again next turn. The first player to reach the Finish Space with all his eggs and the Twinken Token wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
