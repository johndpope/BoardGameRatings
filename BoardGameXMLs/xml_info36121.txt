			<description>&amp;ldquo;18th Century Naval Combat. Abstract skirmish level Ship combat. Each figure represents a single Ship (unit). Victory: You win if you Sink the opposing Flagship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on an 8x8 grid or chessboard. Miniatures or counters are used to represent the ships. Each player starts with an identical assortment of ships: one Flagship, two Ships of the Line, two Frigates, and three Sloops. The game uses a custom deck of cards which is central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from the common deck, and card play determines when units may move, attack, or defend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
