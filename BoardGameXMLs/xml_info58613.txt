							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Adventuring</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The fourth in the &amp;lsquo;Classic Play&amp;rsquo; series from Mongoose Publishing, The Book of Adventuring covers a topic of focal importance to any d20 game in unprecedented depth and detail. This series forms a collection of definitive works on subjects relevant to any gaming group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your party is strung out along a crumbling ledge, fifty feet above a roaring torrent of water, out of spells and badly wounded, while a ravenous hippogriff circles ominously above. What do you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Book of Adventuring reveals the answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for use by those role-players who are new to the hobby or those modest enough to admit that they do not already know it all, The Book of Adventuring leads you on to the road to becoming a better adventurer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn the importance of even the most insignificant pieces of equipment and exactly what they can do for you. Discover the tactics required to survive once the going gets tough and what role your character brings to the party as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is only the tip of the iceberg, every element of the adventurer's craft is detailed in its own chapter, from surviving the dangers of the wilderness to the perils of extraplanar travel; from feeding yourself in the gloomy depths of a drow cavern to overcoming dangers of a very different kind as you make your way through the streets and alleys of a bustling city. Disparate environments they may be, but equally perilous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This valuable tome is the essential guide to all things adventuring.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
