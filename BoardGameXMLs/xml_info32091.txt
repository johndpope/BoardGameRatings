			<description>Fast-playing, simple pulp-gaming rules that use free downloadable paper counters and four kinds of map sets (included). 2+ players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulp gaming, in which each player controls a character or faction from a 1930's pulp thriller, is growing in popularity. Such games combine the visual appeal of miniatures gaming with aspects of role-playing games, allowing the players to control the actions of tough private eyes, seemingly-helpless dames, brave explorers, and all the rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rules are made for simplicity and fast play. The game is meant for use with miniatures, but you can download a set of paper minis for free. All you have to provide is a few six-sided (d6) and ten-sided (d10) dice. The game is meant for two or more players, but it can be used for solo gaming as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
