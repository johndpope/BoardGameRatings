			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MIDDENARDE takes place in 15th century England, a land rife with turmoil, where folk live and die by the sword. Many English troops now return from the Hundred Years' War to find their country bubbling over with strife. The Church's power has grown fractured and disorganized, and while the Crown is weakened by internal forces vying for its future, petty lordlings take advantage of the chaos to enrich themselves by declaring war on one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;middenarde&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;the middle abode,&amp;rdquo; i.e. the earth as it is situated between heaven and hell. The British Isles are full of squabbling lords, small-town cults, hidden magick, and most importantly &amp;ndash; opportunity. These are interesting times, when upward mobility is at its strongest, and anyone can make something of themselves, if they can survive long enough. Even you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the midst of this discord, a story emerges: you, an inexperienced commoner, leave your home in search of better fortunes. Perhaps you are forced out by bandits, or a lordly raiding party. Maybe you are lured out by tales of ancient treasure, valuable artefacts, or mystical beasts. It may be that you are simply tired of your empty life, and want to seek more fulfilling prospects, or new experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either way, you will emerge blinking and dazed into a world where everything is up for grabs, and everyone is trying to take as much as they can get. It's the perfect time to make something of yourself -- but also the perfect time to wind up dead in a muddy ditch. In this tale, you are not the heroic adventurer bouncing from one quest to another, strolling through fights with nary a scratch. You are the pile of bones that crunches under their foot when they step into a dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your characters will be just as mortal as the foes they face, and every violent encounter will be a brush with death. Even slaying all your enemies may leave you scarred and disfigured, and you will have to rely on sturdy metal for your armor, not plot. You are not destined for greatness -- but you have the potential for greatness. Your character will grow and learn, becoming more competent, better equipped, and less naive, as you build them up, through hardship and trial, into something to be proud of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book includes everything you need to create and launch your own campaign in the world of Middenarde. The core rulebook introduces you to the setting and guides you through the process of character creation, as well as all of the game's mechanics. Ready-to-play adventure modules will be forthcoming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
