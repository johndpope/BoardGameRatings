			<description>From the publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doors is a short, imaginative and versatile description of five doors, so every DM can easily add it to their adventure. Every door consist of two illustrations: one 'as seen by PC's' and, secondly, 'what happens after starting the protection of the doors'. As in 'Treasure Chests' ( the previous supplement from this series) every passage can be opened and dismantled by two methods, namely - HOLMES and JONES: forcible/with series of tests and with deciphering the riddles. 'Doors' is an accessory for BG at the levels 1-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Forge Studios presents and represents a new quality in game's accessories combining 'art' packs and ordinary gaming material.&lt;br/&gt;Every PDF from The Forge Studios consists of two parts. The first one is designed exclusively for the DM. In it you can find exact plans, visualizations, ideas, and adventure hooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part is a set of visual aids which can be easily printed or presented to other players during a session, in order to enrich the description and create a more precise presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Doors' consists of:&lt;br/&gt;- 9 page long description&lt;br/&gt;- 10 view drawings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
