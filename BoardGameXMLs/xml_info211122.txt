			<description>Emily Is Probably Dead By Now&lt;br/&gt;A sinister game of bluffing and collusion for 4-6 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay begins with all players guilty of murdering Emily and hiding the body.&lt;br/&gt;Everyone at the table is guilty and is looking for a way out.&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins with pieces of evidence that they must stash in order to get away with murder and win the game leaving the other players to waste away behind bars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During each round of the game players will play location cards face down claiming that they are helping the town search party look for the &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; Emily. The rest of the group needs to decide if you are actually checking a location or trying to stash evidence when nobody is looking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you get caught hiding evidence you will gain suspicion which will make it more difficult to get rid of your current evidence and if you are caught trying to collude with other players you will gain additional pieces of evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ok.....so get rid of evidence that's it right? It can't get much worse then committing a murder and having evidence on you as you help search for the missing person. Well that is true until one unlucky player ends up actually picking up Emily and must now get rid of this very damming piece of evidence .&lt;br/&gt;If any player is caught with Emily's body the game immediately ends and that player will receive the death penalty while all other players will serve jail sentences based on how much evidence they currently have in their hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Highlights&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluffing&lt;br/&gt;Bluffing and hiding your true intentions is the heart and sole of this game. The mechanics were developed to not get in the way or hinder your ability to bluff your way through a tough situation. There are situations in the game that will test your metal and challenge your ability to maintain a convincing deception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collusion&lt;br/&gt;Players will have opportunities on the fly to quickly decide to work with each other to get further in the game but beware there can only be one winner and colluding with others carries a much higher penalty and invites a firm back-stab from savvy players looking to catch you off guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick Game Play&lt;br/&gt;Emily Is Probably Dead is very quick to learn and each game takes about 20-30 mins to conclude. Making this a perfect filler game to play in between other games or as a quick fun gaming experience with very little time commitment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A New Twist On the Who Dunnit Theme&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;So who dunnit?&amp;quot;......&amp;quot;You all did!&amp;quot; now its a question of who is going to get caught and who is going to get away with murder!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
