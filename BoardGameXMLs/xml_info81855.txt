All the villagers were gathered around the festival square, eating, dancing, and having a wonderful time. Meanwhile, far away on Demon Island, Dynagon was plotting his revenge. After the beautiful Princess Luna refused to marry him, Dynagon went in a frenzy.&lt;br/&gt;Dynagon then ordered Impy, his most faithful servant, to go kidnap the princess from the harvest festival, in order to force her to get married to him.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Help!
