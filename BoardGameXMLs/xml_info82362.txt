			<description>Samurai Shodown! 2 (Japanese title: Samurai Spirits! 2 / サムライスピリッツ! 2) is a handheld game in SNK's popular Samurai Shodown series of fighting games. Unlike its predecessor, it was released on the Neo-Geo Pocket Color system, so its graphics were no longer monochrome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was designed as a conversion from the most recent game in the SS series, Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage, and almost all of its story events, endings and cutscenes are derived from its arcade cousin. It turned out to be a surprisingly robust rendition, with almost all characters from SS64: Warriors Rage being included (the sole exception being Yagyu Hanma). It also re-added two series favorites who were not in the arcade, Charlotte and Yagyu Jubei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Samurai Shodown! 2&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
