							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gauntlets of Ogre Power</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warriors of all walks of life and races hunt throughout their adventuring careers for a pair of the coveted gauntlets of ogre power. Forged of crude iron and worn leather and studded with iron studs, the gauntlets of ogre power grant their wearer tremendous strength and the physical prowess of their namesake: the ogre. Unlike many magic items where the name is not an indication of the item&amp;rsquo;s origin, the gauntlets of ogre power were created by ogres but the creator of the gauntlets was not your traditional &amp;ldquo;dumb-witted but as brawny as five dwarves&amp;rdquo; ogre. He is viewed as the worst ogre in history but he might have easily been the greatest of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement has includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Creator Of the Gauntlets of Ogre Power&lt;br/&gt;     History Of the Gauntlets of Ogre Power&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic Item: Gauntlets of Giant Strength and Gauntlets of Titan Resolve&lt;br/&gt;     New Feats: Ogre Blooded, Blood of the Darkspear and Heir of Firbolge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
