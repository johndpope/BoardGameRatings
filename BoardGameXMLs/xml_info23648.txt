			<description>Translation of the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Finally a game about hockey so near to reality you will think you are a coach in the NHL, responsible for the performance of your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will go through the same range of emotions of being both the technician, and the brains of your team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You choose which position each player must be placed at and you pick out your own strategies in order to win against your adversary. Each decision  you make will impact the result of the game. Unlike  Ice Hockey, you will be the solely responsible for your victory or defeat.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is obviously based on the rules before the lock-out as it was released in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
