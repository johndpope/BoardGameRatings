							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nix Ra Bael, Dreamkiller</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Now you will die, and your dream dies with you.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When tyrants wish to silence troublemakers, it isn't enough just to kill the man - they have to kill his dreams as well. So the evil and oppressive hire Nix Ra Bael, the assassin of aspirations, to solve their problems with a bolt between the eyes. Struck blind and twisted by the failure of his quest for &amp;quot;ultimate truth&amp;quot;, this quirky contract killer now thinks nothing of exterminating his victims and obliterating their legacies, since all existence is absurd and meaningless. In the starry-eyed realm of Dream, his is perhaps the most dangerous philosophy of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Game Masters with details on a soulless sharpshooter found amongst the Faces of the Tarnished Souk, ready for immediate use in any campaign&amp;mdash;but especially for use within the Coliseum Morpheuon. Each entry features ingenious stat-blocks from multiple OGL sources, history, motivation, secrets, and insight into the NPC's most carefully guarded dreams, along with complete game statistics for low, middle, and high levels of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within you will find: Nix Ra Bael, a killer of dreams and assassin of aspirations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    CR 21 Male blind oracle siphon drow noble gunslinger (arbalester) 17&lt;br/&gt;    CR 15 Male blind oracle drow noble gunslinger (arbalester) 14&lt;br/&gt;    CR 10 Male drow noble gunslinger (arbalester) 10&lt;br/&gt;    Blind oracle and siphon creature templates, for a sightless savant who can do judo on your juju&lt;br/&gt;    New equipment and magical items: a sinister sniper's crossbows, the bladed tonfa, and a dreamy mask&lt;br/&gt;    Arbalester: a new archetype for gunslingers using piercing bolts instead of powder and bullets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
