			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This beautiful 4-panel screen features magnificent art by Rafael Dorsz on the outer panels and on the inside you will find hundreds of inspirational examples of ways you can describe characters in intense fantasy combat. Strategically organized by the type of damage the character wishes to inflict and the fighting style the character is performing. The types of damage include: Blunt (damage caused by non-penetrating force), Slashing (damage caused by a sharp edge) and Piercing (damage caused by a sharp point). The combat styles include: Finesse (a character who fights with style and grace, such as the Swashbuckler or Martial Artist), Power (a character whose fight is based on strength and vigor, such as the Barbarian or Thug) and Range (a character who is using a thrown or distance weapon such as a javelin or bow). Plus additional descriptions from the Conflict: Storyteller's Deck (Ill Intent, Expressions, Character Distinctions, Environment) so improve your combat narrative and storytelling at a glance! Conflict: Writers and GM Screen is System Neutral.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
