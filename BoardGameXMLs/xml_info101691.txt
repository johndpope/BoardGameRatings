							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Fall of Blacksand</name>
									
			<description>From the Background:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are a fearless adventurer in a rapidly changing world. A long time ago you lived by the sword, earning more than enough gold through your various adventures, enabling you to enjoy a carefree life filled with exotic food and fine wine. Moving from one city to next you made your way around a world filled with dangerous monsters and wonderful magic. Nothing could harm you, a skilled swordsman and experienced trader - this existence was yours to savour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that has changed now. A devastating war ravages the land, tearing apart everything and everyone. Your world suddenly lies in ruins and all that you have ever been counts for nothing. You have lived through many dangerous adventures thus far, but nothing has prepared you for this. Where once there was life, there is only fear and death. You now have to escape to survive and kill to live. No one knows how the war started or who is fighting against whom. Some don't care - they just want to kill before they are slaughtered themselves. One thing is clear, war is everywhere and you must leave your home before you are killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are in Port Blacksand, also known as the City of Thieves. This city has seen many strange things in the past years, and was once home to a variety of thugs, pirates and, or course, thieves. Despite the presence of this dangerous collection of misfits, this city has been your home for several years now and you have grown fond of its many eccentricities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the war first began to the north of the city, you hastily made arrangements to leave the city, and head to the east. It was your intention to reach the safe haven of Silverton. But your preparations to flee were to slow - the city was quickly surrounded by the invading hordes, and all were trapped inside, the city's guards and enemies alike. Traders and thieves together trapped in hell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After several weeks of war, you are still trapped in this treacherous nightmare. There is heavy fighting all around you, inside the city and beyond its stonewalls, as the city's guards struggle to defend their stronghold. What was once your home is smashed, and the whole city is on fire. You have been hiding in the cellar of an old stone building in the middle of Port Blacksand for some days now, waiting for the fighting in the city to recede. Now it's time to attempt to leave, as you have almost no food or water left. You have used your last gold pieces to buy yourself a sword from a passing trader fleeing the city. To add to your problems, you have heard the news from some of the city's guards that another large army is approaching the Port Blacksand from the north, presumably to take the city by force. You must attempt to get through the city and leave the City of Thieves using the southern gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
