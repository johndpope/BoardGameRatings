							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Book of Mormon: Big Dig</name>
									
			<description>The Scriptures are full of treasures and artifacts, and now it's your job to find them! Set out on the ultimate archaeological hunt across twenty Book of Mormon locations, from Zarahemla to the Hill Cumorah- and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll the dice and choose which direction you'll head- or pick up the pace by flying across the board with one of five handy Helicopter Tiles.. Once you've landed, take your Artifact Card in hand and start digging! Finding the tile that matches the card in your hand will earn you an artifact- but try not to get stuck in the wilderness! First player to find three artifacts wins! (from the back of the box)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
