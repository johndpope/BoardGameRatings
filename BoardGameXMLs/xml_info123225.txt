			<description>Disaster on Kangchenjunga (or &amp;quot;K13&amp;quot; for short) is the third game in Tom Decker's 'Disaster on' series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A plane has crashed high up on the slopes of Kangchenjunga, the world&amp;rsquo;s third highest mountain. One of the passengers was carrying plans that contain secrets that if exposed or delivered into the wrong hands, could threaten world security. Your nation has sent you to join an expedition intent on reaching the summit of Kangchenjunga (Kangch), but you have different orders. You must reach the plane wreck, find the secret plans, and continue the expedition as if you are just one of the team. However, there is a spy among you who will try to sabotage your efforts and steal the plans away from you. There may also be another nation&amp;rsquo;s team on the mountain with similar interests. It&amp;rsquo;s a race to the plane crash!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins at midnight at High Camp on Kangch. You will control the movements for your entire team, most of whom are trying to reach the summit. Each turn, you will move climbers towards the summit (and plane crash) and then back down again. However, at some point in the game, the spy will be revealed, changing the rules drastically and forcing you to make decisions about who will summit, who will find and protect the secret plans, and who will try to just survive!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your decisions will not only determine the lives of your climbers, but may also stop the Cold War from heating up. Think you have what it takes? Play Disaster on Kangchenjunga to find out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
