			<description>Promotional game for Nivea, manufacturer of face-cream, etc., by Italian publisher Edizioni Gioghi Lasco.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title relates to a police call on their radio (I think CB users in the 80's used the call of 10/10).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board looks extremely complicated, with a path that crosses over and under itself, but it is a standard 'Goose' like game. 122 spaces have been crammed into the board. Set off from home to travel to the Piazza Italia. First to arrive at the Piazza, wins. Remember to obey any instructions on special squares should you land on one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
