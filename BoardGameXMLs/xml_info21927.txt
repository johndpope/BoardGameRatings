							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Watson&#039;s Education</name>
									
			<description>This is based on my older game Watson's Bible Inquest (Biblical characters have been replaced with historical figures).  It is a game of deduction where players draw cards and must deduce which historical figures are in the opponents hands based on a set of questions.  Points are awarded for correct guesses and points given to the opponents for incorrect guesses.  The game is scalable for different age groups or experience.  It is also educational, although this aspect is not necessary (players may use the charts provided with the game instead).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is available for free download (Print and Play) at my web site:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.tzon.org/watson.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.tzon.org/watson.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
