			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some hero teams are known for their awesome might or the intense battles they may have won. This team is known for going the extra mile to ensure life &amp;amp; property is protected above all else. Sure, it might cost them a win now and again and villains might try to take advantage of that to escape, but the noble men and women of SAFEGUARD aren't in it for the glory (well, most of them aren't) or for the bragging rights about which villains they've taken down. It's that attitude that has earned them the respect of the public. When SAFEGUARD's on the scene, people feel safe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
