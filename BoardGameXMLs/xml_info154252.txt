			<description>Sergeant Major is a trick-taking traditional card game for 3 players using a standard 52 card deck. It takes its name from its popularity among members of Britain's Royal Air Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple variations of the game exist. The two most common are the 9-5-2 (also known as the Canadian version) and the 8-5-3 (the British, Indian and Near-East Version).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8-5-3 version:&lt;br/&gt;As per &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.pagat.com/whist/sergeant.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.pagat.com/whist/sergeant.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the Game&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to win as many tricks as possible. If a player succeeds in winning 12 or more tricks in one hand, the game ends and that player wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal and Card Exchange (first hand)&lt;br/&gt;The first dealer is chosen at random. The cards are shuffled, cut and then dealt singly, 16 to each player. The last four undealt cards are placed face down on the table to form a kitty. The dealer names a suit as trumps (clubs, spades, hearts or diamonds - &amp;quot;no trump&amp;quot; is not allowed), discards any four cards face down, and takes the four undealt cards from the kitty in their place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Play&lt;br/&gt;The player to dealer's left leads any card to the first trick. It is compulsory to follow suit if able to; a player holding no card of the suit led may play any card. Each trick is won by the highest trump it contains, or if there are no trumps in it, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targets and Scoring&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a target. The dealer's target is 8 tricks; the player to dealer's left has a target of 5 tricks; and the player to dealer's right needs 3 tricks. A player who won more tricks than the target is said to be up by the number of tricks won in excess of target. A player who failed to reach the target is down by the number of tricks short. The player(s) who are down pay one stake per trick short of target, and the player(s) who are up receive one stake per overtrick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal and Exchange (second and subsequent hands)&lt;br/&gt;The turn to deal rotates clockwise, so the new dealer is the player who led to the first trick previous hand. The pack is shuffled and cut and 16 cards each are dealt singly as before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now each player who was up on the previous hand gives away one unwanted card per overtrick to a player who was down, and that player must return the highest card(s) held of the same suit(s). The exact procedure is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If just one player was up, that player gives each of the other players as many unwanted cards face down as they had undertricks. These cards are all given simultaneously. The other players add these cards to their hands, and for each card received, they give back face down their highest card of that suit. A player who has no other cards of the suit received will of course have to give back the same card.&lt;br/&gt;    If two players were up, the player with the higher target for the hand about to be played trades first. This player gives (face down) as many cards as he or she had overtricks to the player who was down, and that player gives back face down the highest card(s) held in the same suit(s). After that, the other player who was up gives a card per overtrick to the player who was down, and receives in exchange that player's highest card(s) in the same suit(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After this exchange of cards is complete, the dealer names trumps, discards four cards and takes the four undealt cards. If the dealer was down and had to give away the highest card of a suit, but then picks up one or more higher cards of that same suit from the undealt cards, any such high cards must be shown privately to the player(s) who traded cards in that suit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The play and scoring then proceeds as described above. The targets are always 8 tricks for the current dealer, 5 for the player who leads to the first trick, and 3 for the other player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End of the Game&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when any player succeeds in winning 12 or more tricks in one hand, thereby winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9-5-2 version:&lt;br/&gt;The game is identical to 8-5-3 apart from the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The targets for the three players are:&lt;br/&gt;        Dealer - 9 tricks&lt;br/&gt;        Player to dealer's left - 5 tricks&lt;br/&gt;        Player to dealer's right - 2 tricks.&lt;br/&gt; After trading cards and choosing trump, the dealer picks up the four kitty cards before discarding four.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the the actual dealer was down by 3 tricks or more in the previous turn and gives 3 of his highest cards accordingly, he may look at the kitty before choosing trump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cumulative score for each player is kept on paper. The score for each hand is assessed based on whether the required number of tricks were taken (zero score), more tricks were taken (plus score of number of tricks over required tricks) or fewer tricks (minus score of number of tricks under required tricks). Scores are totalled with the score from previous hands, and the total score of all three players should always be zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9-5-2 is played to a target score agreed in advance, usually 10, 15, or 20 points. The game ends when someone's score reaches or exceeds the target (with that person winning) or when someone's reaches or exceeds the negative value of the target (with that person losing and ending the game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other versions exist such as the 9-5-3 variation with no kitty (played in the Royal Navy), 6-3-8 played with 51 cards and no kitty,and the 7-4-1, a 4 players variant with its own entry in the database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
