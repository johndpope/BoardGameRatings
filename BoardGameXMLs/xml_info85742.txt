							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Jester</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jester presents a new 20-level base class for your d20 System fantasy game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A jester is a madman, but not in the sense of being insane. His actions are unpredictable, sometimes even to him. He is rash and wild, and can be intimidating to someone who does not know him. A jester's behaviour can be quite bizarre, even unsettling, often apparently unrelated to the immediate situation. He relies on surprise, blind luck and unusual tactics and ideas to escape danger and evade his enemies. He sows confusion and chaos, and uses it to his advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all jesters are professional fools, though some are, but all are entertainers at their core. Jesters rarely stop talking or laughing, and regale those around them with tales of harrowing adventure or embarrassing failure and folly. A jester is always good for a rousing tale or jest (thus the name), though some might leave those around him concerned about his sanity, or taste. Jesters thrive on being difficult to read, and work best when their opponents are hesitant and off-step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jesters combine abilities of pure luck, verbal manipulation, sneakiness and magic, including the quirky Random Spell ability, which allows a jester to cast a spell that doesn't use up a spell slot; the only problem is that he doesn't know which spell he will cast! So add some chaos to your campaign today. Add the jester, and just see what happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
