							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Samurai Rundown</name>
									
			<description>The fortress has fallen. The battle lost. The forces are scattered. You're on the run! You can't tell who is friend or foe. Suddenly you hear a noise! Your enemy is upon you! You have to attack! But with what? You've forgotten his weakness! No matter, attack with all you have! Pray you'll go down with honor and your ancestors will be forgiving. Attack!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samurai Rundown is a tile based player versus player game with card based battles. Players start on a tile based map and go around collecting items and weapons, and revealing map tiles. When a player thinks they have enough weapons, they go after their enemy to attack them. When they are adjacent to their enemy, they initiate a card battle. The loser of the card battle loses a heart. When a samurai loses 3 hearts they die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the last samurai standing to win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samurai Rundown also has a showdown mode. When all the weapons are found and drawn. All samurai drop their hearts to one from being exhausted and head to the nearest temple to duel. The samurai then battle to the death. The last samurai standing here is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the last samurai standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
