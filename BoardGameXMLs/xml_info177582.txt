			<description>ダイス 木 (Daisuki) is a game in which the players take on the role of lumberjacks, chopping down trees in the mountain forest in order to collect wood and build houses. Along the way, they will run into fires and termites, but the lumberjack who can hold onto the most wood and build the best buildings will win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game starts with a mountain made of wood disks. Players take turns drawing a disk at random and revealing what they have &amp;quot;harvested&amp;quot; from the forest. As players start controling more wood, they can use those wood chips to buy better equipment, put out fires, build houses, etc. It's a chance and dice game of press-your-luck with a little bit of attack-your-opponents as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
