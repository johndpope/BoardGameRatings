							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sumikko-gurashi Welcome to Sumikko Park</name>
									
			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Sumikko Park is a the fifth game from Nippon Columbia featuring the Nook Dweller characters lineup. Like the previous games, it's mainly a collection of mini-games, but unlike the previous single-player games for the 3DS, Welcome to Sumikko Park is a party game for several players at the same time. Each player selects a character, and players take turns rolling the die, moving all the characters across a game-of-life-esque virtual board. Depending on where the characters stop, there might or might not be a simple mini game, where the winner will earn &amp;quot;Sumiccoins&amp;quot;. Other effects of spaces are gaining or losing Sumiccoins automatically. The player with the most Sumiccoins when the characters reach the goal will win the game. All collected Sumiccoins, can be bought to buy new shelves, rugs, chairs, sofas and so on for the Nook Dweller's rooms, or clothes for the Nook Dwellers themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
