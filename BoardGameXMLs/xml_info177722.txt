			<description>Each player chooses a Disney character He puts the character&amp;rsquo;s picture in front of him and pushes out all the pieces; eyes, gloves, pants, shoes, hat and jacket.&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns to flick the Spinner round the Disney Circle. If the pointer comes to rest on a jacket, the player places the jacket on his character. If it comes to rest on a shoe, he puts one shoe on his character and so on. If the character already has the item on which the pointer has come to rest, the player doesn't score that time round. If the pointer comes to rest on a star the player may choose any one item and put it in position. The first player to complete dressing his character wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
