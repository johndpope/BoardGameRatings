			<description>Scotland, 1650 - the moon is full tonight.  Its light shines down upon the ruined house in front of you.  When you were a child, the name of Drochsolas was enough to give you nightmares.  Now, you are a grown man, and a veteran of many battles, but the name is still enough to send shivers up your back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years ago, Drochsolas Manse was home to a Baron, just as it had been to his ancestors.  Since his death, it has stood abandoned and despised, but not forgotten.  The mansion is a constant reminder of the evil which once dwelt there, the evil which many say dwells there still.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally the Baron died, but the farmland still did not regain its past fertility, and so the people still suffered from famine and poverty.  Since the stormy night when the Baron's body was placed in his family tomb and his sole remaining servant fled from the place forever, no one has dared approach the Manse.  The brave men who ventured into that place to perform the burial have spoken of how they could sense the spirit of the Baron still watching them somehow.  They had hoped to entomb his evil along with his mortal remains, but they had failed.  The hand of the Baron still reaches out from Drochsolas Manse to choke the life from the people, and the ghost of his daughter still wanders the halls of the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And so it is to that cursed place that you have come.  Tonight, under the light of the moon, you will challenge the darkness inside Drochsolas Manse in an attempt to cure the blight which has ruined the land...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Brian P. Dean. Written in TADS.&lt;br/&gt;IF Comp 1996: 7th place of 27 entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Official Release Notes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
