							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit</name>
									
			<description>Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit! is an action/platforming video game very loosely based on the hit sitcom Home Improvement.&lt;br/&gt;On a special broadcast of the show Tool Time, Tim prepares to unveil the new Binford ultra power tool line name after him, the Binford-Taylor Turbo Power Tool Line. He goes to retrieve them, only to discover that they are missing and a note left in their place demanding Tim to come and get them.&lt;br/&gt;The player's weapons include modified tools such as a nail gun, a blowtorch (used as a flamethrower), and a chainsaw which inexplicably hurls energy waves. These weapons are used to fight dinosaurs, acid-spewing mummies, robot sentries, and other enemies. The game is broken down into four worlds of four levels, each world containing a boss level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Home Improvement (video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
