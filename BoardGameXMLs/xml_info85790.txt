							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Divinity Core Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies are everywhere. You are a Divinity; an entity given 'Divine' status by your mortal worshipers. You cannot watch your flock by yourself, so you will need allies in order to protect them. How will you keep your worshipers from being won over by rivals? Can you keep your Divinity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Divinity RPG is designed for those who want to role-play gods and goddesses. However, Divinity seeks to look beyond the anthromorphic approach of viewing them. How about becoming a member of a &amp;quot;machine collective&amp;quot; or being the spirit guide for your ancestral family?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divinity makes very few assumptions about your game. You make it happen. Claim your Divinity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Divinity? It is a 60+ page guide for running a RPG in which the players have god-like powers. It is designed to be stand alone as a settingless game or it is possible to use it as an aid for adding a layer of the &amp;quot;divine&amp;quot; into your own game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player is given a lot of power but he or she has a lot of responsibility as well. They depend on the worship and/or services provided by mortals. As a result, there is a give and take relationship with their worshipers. You will advice for considering scenerios taking place in the distant past to the far future. Nuture your mortals in the past or protect them for rivals in the future. Consider alternative dimensions or eras in between the distant past or the far future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With ten power groups and the ability to decide what skills you want, it is easy to customize your character. A simple karma system for task resolution allows for a player to show up to your game with only a pen, some paper and an imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
