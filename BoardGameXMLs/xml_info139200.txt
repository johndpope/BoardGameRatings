			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wreck-It Ralph is a compilation of five games for mobile devices released in 2012 as part of Disney's promotion of a film of the same name which ostensibly takes place inside several arcade games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the film, the games are linked by Game Central Station. In this compilation Game Central Station is the hub menu, from which the player can swipe left and right to see the games available, along with high scores, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five games are included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fix-It Felix Jr. - An 8-bit style platformer where the eponymous Felix must use his magic hammer to fix windows of an apartment block which have been broken by Ralph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sugar Rush Sweet Climber - A Doodle Jump clone where Ralph must bounce from branch to branch, reaching ever higher. Control is by tilting the device. Ralph needs to watch out for multi-coloured branches, which break on contact. Ralph is equipped with a soda-powered jetpack, which can be topped up by collecting bottles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero's Duty - A dual-stick, top-down shooter in the Robotron / Smash TV mould. Waves of Cy-bugs assault the lone player. Power-ups for the player's weapon can be picked up, such as three-way shots, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turbo Time - A top-down racer similar to Super Sprint. Originally not included in the Android version. Added in the 28th June 2013 update.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hero's Duty Flight Command - A shoot-em-up similar to Zaxxon, though the height of your ship does not change. Each level consists of two stages, in the first your ship flies at low level avoiding or shooting obstacles and Cy-bugs. After defeating a boss Cy-bug, the player must escape at high speed while avoiding indestructible obstacles. Added to both the Android and iOS versions in the 28th June 2013 update.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fix-It Felix Jr. was released standalone on iOS, and versions were also available as a web browser game and in a full-size arcade cabinet. The other games are exclusive to the compilation. Note that &amp;quot;Hero's Duty&amp;quot; is a substantially different game to that released standalone as a web browser game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
