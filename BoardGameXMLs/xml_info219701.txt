			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;王さまとカフェ (King and Cafe) is a game of speed, where players are vying to fill the most cafe orders for the king.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, one player is chosen as king, while all others take the role of local cafe managers.  Each player draws a hand of seven cards.  There is a pile of order cards for the king and ingredients for the managers.  The king briefly displays all of their order cards and then the managers are allowed to adjust their hand of ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of each round, the king chooses an order card and plays it face up to the table.  All of the cafe managers then race to gather the ingredients from their hand and touch the standee of the king.  The first player to successfully complete the order, receives the order card and its points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Managers are then allowed to discard and draw until they have a hand of seven cards in preparation for the next round.  After seven rounds have passed, the cafe managers tally up the value of the order cards they completed.  The player with the highest total wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
