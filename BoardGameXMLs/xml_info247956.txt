			<description>How many times did you watch the sky thinking about the shape of the clouds?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nubes is a game in which you have one minute to guess and build more shape of the clouds than your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player in turn takes one card from the deck. Then he/she must build the object in the card using 16 clouds of 8 different shapes/sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other players must guess which object it is. No speaking or sounds are allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who says the correct object keeps the card (one point) and the active players takes another card until time is up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active player receives one point for each guessed object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
