			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNLICENSED GAME&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game is an unlicensed version of Microsoft Flight Simulator X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prepar3D is Lockheed Martin's continuation of the Microsoft Flight Simulator family of games. It is based on the Microsoft ESP simulator, which is the commercial-user version of Microsoft Flight Simulator X. While Prepar3D is fully licensed and authorized by Microsoft, the limitations of that license prevent it being sold for &amp;quot;personal computer entertainment&amp;quot;. It is however seen by many members of the flight sim community as the natural continuation of the series, and the licensing constraints that it is sold under are not seen as a limitation to the end user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While superficially v3 is not as big an update as v2, it does incorporate a number of new technologies including Autodesk Scaleform and SpeedTree. It also introduced native support for an Avatar Mode, allowing users to exit their vehicles and navigate the environment using a human model in first- or third-person modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;v3 also includes additional aircraft created by third party developers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     H-60 Black Hawk (Virtavia)&lt;br/&gt;     F-35A [new version] (India India Alpha Foxtrot Echo)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While retaining the same name as its predecessors, it is sold as a separate product, much like an annual edition of a sports video game franchise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
