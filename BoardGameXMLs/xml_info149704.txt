			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;Jak&amp;aacute;lla Foreign Quarter is tough place, not quite lawless anarchy, but the authorities care little what happens to na- kom&amp;eacute; scum, foreigners and aliens and only shift themselves to intervene in crime when riots are threatened and inducements offered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This leaves the field free for &amp;lsquo;freelance&amp;rsquo; law enforcement by the inhabitants themselves and opportunities for those down on their luck to haul themselves out of poverty by preying on those even less lucky. Tsoly&amp;aacute;nu may be a paradise to its citi- zens, who hymn the Emperor every day for his divinely man- dated rule, but is a cruel place to the non-citizen, foreigner and outcast. The resultant gangsterism is tolerated as long as it stays within the walls of the Foreign Quarter and does not affect any citizens of any standing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from The Plan:&lt;br/&gt;Having been rescued from a days highly demeaning and unpaid labour in the sewers, the PCs will no doubt be curious as to what J&amp;uuml;ggash has in mind. He ushers his men into the front room of a run down wine shop and explains the deal; evict the &amp;Uuml;gremish, a bunch of no good Nakom&amp;eacute; scum and he is willing to pay 40 hl&amp;aacute;sh, 10 up front, 30 on completion of job and bonuses for captives, 5 hl&amp;aacute;sh for a child under 14, 10 hl&amp;aacute;sh for a woman, and 12 hl&amp;aacute;sh for a man. There are 10 men, 12 women and 18 children as far J&amp;uuml;ggash can tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
