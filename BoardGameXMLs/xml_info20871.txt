			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A points scoring game of &amp;lsquo;facing capture&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;waiting capture&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;void captures&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp; &amp;lsquo;capture proper&amp;rsquo; for 2 to 8 player&amp;rsquo;s played on an classically designed, yet attractively different, checkered board where war is fought IN every direction &amp;amp; FROM every direction!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Classic in Waiting, in Tradition, and in Style, Babylonia&amp;trade; is a social 2 to 8 players points scoring capture game, where the winner is the player with the most point at the end of the game after deductions have been made. In this game the player&amp;rsquo;s men are called &amp;lsquo;Zealots&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking turns, a move is to lay your Zealot on the board, then totaling your scores, if any, for that turn - and that&amp;rsquo;s about it really, but don't be misled; from humble beginnings the whole board will soon have you on your toes! So watch out. You have been warned!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
