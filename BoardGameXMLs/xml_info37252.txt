			<description>An antique dexterity game from Parker Brothers. The playing board contained inside the box bottom consisted of nine inverted metal bells of varying sizes marked with scores from 25 to 100. Using  five small metal balls and a spring-arm catapult, the object was to score the most point by flinging the balls into the higher scoring bells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colorful box cover shows three dogs playing the game. The rules are printed inside the lid. The game also included a small advertising insert for other Parker Brothers games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
