							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Vakantielandenspel: Frankrijk</name>
									
			<description>Name translates to 'Highlights of the Game: France', part of a series of such games with different countries being the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a game where you can show off your knowledge of France by answering questions on History, Art, Culture, Sport and Food.By answering questions correctly, and with a little luck, you will collect souvenirs of the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of 48 question cards, 30 souvenir cards, one round ard, 1 rules card and 1 pamphlet with informative background information about your holiday destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each card there are questions in 5 categories and each is designated with its own icon and colour. The five categories in full are;&lt;br/&gt;Eten en Drinken (Green) - Eating and Drinking&lt;br/&gt;Geschiedenis (Yellow) - History&lt;br/&gt;Sport, Spel en Vakantie (Orange) - Sport, Games and Holidays&lt;br/&gt;Kunst en Cultuur (Red) - Art and Culture&lt;br/&gt;Stad en Land (Blue) - Cities and Countries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On each card the category questions are in a different order. On the back of each card are the answers. You play in rounds. The Round Card is placed on the bottom of the deck. You start with the first question on the card you have just drawn. If the Round Card is on the top of the deck, you put it back on the bottom and then ask the second question, and so on until 6 rounds have been played. On the question cards there are also commands, recognizable because the icon box is blank. These commands are on the lines of &amp;quot;Change a Souvenir to a different colour, Lose a souvenir, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Question reader is the player to the left of the player whose turn it is. If the question is answered correctly, the player receives a souvenir in the same category of the question. If the player answers incorrectly then that player must lose a souvenir (if he has one) in that category. The question card is then placed on the bottom of the stack and the turn passes to the next player in a clockwise direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maximum number Souvenirs&lt;br/&gt;The number of souvenirs that a player may have in a category is a a maximum of '2 players - 3', '3 or 4 players - 2'.. If a player gets a question in the category of which he already has reached the maximum, then he can choose a souvenir of any other category if he answers correctly. At the end of your turn you can exchange any 2 matching souvenir cards for one in any other category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the first player to get souvenirs in all 5 categories&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
