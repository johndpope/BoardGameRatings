							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gundam War Nex-A</name>
									
			<description>The successor of the Gundam War CCG. Although most mechanics are still similar, Gundam War Nex-A was designed as the next &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; of the CCG, featuring a different card backs and streamlined rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the namesake implies, players take control of the various Mobile Suits and pilots of the different Gundam series. In addition to the previous shows, such as the ones set in the Universal Century like Zeta and Char's Counterattack, the game also features the alternate timeline series, such as Wing, 00, Turn-A and, the newest addition, Gundam Age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Similar to Gundam War, combat in Gundam War Nex-A is still divided into two zones, Earth and Space, with the players able to designate different Units into squads. Players attack one another in turn, attempting to deplete each others' Nation Pile(Draw deck), in order to win. Character or Operation cards can be placed on existing Units, giving the assigned Mobile Suit or Armor a bonus in its stats or additional effects. Command cards also give one time effects which players may trigger during their appropriate phases. Ace cards, the rarest card type typically found in boosters, combine Units and Characters into one cost efficient card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike Gundam War however, Gundam War Nex-A no longer has Generation(Resource) cards. Instead, each card can be played as a resource. Further, Roll-ing(Tapping/activating) a card may now include a cost in resources. Alternatively, players have the option of using Graphic card, which combines resource generation, buffing and defense into one card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the card backs of Gundam War Nex-A are different from Gundam War, Gundam War cards can still be converted for use in Gundam War Nex-A, though with a penalty or drawback of sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gundam War Nex-A is only available in Japanese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
