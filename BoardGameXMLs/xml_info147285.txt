							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Red Queen</name>
									
			<description>The Red Queen is a card game pitting a team of 2 to 5 players against the infamous Queen of Hearts, a character as unpredictable as Lewis Caroll described in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Using deduction to work out how best to advance their plans, the team must assemble an army of soldiers to challenge the Red Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Red Queen, the player cards are facing outwards in such a manner that all players except the one holding them will know what they are. Each round players will be able to give clues to one another to lift part of the mystery surrounding the pool of cards they collectively possess, build their army, or use special roles actions to help them in this endeavour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... meanwhile the evil Red Queen will continually interfere with the team using a set of treacherous actions in the hope to make them lose 'heart', literraly, the currency representing the team's morale in the game. Her own army will also grow throughout the game, putting the team under pressure to raise their own as efficiently as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game features a strong thematic element and role cards based on characters directly inspired by Lewis Caroll's work. Alice herself takes on a key role too, unsurprisingly, but as an outsider will be of equal support to both sides and it is up to the players to make the most of her abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
