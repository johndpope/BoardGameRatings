			<description>A Free Cheapass Game:&lt;br/&gt;Queensland is a game for two players that uses a checkers set and a pad of paper to keep score.  You play by optionally moving a piece which was previously placed and then placing a piece.  The goal is to score points by counting the number of open squares between two of your pieces.  Played in two rounds.  The player with the higher score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
