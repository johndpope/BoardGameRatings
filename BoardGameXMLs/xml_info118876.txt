			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full speed ahead!  Sepio, the sea-monster wants to be the first to reach the light house.  In order to prevent this, Capt'n Sharky and his crew try to sail around the dangerous obstacles to win the race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An exciting race game where the players have to use their capacity for remembering in order to move the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 18 obstacle cards with three symbols on each card which are placed face down in a circle with a gemstone on top.  There are also 14 sea cards which each have one symbol.  After 30 seconds of studying them, they are also turned face down.  On your turn you turn up an obstacle card and then try to turn up a sea card which matches one of the symbols on the card.  If you succeed, you collect the gemstone and move your ship forward between the next two cards.  You can try it two more times, but the second time you must turn up two sea cards that match two symbols and the last time, 3 sea cards that match three symbols.  Anytime you fail, the sea monster moves forward one obstacle card.  Also, if you failed after collecting one or two gemstones, those gemstones are then placed on the last cards.  The player with the most gemstones wins unless everyone loses.  All players will lose if everyone takes on too much risk and the sea-monster passes the last obstacle card first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game-play thus incorporates both memory, press your luck and a bit of cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
