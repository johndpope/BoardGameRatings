							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Twelve Elements of War</name>
									
			<description>Welcome to the Eastlands of Dothmora, a realm riven by intrigue, feuding lords and warbands fighting in the secretive Shadow War. It is a land steeped in rune magic and blood, yet one where the various races &amp;ndash; humans, elves, dwarfs, fauns, trolls, ogres, orcs, goblins and halflings &amp;ndash; live in harmony, owing allegiance not to race but to one of the mighty factions that make up this war-torn kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve Elements of War is a 28mm Tabletop skirmish wargame. A typical warband will include between 7 - 12 models (depending on your faction and style of play), activating one model at a time. Players alternate turns activating models, keeping both players engaged and thinking. Despite only activating one model at a time, it successfully simulates combined attacks with multiple models; the first attacks in a round weaken and lock-down a model, making it easier to finish off by attackers later in a round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It uses a multiple D6 dice, one-roll system for all rolls during a battle. Roll a number of dice equal to the Model Statistic that you are using to attack/defend/employ, add bonus dice if you have an advantage of some type, like charging. Compare the result of this roll to the enemy model's statistic or enemy model's roll to see if you succeed. The dice system does not use charts or tables &amp;amp; is used for all rolls, making the game extremely easy to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad range of Faction Lists each bring something special to the battlefield, and each faction choose from the 9 fantasy races. Each Faction is balanced to each other, despite having multiple fantasy races and at least 6 roles per Faction to choose from. Successfully employing a variety of different races performing melee, shooting or magic roles on the battlefield is the key to winning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 20 different mission combinations ensures that each game of Twelve Elements of War will different from the next. Creating a balanced warband is only the start; quick thinking, using the right model at the right time &amp;amp; an assertive battleplan is the key to completing your objectives while denying your opponent theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fun with Twelve Elements of War doesn't finish after one game. Twelve Elements of War has a complete Campaign system that sees your models gain experience, better abilities, new skills, money and magical runic items as they play battles and also explore the world of Lumria acquiring strange and unique items. You will also have the option to visit a town after each game. In town you can choose to go to the Tavern to recruit new members and heroes, The Market to purchase new items and equipment, the Arena to watch pit fighting and maybe pick up a few pointers. Lastly the Temple, where you can prey to the gods to heal your wounds or ask for their blessing in future battles. In addition to visiting these places, you roll on one of four unique &amp;ldquo;random encounter charts&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games can be played on a vast variety of battlefield types, from cautious tactical advances in the snow covered Forest of Sighs, to fast paced skirmishes leaping from building top to building top in the sprawling Port City of Arcadia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, with 100's of magical  item combinations to try out and over 36 unique runic spells to cast with your magic users, this game has a large amount of re-playability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factions in the core book include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The elite soldiers of Highguard, vying to restore their city-state to its former glory.&lt;br/&gt;- The tough, guerrilla warriors of the Mining Guild, seeking to control valuable mineral resources across the continent.&lt;br/&gt;- The Geniocracy of Toth, who strive to expand their knowledge of technology, science and magic &amp;ndash; by sword&amp;rsquo;s edge if need be. &lt;br/&gt;- The sorcerers of the Shadow Hold, adepts at runic magic, and served by thrall workers and brainwashed fighters. They scour the land for lost runic artifacts and raid other factions to capture   slaves. &lt;br/&gt;- The stern Keepers of Talon Crag Citadel, who have vowed to the gods to hunt down all who dare toy with the more dangerous aspects of runic magic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With more to follow n the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
