			<description>Lover'sopoly was created for the sole intended purpose of creating a game intended for married couples that most adult board games on the market today do not offer.  Most adult board games today are very shallow and have no depth to them.  married couples have often purchased &amp;quot;sex games&amp;quot; that come and go and offer no substance.  Lover'sopoly touches on every level of marriage relationship from intimacy, to sex, to romance and even humor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are by rolling the dice and advancing to the next space.  Spaces consist of &amp;quot;action spaces&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;Pandora's Box&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Naughty or Nice&amp;quot;.  When landing on an action space the individual has the right to purchase the space and build on the space &amp;quot;time chips&amp;quot;.  By purchasing more time chips they receive more time with the action when their spouse lands on it.  &amp;quot;Padora's Box&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Naughty or Nice&amp;quot; are not properties open to ownership but rather actions or questions that are fueled throughout the game and keep the game interesting and moving along.  The goal is to own as many of the desired action properties but watch out because your partner may earn the right to purchase an action property right from under your nose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The action properties are the most creative portion of the game.  Ladies, how would you like to receive a nice 3 minute kneck massage every time your partner lands on your space?  &lt;br/&gt;Or perhaps you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind your partner drawing a seductive pose of you in your birthday suite?  Men, how would you like your spouse enjoying a nice dessert off of your mid-section?  Or perhaps having your wife describe your most attractive features?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has everything for both male and female and is the perfect way to spark up a relationship.  Loversopoly makes the best Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day gift as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
