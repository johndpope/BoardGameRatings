			<description>From the box: &amp;quot;IV-V-I is a game where harmony and music form the backdrop for composing phrases in order to score points and win.&amp;nbsp; But watch out!&amp;nbsp; Twists and turns await in the form of part writing errors and styles that change the game entirely.&amp;nbsp; With its unique and intuitive method of play, anyone can jump in and join the fun - regardless of musical training!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In IV-V-I ('four-five-one') players take turns using the cards to create harmonic phrases, laying down up to three harmony cards and two voice leading cards per turn.&amp;nbsp; They can also play part writing errors on their opponents to hinder their progress.&amp;nbsp; Errors that are not corrected mean the relevant cards are not scored, and in some cases reduce a player's score!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Composer cards allow players to break the rules to a point, but if the composer is taken out of play, what cards had been played that break the rules no longer can be counted toward a player's score. &amp;nbsp;When a player is ready to score, he locks his phrase during his turn by playing a cadence card (cadences are ends of musical phrases) and scores his progression (point values are listed on each card) up to the cadence.&amp;nbsp; He then clears his tableau and will start a new phrase on his next turn.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When a player has finished playing cards during a turn, he will refresh his hand and game play passes to the next player. &amp;nbsp;Players pre-determine a stopping point score-wise, with the first player attaining that score declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
