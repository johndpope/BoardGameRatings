							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Order of Vampire Hunters: Vibora and the Jararaca Expansion</name>
									
			<description>This expansion for The Order of Vampire Hunters includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 Highly Detailed Plastic Miniatures:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Vibora and Culebra&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; 6 Jararaca&lt;br/&gt;2 Vampire ID Cards.&lt;br/&gt;15 Vampire Encounter Cards.&lt;br/&gt;4 Vampire Activation Cards.&lt;br/&gt;1 Rule Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vibora is a powerful Elder Vampire, more than 500 years old. She is always seen with a small pack of decrepit minionsand her familiar, a massive python, Culebra. Her origins are lost in time, but her reptilian nature is clear. She controls all snakes in her vicinity and has a life-sustaining bond with Culebra: the python is as old as she is. Many in the Order say that Culebra is the source of her power, not vice versa. Early stories describe Vibora as a beautiful, beguiling woman but this could simply be a myth. Now, she is a hideous scaled creature. Hunters that have survived an encounter with Vibora report it is the snake&amp;rsquo;s writhing dance that captivates them, not Vibora&amp;rsquo;s charms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jararaca are not of the true Vampire bloodline and don&amp;rsquo;t live as their own clan. They are simply Vibora&amp;rsquo;s most recent victims, unfortunate humans that persist in the undead state for a short while after they have turned. They are weak and tainted, not surviving long at best, and expiring quickly if separated from Vibora and the pack: what little life force Vibora passes on to them seems to be sustained only when they are together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
