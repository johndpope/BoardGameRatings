							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Flying Corps</name>
									
			<description>Flying Corps is a 1996 World War I flight simulator developed by Rowan Software and published by Empire Interactive. It was one of the most popular flight simulators of its time due to its accurate flight models and graphics, and also the novelty factor of a First World War dog fight simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is split in four campaigns: The Flying Circus (1917), Battle of Cambrai 1917, Spring Offensive (1918) and Hat In The Ring (1918). Several player flyable airplanes are available, including the Sopwith Camel, the Nieuport 28 and the Fokker Dr.I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Flying Corps&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back of Box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Aim for the man, not the machine.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find out how it feels to fly and flight with the thrilling forerunners to modern fighter planes and experience the gritty realism of airborne conflict in World War I. Forget the luxury of contemporary firepower and equipment. In 1917, aerial combat was intimate, and the tools of the trade limited to a machine run, nerves of steel, sharp wits and reflexes, and chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extensive research, meticulous modeling and advanced programming techniques mean unprecedented historical accuracy, breathtaking live landscapes, and authentic aircraft handling to unsettle the strongest stomachs. The result is more than mere flight simulation. Flying Corps is an exciting and exhilarating rendition of life and death in the skies of the Great War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Rewrite history in four full blown campaigns from the allied and enemy perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Join the Hat-In-The-Ring Squadron, the Jasta 11 Squadron, the Royal Flying Corps or take part in the Battle of Cambrai and attempt to better the skills and kills of airborne aces such as Eddie Rickenbacker and Baron Manfred Von Richthofen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Feel the benefits of detailed flight models in action and discover the true meaning of adverse yaw, gyroscopic force, torque, slipstream and inherent structural integrity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Beautifully built (and customizable) aircraft include the Sopwith Camel, Nieuport Scout, Spad XIII, Albatross DIII and Fokker DRI Triplane. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Breathtaking high-resolution three-dimensional landscapes recreated from archive material, period aerial photography and satellite and cruise missile contour data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Believable computer-controlled pilots with artificial intelligence that learn from their experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Multiple skill settings cater to novices and veterans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Comes complete with an authentic replica pilots manual and terrain maps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flight sims don't get more real than Flying Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inside Box Flap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take control of the Albatross DIII, Fokker D.R.1 Triplane, SE5a, Sopwith Camel and Nieuport Scout: Six beautifully modeled aircraft, accurate down to the smallest historical and technical detail, and with fully customizable paint schemes. Learn to stall, climb on turns, control spins, and perform maneuvers such as Immelmann turns, horizontal vrilles, side-slipping, loops and the split S. The flight models are so comprehensive you can feel the effects of the adverse yaw, gyroscopic force, torque, slipstream, and inherent structural integrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attention to detail is unprecedented. This labour of love features intricate three-dimensional landscapes recreated from archive material (including period aerial photography), sound effects sampled from as many actual sources as possible, and an authentic replica of a flying manual actually used by pilots in WWI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Surprise is the first factor of success in aerial fighting and an ability to out maneuver your opponent the second.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fly dozens of daring missions in full blown campaigns or rewrite history. Multiple skill settings cater for novices and veterans, and a considerate learning curve means it won't be too long before the flyers and formations are under your direct control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flying Circus. The Red Baron's infamous Jasta 11 Squadron is yours to command against the Royal Flying Corps, including the formidable 56th Squadron and British ace Albert Ball. The Allied ground offensive is intensifying. Vimy Ridge has fallen and Douai airbase will follow unless you can turn the tables and match Manfred von Richthofen's success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Cambrai. The German defense is collapsing under the weight of Allied forces. Hundreds of tanks and troops are closing in on Cambrai, and squadrons of Royal Flying Corps are about to turn up the heat. Prove your worth as a Jasta commander: cover your ground forces' retreat, help neutralize the massive assault and initiate counter-attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hat-In-The-Ring. The US Expeditionary force has unleashed its new aerial pursuit squadrons. Now it's your chance to emulate ace Eddie Rickenbacker's skills and kills. Lead the famous 94th squadron to victory and be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by the end of the War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spring Offensive. In 1918 the Germans are making a last ditch attempt to reclaim three years of lost ground. Their tanks, aircraft and infantry are pushing hard to claim Arras and Amiens. But you, a new Royal Flying Corps pilot are going to aid the push back and help bring the War to its climax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
