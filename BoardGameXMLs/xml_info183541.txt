							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Patagonia War</name>
									
			<description>Argentina and Chile almost came to blows over Patagonia at the turn of the century before war was averted. What if peace negotiations had not been achieved? Who would have won the naval contest? Now, using Avalon Hill's Victory in the Pacific (VITP), you can find out for yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avalon Hill games, though dated, are still among the most fun to play. Unfortunately, they can take a long, long time to play. Even game of VITP can take a good 4-6 hours to play to completion. Patagonia War allows players to play a game with a similar system, but in a much shorter time (5 turns, 3 sea areas, 26 ships).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VAIPA Quarterly #10, Patagonia War, contains the following items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The Rulebook &lt;br/&gt;2. The Map &lt;br/&gt;3. Twelve Chile ship counters. Fourteen Argentina ship counters. Six Control markers (counters). &lt;br/&gt;4. Small zip lock bags to place your counters into (Your option).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, since this game is based on Avalon Hill&amp;rsquo;s Victory in the Pacific game, you will need a copy of that game. Specifically, you will need:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. Damage markers &lt;br/&gt; b. Disabled markers &lt;br/&gt; c. Sunk markers &lt;br/&gt; d. Dice &lt;br/&gt; e. Rulebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
