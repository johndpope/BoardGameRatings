			<description>Arctic Moves is a 2-dimensional action-adventure game shooter game being the third chapter of the Moves Trilogy and followed by Army Moves in 1986 and Navy Moves in 1987. The game was developed by Dinamic Software and designed to be published for the Atari ST, but this version was not released due to Dinamic's Software bankruptcy (1992). The game was later ported for the PC MS-DOS based computers and published in 1995 by Dinamic Multimedia (founded by a part of Dinamic Software owners). The Atari ST version was finally developed by Luis Mariano Garcia (an ex member of Dinamic Software and later, Dinamic Multimedia). An Amiga conversion of the Atari ST version was released in February 2017 by Meynaf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Story&lt;br/&gt;After being successful on his previous missions in Army Moves and Navy Moves, Derdhal must now travel to the Arctic and infiltrate a base held by aliens who want to use future human technology for their causes. A U-92 submarine takes Derdhal outside the arctic base and he must use his weapons and skills to finally find out what is going on. The game follows the issues of the previous ones, especially in difficulty levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;The game is split into two parts. At the first part (Mission 1) you start on the frozen surface of the Arctic, where you infiltrate the enemy base to destroy the communications system and destroy all their vehicles; get the job done and obtain the code for the second part (Mission 2). After ending the first part you'll get a code, useful to unlock the second mission (a typical scenario for Dinamic Software games). In the first part, you'll fight with hordes of various enemies varying from arctic commandos to air troops, who will shoot or throw grenades instantly! Note also that there are several mounted machine guns scattered around the areas. Apart of shooting, the game offers a lot of platform game style action, in which you have to jump to higher grounds in order to reach certain spots and objects. Not only you have to defend your precious energy bar, you have also to watch the limited time offered before ending your mission. Hopefully, there are scattered energy bonuses (depicted as hearts) and extra time bonuses (depicted as clocks) for you to collect. The second part is a bit different. Still an action-adventure game, but now running inside the alien spaceship! Your mission now is to connect 7 main systems of the spaceship. In there, terror is all over the place while walking in the dark corridors. Robots and deadly alien species will come on you to terminate your quest! Note also that there are a few huge beasts called CAPITOSAURUS, some of them throwing acid balls, which will only be killed by grenades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Arctic Moves&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
