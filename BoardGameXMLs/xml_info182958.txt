							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Fall of the Tower</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fall of the Tower is a momentous adventure for the Accursed game line. It represents a turning point in the struggle for the future of Morden, a savage blow struck against either the Witches who have conquered the land or the Order of the Penitent that seeks to save it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Order has tracked down a woman whom they believe to be the last surviving Seelie Fey. With her help, it may be possible to strike and destroy Turris Atra, the Chimera's base of power. However, doing so risks the Order's own base of operations. Dare the heroes attempt such a crippling strike?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure was originally run exclusively at Gen Con 2014 for a group of Kickstarter Backers. It includes six pregenerated Witchmarked player characters. Those characters are also available as alternative face cards, compatible with our existing Accursed decks. These replace the Jacks of the appropriate suits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PDF version includes print &amp;amp; play versions of the cards, designed to be used with letter sized pre-perforated business card sheets, such as Avery 5870. Page 1 shows the card backs. page 2 shows the card faces. The PDF uses a monotone card background and back, to avoid alignment issues when printing on prepunched sheets. Both of these are markedly different from the Print on Demand version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
