							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Book of Terrible Creatures</name>
									
			<description>From the Foreword:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book could save your life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can't claim to have fought and killed every creature in these pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, I can't even claim to have run away from them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book will help you do both. Maybe even at the same time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all the creatures in this book are mindless monsters. Many are intelligent, some even more so than most humans. They have their own societies, religions, language and traditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, that doesn't mean they don't want to rip your guts out and eat them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exercise caution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
