			<description>Have you ever played with a ball, balloon, tennis ball or with the popular rubber ball?Sure you have. Each time it was universal and simple never-ending fun. That is what the conception of the GUMBOY game is based on, connecting the time-tested and popular characteristics of a rubber ball with the simplicity of the first video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUMBOY uses its extraordinary rubbery characteristics &amp;ndash; rolling, bouncing, jumping, flying and floating, which in connection with the simple controls brings you loads of fun. And even more when you realise that GUMBOY changes its size, shape and material! It joins the game in the form of a sphere, cube or star. It will be filled with rubber, air or water&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GUMBOY is refreshing and original fun for everyone, regardless of age or current game playing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
