			<description>Description from the designer:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The King is dead and the Kingdom of Meridia is at War!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the crown's greatest Warlord, the Kingdom is yours by right. But first you must prove your worth by defeating the lesser Warlords that would claim your throne. You'll need to win the loyalty of many followers, build mighty fortifications, and devise cunning tactics to become the new ruler of Meridia... May the best Warlord win!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warmonger is a simple yet strategic board game for 2-4 players, combining the structure of a deck building game with the direct player interaction of a war game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Warmonger, there are no dice; your deck controls every aspect of the game. The cards in your deck represent all of the resources at your disposal, and you'll use abilities granted by those cards to purchase new cards for your deck, recruit and move armies on the board, and defeat your opponents in battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
