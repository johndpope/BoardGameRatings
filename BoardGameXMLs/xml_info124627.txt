[Ed. note: Actually released one week later.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the police in Americas wildest TV chases, players smash felons off the road in a high production, large, free roaming and beautifully rendered city with aerial coverage of the pursuit and TV style &amp;lsquo;breaking news&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 20 missions and 5 different vehicles players complete escape, challenge and pursuit activities, collecting stars for their police badge to access new parts of the city and new more powerful vehicles.
