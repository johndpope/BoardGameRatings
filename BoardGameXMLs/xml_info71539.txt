							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Throne of the Sun Elves</name>
									
			<description>Elfland is in mourning over Dahla, queen of the Elves, who lost her life in the battle to free and unite the neighboring troll kingdom, before she could choose her successor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greed and mistrust are spreading amongst the members of the Elf Council. The Troll Lords stoke up this power struggle and ally themselves with one of the Council Members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone tries to gain power and win the throne of the magnificent Elf Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Throne of the Sun Elves is a game from Stefan Becker. It consists of a board with three levels and a die, each player receives four Trolls and two Elves Whoever gets their two Elves on the throne first is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A captivating strategic game - which Elf will win the throne?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game play consists of rolling and moving your Trolls to help your Elves claim the crown by blocking your opponent's Elves as you both climb to the throne in the center of the board, but watch out for your opponents Trolls and Elves blocking you from reaching the throne. Often it will be more important for you to work out the moves of your opponents Elves and stop them than with your Trolls (and temporarily your Elves) before you can work out how to move your Elves to the center. Think Quoridor where the Trolls are the walls but can move after being placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Art.-Nr.: 56.027&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- User summary and Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
