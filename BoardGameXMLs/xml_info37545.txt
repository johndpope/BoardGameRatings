			<description>&amp;quot;This is a modifiable dungeon-crawling game for 2-4 players.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One player takes on the role of the Dungeon Master. The other players each control a Hero who is exploring the dungeon. The game uses three to five custom card decks: a DM Deck (60 cards), a Dungeon Deck (30 cards), and a Hero Deck for each Hero player (60 cards.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Deck consists of cards specifying rooms and passages which are used to randomly create the dungeon. A Hero Deck consists of cards for various actions and treasures. The DM Deck consists primarily of cards representing monsters and traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hero players win if the Objective room card is located and resolved. The DM player wins if all of the Heroes are killed before they resolve the Objective room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
