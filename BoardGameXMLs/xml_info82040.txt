			<description>Bad News Baseball, originally released as Gekitō!! Stadium (激闘スタジアム, &amp;quot;Fierce Fighting!! Stadium&amp;quot;) in Japan, is a baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game lacked a season mode comparable to those of most modern baseball games. Instead, in the one-player mode the player's goal was to defeat every other team featured in the game in the order of their choosing. Wins and losses were not recorded, and the player could continue playing indefinitely until all other teams were defeated. While this meant that there was no set schedule of games, pitchers did have a stamina rating that once depleted would take several games worth of rest to recover from. In this way, the game simulated the idea of a pitching rotation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bad News Baseball&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
