			<description>Welcome to the bizarre world of Chō Aniki! This title was originally released in 1995, and was the only title in the long-running series to include digitized graphics for the majority of its objects and stages.&lt;br/&gt;Chō Aniki: Kyūkyoku Muteki Ginga Saikyō Otoko is the third shooting game in the series, released the same year as a Chō Aniki fighting game. The title does not have a one-to-one translation, but could be called &amp;ldquo;Super Big Bro: The Strongest, Most Ultimate Invincible Man in the Milky Way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At long last, Western gamers can now enjoy one of the most controversial titles ever released in Japan. The legendary Cho Aniki will grab you by the dingle berries and pull you into its world of wacky fun. Long known for being a true Japanese &amp;ldquo;kuso-ge&amp;rdquo;, we present the game in its original Japanese splendor. No political correctness here. And no telling how strange a journey you&amp;rsquo;ll take. Hop on board and let the shooting begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cho Aniki has always been a favorite of those with knowledge of the Japanese domestic game market. This classic icon of the shooter era created a special place as one of the most outrageous titles in the parody shooter legacy. Deemed too daring for Western markets, in reality, the game is a comic portrayal of over-the-top graphics in a time of over-abundance in the shooter genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you blast your way through multitudes of erotic bodybuilders, spinning corpses and head holes, you&amp;rsquo;ll find humor and challenge in completing every emphatic level. The game consists of an unending spiral of the weird and wacky. Cho Aniki is tough and will challenge your shooting skills, but in return, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a constant flow of humor and irony that will make you laugh as you blast your way through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This long-running series claims its first entry on the Japanese version of the TurboGrafx16, known as the PC Engine, and features muscle-bound manly men with holes in the tops of their heads. This 32-bit entry was originally released in 1995, and was the only title in the long-running series to include digitized graphics for the majority of its objects and stages. The game was also ported to the Sega Saturn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chō Aniki: Kyūkyoku Muteki Ginga Saikyō Otoko is the third shooting game in the series, released the same year as a Chō Aniki fighting game. The title does not have a one-to-one translation, but could be called &amp;ldquo;Super Big Bro: The Strongest, Most Ultimate Invincible Man in the Milky Way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this is not the best game in the series, it is probably the most visually bizarre, and also sports an excellent soundtrack from a variety of composers, but notably longtime series stalwart Koji Hayama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chō Aniki: Kyūkyoku Muteki Ginga Saikyō Otoko is a game for those who appreciate an extreme challenge &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t say we didn&amp;rsquo;t warn you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
