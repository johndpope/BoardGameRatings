			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Know NOTHING of My Power&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Inphinite, born on a Dynasty Citadel, and sent to Earth as an infant, Princess Sthenia (PL 13) was raised as a child of the gods. She led her people to many victories, but was confronted by Omega, who fought her to a stand-still. Her followers placed her in a sarcophagus in a temple. Unable to use her powers of energy vampirism, Sthenia languished in her tomb for thousands of years.&lt;br/&gt;The Nazi villain, Hauptman Arysh, found her and brought her back to fight with the German Afrika Corps against General Patton&amp;rsquo;s forces. Opposed by Sea Devil and the American hero, Victory, Sthenia was eventually sealed back into her tomb for good. Or was she ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iconic Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
