			<description>Game based on a character from a Spanish children's film about a young boy's journey from the Appenines to the Andes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;32 cards in four suits of 8 cards. The first player lays a card. The next player must play either the same colour card or the same value of the played card. The four cards numbered 5 may be played as a Joker and can represent any umber or colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to get rid of all the cards in your hand. First to do so scores nil points. The other players score points equal to the value of each card left in their hand. Wild cards still in a hand score 25 points against the holder. The player with the lowest score when a pre-arranged number of games have been played, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
