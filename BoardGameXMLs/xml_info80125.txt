							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Toeffrun Creation Myth</name>
									
			<description>Publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Countless civilizations throughout history have looked to nature or toward the heavens to justify the inexplicable in their lives. For some, the forces that shape the world are intangible, lack physical form or description, and exist largely as spiritual concepts. Others take a more palpable approach, giving those they worship qualities and faults, shaping the gods in their own image. Each ideology has a common need to quantify that which is unexplained, while maintaining its fear and reverence for their higher power. Those that live on the World of Revloc are no exception, and the beliefs of the people of the Kingdom of Toeffrus are highlighted in this Lexus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eleven new deities to use as an overlay for a part of a campaign world or to stand alone! This ten page Lexus details the Fall of the Archaics and the Rise of the Supernals!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
