							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Savannah Village</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rain showers of the rainy season have barely passed and luscious green grass has sprung up where there was only dusty barren ground mere days ago. One might even be tempted to think that this small village is surrounded by fertile lands. The few dead trees among and around the huts still give testament to the long droughts that have struck the land over the past few years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The huts of the village themselves are simple affairs. Their foundations and a few pillars carrying the roof are made from stone. The walls on the other hand are simple wickerwork and the roofs are thatched with the dried grass of past years. At the center of each hut there is a fireplace and a large hole in the roof to allow the smoke to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
