			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would like to propose a game where a modest amount of simple information makes a binary tree appropriate.  Branches can be labeled so that the ordering of the data is not critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guessing an animal is a game which many children approach on a random basis.  Especially when the starting letter is given, the child begins a scan through his &amp;quot;animal vocabulary&amp;quot; looking for a possible match with any entry beginning with that letter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guess That Animal!, subtitled Simulating Learning in Computers, was written by Daniel Hastie and published as type-in source code in Compute! Issue 27, August 1982.  It presents a simple &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; program that will guess the animal the player is thinking about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nine months later a version titled Sinclair/Timex Guess That Animal, written by Ralph Kennedy, was presented for the Sinclair ZX-81 - it was published in Compute! Issue 36, May 1983.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
