							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sternkrieg: A Game of Interstellar War</name>
									
			<description>Sternkrieg is a game of interstellar exploration and conquest. Each player represents a colony in the same area of space (the same constellation, according to the rules, although this is of course meaningless) which builds ships and sends them out to explore other regions, gaining raw materials which can be used to build more ships. Players can also use their ships to attack each other. Combat takes place either on a tactical hex grid (provided by the players, as would be the counters) or on a table using miniatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships and fortresses (which protect planets) are customizable, being built using a point system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was first published in 1976, with a second edition released in 1977. The differences between the two are not known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
