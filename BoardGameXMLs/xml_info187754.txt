							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mascha und der B채r: B체hne frei f체r Mascha!</name>
									
			<description>Masha lives in a little cottage in the woods. With her fun, games and pranks, she really turns the idyllic life of her neighbour, a former circus bear, topsy-turvy. All the bear wishes for is a quiet life, but bubbly Masha keeps on causing havoc, making sure the bear&amp;rsquo;s life is full of action and adventure!&lt;br/&gt;Today is Masha&amp;rsquo;s big day: the stage has been erected and all of her costumes are ready and waiting for her appearance. All of her friends are attending the show.&lt;br/&gt;Arrange exciting scenes and make sure to pay attention since also you will play an important role in Masha&amp;rsquo;s play! Fans of Masha can playfully test their memory with three amusing memo games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with three variants, and everytime you play, you choose the variant you prefer:&lt;br/&gt;Variant 1 - Can you see the difference? &lt;br/&gt;Variant 2 - Memo&lt;br/&gt;Variant 3 - True or false&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends as soon as each player has had four turns. The person with the most points after four turns wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
