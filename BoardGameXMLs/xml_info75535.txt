			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Role-playing games are meant to be run with an impartial referee who plans out adventures ahead of time and looks over all the myriad details of running the game.  But sometimes the referee can&amp;rsquo;t run a game.  Typically when this happens, the playing group either cancels the session entirely, or ends up playing a board game.  But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to happen this way.  The rules detailed in this document allow the players to run a session without a designated referee, and with no more than fifteen minutes of pre-game preparation.  It gets around the DM problem by separating the DM&amp;rsquo;s work into six main tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Essentially, the game is run via a set of random tables, with each player using die rolls and their own common sense to carry out their assigned task.  Each player is required to use a little discretion and a little impartiality, but only in one area of the game; and so they are still able to play and advance their character.  The Master is allowed to fudge with the results, modifying things as desired.  Masters are encouraged to make up different items not currently on the lists.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;There are two major sections for this rulebook.  The first section covers group play; the second section covers solo play.  Both focus on gamemasterless dungeon-crawling in randomly generated dungeons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some stat blocks are for a different fantasy roleplaying game, suggesting the supplement was being converted from an older supplemnt for another roleplaying game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
