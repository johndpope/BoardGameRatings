			<description>Hooked on Bass is a VCR board game about bass fishing. Players roll dice to move their boats around the board and fish by playing cards, rolling dice, and cross-referencing the results with their board location in a reference book that comes with the game. Players who fish successfully play the VCR tape to determine what size of fish they caught. The player who catches the highest total weight of fish during the day wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
