			<description>Enchanted Cave is a free browser game created by Dustin Auxier in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enchanted Cave is a simple Dungeon Crawler in which you must fight your way down 100 dungeon levels to the end of the game and defeat The Master.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whilst delving you will collect equipment, gems and gold in order to upgrade and improve your statistics allowing you to delve further and further into the dungeon each session. Equipment can be brought and sold at shops which appear every 10 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enchanted Cave uses a save system and has a findable item called Escape Wings which allows you to bail out of the dungeon when close to death so that you can continue fresh from the last visited shop. It also boasts randomly spawning enemies and randomised levels meaning no two sessions are the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequel simply called The Enchanted Cave 2 was released in early 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click this Link to Play Enchanted Cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
