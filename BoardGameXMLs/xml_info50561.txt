							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gwenthia (Second Iteration)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This book describes the world of Gwenthia: its geography, its peoples, its history, its politics, its gods, and its possibilities. The concept behind Gwenthia evolved at &amp;lsquo;The Tavern&amp;rsquo; (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://tavern.zunder.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://tavern.zunder.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;) as a shared world similar to Chaosium&amp;rsquo;s old Questworld project of the late 1980s. Beginning with a simple map, Tavern members quickly staked land claims and began the co-operative process of developing cultures peoples, creatures and conflicts to fill those lands and influence others. Gwenthia was rapidly born, and is still in a state of development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed with BRP in mind, Gwenthia is designed to work with any set of roleplaying rules or mechanics: ready-published, hybrid or home-grown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intention of this book is to draw together the basic settings of Gwenthia and present them in one place for gamers to use for their own campaigns.
