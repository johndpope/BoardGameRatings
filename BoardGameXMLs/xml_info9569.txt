							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Last Starfighter Combat Game</name>
									
			<description>Starfighters of opposing forces clash in space. Laser beams cut through ships as they explode and die. Torpedoes smash into others igniting them in great balls of fire. The two forces are fighting for control of the galaxy and both sides feel the need to win this battle. Your commander sends in reinforcements constantly until finally it is your time. You don your flight suit and climb into your ship then you realize that it's all up to you for you are The Last Starfighter&lt;br/&gt;Players choose to be pilots for the Rylosians, striving to save the galaxy or pilots of the dread Ko-Dan armada attempting to subjugate the civilized worlds. The Last Starfighter uses a simple system for simultaneous action. Players plan their [sic] moves, and plot them on an easy-to-use plotting sheet, hoping to outmaneuver their opponents. Then they execute their moves, get the enemy in their sights and FIRE!&lt;br/&gt;This game includes 78 colorful playing pieces, a 17-x 22-inch map sheet, rulebook, a pad of plotting sheets and 2 dice. Everything you need for a galaxy of fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
