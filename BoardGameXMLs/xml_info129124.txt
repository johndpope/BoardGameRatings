			<description>A simple, turtle-themed racing game for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows a racing track made up of tomatoes and salad. Each player has two turtles and a peg in the same colour (so they don't forget what colour they are). The aim of the game is to get one's turtles to the end of the track first. Players take turns rolling the colour die. Turtles are moved according to the die roll. If blue is rolled, a blue turtle is moved - even if it isn't one's own turtle. Green allows the active player to put one of his/her turtles on the next salad space, red on the next tomato field. If a turtle lands on the same space as another, it is put on that turtle's back. If a turtle in a stack gets to move, the others that are on its back ride along. Turtles can only leave the track at the end if the player rolls red, green or his/her own colour. If there is another turtle on its back, they also reach the finish.&lt;br/&gt;The first player who manages to get both his/her turtles to the finish wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
