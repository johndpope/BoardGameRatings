			<description>From Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pitifully monstrous Pilgrims are peaceful creatures, who are often preyed upon during their great journeys. Like herd animals, however, their great numbers ensure that at least some will survive, no matter the calamity that befalls them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leading these great migrations are usually two or three &amp;quot;navigators&amp;quot;, members of the tribe who, due to their great age, have accumulated knowledge of the Twisted Earth, its many trails and trade routes, and even the passage of the stars. Using these visual tools these elders manage to lead their people across the known world on their religious exoduses - and home again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-The Broken &amp;amp; The Lost (Tribes of The Twisted Earth)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunchasers is an article that intends to shed more light and bring more depth to the &amp;quot;Pilgrims of the Light&amp;quot;, a tribal group first introduced in The Broken &amp;amp; The Lost, a Darwin's World sourcebook with an emphasis on the primitive cultures of the Twisted Earth. This article details the tribe's curious religious beliefs and describes their &amp;quot;Great Voyages&amp;quot; across the Twisted Earth. It also introduces a new advanced class, the &amp;quot;Sunchaser&amp;quot; (which represents a kind of world-wise guide and navigator), as well as two new feats designed specifically for characters with nomadic origins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
