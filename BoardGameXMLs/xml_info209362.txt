			<description>Exlibrium is a magical seal, which helps secret order of mages-bookworms protect the barrier between narrative and objective realities. &lt;br/&gt;The game challenges players in medieval fantasy setting - mages of seven colors will transform into barbarians, bards and assassins. Up to 5 players can fight in a battle, but there is only 1 champion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Card-drafting game with original twist - all cards are double-sided, and a player must decide, which side he want to use this time. The game took place over three rounds - each round players will simultaneously choose one of cards from the hand to play and then pass remaining cards to the next player. Each card is double-sided and each side provides a player one of 7 characters to add to his tableau. At the end of each round the player activate all of the characters - but the character power is granted only if player has the majority. At the end of the game all characters are scored and the player with most vp earned from majority of characters and their powers through the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
