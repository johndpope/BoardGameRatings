			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How can four city animals get off of an island thousands of miles from home? You can help them! Based on the DreamWorks movie Madagascar, Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria have been stranded on Madagascar and they need to gather Colorforms Stick-Ons pieces that spell out the world HELP. Spin the spinner and move your character around the board to collect the pieces to signal a rescue ship. The first zoo animal to collect all four pieces and get to the finish decides where the ship sails to. Beware the Foosa who lurk in the jungle! They can pop up at any time and set you back! Game comes with Game board, Character cards for Marty, Alex, Melman, and Gloria, Colorforms pieces that Stick Like Magic, Spinner, Instructions, and a special bonus Alex window stick-on! Ages 3 and Up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
