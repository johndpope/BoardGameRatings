							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Super Cubes and Slip</name>
									
			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Cubes is a computerised form of the popular cube puzzle in which the coloured faces of the jumbled cube must be restored to their original positions. You have the choice of playing with a 2x3, 3x3, or 4x4 cube, and you can opt for one of 9 levels of difficulty. Best of all, if you get in a tangle and cannot straighten it out yourself, you can start again from the beginning at the touch of a button: no need to go out and buy another puzzle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can compete against your friends by seeing who can reassemble the cube in the smallest number of moves -- the count is kept by the computer, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slip lets you compete against the computer or against a friend. The idea is to get the balls into the holes by tilting the maze. It sounds pretty easy, but just try one of the higher levels of difficulty!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another way of competing in both games is to see who can complete the game the fastest, using the computer's stopwatch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
