							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Lords of the Howling Hills</name>
									
			<description>cover blurb:&lt;br/&gt;You have entered the Howling Hills at the behest of the barbarian warlords. You have overcome the humanoids in their  fortress dungeon, and you have braved the undead terrors of the storied Tombs.  Now, finally, before you is the last  obstacle: the vaunted durance of the Lords of the Howling Hills.  Will your party survive this final challenge, or will they perish like those before them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module was originally used as a convention adventure for the HMGS-South RECON &amp;rsquo;06 convention, and is a  continuation of a series of three related convention modules from THE DELVER&amp;rsquo;S DUNGEON.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module contains a fully detailed scenario, maps, notes for the Dungeon Master, and full background for integrating it  with the other modules.  It may be used with WGH3 INTO THE HOWLING HILLS and WGH4 TOMBS OF THE HOWLING HILLS or it  may be played as a stand-alone adventure scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from Notes for the Dungeon Master:&lt;br/&gt;WGH5 Lords of the Howling Hills is the final module in the  WGH series.  While it is intended for use with the two previous  modules (WGH3 Into the Howling Hills and WGH4 Tombs of  the Howling Hills), it may be used as a stand alone module  and/or incorporated in to a separate campaign or module.   This module is geared for play by a party of four to six  adventurers of fourth to sixth level of experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
