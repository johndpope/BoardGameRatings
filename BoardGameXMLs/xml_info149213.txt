							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horror World (Draft v0.5)</name>
									
			<description>designer's comment:&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Kreg Mosier's The Dead, S.P. Wipfli's DEAD MEAT, AFMBE, The Deadworld Comics, All the Romero and Russo movies, and any other Zombie Movies that I have seen. Oh and let us not forget AMC's The Walking Dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original Horror World conceived back somewhere in the early 90's and long gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completely easy to make a Player Victim. In fact if you are going to play make a few Victims because players die. Heroes that try and shoot every undead they see will find themselves eaten by the dead when they run out of bullets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have always found problems with many of the survival games out there namely complexity and long character creation then you play and die fast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary:&lt;br/&gt;A survival horror themed role playing game built on a simple, flexible d6-based mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
