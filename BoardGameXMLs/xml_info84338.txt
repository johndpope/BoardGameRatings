							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Legend of the Headless Horseman</name>
									
			<description>Legends hold that the first headless horseman was once a brave, just, and loyal knight protector who served the monarch of a kingdom that fell into oblivion long ago.  Tales from this forgotten period of history do state that the knight protector was not only the most accomplished warrior and the boldest horseman of his era, but also the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s most devoted champion. A headless horseman is a strange creature that haunts the area around the place it was created. Undead, evil, and often as silent as a ghost, the headless horseman roams under the crescent shaped moon in search of prey it can behead. It comes out mostly after dark, preferring the quiet solicitude of the night to hunt down and murder its victims, which are always humanoid. This sourcebook includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     New Template: Headless Horseman&lt;br/&gt;     Headless Horseman Characters&lt;br/&gt;     New Monster: Headless Spawn&lt;br/&gt;     Hess, Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
