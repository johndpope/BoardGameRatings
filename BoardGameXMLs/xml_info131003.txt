			<description>User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A memory-styled yet complex card game based on the Japanese TV animation series Puella Magi Madoka Magica. The game consists of 6 witch cards, 16 Puella Magi cards, 10 emotion cards, and some fate (point) cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 16 puella magi cards are placed face down in a grid, and the goal of the game is to &amp;ndash; like Memory &amp;ndash; on your turn, reveal the correct puella magi in order to defeat the current witch. Defeating the witches gains the player a fate card and an emotion cards. Emotion cards can be used for special effects. Also, each player has a secret identity that gets certain bonus points at the end, but it's dangerous if the other players discover who you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
