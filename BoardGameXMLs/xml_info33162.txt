			<description>A game for the piecepack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     1 piecepack&lt;br/&gt;     1 standard Go board with two sets of differently colored Go stones (white and black stones are assumed in these rules)&lt;br/&gt;     1 opaque bag or bowl from which to draw piecepack coins&lt;br/&gt;     Paper and pencil for score keeping&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The little village of Fumblebuck, Iowa, is in trouble. It&amp;rsquo;s currently a small village, but the population is booming and the rich resources of the area are bringing industry and commerce. The mayor of Fumblebuck decides to hire a pair of city planners to help plan and control the growth of his budding metropolis. The city planners know that the one who successfully brings the most balanced development to Fumblebuck will be assured of a long and lucrative political career in the region. So they set about zoning the county for development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players are the city planners hired to develop Fumblebuck. They compete with each other to create the best-supported Residential, Agricultural, Commercial, and Industrial zones in which businesses and families can thrive. The game progresses from a relatively unstructured growth in population and resource development in the area of town (placing Go stones on the board), through the establishment of various zones for constraining land usage (placing piecepack tiles on the board), to bringing new businesses, industries, and housing developments to town (placing piecepack coins on the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
