			<description>The year is 2288. The city is protected by an organization called &amp;quot;The Peacekeepers League&amp;quot; and everything is swell except for that it's under attack! By a robot army lead by professor Darnacus Damnation!! Or is it... ?&lt;br/&gt;From developer's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;100 years after the events of Noitu Love 1 the new star of the Peacekeepers is Xoda Rap, and what she has to endure is a sudden resurrection of the Darn armies, but adding to that the city is locally turning to places of the past! What could be causing this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a mouse reticule as a quick-dash-to-enemies and mouse gestures for special moves, Xoda will take on anything that stands in her way in the name of peace! The game shares little in pacing and action to Noitu Love 1. It is more of a continuation on that universe, so expect much more mindless action!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
