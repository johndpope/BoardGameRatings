			<description>This is a game for two teams. Each team takes turns to pick a who card and a what card and has two minutes to describe as many pairs as possible for their team mates to guess. Similar to charades but the player is allowed to talk, so long as they don't use any of the words on the cards. Examples of possible combinations are Hitler getting hit by bird poo and Sean Connery playing a didgeridoo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
