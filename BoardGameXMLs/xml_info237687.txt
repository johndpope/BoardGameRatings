							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Grim Dawn - Crucible Mode</name>
									
			<description>The Crucible is a cruel place where even the mightiest heroes meet their match. But we couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop with just one deadly arena. The Crucible will feature several battlegrounds, each with a different layout and defensive positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of the Dead&lt;br/&gt;Countless bones of failed combatants litter the floor of this Crucible. This tomb lies within an endless sea of bones and misery. Will your bones join them? Or will you triumph where countless others have failed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of the Deeps&lt;br/&gt;Deep beneath the earth, where no natural light can reach, this deadly Crucible was formed from the surrounding stones. What little light remains only serves to illuminate the terrors that await you within every shadow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of the Grove&lt;br/&gt;Hidden away within a treacherous forest, this Crucible gives a new meaning to survival of the fittest. The warding power within the sacred stones at the center of this arena have long ago lost their strength. The gods will not spare you from a painful end at the claws and fangs of the Crucible's fiends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucible of the Sands&lt;br/&gt;The shifting sands have nearly consumed this forgotten temple, now used as a Crucible to test the hardiest fighters. With the hungering fiends of the Crucible crawling in from every corner, it is inevitable that your sunbleached bones will soon join the ruins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
