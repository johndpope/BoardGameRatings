							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Conquest of Canaan</name>
									
			<description>The year is 1300 BC. Take command of an Israelite tribe of warriors, priests and tribesmen in order to conquer the land of Canaan and be crowned King of the Israelites! Command legendary warriors, powerful relics, and awesome miracles to battle the Canaanites together with your fellow tribes, while deviously scheming to claim the lion's share of glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conquest of Canaan is a worker placement game for 2-5 players. Each player controls one of the tribes of Israel, strategically managing his workers and resources while trying to take control of ancient Israel from the Canaanites. You'll undoubtedly battle with your fellow tribes to conquer high places, but if you hope to defeat cities, you'll also need to work together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resources and workers are limited, so you'll need a sharp wit, good planning, divine favor, and a little luck to succeed in the Conquest of Canaan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
