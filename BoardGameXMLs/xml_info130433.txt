			<description>Very simple board game for the under fives (with supervision). The board is very large and made of some sort of synthetic plastic. It folds out like a piece of cloth to give it it's size. The board is a track, running from the Start to end at Winnie the Pooh's house. Dice controls movement and special squares (there aren't many as it is intended for the very young) must be obeyed. The first to get to Winnie's house, wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The poor quality box lets down the nice presentation inside. A lot of thought has gone into the board, both physically and artisticly. The four playing pieces are like large round half-discs so easy for children to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
