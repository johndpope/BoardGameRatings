			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt; Goblinoid Games travels back in time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lurching into action, your battered chronoscooter crosses the void of time and space. Another lurch, and the vertigo fades. The countryside comes into view. Knights in armor battle, clanging sword against shield, and then someone blasts at your neck with a laser beam. Once again, all of Time is a mess, and as an agent of the Time Corps, you must set this world straight or die trying! Adventure to any place, any time, in this universe and beyond! The TimeMaster Roleplaying Game makes you master of the &amp;quot;Fourth Dimension&amp;quot;, guiding you to the ultimate adventure in history, legend, and science fiction. fight cunning aliens and savage renegades who twist Time to their own purposes. Only skill and wit stand between the world you know and absolute chaos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblinoid Games has always taken inspiration from the spirit of the 70s and 80s, publishing retro games such as Starships &amp;amp; Spacemen, Labyrinth Lord, and Mutant Future. Now we are pleased to announce that Goblinoid Games has been recruited into the Time Corps and is traveling back in time to bring a new classic title into the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goblinoid Games has purchased the rights to TIMEMASTER: Adventures in the 4th Dimension! Originally published by Pacesetter in 1984, TIMEMASTER was an innovative RPG for its time (pun intended), presenting one of the earliest percentile &amp;ldquo;chart-based&amp;rdquo; game systems and a heavily supported and playable game of time travel; a feat few have been able to repeat. TIMEMASTER never suffered from the commonly perceived problems of time travel games, as it set out a very playable premise based on a number of &amp;ldquo;laws&amp;rdquo; of time travel, and infinite universes. A referee can run highly accurate historical games if desired, or fudge the details since it is in the distant past of the setting or even in an alternate timeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current time in the game is in the 72nd Century, leaving a wide swath of time between (our) today and the future for the referee to design. History in your campaign could have taken various paths over such a vast time period. For example, characters could go back to the beginnings of interstellar travel, or the post-apocalyptic period following the blights and radioactive fallout of the third world war, if you envision your milieu following that timeline. The possibilities are quite literally endless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the ranks of the Time Corps, and you can be the Master of Time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
