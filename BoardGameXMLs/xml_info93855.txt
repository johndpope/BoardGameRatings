			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mythology expresses the deepest values of a culture. This fact can aid a GM in creating a truly exciting and vibrant world. Unfortunately, the default assumption for most settings is that there is a single unified pantheon that runs the world, even if the gods are seen differently by separate cultures. For many, the author included, this does not ring true, and ignores infinite opportunities for campaign development. This article will explore a few game-expanding options for faith as they appear in Morningstar, presented for use in any setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of Morningstar has no single unifying pantheon. Each culture has its own myths, filled with its own gods, and for most of the world&amp;rsquo;s history, they were distant. Until recently, divine attention was rare for mortals, the stuff of half-forgotten tales. Now, there are newcomers &amp;ndash; usurper gods, vying for the hearts of the worshippers who sustain the elder gods. The native gods are virtual forces of nature, or the living dreams of a people, while many of the usurpers are little more than immensely powerful planar beings. The power of the usurpers is more brazen, and more easily given than that of the autochthonic deities. While the invaders are wont to appear in their avatars, the native deities are more ephemeral, and not naturally inclined to shows of divine prowess. In order to survive, however, the elders have had to resort to similar tactics, such as granting clerical spells, and on occasion, manifesting before mortals. They battle not in some distant heaven or hell, but upon the souls of humanity. This divine tug of war is but one of many revolutions raging across the globe, but it may prove to be the most decisive for the citizens of the Nine Empires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Faith and Lies&amp;quot; is an article on religion that introduces new ways of looking at faith in Morningstar, originally published in EN World Player's Journal #4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
