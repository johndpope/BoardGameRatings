			<description>Chaotic Connections a game in which players are building routes to connect various US cities.  The connections are placed by playing Chaos Cards which can be used to add road tiles to the board in multiples of 100 mile increments.  The number of miles vary from car to car.  Other chaos cards allow to to create roadblocks forcing players to find a new routes, to create connections allowing players to bypass a city or curve cards which can have larger impact such as making players re-arrange cities on the board.  The first player to connect all his cities wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
