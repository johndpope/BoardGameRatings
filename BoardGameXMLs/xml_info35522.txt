							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cutthroat Caverns: Relics &amp; Ruin</name>
									
			<description>From the website:    &lt;br/&gt;The critically acclaimed game of dungeon delving, kill-stealing and cooperative - backstabbing becomes even more challenging with the inclusion of a NEW game mechanic, an Event Deck that makes even the most familiar Encounters new again. And mixed among the Events are ways to earn powerful new Relics that confer game changing abilities upon their owners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, this set includes 15 of the deadliest creatures yet. Can you resist the lure of a 14-card hand? Will you succumb to the PVP inducing effects of Voodoo? Or will you become a horrific beast yourself in the final moments and turn on your companions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relics and Ruin is the second expansion to Cutthroat Caverns and what an expansion it is! First, let me highlight the fact that several of the Encounters and the inspiration for the Event Deck came from you, the fans, in our Create an Encounter Contest. Sure, we beat 'em into shape - but these amazingly compelling encounters get right at the heart of what players wanted - because players created them. And as you will see, they are deadlier than ever - with many new and unique ways to challenge players to work with and against each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, the Event Deck is an inspired way to keep the game evergreen. Sure you may have faced the Boogens countless times, but thanks to an Event card, some dark power may have them swinging for double damage or you may find yourself in close quarters with a gimped hand. Or perhaps your next run in with Fear will lead to a friendly side wager about who can swing hardest in a given turn - with added Prestige on the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To balance the harsher environment, you will be able to earn powerful Relics. Unlike the Items in the base game, many of these items have game-long abilities to give you an edge over your companions. For example, Vampiric Bracers grants the ability to gain life for powerful attacks, while Talisman of Renown gains an additional Prestige Point every time you gain Prestige. But items of this magnitude aren't just lying around, they must be earned. Perhaps it will require a sacrifice of life to claim one or maybe playing the last action card before the creature dies is the key. It sets up an interesting situation in that you may find yourself deciding between taking action to score a kill - or a Relic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And speaking of the Relics - many of them are real items created by real artisans. Yep, you can own some of them by contacting the creators in our gallery. And of course, the gallery is full to brimming with more great art from artists around the world and we encourage you to visit their personal galleries to see more of their great works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All in all, this is an expansion that is not to be missed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relics and Ruin will also feature some of the winners from the Create Your Own Enounter Contest including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    6 MERCURY by Claus Jensen&lt;br/&gt;    3 VENOM SLINGER by Greg Dapkus&lt;br/&gt;    2 WEREBOAR by Fred Barnard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the GRAND PRIZE Winner:&lt;br/&gt;GLUTTONY by Miles Armstrong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
