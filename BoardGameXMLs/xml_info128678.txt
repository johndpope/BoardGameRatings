			<description>User Summary: walkie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CrazyQuest is a &amp;quot;massively singleplayer&amp;quot;, online, turn-based RPG.  The core of the game is a retro-style, hack-and-slash RPG, featuring point-to-point movement, leveling, upgradeable skills, and loot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game is fundamentally single player, a unique feature is a shared chat room in which all active players can talk, and view each others stats and equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme is a combination of standard fantasy with surreal and humorous additions.  For example, dungeons include the expected swamp, crypt, and volcano, but also Mario and Alice in Wonderland spoofs, and the bowels of a sick ogre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
