							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Festival Experience</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the course of a campaign there are some sessions when you just don&amp;rsquo;t have enough players and need a &amp;ldquo;side trek&amp;rdquo; to salvage the day. While many times it&amp;rsquo;s a throw away session this adventure brings in the underused festival experience. From royalty to commoners everyone likes a good break from the daily grind. This packet lays out a basic festival experience with vendor options and actors. While no &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo; is present it provides a good base with which to work with. In one of the Filbar Campaigns this festival gave the PCs an opportunity to come face to face with one of the nemeses without knowing until it was over. It also gave them rumors from the carnival staff of the location of a much sought after item. Just two of the possibilities for a successful one-shot adventure!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure setting was designed for 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;amp;D for the Filbar Campaign for any level of adventurers.  This scenario is easily adaptable to most any game and system. Save yourself some time and utilize it for a one shot adventure or a continuing campaign!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
