							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pallaso: Mordare Di Molti Colori</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pallaso the clown is a panoply of whirling scarves, baritone and bawdy songs, blue balancing balls, jovial smiles that show the whitest of teeth, and just a hint of blood red within a flash of silver. His victims notice all this just before an orange scarf covers their eyes, and the last thing they hear is a loud song or joke that covers the quiet thud of their bodies hitting the floor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Character Cache is a collection of characters designed to be used in tabletop RPG gaming, either as character concepts for players or as NPCs/villains by GMs. Artist Matt Morrow illustrates the character pieces, and Encoded Designs writes a system-neutral description, including how to incorporate this character into your campaign. These write-ups also include hooks for encounters and adventure inspiration, plus tags for quick reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the system-neutral write-up are stat blocks for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Fate Core&lt;br/&gt;    5e&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
