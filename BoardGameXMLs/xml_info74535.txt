			<description>&amp;quot;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also known as Terra Diver in the western world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raizing's ST-V top-down but horizontally formatted shooter was released in the arcades in 1996 and was an easy port to the similar hardware of the Sega Saturn in 1997 and an excellent port to the Sony Playstation that same year.  Two distinct Sega Saturn versions of this existed - a later edition entitled &amp;quot;Soukyugurentai Otokuyo&amp;quot; featured some enhancements, fixes and a playable demo of Battle Garegga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terra Diver is a vertical-scrolling shooter. The player picks one of three different ships - red, green or blue - each with their own pilot, fire pattern and laser web. Each ship has a standard gun and a bomb, but the most distinctive of these aspects is the laser-web: holding down the button for the standard gun will release a lock-on laser-web traditionally shaped as a cone or semicircle, which will destroy the enemies it locks onto after releasing the buttons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each ship has two different lock-on weapons that function as web-designed laser targets.[clarification needed] Once an enemy enters the web's range, the player can destroy the enemy or multiple enemies can be destroyed via homing lasers or multiple fire-balls.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Terra_Diver,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
