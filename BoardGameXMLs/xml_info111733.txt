			<description>Published in a limited edition, plastic leather pack to celebrate the 10th anniversary of dV Giochi, Dieci is a trick-taking game with illustrations taken from many dV Giochi titles. The players are &amp;quot;Radiatov&amp;quot;, a race of aliens who want to collect artwork from particular games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start the game, each player receives ten cards (with some cards removed for fewer than six players and a smaller hand size for 7-8 players) as well as a secret goal card. Cards come in five suits valued from 2 to A. The top card of the remaining deck is revealed to show a trump suit, and three of the 30 characters are laid face-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trick-taking in Dieci is fairly standard: One player leads a card, with everyone else following suit if possible and throwing off (or playing trump) if not possible. The highest trump card claims all cards in the trick; if no trump was played, then the highest card regardless of suit wins the trick. The player claiming the trick must then claim one face-up character card bearing a suit played in that trick; if no such character is face-up, the player claims the top character card from the deck. Going clockwise, each player then claims a remaining character card or passes; once everyone has passed or all characters have been claimed, the next trick begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the character deck runs out, the game ends. Players score:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    One point for each card claimed.&lt;br/&gt;    A variable number of points (0-20) depending on how many characters they took that are shown on their secret goal card.&lt;br/&gt;    Their lowest-valued character card in each of the five suits. For each other character in a suit, they lose points equal to that character's value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
