			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free20: The Troublemaker Template is a free Otherverse Games product, suitable for inclusion in almost any D20 based campaign. The concepts in this book are as applicable to dungeon crawls as they are modern action campaigns. Special attention is given to using this template in Psi-Watch and Otherverse America campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the fictional girls within above share certain traits: all petite, nimble females, all sarcastic and quick-witted, all running on nerve and bravado, all anxious to be taken seriously by their larger, more experienced male partners, and none of &amp;lsquo;em exactly as tough or competent as they think they are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Troublemaker Template helps gamers build young heroines who fit the tropes of the fictional girls who inspired the template. This easy to attach template rewards players for fully embracing this character concept, keeps them alive in the face of overwhelming opposition (at least hopefully), and adds a handful of appropriate new weaknesses right out of the comic books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
