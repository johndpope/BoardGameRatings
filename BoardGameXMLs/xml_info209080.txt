			<description>Classical Petteia (Poleis, Cities or the Game of Pebbles) was an ancient Greek game traditionally believed to be played by Ajax and Achilles during the Trojan War (c. 1194-1184 BC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Petteia XXI is a variation of the ancient Greek game, expanding on the classical rules and adding new tactics which allow a modern 'XXI' (a.k.a. 21st) century player to force a win on his/her opponent, while minimizing the number of draws or blocked positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Petteia XXI is played with light and dark pieces, checkers or stones initially lined up on opposite sides of the board. It can be played in various size boards: 8x8, 10x8 or 12x8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to stalemate the opponent or to capture his entire army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical captures (custodial and corner) apply to Petteia XXI in addition to the following capturing tactics:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Push and Crush Attack&lt;br/&gt;     Flank Attack&lt;br/&gt;     Phalanx Attack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aditionally, Petteia XXI has locked soldiers (similar to blocked pawns in Chess) which strategically limit pieces mobility to increase capture opportunities, and to minimize the chances of draws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/petteia-latrunculi-xxi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/petteia-latrunculi-xx...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
