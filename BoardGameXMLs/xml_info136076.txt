			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oathbreaker is a guisarme notorious among the leaders and great scholars of the Sanguine Lord&amp;rsquo;s church. A Sanguine Covenant paladin bore the weapon in an attempt to sidestep her vows for the ostensibly greater good, and can help free others from their limitations as well. Though its effect is only temporary, it is supplemented with other powers which can theoretically keep others from ever realizing what has happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Treasures of NeoExodus: Oathbreaker is created for use with your NeoExodus: A House Divided campaign setting home gaming for the Pathfinder RPG. The Treasures of NeoExodus series focus on creating unique and interesting magical and mundane items that you can use in your NeoExodus home games that give you more a personal connection to the item. This PDF comes with a background and history of the Oathbreaker, its special mundane and/or magical qualities plus magic item containing detailed information and blank versions of the cards. Everything you need to incorporate Oathbreaker into your character&amp;rsquo;s background and your gaming sessions is here making them even more appealing, special and personal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
