			<description>In this monopoly-type game the properties are (existing Hungarian) companies and players can only buy shares of the companies. Moreover, when a player arrives to the appropriate space, the other players also can buy the shares of that company. But it is more expensive, since when shares of a company are bought, the value (and price) of all the shares of that company increases. A lot of other features of stock markets are included in this game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
