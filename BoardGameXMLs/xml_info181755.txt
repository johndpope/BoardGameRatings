			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;This set contains 1 Character Meeple for each of the 16 factions in Tiny Epic Kingdoms by Gamelyn Games. Please note that the game requires 7 meeples of a faction for gameplay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are looking for the 112-piece complete set, see Tiny Epic Kingdoms Complete Set of Character Meeples (112 pcs)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiny Epic Kingdoms comes with 7 meeples in five different player colors (black, white, blue, orange, and purple).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While certain variants exist which allow play with just a single character meeple, the release of the Heroes' Call expansion allows you to replace your hero meeple with a character meeple modeled after the faction you play as.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These character meeples are larger than the basic meeples included with the game (approximately 19 mm tall).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Character meeples exist for each of the original 16 factions:&lt;br/&gt;- Human&lt;br/&gt;- Orc&lt;br/&gt;- Elf&lt;br/&gt;- Dwarf&lt;br/&gt;- Construct&lt;br/&gt;- Satyr&lt;br/&gt;- Halfling&lt;br/&gt;- Lizardfolk&lt;br/&gt;- Undead&lt;br/&gt;- Goblin&lt;br/&gt;- Valkyrie&lt;br/&gt;- Dark Elf&lt;br/&gt;- Merfolk&lt;br/&gt;- Centaur&lt;br/&gt;- Shapeshifter&lt;br/&gt;- Order of Gamelyn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
