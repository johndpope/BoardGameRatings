Let your curiosity take you to what lies beneath the Sea of Statues, Mount Palmerston, and the dread Dawn Machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convert your ship into a Zubmarine and dive anywhere in open water to discover new cities, zee-beasts and environments to terrify your crew and slake your hungers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 new underzee ports, each with their own tales and opportunities for the enterprising Trespasser. Visit Dahut, the city of drowned delights. Brave Wrack, where a Fair King rules the unforgivable.

Track down the Seven Against Nidah, who once came within reach of eternal life. Can you succeed where they failed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New enemies to face, from the cunning Wreckship to the inexorable Constant Companion.&lt;br/&gt;Discover the treasures the zee has claimed. Explore ancient wrecks, avoid hostile witherweed, discover the unexploded Unclear Bomb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanity is scarcer. Death is closer. We warned you, Trespasser. You should not have come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
