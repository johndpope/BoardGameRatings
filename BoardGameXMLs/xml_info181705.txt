			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go out with a bang with Remedial Tinkering: Rocket's Red Glare, the newest expansion for the tinker, 2013's highest-rated, and most actively-developed, base class!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core concept of the tinker is that of a squad commander who builds his own troops, and since automatons simply aren't allowed to do anything fancy unless they have the hardware or the scripting, there's always call for new and interesting ways to build and command minions. The issue, however, is that many legacy tinker expansions focused on the endgame and are effectively carrots dangled in front of the player to stay on that leveling treadmill. While that's fine if there's plenty of content at low levels, the continued creation of such expansions ended up making the class fairly lopsided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the solution. The Remedial Tinkering line is designed to be both transformative and accessible, allowing even the newbie tinkers to try strange and ridiculous tactics without having to qualify for a fancy prestige class or top-tier invention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rocket's Red Glare introduces three new invention descriptors: compartment, firework, and propellant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compartment: A new descriptor for a legacy concept, compartment inventions simply hold stuff and are effectively an automaton's backpack. An automaton with such an invention may have an inventory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firework: Fireworks are special in that they are the first inventions ever to occupy an automaton's inventory, and that they require special launchers to shoot. Effectively a rocket-propelled thrown splash weapon, the firework opens up a brand new way to render foes to rubble through the beauty of explosives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Propellant: Propellant inventions modify entire compartments full of fireworks, adding minor abilities that usually affect all creatures in the flight path of the firework. Mix fireworks and propellants to make custom explosives for fun and profit!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    3 new innovations&lt;br/&gt;    25 new inventions&lt;br/&gt;    A suggested reading list to get the most out of certain inventions presented herein&lt;br/&gt;    Legacy support for existing tinker content given the advent of the compartment descriptor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
