			<description>A 3M edition of the &amp;quot; Edu - PLAY - tional &amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game is similar - if not better! -  equipped as &amp;quot; Quinto &amp;quot; from the adult bookshelf series of the same company and plays nearly the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can tell that this is the better &amp;quot;Quinto&amp;quot; as it was edited earlier than the Quinto using the number tiles which have to be drawn in the pre-game-phase and was obviously adapted later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accordingly this is not a game for younger children as you have to be fit in multiplying and addition up to the number of 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were two editions with completely different box design, the second one from 1968.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
