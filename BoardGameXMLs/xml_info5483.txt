			<description>Kursk is a simulation of the largest tank battle the world has ever known.  The finest German armies advanced upon the numerically superior and well-entrenched Red Army, and their might was shattered.  Because the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union is the most important event in recent history, this study of its most crucial battle provides invaluable insight to both the historian and the gamer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the dreaded Tiger I, Panther, Elephant to the SS Divisions &amp;amp; Red Army Guards to Khukov &amp;amp; Manstein.. it is all present at the Battle of Kursk (Kypckar) !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kursk:  The greatest tank battle the world has ever witnessed, is recreated in a highly detailed game-system that incorporates all the vital elements of the battle - from movement and attack modes to anti-tank units and artillery barrages, from air support to Soviet partisans and German Kampfgruppen.  Three scenarios capture all the battlefield action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Components :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Map:            22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; single sheet&lt;br/&gt;Counters:        600 pieces&lt;br/&gt;Rulebook:        25 pages &lt;br/&gt;Charts:        German Deployment Display &amp;amp; Soviet Deployment Display&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Stats :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Average Playing Time:        4-9 hours &lt;br/&gt;Ages:                12 to Adult&lt;br/&gt;Number of Players:        Two-?
