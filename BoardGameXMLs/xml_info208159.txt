			<description>Players travel a path from the top of the board to the bottom by playing cards.  Cards can also be used to impede opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cards either have a number (1-5) of squares to move in one direction, a &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; that lets a player advance to a corner or fork, a &amp;quot;circled star&amp;quot; that allows a player to move another player's piece to a star square, or an &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; that forces a player to skip a turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
