			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My Little Pony Online Card Game is a fan-made card game based upon the My Little Pony: Friendship is magic series. It is designed in the style of a CCG, although players can play with all cards online via a plugin for LackeyCCG. Along with building their decks, players choose a Herd Leader card representing one of the show's main characters. Herd Leaders determine a player's hand size, Herd Morale, and special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players lose when their Herd Morale is lowered to 0, or they can no longer draw a card. This is primarily done by playing Pony cards; each player may have up to three Ponies on the field at a time. Players may also play Spell cards, with various effects. Any card may be played face-down as a resource. Spells played as a resource may be flipped face-up and played for free, if the player has enough total resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player may have his ponies clash with any of his opponents. If the opposing pony's power is lower or equal, it is Staggered, and the defending player takes Piercing Damage equal to the difference in power and Stagger Damage equal to the losing pony's cost. At the start of each player's turn, he may revive one of his Staggered ponies. Any others are KO'ed and discarded from play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
