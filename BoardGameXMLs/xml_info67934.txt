							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tsushima: Naval Wargame Rules For Pre-Dreadnought Actions</name>
									
			<description>These rules are quick and simple to play providing a very fast and bloody game in the period 1880 to 1906. The scale is 1 nautical mile to 10cm. The rules incorporate weather, spotting, minefields and allow for both written orders or sequential movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gunnery system takes account of the ranges, penetration and damage by specifying the dice that are rolled to attack in a given situation. Torpedo, Mine and Ramming attacks are resolved using similar mechanisms, so there is a consistent feel throughout the combat system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In line with the style and intention of the rules, armour has been standardised for each class of vessel (of which there are ten covered). Guns have been grouped into 9 classes following the same philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a fleet list covering the significant vessels of 10 nations in this period with 130 vessels. A simple conversion system allows you to quickly put together the game data you need to fight a battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Counters are provided to enable you to sit down and play both an introductory scenario and Tsushima-style encounter between Russian and Japanese fleets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Publishers Description)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
