			<description>There are 4 starting Points (Houses) for 4 different traffic participants: a car, a three-wheeled delivery van, a bicycle and a pedestrian. The first player to reach the wholesale supplier (Grossh&amp;auml;ndler) and get back to his starting point wins the game. Movement is determinated by a die. The players may choose their own way while minding the traffic rules. On some spaces events hinder or benefit the players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was published sometime between 1945 and 1953 to promote Dreiring soap and laundry detergent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
