			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design the races you want with this new release from John Fraser, the author of Complete Control: Character Design for the Uninhibited.  With this 10-page release, you'll find rules to mathematically break down and build up existing and new races, including support for the new and alternate races introduced in Dreamscarred Press's Third Dawn Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included are tables giving a variety of existing racial abilities and their associated values, as well as charts showing existing races and how they rank compared to each other based upon the value of their abilities.  In addition, included are new variant half-orc races, and a brand new race: the treel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use Racial Points (RPs) as the currency to design your own custom race with this continuation of the game design supplements by John Fraser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
