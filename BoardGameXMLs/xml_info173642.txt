							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Motebringer: An Edgewalker Archetype</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some edgewalkers reject the philosophy of balance espoused by the majority of their peers, electing instead to focus their attentions on the powers of light and radiance. For their part, the rest of the edgewalkers don't really seem to mind. After all, how can one toe the path between two extremes if those extremes didn't exist?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like edgewalkers, motebringers understand that light and darkness are two sides of the same coin. Unlike edgewalkers, motebringers believe that one of these halves is inferior to the other. Totally locked out from selecting darkness-based waypoints, the motebringer specializes in light-based waypoints and the shaping of physical material from nothing more than a glimmer of radiance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motebringer's iconic ability is the creation of a radiant shawl, effectively a sheet of light worn in the shoulders slot. Each morning, the motebringer can customize his radiant shawl with a number of infusions, which grant offensive, defensive, and utility abilities to it. Effectively, the motebringer gives up access to half of the edgewalker's talents in exchange for a cape that can and will rival artifacts by the time 20th level rolls around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Motebringer edgewalker archetype [Requires The Edgewalker: Wielder of Light and Darkness]&lt;br/&gt;    30 infusions for use with radiant shawls&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
