			<description>Humanity Divided&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been 6 years since humanity overcame the alien threat known simply as the Judgers. But it was only a momentary respite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning from our previous war, the Volterites came under a banner of peace, but that was just a shroud to hide their intentions. Now, these telepathic aliens have turned our own kind against us, corrupting mankind with promises of Utopia served up by their advanced technology, and the Near Orbit Vanguard Alliance must fight the one threat it never intended to: ourselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than ever, N.O.V.A. needs heroes.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;More than ever, N.O.V.A. needs you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join our hero, Kal Wardin, in the fight to unite humanity and uncover what sinister plans the Volterites have for us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
