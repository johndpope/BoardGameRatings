							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Prison Tycoon 4: Supermax</name>
									
			<description>Build a profitable privately run prison from the ground up. Every wall, every fence, every decision is yours. Start small and forge your reputation as a first rate warden. Grow your facility to SuperMax capabilities, housing the most dangerous and diabolical criminals on earth - all for the bottom line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Supermax, the focus is on prison gangs and gang bosses and how to run your facility without it erupting in all out gang war!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you build it... Manage the layout, construction, and equipping of your prison. Every choice determines the safety and respectability of your prison.&lt;br/&gt;Us vs Them - Staff your prison from guards to rehabilitation experts. Your decisions and budgets govern your team&amp;rsquo;s morale and overall performance.&lt;br/&gt;Break &amp;lsquo;em Down - Manage the security levels throughout your prison. Too strong a grip can explode in prisoner riots - too weak and the gangs will run your stir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bad to the Bone! Lock up the worst of the worst in the NEW Restricted Access Quarters for 23 hours a day with 1 hour for outside exercise.&lt;br/&gt;Someone&amp;rsquo;s Gotta Pay! Build prisoner factories to bring in some extra income to help keep the prisons finances healthy.&lt;br/&gt;Be the Big Boss! Determine your prisoner&amp;rsquo;s fate - release your prisoner on parole or keep them locked up for the safety of society (and your pocketbook)&lt;br/&gt;Control or Be Controlled! Keep the peace among the prison gangs or one may take over certain areas of the prison as their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
