			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a short 30-second prototype video, Samus ran through a series of corridors until finally getting into a boss fight with a monster that very closely resembled Kraid. The project reportedly had a slightly different art style than usual and Samus was depicted as more thin and athletic. The mystery studio pitched its concept to Nintendo, but it was shot down as Nintendo didn't want to take the series in a 2.5D direction at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
