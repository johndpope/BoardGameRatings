			<description>Extra Innings​ (白熱プロ野球 ガンバリーグ, Hakunetsu Puro Yakyū Ganba Rīgu, titled Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League in Japan) is a 1991 baseball game released for the Super NES. The game features 12 fictional teams composed of their own fictional players, drawn in an anime  style. Players can also create two custom teams, the players of which can have their names and ratings edited any number of times. For the most part, the game adhered to realistic rules of baseball; it omitted some more complex strategies such as the double switch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extra Innings's controls were somewhat primitive, like many baseball games from its era. For example, unlike modern baseball games, rather than the player choosing one player to move independently, moving the D-Pad will move all players in the field in unison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like most baseball video and computer games, either one or two players can join in for simultaneous play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Extra Innings,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
