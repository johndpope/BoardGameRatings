							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HârnMaster Gold: Gamemaster edition</name>
									
			<description>The long-awaited GameMaster Edition of H&amp;acirc;rnMaster Gold is here. It includes extensive sections on Game Mechanics (Time &amp;amp; Space, Routines of Play, Future History, Movement...and much more), Cases (Searching, Listening, Brute Force and Ignorance...and much more), Character Development (Families, Relatives, Medical, Psyche, Procreation, Aging...and much more), Reality (Where to begin...and much more), Psionic Talents (Charm, Clairvoyance, Extratemporality, Telekinesis...and much more), Encounters, Treasure (Personal Possessions, Potions &amp;amp; Elixirs, Gems &amp;amp; Jewellery, Written Works, Armour, Weapons...and much more), and Adventure, which includes types of adventures, designing an adventure...and much more. It even includes a complete random adventure generation system!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A list of contents like this cannot do justice to the most comprehensive set of GameMaster rules we have ever created. Together with version 2.1 of the Player Edition of H&amp;acirc;rnMaster Gold, the GM Edition gives the discriminating Gamemaster exactly what is needed to run an intelligent game that never flies in the face of reason and actually works the way it is meant to work. These are, possibly, the most logical and elegant, dare we say 'common sense', set of RPG rules ever produced!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
