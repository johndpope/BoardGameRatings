			<description>The troubled skies of Europe saw a ray of hope emerge today, as the dashing and mysterious pilot Snoopy was sighted over the port city of Toulon. Plunging through the clouds in his unmistakable Sopwith Camel, the fearless canine dealt a savage blow to the elite Imperial Air Service squadron dubbed the &amp;quot;Flying Circus&amp;quot; by its commander, Captain Manfred Albrecht Baron von Richthofen; perhaps better known by his moniker in the press, the &amp;quot;Red Baron&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allied Air Force enlistments skyrocketed on the news and new pilots have already begun training. With the forces of the Red Baron massing on all fronts, the anticipated deployment of these new pilots on June 2 cannotcome soon enough for Allied commanders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
