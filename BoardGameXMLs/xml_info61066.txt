							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Synthetic Lycanthropy</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1932, at the direction of Adolph Hitler, Reiner Oswald began research on Project Tier Innen (literally, Project Inner Beast). Oswald, a member of the Thule society and on the payroll of the Nazi party, was a brilliant scientist with a profound knowledge of folklore and the occult. He delved into the myths and stories regarding shape-shifting and lycanthropy, determined to find the kernel of truth hiding within the legend, and to exploit it. By 1942, he was ready to put his theories into practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learn what happened after the re-discovery of Dr. Oswald&amp;rsquo;s work, and how you can include Synthetic Lycanthropy in your D20 Modern game with six Were-animal Templates, Transformation Classes for PC versions of Synthetic Lycanthropes, as well adventure hooks and rules for Catalyst 13.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
