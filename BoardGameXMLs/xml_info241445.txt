			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An enemy tank is placing barriers on the battlefield.  You must destroy the enemy tanks to keep the area open.  As the game does on, the open spaces rapidly disappear, making the job more difficult.  Two levels of difficulty; in Level 2 they're laying explosive mines!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will run in 8K on any OSI C1, C2 or C4 tape based computer.  Recorded twice on each tape; covered by a limited replacement warranty, return for replacement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmed by Bob Retelle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
