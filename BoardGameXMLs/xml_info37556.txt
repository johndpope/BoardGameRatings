							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Satsuma Rebellion</name>
									
			<description>&amp;quot;Card Game for 2 players. Theme: The Satsuma Rebellion in Japan in 1877. The Modern Imperial Army destroyed the last of the Samurai. One player is the Samurai. The other player is the Imperial Army.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game uses two custom decks of cards, the Samurai Deck and the Imperial Deck. Each deck contains eight types of cards, each ranked with a Strength value: Force, Reserves, Leader, Attack, Defense, Morale, Weapons, and Escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The game ends when the Samurai player has accumulated 9 Casualty Markers. At that point, the last of the Samurai have been wiped out. Victory is a function of how many casualties the Samurai were able to inflict on the Imperials.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
