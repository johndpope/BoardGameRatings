			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Davae Breon Jaxon's Cinematic Environs continues his new series of suppliments designed to help GMs paint vivid cinematic scenes for their players in a way that gives the environment its own unique character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These environs can take a mundane encounter or location and turn it into an epic scene that the players will be talking about for year to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fifth in the series deals with Aquatic Environs. It discusses the effects of breathing (or drowning), crushing depths, currents, waves and many other hazards that the characters will have to face if they are to dive deep below the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, instead of simply traveling to a lich's tomb, the party may have to seek out the temple on the ocean floor. Instead of roudy orcs, the party now has to be on the lookout for merfolk who don't appreciate surface dwellers meddling in their business. Instead of tracking down goblin raiders, they end up crewing a ship in pirate infested waters, hoping that the stories of the kraken are a myth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also incuded is a new character background, new equipment, new weapons and new spells related to this particular environ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
