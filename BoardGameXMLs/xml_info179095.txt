							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chariot of Gold</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chariot of Gold: The Bezian Empire has been looting its conquered territories of all of their treasures for many generations now, all without too much incident. A little insurrection here, a little rebellion there, all easily put down. But local resentment has only built over the years with each incident. Until, on the far northern fringes of the Empire, the Imperial Army looted the burial mound of one of the most honored kings of that ancient land, a looting that included a sacred artifact &amp;ndash; a chariot of gold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So now, there is bloody revolt. And the leader of that revolt is riding a golden chariot, wrested back from the hands of the Empire. A chariot that has become a symbol of all that the Empire has done to their people over the years, and of all that they are going to do to the Empire in revenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
