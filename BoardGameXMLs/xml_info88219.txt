							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cabin Fever</name>
									
			<description>Game Overview&lt;br/&gt;Cabin Fever is a small, dice-based scoring game with the theme of escaping a cabin during a harsh winter. Players begin the game &amp;quot;snowed in&amp;quot; requiring them to &amp;quot;dig out,&amp;quot; or score 100 points before they may begin collecting points. The first player to score 1,000 or more points wins the game! The game has a strategy component where players may trap other players in the cabin, preventing them from scoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special scoring situations have easily recognizable winter themed monikers. Players encounter obstacles along the way in the form of certain types of die rolls (&amp;quot;squalls,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;thaws,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;broken chairlifts&amp;quot;) which may end their turn or put them in the cabin. In addition to obstacles there are special die rolls that immediately reward a player such as &amp;quot;vacations&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;chairlifts&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Setup&lt;br/&gt;Cabin Fever is designed for 2-8 players with an optimal number of 3 or more players. A game can be played with more than 8 players at the consequence of extending the game's duration. All that is needed in addition to the game is a pad of paper and a pencil or pen with which to keep score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;Each player rolls a single die to determine who starts the game. The highest roll goes first (after resolving ties). All players are considered &amp;ldquo;snowed in&amp;rdquo; and must &amp;quot;dig out&amp;quot; by rolling 100 points or more on the scoring dice. Once a player digs out he or she ends his or her turn and passes the scoring dice to the next player on the left (clockwise) and may begin scoring on his or her next turn. The first player to accumulate 1,000 points wins the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five same color dice included with the game are called scoring dice. Players start a turn by rolling all five dice (opening roll) in an attempt to create matching die faces. Players may elect to end their turn at any time and collect their points (with a minimum requirement of a matching pair). Players may continue a turn to earn more points but must roll at least one match to an existing match, or create a new matching set on each consecutive re-roll of non-matching dice. Dice that have been assigned to a match may not be re-rolled. If players fail to roll a match on a re-roll they immediately end their turn and do not collect any points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;    * 5 Scoring Dice (white)&lt;br/&gt;    * 1 Vacation Die (green)&lt;br/&gt;    * Cabin game piece (clear)&lt;br/&gt;    * Cabin Fever rules sheet&lt;br/&gt;    * 3 &amp;quot;I have Cabin Fever!&amp;quot; stickers&lt;br/&gt;    * Palm-sized, clear acrylic, travel box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
