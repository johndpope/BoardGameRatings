							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Authentic Demolition Derby</name>
									
			<description>This is a simulation of a real demolition derby as it is done at your local fair grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box contents are:&lt;br/&gt;A toy car for each player.&lt;br/&gt;Damage tracking sheets.&lt;br/&gt;Combat cards.&lt;br/&gt;Derby action cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The car damage areas are divided into Engine, Tires, and Frame. Each area starts with 7 points. Cards are played indicating how the cars hit i.e. front-to-front rear-to-driver-side-tire, front-to-Passenger-side-door, etc. When the Tires or Engine are reduced to zero points your car is disabled and you are out of the game. When the Frame is reduced to zero any further hit there will do a point of damage to the Tires and the Engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The toy cars track relative car positions on the playing field since these have an effect on what area of a particular car is available to be hit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
