			<description>Game about the auction of vegetables (!). Players move around the board with a die that doesn't have numbers but vegetables marked on. Whenever a player is on an auction space, an auction is triggered. The auction is done in a similar way as in The Merchants of Amsterdam, meaning that players have to hit a spring driven auction clock to place a bid and win the auction. The object is to buy your vegetables cheap (during an auction) and to sell them with profit (whenever one is one a vegetable space of a sort that one has bought). I suspect this light Dutch bidding game with a high dose of luck (due to the die) was released in the early '90s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
