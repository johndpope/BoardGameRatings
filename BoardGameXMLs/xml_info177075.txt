			<description>Ranka is subtitled &amp;quot;Easy Go&amp;quot; and the gameplay lives up to that description. The game takes place on a hexagonal game board divided into triangles, and players alternate turns placing one triangular piece of their color on the board. If you completely surround an opponent's piece or pieces with pieces of your own (or with a combination of pieces and the edge of the board), you capture the opponent's pieces and remove them from play. Players cannot immediately recreate a board position by playing into a space from which they were just captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ranka also includes five double-sided wall/meal pieces, and if you play the game with them, players take turns placing them on the board before the game begins. If you completely surround a meal or wall piece &amp;mdash; or surround a meal or wall in addition to opposing pieces &amp;mdash; you capture all of the surrounded pieces. You can also use a wall as if it were a piece of your own color in order to capture an opponent's piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When using walls or meals, a player can win by either capturing five opposing pieces or capturing three wall/meal pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board in Ranka is double-sided, with one playing area being smaller than the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
