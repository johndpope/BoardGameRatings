			<description>publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: You enter the giant garden and see a maze of statues and flowerbeds. What do you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: I begin examining the statues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: They are a collection of marble statues in various poses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player: Are there any that stick out as unusual?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GM: Ummmm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statues - they decorate town squares, stand in the halls of temples, libraries and courts. They often decorate dungeons and provide clues to ancient civilizations. Unfortunately, while statues are a common decoration, they are often glossed over with a simple description and little detail. However, giving these items a unique description can add to the atmosphere of a location. For this reason, we at Healing Fireball Publications have created Two Bit Tables: Statues of All Shapes. This is a large 6 page collection of tables that will allow you to generate unique statues to populate your world. All this and it's only 50&amp;cent;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
