			<description>In Good Little Trains, players become train drivers eager to delivery their cargo to the ring of colourful stations connected by an ever-changing layout of tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every turn you have a chance to switch one piece of track before both your own train and the neutral 'Ghost' train both head out across the network of rail lines. Aim to drop your own cargo at the most valuable stations, while also having an eye on where the Ghost train is headed, and what your competitors are up to!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If at the end of a turn all the stations of one colour have cargo, then those stations are scored. All players can earn points for their cargo, and the player who triggered the scoring gets a coin. Once all 10 coins have been taken, the game ends and the player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Little Trains is the first product of a new collaboration between the co-designers of 'Elysium', 'Costa Rica, 'Pyramids and 'Professor Evil and the Citadel of Time'. All these new games will be available as free print-and-play downloads from the Good Little Games website, alongside the existing catalogue of free microgames including the original editions of Pocket Imperium, Empire Engine and Bad Grandmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
