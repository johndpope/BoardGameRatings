			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xeno began many years ago on the planet Io because the miners were bored of digging solid methane. So the game Xeno was invented which involved 2 players knocking blocks of solid gases around an ice pitch scoring goals. It was a highly dangerous game and there were few rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today it is a bit more civilised with a proper pitch and rules that have to be abided by!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is reminiscent of air-hockey. Each player controls a disc and attempts to use it to propel a puck into the opponent's goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The control mechanism is unusual - the player controls a crosshair extending from his disc. The location of the cross and the distance it extends from the disc defines how far and in what direction the disc moves when the user presses fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hitting the puck or the opponent's disk will cause them to rebound, so tactics can include positioning your disc in defensive position, knocking the opponent out of the way, along with going for the puck itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional element to the strategy of the game is a shot timeout limit. After a shot, there are a few seconds (user definable in the menu screen) before another shot can be taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After four quarters of play are completed (again, the length of a quarter is user-definable) the player with the most goals wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
