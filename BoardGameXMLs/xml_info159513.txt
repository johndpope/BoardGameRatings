			<description>This game is based on 6-Tage-Rennen by the same author. Everybody has  the same hand of movement cards. Each player plays one cards and moves his pawn accordingly. If he lands on the the spot as fellow player he may move the same number again immediatly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of a bike race however, Auf Gehts! simulates a race of Biathlon. The card play is similiar to 6-Tage-Rennen, but the track features slopes and hill where slightly different rules apply. Every round there is a shooting, which is simulated by a real-time-dexterity element using a small &amp;quot;Marble gun&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to cross the finish line is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
