			<description>Shock Troopers (ショックトルーパーズ) is an arcade game developed by Saurus. Gameplay involves taking command of one or three commandos in an 8-way shooter through 6 stages of opposing forces, weaponry, and power-ups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bloody Scorpions have kidnapped a scientist and his granddaughter in order to gain the powerful drug, Alpha-301, which converts normal people into unbeatable superhuman soldiers. A special team must fight through their ranks in order to get to their leader and save the scientist's granddaughter and the world. The game received a semi-sequel in Shock Troopers: 2nd Squad. There is also believed to be a third game which became vaporware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Shock Troopers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
