			<description>Break Away was originally published in the July 1983 issue of Games magazine, and was reprinted in Spielbox 4/87 as part of the &amp;quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&amp;quot; series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board has 5x6 spaces and each player has 7 playing pieces. At the start of the game, all playing pieces are placed on the board, but not on fixed locations. In fact, one player places the pieces on the board and the other player chooses the color he wants to play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Object of the game is to &amp;quot;break away&amp;quot; all your playing pieces: as soon as a player manages to have all his 7 pieces isolated, that is with no own neighbors on all adjacent spaces, he is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of spaces a piece must move is ruled in an unusual way, too: 1, 2, or 3 spaces, alternating with every move of each player (resulting in 1-3-2-1-3-2-1-3-2... for a single player).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
