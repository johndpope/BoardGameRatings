							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mist</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A game for a large number of players, using the Dead of Night rules. You'll need to have read the novella by Stephen King or have seen Frank Darabont's screen adaptation to make sense of this, but in a nutshell, a weird mist descends one day, blocking out all vision beyond a few feet and hiding the unearthly, blood-thirsty creatures that lurk within. This scenario is presented in the style of a pseudo-LARP, where it is assumed that the location the players of the game are in is also the location of the characters in the story, so players are free to get up &amp;amp; look around to establish what supplies are on hand, where the exits are &amp;amp; how they lock, etc.&lt;br/&gt; There are two versions: the first is set in a community centre that is used by local groups for various activities and meetings, while the second takes place in the bar &amp;amp; leisure complex of a large holiday village, which has opened out-of-season for a 60s &amp;amp; 70s music revival weekend. Both versions are designed to run for a lot of players (6-12 approximately), but be prepared for a certain amount of turnover as characters get killed off. I have used the first version in a game of 8 players and the second in a game of 9 and haven't run out of characters yet...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
