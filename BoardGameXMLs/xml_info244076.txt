			<description>In Cosmos, players will be protoplanets at the beginning of a planetary system, searching for chemical elements in space to form their characteristics, such as atmosphere, rotation spped and gravitational force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 7 billion years (calm, it's only 7 rounds), the protoplanets will rotate and grow in their orbits in search of becoming a planet capable to support life, in an asymmetric game of deck-building and hand management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every round, players will play a card from their hands, which tells the action that the planet will do. These actions will allow the planet to move in its orbit, attract elements of spaces near it or make improvements in its characteristics. Each characteristic will benefit the player in a way, such as playing more cards per round, attracting more distant elements, or better controlling the temperature of your planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He who has advanced further in the path of life will be the winner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
