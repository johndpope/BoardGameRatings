			<description>A word card game that is similar to Rummy 500, with many options to its play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deck has 8 suits of cards 1-K, each one also having a letter and point value; there are also 4 joker/wild cards.  The rules (and facecard names) are in French, English, Dutch and German.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a turn, a player: &lt;br/&gt;1. Draws the top of the draw pile, or any card of the discard pile (which is fanned).  If the latter, the drawn card must be melded immediately, and all the cards above it are added to the hand. &lt;br/&gt;2. Melds cards from the hand.&lt;br/&gt;3. Adds to melds already on the table.  This can only be done after one has melded 5 cards of his own.  &lt;br/&gt;4. Discards a card. &lt;br/&gt;The game ends when a player clears his hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multiple options include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hand size: 8 to 13.  Larger is recommended for cardplay melding (sets and runs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Melding: words alone, cards alone (sets and runs), various ways of doing both, dealer's choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scoring: maximum (add points for each meld); minimum (add points for unused cards in the hand).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others: bonuses, variations such as crossword arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a Group Game mode where one hand (8 to 13 cards) is laid out for all to see, and write out their best scoring meld based on those cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
