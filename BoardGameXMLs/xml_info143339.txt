							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure Dungeon 2</name>
									
			<description>Documentation accompanying program listing in SoftSide Magazine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be exploring a dungeon of rooms and passages. In this dungeon you will find a variety of monsters. Defeat the monsters, and you will usually gain treasure. But if you are weakened, you may be killed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screen will display the section of the dungeon you are in as viewed from above. You are represented by a small figure in the center of the room. The boundaries of the room represent the type of walls around you. A solid line means a solid wall (or perhaps a secret door), a solid line with a 'D' means a dosed door, an 'O' means an open door. A gap in a line means an open passage, and no line at all means that you can see no wall in that direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find a monster, the display will show a huge monstrous figure in the center of the room. You may run or fight. If you fight, you both exchange blows until one is defeated or you retreat. If you keep on fighting against a strong monster, you may be killed. If you run away, the monster may strike a parting blow and you may drop some treasure. If you defeat the monster, you will then gain its treasure if one exists. It is always a good idea to check your strength after a fight to see if you need rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you find and defeat all the monsters, the game is over. You may then rate yourself on how long it has taken you. For the first adventure, anything less than 100 hours in dungeon time is pretty good. If you wish to quit before all the monsters are defeated, you may do so by going back to the entrance and pressing 'Q', you will then be asked if you want to quit or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to getting the program listing published in the September 1979 issue of SoftSide magazine, creator David E. White also offered Treasure Dungeon 2 for direct sale. His ads for the game appeared in the classifieds section of Dragon magazine in February and March of 1980.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
