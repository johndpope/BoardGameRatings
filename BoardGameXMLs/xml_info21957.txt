			<description>A game of the Allied invasion of Sicily, 1943.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(from the publisher:)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. BSO, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or heavy weapons). No CRTs, no siree!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don&amp;rsquo;t 'drive' the game and they can be left out, if you&amp;rsquo;re so inclined.)  The cards are turned into a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards or rally units. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards, themselves, give the players 'Opportunities', from using their Tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Reaction movement, to appearances by Patton and Monty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing time for BITTER VICTORY has averaged 3 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 8 pages, including a section on Solitaire play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available in English or French&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)&lt;br/&gt;    1 A1 map of Sicily &lt;br/&gt;    20 colored Opportunity Cards &lt;br/&gt;    224 counters (NATO Symbols) &lt;br/&gt;    1 Aid Cards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
