							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Treasure Hunt</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Advertisement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a challenge, so don't cheat and read the program listing. Use your imagination. You are exploring caves and trying to find 20 treasures. Some are easy to get, others are very difficult because you have to figure out how. When you first play, you will probably make a lot of mistakes. The more you play this game, the more secrets you will discover, and thus, the more treasure you will find. All 20 treasures can be found in about an hour of play if you know what you're doing. Your first problem is to draw a map of the caves. However, to save you time, a map is enclosed. Good luck, you're gonna need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
