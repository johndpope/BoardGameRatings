							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Terminator 2: Judgment Day â€“ Chess Wars</name>
									
			<description>A chess game developed by IntraCorp and published by Capstone Software for DOS platforms in 1993. In this game, characters from Terminator 2: Judgment Day act as chess pieces. White is the &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; side, with the T-800 as king, Sarah Connor as queen, two John Connors as bishops, two Miles Dysons as knights, and soldiers in green uniforms as rooks and pawns. Black is the &amp;quot;machines&amp;quot; side: grey-coloured robots with metal skeletons, without the T-1000. The pieces are not taken on the chess board but in futuristic battlefield settings resembling the scenes of man-machine war from the movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player can choose from several game types and difficulty settings. The game rates the player in accordance with the United States Chess Federation scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2%3A_Judgment_Day_%28video_game%29%23Terminator_2%3A_Judgment_Day_-_Chess_Wars Terminator 2: Judgment Day (video game)]&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
