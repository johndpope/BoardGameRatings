							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Point of Attack 2</name>
									
			<description>POA2 is a modern tactical level simulation that depicts combat over a wide range of circumstances and levels, from platoons and individual vehicles to company or higher sized units.   It features complete depiction of supporting artillery, air strikes, electronic warfare, engineer, chemical warfare, helicopter, naval, and psyop units, network communications, and satellites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point of Attack 2 is an astonishingly comprehensive and detailed modern combat simulator. The weapons database includes hundreds of systems from circa 1960 into those the might be fielded the near future, all modeled in amazing detail. The ammunition types include cluster munitions, missiles, bombs, rockets, kinetic energy rounds, and even hypothetical energy weapons.&lt;br/&gt;Systems that are modeled include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Point Missile Defense&lt;br/&gt;     Radar&lt;br/&gt;     Laser&lt;br/&gt;     Decoy systems&lt;br/&gt;     Jamming systems&lt;br/&gt;     NBC defense&lt;br/&gt;     Mines&lt;br/&gt;     Remote sensors&lt;br/&gt;     Naval units&lt;br/&gt;     Air forces&lt;br/&gt;     Terrorists&lt;br/&gt;     Civilians&lt;br/&gt;     Satellites&lt;br/&gt;     Communications Networks&lt;br/&gt;     and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point of Attack 2 is a &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; unlike any other ever available for the civilian market.  It is not for everyone--it is a product designed to accurately model the minute intricacies of modern weapons systems to a degree which casual gamers may find cumbersome, even excessive.  POA2 values 'brutal' realism above all else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
