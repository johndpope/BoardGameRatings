							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Boneyard</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Valos was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the priest, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Even you&amp;rsquo;ve signed it. Yes, Old Valos was as dead as a door-nail&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boneyard is a 3- to 4-hour adventure for characters levels 1st to 4th. It features a flavorful setting, memorable roleplaying, oddball and depraved NPCs, interwoven storylines, and macabre combat encounters! The adventure also includes 3 new NPC stat blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When darkness falls and the iron gates close behind you, the dead come out to play!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
