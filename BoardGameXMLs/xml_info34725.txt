			<description>The box that I received is &amp;quot;Set 1&amp;quot; in the official card game series. It contains three decks of 64 cards each: Over the Rainbow, Speaking Out, and Lost in Space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each deck is a themed game of Go Fish containing 16 sets of 4 cards each. However, the cards contain advanced vocabulary words from Reader's Digest Word Power columns. The four facets of each card are: Definition and Part of Speech, Word Origin, Synonyms, Fill in the Blank, the latter of which is an example sentence in which a blank indicates where the word would go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn, you ask for a card whose [insert facet] is [insert facet's description], e.g. &amp;quot;I would like a card whose synonyms are abandon, abdicate, discard, throw away.&amp;quot; If the player has a &amp;quot;Jettison&amp;quot; card, he gives it up. The rest of the rules are Go Fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The box includes a supplementary color guide with pictures and further explanations for each word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
