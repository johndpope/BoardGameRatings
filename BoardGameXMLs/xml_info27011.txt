			<description>The players take on the role of television show producer vying to book the best guests for television&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Today Show&amp;rdquo;. The deck is divided into four suits. Each suit represents a category of guest. Each suit has cards valued one through twelve; one being the greatest value and twelve having the least value. There are also four wild cards, valued at thirteen, to bring the total number of cards in the deck to fifty-two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All players place their pawns on the start space. Each player chooses a card secretly. All players reveal their chosen cards simultaneously. The player who played the highest valued card gets to advance one&amp;rsquo;s own pawn the number of spaces equal to value of the winning card. The rules are do not state what happens if two or more players tie. If two or more players play wild cards, there is no winner and the hand is replayed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain spaces on the track assign a player who happens to land on them a personal trump suit. This trump stays in effect until the player moves on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hand is over when someone lands on the &amp;ldquo;Off the Air&amp;rdquo; space at the end of the track. The value of the cards remaining in the hand of the players is totaled and added to the score of the player who ended the round. All players receive the value of the cards in tricks each has taken. The first player to score five hundred points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
