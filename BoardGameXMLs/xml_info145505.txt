			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come and see the true power of fairy tales!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Faerie Knight cavalier archetype makes you a stalwart champion of the faerie realm who rides a mystical fey mount, while gaining the ability to call upon the fair folk for inspiration rather than relying upon tactical genius. This allows you to charge into the rescue while maintaining the otherworldly sense of enchantment offered by your connection to the Primal World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Laughing Man monk archetype replaces the physical martial arts of the east with the wily arts of the fey, allowing you to confound your foes with clever word play and lay them low with the force of your words. It is a truly unique take on the traditional master of the martial arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Masquerade Reveler barbarian archetype allows you to take on the wild and unpredictable aspects of the realm of the fey when you rage using eidolon evolutions, offering you unmatched versatility while still remaining effective both in and out of combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of this is backed up by a collection of new feats that support these archetypes along with a the Gancanagh a fey inspired by Irish mythology who manipulates both mind and body with enchanting music and an addictive touch, providing game masters with a truly unique challenge to surprise players with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
