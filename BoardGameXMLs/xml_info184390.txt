			<description>Based  upon a popular youth fiction book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be part of the story, work alone or co-operate with your team and build the time machine!&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the game, every player gets a secret role card, which determines the team the player is part of. During the game, the players have to deduce who their partners and who their opponents are. The goal is to find as many parts of the time machine as possible. It's not enough to find the parts though, the teams have to defend their findings as well, because it's possible to steal items from other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the game, players use their action cards to move the characters on the board. These cards have different possible actions based upon the location of the moved character on the board. These characters can find and pick up parts of the time machine, and the player who moved the given character gets the part, which is essential for winning the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
