			<description>The year is the 2099. The city is London. But the world is different now. Very different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climatic catastrophes have changed the Earth's climate permanently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bionic beings, complex technologies, relationships and romance are mixed all together in this adventure game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has a relationship value with the player that will change through the story based on your choices inside the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bionic Heart features a truly dynamic plot, where each of your decisions affects the story outcome, even later in the game: every move, every choice matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing this game, you have to take big ethical decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is a bionic being less worthwhile than a human being? Is the science the ultimate answer for men, or is love and friendship?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Bionic Heart there isn't any right or wrong choice: only results as consequences to your action/decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is fully voiced, features wonderful manga art and has 24 unique endings, a guarantee of great replayability and longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
