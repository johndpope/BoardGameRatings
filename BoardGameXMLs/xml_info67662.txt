							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: Desecrated Temple</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You enter a vast hall, some 50 by 65 foot. The 20 foot high, vaulted ceiling is supported by 30 pillars, and riddled with cracks. Tapestries hang in tatters from the walls, and it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to tell what was once depicted on them. Some remnants of words or aphorisms remain, painted on the pillars, a single letter still legible in places. Wooden benches are piled up against the walls, apparently to clear the floor of the room. At several places, the large grey tiles of the floor have been removed, and holes have been dug underneath. Some people are camping in the center of the room. There&amp;rsquo;s a smoldering fire, and about it lie three bedrolls, a large leather bag, and a couple of shovels and pickaxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover Desecrated Temple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is part of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment.  This is Room 19, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
