			<description>According to the rules, Hurry Home was designed by J. W. Patterson, whose most famous game was the 1939 hit Contack. Described as &amp;quot;72 miles of hilarious enjoyment&amp;quot;, this race game has three twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the circular course from Home to Town and back again is laid out in three lanes: Red (inner), Yellow (middle) and Green (outer). Second, the game uses a very large 12-sided die with color-coded numbers: 1-4 are red; 5-8 are yellow; and 9-12 are green. Finally, players may only move counter-clockwise on the yellow and red tracks, and must move the opposite direction on green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players choose one of seven vehicles: train, plane, bus, car, scooter, bicycle and horse-drawn buggy, but their mode has no bearing on their speed. Each player roles the die and must move on that color track in the direction indicated. If this requires moving sideways to get to the right track, each such move counts against the total: so a player on the red track who rolls green 9 must first spend two points to go sideways to green and then 7 points clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player counters block movement by other players, whether sideways or around the track. First player to pass town and then home wins. A variant allows each player three rolls per turn, with the first two being optional and the final one compulsory (even if one or two previous were accepted and moved).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
