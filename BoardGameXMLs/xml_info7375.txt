							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Chick Game</name>
									
			<description>The Chick Game&amp;reg; is a unique conversation game that encourages women to reminisce about lost loves, analyze the complex relationships in their families, discuss the ups and downs of their friendships, reveal their quirks, and dish the dirt. Unlike other &amp;quot;sharing&amp;quot; games, there IS a winner in The Chick Game&amp;reg;&amp;mdash;it's the chick who reveals the most about herself, through a combination of choice and chance, during the course of the game. The Chick Game&amp;reg; rewards you for spilling all the intimate details of your life. But the game also gives you options to &amp;quot;play it safe&amp;quot; and answer less revealing questions if you'd rather keep some things to yourself. The Chick Game&amp;reg; is a great gift for women, and is perfect for birthdays, bridal showers, bachelorette parties, bridesmaids gifts, girls night out, girls night in, girls weekends, reunions, road trips, dorm rooms, and hostess gifts. The Chick Game&amp;reg; is &amp;quot;girls night out&amp;quot; in a box. It's available online at &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.thechickgame.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.thechickgame.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
