							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pocket Loops</name>
									
			<description>Pocket Loops uses a 12 piece subset of the Kaliko tiles with paths in two different colors.  Each set has a random set of tiles, made from left-overs of the acrylic version of Kaliko.  These tiles are hexagonal, each one having 3 paths that cross the tile from one edge to another.  To play the game, each player uses 6 tiles and tries to be the first to form a specific hexahex shape with matching paths.  There are 82 different hexahex shapes, formed from all possible arrangements of 6 connected hexagons.  The rule sheet includes puzzles for solitaire play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a version named Pocket Loops 3 that uses 16 all-different three-color tiles.  To play this game, each player starts with 7 tiles, the remaining 2 form the starting pattern.  Players take turns placing tiles, such that each tile touches at least 2 other tiles and the path colors match.  Each segment of the paths extended by the newly played piece scores 1 point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
