			<description>Join 5 Turn  is an abstract strategy game for people ages 4 and up.  It is basically a new twist on an old game.  The old game being Connect Four - or in this case, five.  each player has 13 tiles either red or blue and they try to get four or five in a row depending on the variation being played (there are three included with the game) the twist is that the board is mounted on an angled post and every time you place a tile you rotate the board a quarter turn.  this causes the tiles to shift and adds a new strategy element to an old game&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
