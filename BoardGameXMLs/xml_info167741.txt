			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build your own giant ship in this upgrade heavy shootem up. Collect iron to buy new accessories and weapons. Buy larger cabins to have more room for them. Place them on the ship as you want. Collect stars to unlock new weapons and accessories. In gameplay your ship is so large it nearly fills the screen, so don't expect to do much evasive maneuvering. The real challenge is in outfitting your ship. Make sure you have enough fuel to get through the level!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
