			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrorists are planning to destroy vital pipelines, people are being kidnapped for ransom, and who knows what foreign dictators are plotting. Only one thing stands to protect the world from these madmen, the International Secret Intelligence Service, ISIS. The American public can rest well knowing that the best of the best are on the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the head of the organization is more concerned with getting her hands on the new hire, the HR department is still trying to adjudicate that disgusting business about the Pita Predator, and the top agent just shot a coworker in the locker room. The coworker was in the locker room, not shot in the... never mind. But you&amp;rsquo;re more concerned with getting these TPS reports filed before Ms. Archer gets back from her three&amp;shy;martini lunch while avoiding &amp;ldquo;volunteering&amp;rdquo; for that madman Krieger&amp;rsquo;s latest science experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not even an international intelligence agency is above office politics and maddening bureaucracy, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got to navigate the bullets, red tape, and get the hell out by 5. After all, tonight is, um, uh... damn it! I had something for this!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
