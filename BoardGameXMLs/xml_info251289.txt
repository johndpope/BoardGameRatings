			<description>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house&lt;br/&gt;Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;&lt;br/&gt;But stillness is for those with no autopsy,&lt;br/&gt;For the dead were enjoying a Christmas soiree!&lt;br/&gt;The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,&lt;br/&gt;In one was a foot, though we knew not from where;&lt;br/&gt;The banshee shrieked carols of Christmases past,&lt;br/&gt;And all within earshot lost sanity fast;&lt;br/&gt;My friend, Dr. Jekyll, joined in the refrain,&lt;br/&gt;But I knew that within, Hyde sneered in disdain;&lt;br/&gt;With the mummy's own linen, he wrapped Christmas gifts,&lt;br/&gt;Each containing a tablet of cursed hieroglyphs;&lt;br/&gt;The witch mixed a potion of expensive liqueur,&lt;br/&gt;Which the vampyre spurned, preferring cruor;&lt;br/&gt;The ghost and the zombie had a small Christmas fight,&lt;br/&gt;On which was more deader, the undead or the geist;&lt;br/&gt;With twice seeing eyes, Franky took it all in.&lt;br/&gt;His very first Christmas, about to begin;&lt;br/&gt;But I thought I heard rustling out in the snow,&lt;br/&gt;And I spied out my window Van Helsing's crossbow;&lt;br/&gt;The hunter had found us and we had a plight,&lt;br/&gt;For Franky had not learned of Christmas delights;&lt;br/&gt;He let fly his arrow but it fell with a flub,&lt;br/&gt;For his cloak had been caught on a thorn in the shrub;&lt;br/&gt;Without wasting a moment to thank our landscaper,&lt;br/&gt;We escaped in the night to continue our caper;&lt;br/&gt;But we know he's still out there acting like an ass,&lt;br/&gt;Determined to make Franky's 1st Christmas his last;&lt;br/&gt;All the monsters are scared and I need assistance,&lt;br/&gt;To help overcome their foolish resistance;&lt;br/&gt;I beg you, dear reader, help Franky today,&lt;br/&gt;Just download the game, print it, and play;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Franky's 1st Christmas you must guide Franky to the lairs of 6 monster so that they can teach him their favorite thing about Christmas. Meanwhile, Van Helsing will be investigating the monsters and hunting them when he can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster card has two sides. The front includes their ability to persuade other monsters and a special power. The backside shows their Christmas lesson and how nervous they are to teach it. The Dr. Jekyll card is slightly different - he doesn't teach a Christmas Lesson. Rather, he turns into a Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde can still be used, but he's far more clumsy and less efficient than Dr. Jekyll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monsters will roll dice to try and convince each other to teach Franky his Christmas lessons. Each monster has distinct success values, making each roll in the game unique. Some monsters may instead use a special power to distract Van Helsing from his investigation or give other monsters a benefit. How the monsters use their actions is entirely up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn has 7 phases.&lt;br/&gt;1. Roll Random Event - This will usually move Van Helsing further along in his investigation or give the monsters better luck in their attempts to teach Franky.&lt;br/&gt;2. Select a monster to teach Franky a Christmas Lesson&lt;br/&gt;3. The other monsters take actions to persuade the teaching monster to do its job.&lt;br/&gt;4. Check to see if Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde.&lt;br/&gt;5. Reset the cards and get ready for the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You win the game by teaching Franky all 6 lessons of Christmas and escaping from Van Helsing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
