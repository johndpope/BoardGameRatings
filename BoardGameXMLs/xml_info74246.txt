			<description>&amp;quot;Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption is a 2006 expansion pack for the computer game Star Wars: Empire at War...&lt;br/&gt;Corruption adds organized crime as a third faction. Pirates had previously been present as a type of moderately-armed speed bump. The Zann Consortium is ... an invented side, notionally outside the good-evil dichotomy but willing to go to any lengths for a profit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Consortium has a full-fledged campaign that's set in the background of the film trilogy. Its specialty is &amp;quot;corruption:&amp;quot; it can conquer planets traditionally, but also gain bonuses from enemy-controlled worlds by having its infiltrators conduct any of several kinds of missions such as bribery, sabotage or piracy. Several mission types cause a small battle. It also has a mish-mash set of original units: A ring of raiders, renegades and ruffians eventually expands to eclectic exotic equipment as the Consortium appropriates everything it can lay its hands on. Crowd-pleasers include Rancor riders, surviving Droidekas and, if a &amp;quot;slavery&amp;quot; mission is performed on the forest moon of Endor, suicide bomber Ewoks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rebel Alliance and the Empire receive new units and changes to existing ones. Corruption also introduces the ability to position structures and units on a planet's surface, pre-select starting units during space or ground battles, mobile build pads and transport ships for ground battles, the ability to repair space station hardpoints, and orbital bombardment from capital ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Galactic conquest mode includes new sets of planets, with the new feature of non-conquest goals. The skirmish mode includes maps for the new planets alongside the previous maps, with the optional feature of having a third player on the map. Corruption includes 12 new planets: Dathomir, Mandalore, Hypori, Myrkr, Felucia, Honoghr, Kamino, Mustafar, Muunlinst, Saleucami, The Maw, and Utapau. Alderaan is now an asteroid field, and Bespin has a new ground landscape. Some planets now have infantry- and light vehicle-only terrain, and damaging terrain. New vehicles are also available, most drawn from the books and comics taking place after or between the original saga. These include all 3 phases of the Empire's Battle Droid, Lancet Aerial Artillery, and the Super Star Destroyer Executor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Star_Wars:_Empire_at_War:_Forces_of_Corruption,&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
