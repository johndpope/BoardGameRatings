							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hard Day&#039;s Knight</name>
									
			<description>King Elvish has proclaimed his daughter, the Princess, has decided to marry. The Princess has narrowed her suitors down to the finalists present. You are all Knights in service of King Elvish. And like all Knights of the Kingdom you are madly in love with King Elvish&amp;rsquo;s daughter. After much discussion, King Elvish and his daughter have agreed that the most valiant of her chosen suitors will become heir to the throne. The first Knight to present the Princess with the 3 Gifts of Gallantry she desires will win her favour. To acquire these gifts you must complete quests and obtain Laurels of Valor. Many Quests are impossible to complete alone. So, to demonstrate you are a born leader, you must hire and lead an adventuring party chosen from the most Motley Crew of the Kingdom. But, as a Knight of the Kingdom, you have worked your whole life in service and in turn been supported by the King. You have no gold to spare. In order to secure the necessary gold to pay your crew you must moonlight on OPQ (Other Patron&amp;rsquo;s Quests). Use your gold and crew wisely to quickly complete as many quests as possible. Thereby securing your place as the true Rock Star Knight of the Kingdom and rightful heir to the throne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Hard Day&amp;rsquo;s Knight each player holds 3 action dice, 1 patron die, some gold coins, and a hand of Motley Crew cards. Each round begins with the available Quests of the day posted at the center of the table. A round is a single hard day in a Knight&amp;rsquo;s life attempting to complete as many Quests as possible. All players simultaneously roll their 4 dice at once. The patron die randomly determines the turn order for each round. To complete a Quest and receive the Laurels and daily income from that Quest card, players must match their action dice with the dice icons on the Quest cards. But don&amp;rsquo;t be so quick to grab those Quest cards. Each player has a chance to hire Motley crew members and disrupt the dice on the table, or possibly the turn order, as you fight it out to be the first to complete the available Quests of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
