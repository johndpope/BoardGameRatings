							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">GoBots GIANT Card Game</name>
									
			<description>The object of this children's card game is to be the first player to collect ten or more pictures of their GoBot. Each player is trying to collect a different GoBot (either Leader-1, Royal-T, Cy-Kill, or Cop-Tur).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 31 oversized cards, and each has four pictures of GoBots. Two different GoBots are represented on each card. For example, a card may have two pictures of Leader-1, and two pictures of Cop-Tur. Or, it could have three pictures of Royal-T, and only one of Cy-Kill. (Cards always have either 2+2 or 3+1 pictures.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, a player draws one card from the draw deck or the discard pile. If at least one of the four pictures on that card is of the GoBot that the player is trying to collect, they keep it and play if face up on the table. All of the cards a player collects are placed side by side, in front of him. If the card drawn doesn't pictures the player's GoBot, the player discards it face down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also five Zap Cards. When a player draws a zap card, he places it on top of (covering, or &amp;quot;zapping&amp;quot;) any four pictures on an opponent's cards, either over one whole card, or overlapping it to cover one half of two different cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player who is the first to collect ten pictures of their GoBot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
