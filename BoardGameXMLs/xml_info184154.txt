			<description>You can mime as many words of &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; as you like. Your teammates must guess them and make with them all the craziest sentence possible. But beware, if you risk too much and the time runs out, you will lose everything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing by teams in your turn you have to roll the dice and take as many cards as it showed. Then, turn down the sand clock and you have to mime all the cards. When your mates guess them, they have to construct a sentence with all of them to win the cards. If done, you can choose to roll the dice again and take new cards but if your time ends before they get the words and the sentence, you will lose the cards and some of yours yet won. At the end of the game, team with most cards is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
