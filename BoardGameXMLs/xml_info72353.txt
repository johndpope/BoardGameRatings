			<description>NUTS! - War Against Japan is a supplement to the NUTS! World War 2 tabletop miniatures wargame describing forces and rules specific to the Pacific Theater of Operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;For the Allies, the war in the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) was fought under conditions unlike any found in Europe or North Africa. Fought against an enemy unlike any they had ever faced before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the Japanese, the war was about proving that their cause was just: the liberation of Asia from the yoke of Western oppression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of NUTS! - War Against Japan. NUTS - War Against Japan includes American, Australian, British, Chinese, and Japanese armies, all the major players in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WAJ portrays actions at the &amp;quot;tip of the spear&amp;quot;, the area of combat where small arms dominate the field. This is that deadly space where you can look your enemy in the eye while driving a knife into his heart; where the foxhole next to you may just as easily have the enemy in it as one of your buddies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you ready for it? Come experience PTO combat in a way that no other game can. Come experience War Against Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NUTS! - War Against Japan is not a stand-alone game. You must have the core rules, NUTS! Second Edition, to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
