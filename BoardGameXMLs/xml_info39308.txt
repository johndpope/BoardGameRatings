							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Strawberry Shortcake Win By A Whisker Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This card game is like Old Maid except with a twist. Instead of being declared the loser, the player who is left with the Old Maid (in this case, the Custard card) is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game begins by dealing out the 35 cards to all the players. Any pairs a player has are put down in front of them and the remaining cards are kept hidden. Players will then take turns picking a hidden card from another player. If a match is found, it is put down in front of the player that found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when one player is left holding the &amp;quot;Custard&amp;quot; card (Strawberry Shortcake's cat). They are declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
