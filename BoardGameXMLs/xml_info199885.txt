							<name primary="true" sortindex="3">A Single Moment</name>
									
			<description>The two samurai stared at each other. &lt;br/&gt;Once they were friends. Brothers. But time has come for honor to be regained, and vengeance to be unleashed.&lt;br/&gt;Footing adjusted. Grips tightened. Eyes narrowed. &lt;br/&gt;A single moment and it was over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keywords: Narrative, Two-Player, Multiple Genres, Cards, No Character Sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tobie Abad&amp;rsquo;s A Single Moment cuts deeper than the blade your character points at his enemy. The experience is drawn out of you from recesses that you didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed via the invisible game system. In just a few hours you will have shared a deep and enduring tale with a good friend that all comes down to, a single moment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;Ben Woerner&lt;br/&gt;WunderWerks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is an interesting, well-edited two-phase story game. I would gladly play it. Heck, I would gladly publish it.  In particular, I like the advice and explanations hiding inside the rules text. I also like the suggestions at the end for hacking the setting. I want to play the space opera hack with my friend the Stars Wars fan.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Josh T. Jordan&lt;br/&gt;Ginger Goat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;An intensely focused Samurai game with a lot of grit, intention, and drive.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;Ben Lehman&lt;br/&gt;these are our games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
