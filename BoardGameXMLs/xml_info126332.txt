			<description>In original Quintazone, players create a surface of tiled cards with connections defined by matching the five elements of air, earth, fire, water, and space, and they score by occupying those cards with pyramids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Quintazone-Chaser, the game is extended, as the players roll a die to race across the cards and collect the pyramids that were placed in Quintazone. The Chaser plays faster than the original game, but can only be played directly after it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the Aquarius Deck and Looney Pyramids used in Quintazone, Quintazone-Chaser adds a unique token for each player and the color die from IceDice (or a regular numeric d6).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion was originally published at IcehouseOrg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
