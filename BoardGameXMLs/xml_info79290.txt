							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Freelands</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Freelands are a sea of grassy hills and small woods, its scattered communities are islands of civility in a land plagued by orcs, giants, and undead. It is a land where mighty heroes can carve out a fief and be master of their own destinies, for no sovereign holds sway over the Freelands; or meet a painful death at the hands, teeth, and claws of the many horrors that haunt the land between settlements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This supplement explores the Freelands in greater detail, providing information on religious view, military might, and the vital trade network, as well as giving GMs over half a dozen new major locales to wave into their adventures. Expanded information is provided for the cult of the Norns, along with two new minor deities and three new monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
