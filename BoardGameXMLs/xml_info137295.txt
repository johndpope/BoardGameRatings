			<description>Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snowboard Hero&amp;trade; is an action-packed fun sports spectacle which brings high-speed racing action, sensational air manoeuvres and break-neck tricks to your Apple smartphone or tablet.

Jump over kickers, pass through gates, race as fast as you can or grind whatever obstacle is on your way! Make sure you collect the power-ups to get an extra boost, trick bonus or cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlock a huge number of stylish jackets and pants to customize your character and invest your earned cash to buy new boards and improve your character&amp;rsquo;s abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
