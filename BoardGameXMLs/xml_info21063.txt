			<description>[Translated from French, so might not be completely accurate...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calypso is at the same time a game of memory and deduction. In the center of the table, 6 tiles show fish of different colors, with another colored fish on the reverse. There are 4 colors in total. When the die roll shows a blue fish, you must turn over a plate to reveal a blue fish. It is thus useful to remember the movements of the fish. But when your memory fails, your powers of deduction can take over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imagine that you must turn over a red fish and that the situation on the table is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purple fish, Yellow fish, Yellow fish, Blue fish, Blue fish, Blue fish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can deduce that a red fish is under purple fish. Indeed, the three blue fish are blue/red, blue/yellow and blue/purple. The two yellow fish are thus yellow/red and yellow/purple. The last fish is thus purple/red, the only missing combination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This combination of reasoning and memory allows kids and adults to play each other. Whilst the adults can play the reasoning game, kids are generally much better at memory games!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
