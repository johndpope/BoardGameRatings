							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Iron Gauntlets Core Rules</name>
									
			<description>Harken back to the days of fantasy adventure.&lt;br/&gt;It is an age when heroes ventured where the mass of humankind dared not tread - into a fantastic world of arcane wizards, bold warriors, powerful kings, and fell beasts. The voyages were perilous, but the rewards were great. Iron Gauntlets will thrust your heroes into epic swords and sorcery quests. Will they find glory or treachery, triumph or an early death?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron Gauntlets goes back to basics with Heroic fantasy roleplaying and helps you create a customized campaign with its versatile and simple Impresa-based system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This edition contains only the core rules needed to play, as well as a sampling of Disposable Heroes Paper Minis and 3D rendered Battlemaps from &amp;Oslash;one Games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Versatile System&lt;br/&gt;Powered by the Impresa Modular Roleplaying System, Iron Gauntlets is both easy to learn and easy to play. The rules are simple, yet robust, and keep the action moving:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roll a number of 10-sided dice based on ability. Each die less than or equal to skill level is a step. The task's difficulty determines how many steps you need to succeed. Apart from some modifiers and variable outcomes (for magic), that's it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is story-centric, so characters perform tasks based on what they want to do, not what the rules tell them to do--dice can be bypassed in many situations and odds of success increased with experience, concentration, and assistance by others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diceless play is also possible when used in conjunction with Active Exploits Diceless Roleplaying. Or, use the genreDiversion i rules (genreDiversion i Manual, HardNova ][, Active Exploits Diceless Softcover) for 2d6 play. Plus you can also adapt your old OGL characters to Iron Gauntlets using the free conversion notes (included with Expanded PDF and Softcover).
