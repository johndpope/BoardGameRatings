			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Know this, you may look as they do, but you are not one of them. They know the power you possess and they fear it. Rightly so! For we are the future! We are the proper masters of this world! The normals are the last remnants of the failure of creation. We are its successes! Stand tall, brothers and sisters, the age of the sorcerer is upon us!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Xendras, advocate of sorcerer supremacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorcerers. They are just another type of magic&amp;ndash;user. Their powers are supposedly borne of dragon&amp;ndash;taint and their powers are unnaturally innate but they are no different than wizards. They are a normal component of the magical world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But what if they were not?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People fear wizards for their power. They respect clerics for the authority given to them by the dive. Sorcerers are a different story. Their powers just &amp;lsquo;happen&amp;rsquo;. One day a child is normal and the next day he hurls flame from his fingertips. They are dangerous, undisciplined and uncontrollable. Most frighteningly, they could be hiding anywhere. A wizard is easy enough to spot by the books and other mystic paraphernalia he carries. A cleric is bound by the will his god and wears his holy symbol proudly. Yet sorcerers are beholden to nothing and look like anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rumors are everywhere: Sorcerers are really dragons or demons in human form. They consume souls to power their magic. They are a curse sent to wipe out mankind. They are servants or thralls of malign forces. They seek to destroy and replace mundane human and demi&amp;ndash;human kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Four New Feats. New Spelltouched feats (Accelerated Perspective, Fight not Flight, Light as a Feather and Rubberflesh) grant special supernatural powers that stem from a sorcerous bloodline or from exposure to magical energy.&lt;br/&gt;     Four New Flaws. Freak, instinctive magic, instinctive psionics and overactive aura. Flaws allow you to select an additional feat in exchange for a vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;     Class Variant: The Bloodbound Sorcerer. Trade in your ability to summon a familiar to gain one of eight special powers and themed spell-lists associated with the bloodbound domains: the botanic, firebrander, frostlord, living banshee, manbeast, metamorph, speedster and stormlord. Burn with living fire, outrace a speeding bulette, master your own shape, kill with the sound of your voice and more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
