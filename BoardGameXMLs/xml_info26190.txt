			<description>An expansion set for the base game. This adds a set of 8 Robber cards along with rules in German, English, French and Spanish on how he affects the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robber can steal from the thieves and the master thieves. If a thief or a master thief finds jewels, and a robber has been played, the robber's may steal one of the jewels starting in numeric order as in the cards. A robber may not steal the last jewel a thief has found. After stealing, the robber card is discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robber may also take a thief or a master thief as prisoner. If the thief or master thief drops jewels from the drawer, the robber may exchange the robber card with the thief or master thief card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The robber never touches the cube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion was a give-away at Essen 2006 at the Zoch Spiel booth. Unfortunately the card-size did not match that of the original card set. Although it did not matter too much that they were slightly oversized, in 2007, the set was once again an Essen give-away, now with a matching card size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expands:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Master Thieves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
