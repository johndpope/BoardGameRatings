			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a roleplaying game that is designed to be run with no preparation in a single game of two to four hours. It is inspired by the cinematic soldiers versus aliens genre &amp;ndash; that means Aliens above all else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every game session has the same basic setup &amp;ndash; a squad of marines is heading out to investigate an isolated colony (or where ever). Contact has been lost and Colonial Defense is suspicious. Inevitably, there's a hostile force waiting there and it's up to you guys to save the day or die trying. And do it with style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make each game different, the mystery is invented as you go along. All players get an equal say in what actually occurred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
