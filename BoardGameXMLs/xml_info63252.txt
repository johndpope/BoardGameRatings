			<description>BlastBox! The exciting game with a Bang!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BlastBox is a tension filled strategic game with an explosive outcome that will make you jump out of your seat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inflate one balloon per player and place them inside the BlastBox. Players use the spinner to determine how many spikes are needed per turn. Be careful where you place them, burst a balloon and you're OUT!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll need daring, luck, and a bit of skill to remain in the game.
