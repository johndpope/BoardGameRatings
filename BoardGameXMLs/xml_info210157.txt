							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Baseball Spin-A-Game</name>
									
			<description>This mechanical game is like baseball crossed with a one-eyed bandit. The key to the game is a spinning roller mounted in one end of the plastic game case. Facing a baseball diamond that slopes down toward the players are 8 windows to cover all possible running situations: No one on, man on first, second or third, first and second, first and third, second and third, and bases loaded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For each at-bat, the batting player pulls a lever on the side of the roller, which sets it spinning. When it stops, the result of the play is read out of the window that corresponds to the current state of the field. The results can vary widely: a home run with man on third can sit right next to pop-up out with man on second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A baseball diamond covers most of the top of the game, with peg holes to enable runners to be tracked. Normal rules of baseball apply: three outs to an inning; nine innings to a game; highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is undated, it is likely c.1960, since the box shows the publisher as Hassenfeld Brothers but also displays the Hasbro mark that was used for years prior to the company name change in 1968.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
