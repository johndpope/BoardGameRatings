							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Temple of the Flying Blades</name>
									
			<description>Your task:  Take control of the temple.  Like the Chinese tradition of wǔx&amp;iacute;ng, about which the Onmyōji have taught your dojo, you arrive to discover that there are five competing elements:  Two over whom you have mastery; two who know your vulnerabilities.  Nevertheless, you know you must prevail at The Temple of the Flying Blades!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Temple of the Flying Blades is a ninja-fighting game for 5 players. It includes a variant for 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Temple of the Flying Blades is a step-up from The House of the Flying Blades. It is a game on its own, but players owning The House of the Flying Blades can 'upgrade' to The Temple of the Flying Blades by purchasing the additional components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MATERIAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The temple board (a 6&amp;times;9 board that transforms the 9x9 house into a 15x9 temple).&lt;br/&gt;- At least 28 additional black ninja counters and at least 28 additional green ninja counters. So there are 5 dojos with at least 28 ninjas each in total.&lt;br/&gt;- 32 'special attack' cards (from the base game).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a variant, you can play without the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
