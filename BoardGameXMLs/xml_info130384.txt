							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cypher: Cyberpunk Text Adventure</name>
									
			<description>User summary by zefquaavius&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name suggests, Cypher: Cyberpunk Text Adventure is a text adventure in a cyberpunk setting.  &amp;hellip;created decades after the popularity of text adventures petered out, due to the maturation of computer graphics.  Cypher modernizes the ancient (in computer terms) genre quite a bit, by adding graphics designed to immerse 2012's gamers in a gaming technology created in 1975.  For example, as you acquire noteworthy items, they lie among the others at the right of the display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to NeoSushi City&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever since you came back from the Moon colonies you've been struggling to get into the smuggling business again. Things aren't as easy as they once were though, especially without your old pal Eddie around. It was him who brought all the major players in the market to do business with. And boy did they line up to hire you. Even the Yakuza used to pay almost twice the standard rate for moving passcodes through the international borders inside your Synapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All you've got now is a French crook that goes by the name of Lime, who cares more about setting up his own deals than bringing new quality customers on board to work with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You always knew working with that french bastard was trouble, only you never realized how much until one of the deals he had setup went wrong.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Immerse Like Never Before&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CYPHER: Cyberpunk Text Adventure is unlike anything you have ever played before; it is a whole new dimension in game interaction and storytelling you can vividly experience from within the realms of your own imagination!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Think of a book or movie you like the most, now imagine for a moment a limitless world of interaction and adventure where you not only take control of the main character of the story, but ARE the main character of the story! Every word you say, every decision or action you take is exclusively your own in the world of CYPHER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Text Adventures you communicate with the game world through conversational English sentences, the same way you would do in a chatroom or writing emails. The story unravels into a thrilling interactive experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat for hours... as long as you can escape death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
