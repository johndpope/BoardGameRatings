			<description>De Helden van onze Planeet is a card game in which players try to reach the number 2020 first, because 2020 is the year that WWF has set as goal to live in harmony with nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players start in the year 0 and try to be the first to reach the year 2020 by playing out cards with numbers. These numbers represent years and players have to reach year 2020 exactly! There are of course special cards to block another player, steal years from another player, or play extra cards. The cards itself have photos and information on them about nature, wildlife, and preservation of the environment. So besides the game-play there is a learning factor for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
