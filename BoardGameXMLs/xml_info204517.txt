							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">24 Hours &#039;til Rescue</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 Hours &amp;lsquo;Til Rescue plunges you into dynamic, hand-crafted, city overrun by the undead with one, simple premise: to escape the city alive. Yet, with most of the streets barricaded, all of them teeming with enemies, and with rescue not coming for another 24 hours, the chances of survival are slim to none. If you want to escape you are going to have to head out into the streets, find fellow survivors, scavenge the city for guns, ammo and food, and undertake a terrifying quest that will lead you into the bowels of the infected hospital, through the rat infested sewers, and to the home of the crazy mayor. The world is never going to be the same again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
