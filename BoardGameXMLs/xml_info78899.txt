			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mega Man V is the fifth in a series of handheld ports of the successful NES games.  It represents the culmination of the Gameboy ports, with a completely original set of enemies, stages, and bosses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay is mostly the same as other entries in the franchise.  Players attempt to destroy 8 robot masters, then defeat Dr. Wily himself.  As each boss is destroyed, its special attack is gained for use against future enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This version introduces the Stardroids, mysterious robots from space named after the 9 planets in the solar system.  Their leader, 'Terra', attacks Earth along with the other 8, and MegaMan naturally has to save the day.  Of course, it comes as absolutely no surprise when Dr. Wily is revealed to be the mastermind behind it all.  Mega Man V continues the tradition in the Gameboy series of giving the player only 4 stages to choose from at the start, followed by an intermediate stage, then the next 4, and finally Dr. Wily's fortress stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the 2 Rush adaptors gained along with weapons when defeating specific bosses, the cat Tango can be used as a special weapon.  Like the previous game, there is a shop and currency system for buying items with the 'p-chips' found in stages.  Also like the 4th gameboy title, some stages have secret areas that can be accessed using one of the special weapons.  An interesting note about this game is that it has the only occurrence in the series of another enemy taking the place of Dr. Wily's machines for the final boss fight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
