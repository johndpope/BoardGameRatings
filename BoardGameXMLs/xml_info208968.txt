			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Legendary Adventures: Arctic Tundra, we introduce the vast, desolate wilderness known only as the Expanse to the poor souls who live there. Eking out a difficult, modest existence in these inhospitable wastes is hard enough at the best of times, but come each winter an impenetrable blizzard renders the entire arctic shelf of the Expanse unlivable to all but the hardiest, most-resilient of creatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join the Iqtoh tribe in our latest offering as they undertake their perilous and exhausting annual migration, desperately racing to keep ahead of the encroaching winter before getting devoured by sub-zero conditions and dense blizzards. Travel with the tribe as they depart the Endless White and traverse the Mammoth Hinterlands, Matsuoka's Ryse, and Shifting Sea regions before, and with a little luck, finally reaching the safety and sanctuary of Whitewhorl.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legendary Adventures: Arctic Tundra features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Adventure. An open, non-linear adventure that features a central meta-plot and lots of optional/recommended quests to keep your players busy in the Expanse.&lt;br/&gt;    New 'arctic' equipment. Including an appropriately-themed kit that provides everything aspiring adventurers could want to mount an expedition into the Expanse or any other frigid, frosty, or frozen frontier.&lt;br/&gt;    Appendices. Statistical information for new non-player characters and monsters, perfect for use in colder climes.&lt;br/&gt;    Additional Materials. Random event, encounter, and environment charts for three huge arctic-themed regions, including unique rules that govern travel in each, and several potential adventuring-hubs along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
