							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Star Wars Escape From Naboo</name>
									
			<description>Sleek, elegant and breathtaking, the transport vessel used by Queen Amidala of Naboo is a handcrafted J-type ship powered by a 327 Nubian engine, specially crafted for the young leader.  In keeping with the peaceful nature of the Naboo people, the Queen's ship has no weapons, only deflector shields.  Queen Amidala uses her ship to escape the Trade Federation blockade and appeal her planet's cause to the Galactic Senate.  Their mission is jeopardized when the hyperdrive breaks down.  Now you must make repairs before the Trade Federation finds the ship and stops your critical mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
