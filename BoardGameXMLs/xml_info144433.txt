			<description>Heroes &amp;amp; Generals is a combined first-person shooter and strategy video game in a World War II setting. It is being developed by independent studio Reto-Moto, which is founded by some of the original founders of IO Interactive and the Hitman series, and will be published by Square Enix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developers call it a &amp;quot;mass participation game&amp;quot; in contrast to a traditional massively multiplayer online games, where the actions in the FPS-part of the game reflects into the strategy-part. The player can use weapons from Germany, the United States, and the Soviet Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay  &lt;br/&gt;The player starts with a soldier from each faction (United States, Soviet Union, Germany) and can buy additional soldiers with in-game credits. These soldiers are equipped with a default rifle and can play the Encounter game mode immediately. When entering a battle, the player is presented with an interactive map, showing terrain and which team controls which control points. In the Skirmish and Encounter game modes, the player must click on the spawn point of their team (or called faction) and can choose whether to spawn on foot or in a vehicle. In the Assault game mode, the same rules apply, except players can also spawn on control points captured by their team. Teams will always consist of soldiers from the same nation, unlike some World War II games that have teams of mixed nationalities. The game includes World War II era tanks, planes, and land vehicles. Infantry units are also a vital game play aspect. Tactical decisions made by officers in grand campaigns affect in-game support, reinforcements, and logistics. Players will encounter a variety of terrain, from fields and countryside to large cities. The game features three game modes for the FPS-part of the game: Assault, Skirmish and Encounter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Heroes &amp;amp; Generals&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
