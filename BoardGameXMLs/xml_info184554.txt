							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">ATS Great War: Tankschreken!</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legendary designer Ian Daglish (dec.) left behind his take on the Great War for tactical-level gamers and the baton has crossed the finish line in the form of ATS GREAT WAR I: Tankschreken!&lt;br/&gt;The module includes all the combat counters needed to play plus 10 scenarios, all featuring British vs. German actions ... and of course some of them debut tanks ... the name deriving from an attempt to keep this new technology secret by making the enemy think &amp;lsquo;water tanks&amp;rsquo; were being constructed. You also receive&amp;mdash;as a SPECIAL BONUS&amp;mdash;ALL OF THE BOARDS NEEDED TO PLAY in 11&amp;rdquo; &amp;times; 16&amp;rdquo; folding format. You also receive a Play Aid to augment standard system play aid cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You receive all the combat counters you need to play. Special rules in color, 3-hole format. And of course, a collection of color format scenarios (8 in all) that all feature German/British combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
