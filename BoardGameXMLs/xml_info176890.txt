							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">World of the Dead</name>
									
			<description>From Publisher's Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been four years since the Living Dead rose and consumed the Earth. Governments fell, militaries were torn apart, and everyday conveniences we took for granted crumbled. Surviving meant finding enough food, water, and shelter to make it through another day. Where once we lived in tightly packed cities along side the faceless masses, now whether or not to trust another human being could mean life or death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But humanity will not go down so easily. In the years since the outbreak, societies have arisen, with citizenship based upon hard work and contributions, not a natural right. New Living Dead roam the wastelands, some a result of a mutation to the original virus, and some created through diabolocal experiments. Most dangerous is the Rotter, a Living Dead with full memories of its previous life, and the intelligence to wage a war to eliminate what remains of humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;World of the Dead is a stand-alone sequel to the popular War of the Dead campaign. Although War of the Dead is not necessary to play, a copy of Savage Worlds from Pinnacle Entertainment Group is required. Inside this book you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Five player races&lt;br/&gt;     Expanded Setting Rules&lt;br/&gt;     New Edges&lt;br/&gt;     Details on living in the survivor kingdoms, plus rules for creating one of your very own&lt;br/&gt;     Complete rules for custom building new Living Dead&lt;br/&gt;     Adventure Generator&lt;br/&gt;     Full Plot Point Campaign and Savage Tales&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four years is a long time to live in the Rotter Lands. The Living Dead press in on all sides, and raiders ply the wastelands looking for slaves and resources. Do you have what it takes to survive in the post-apocalyptic world, and protect the society that has grown around you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
