			<description>The game consists of many pie piece shaped tiles which contain sentence parts; there are also round picture tiles on which the &amp;quot;round belly king&amp;quot; does something with someone somewhere, using some item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule set contains many different game ideas, all aimed at training kids to read fast and accurately and to form correct complex sentences. Some examples: &lt;br/&gt;- A player picks a picture tile, then lays out a sentence which shows the events of the picture.&lt;br/&gt;- As above, but now the player must put one wrong tile into the sentence. The first of the other players to find the mistake scores a point.&lt;br/&gt;- Players compete forming as many correct sentences from the available tiles as possible.&lt;br/&gt;- Each player draws an image, looks at it and turns it over. Now everyone must find the corresponding sentence parts and say their sentence; the first one to manage that is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
