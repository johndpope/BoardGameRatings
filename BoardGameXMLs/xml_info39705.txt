			<description>&amp;quot;Shake, roll, but don't get rattled in this frantic fast food race game. Be fast or be last in the whackiest, zappiest American Diner on the block!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunny die up, over easy, hold the fries! Take the order, serve the food and collect a tip - but its your opponent that's in control of the time with the unique, shake, rattle and roll salt pot timer. They shake - you quake, as you race to be the first player to collect three tips and win the game.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the last game to be produced by Waddingtons before they were taken over by Hasbro. The game is for 2-4 players, Ages 6 and up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a coloured playing piece representing a waiter or waitress. On their turn, each player is timed using a salt pot shaker (which is effectively a timer), which is shook frantically to make the 'salt' within it drain faster. When all of the 'salt' within it reaches the bottom, the players turn is over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a players turn, the player may do as many of the following before their time runs out:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- roll a standard six sided die and move from the kitchen to the nearest table of their colour&lt;br/&gt;- on arriving at a table, the player picks up a food order disc and tries to return to the kitchen&lt;br/&gt;- upon reaching the kitchen (which contains a spinner), the player spins the spinner until it matches the food order they have picked up. The spinner can reveal either a blank or food. If food is displayed, the food order is ready&lt;br/&gt;- return back from the kitchen to the table where the order was placed, and collect a money tip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to collect three money tips wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game board requires some assembly, and consists of the kitchen, the tables to be served, and narrow lanes which the players move along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with many of the later Waddingtons games, it was firmly aimed at the younger end of the market, and as a consequence has limited replay value. Still, it is fast and frantic - players are constantly rolling dice and moving pieces, whilst another player is shaking the timer to end that players turn, egged on by any other players. The narrow lanes in the board do introduce a limited amount of strategy - you can block opposing players off - and the salt pot timer is a work of genius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
