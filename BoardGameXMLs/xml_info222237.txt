			<description>WALL TO WALL &amp;ndash; BUILD YOUR VICTORY BRICK BY BRICK!&lt;br/&gt;Two players, one wall, opposing sides, different colours. Who will place the most bricks of the same colour in a row, diagonally and touching?&lt;br/&gt;The bricks and the die of Wall to wall  are made of wood coming from eco-friendly forestry in respect of the natural and social environment. (100% FSC&amp;reg;)&lt;br/&gt;Wall to wall is a safe, eco-friendly game realised with nontoxic paint and made in Italy.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;COMPONENTS:  &lt;br/&gt;42 wooden bricks with colours on two sides&lt;br/&gt;1 wooden die with 6 sides&lt;br/&gt;1 instruction sheet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO BUILD THE WALL&lt;br/&gt;The bricks on the bottom row - the one touching the playing area &amp;ndash; must be placed adjacent to one another, with a maximum of 10 bricks being used. From the second row up, each brick must be placed half over two different bricks. Unlike the first row, bricks do not need to be placed adjacent to each other. Only bricks that have no other bricks above them can be moved.&lt;br/&gt;RULES&lt;br/&gt;Goal: Place as many bricks as possible in your colour on your side of the wall in a row, diagonally and touching.&lt;br/&gt;PREPARATION AND STARTING&lt;br/&gt;The two players must sit facing each other, with the bricks placed to one side of the playing area in a pile. Each player choses one of the colours: green, fuchsia or light blue (the colour that is not chosen is neutral). Thefirst player to go is the one that, throwing the die, throws their colour first. After this, the players alternate turns. The wall is built between the two players. The bricks are placed such that the two coloured sides of the bricks face the players.&lt;br/&gt;TURNS&lt;br/&gt;The player whose turn it is throws the die and performs the corresponding action:&lt;br/&gt;- Green brick: Take a brick from the pile that has AT LEAST one green side and PLACE IT on the wall.&lt;br/&gt;- Fuchsia brick: PLACE a new brick that has AT LEAST one fuchsia side.&lt;br/&gt;- Light blue brick: PLACE a new brick that has AT LEAST one light blue side.&lt;br/&gt; - Little girl: PLACE a brick that has NO SIDES in your colour.&lt;br/&gt;- Grey brick: Take a brick from the WALL and MOVE it to where you want on the wall, or simply TURN IT AROUND.&lt;br/&gt;NB: Once a brick has been picked up, that brick is the one that must be moved or turned. If the wall hasn't yet been started, then you forfeit your turn.&lt;br/&gt;- Little boy: CHOOSE one of the actions from the five options. NB: If the action indicated on the die cannot be done (e.g., the die shows fuchsia, but all the bricks with at least one fuchsia side have already been used), then you forfeit your turn.&lt;br/&gt;END OF GAME&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when all the bricks have been placed on the wall. Points are awarded as follows: 10 points for the longest diagonal (in a player's colour on their side of the wall); 8 points for the longest row; 6 points for the most touching bricks. If there is a tie, then thepoints are shared (e.g. if both players have 8 touching bricks, then each one gets 3 points).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
