			<description>Dexterity racing car game. Under the board there are magnets and the cars have magnets in as well. Using the steering wheel, you may connect magnet to magnet and advance the car round the track. Not as easy as it sounds. The winner is the player who manages the most laps after a pre-determined time runs out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
