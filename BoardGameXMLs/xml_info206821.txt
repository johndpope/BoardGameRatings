							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">12 Days of Munchkin Christmas Coloring Book</name>
									
			<description>Description from the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12 Days of Munchkin Christmas Coloring Book is a 28-page coloring book that illustrates Christmas the Munchkin way &amp;ndash; by showing just how much havoc Spyke wreaks with his chainsaw on each of the twelve days of Christmas! Hint: Many orcs, trolls, and other fantasy creatures did in fact die in the making of this product. So color it yourself, or give it to your real munchkins so they can learn all about monster-killing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book also comes with ten unique Munchkin cards, which means when you're done coloring, you can shuffle some new cards right into any Munchkin game and do some slaying of your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
