			<description>Six player version of Omba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to block all opponents so eventually one is the last player to be able to make a legal move. Movement is determined by a die. A playing piece can move the number rolled, not just horizontically but also vertically. Thus getting on top of a neighboring piece and blocking it takes a roll of a two. &lt;br/&gt;A player that cannot make a legal move with his/her roll is eliminated, unless he/she still has one or more of his/her playing pieces outside the board (i.e. not used yet). In that case he/she can re-roll until a movement is possible. &lt;br/&gt;The last player who isn't completely blocked is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The playing field is star shaped. In comparison to Omba, there are a lot more possibilities for movement, so the game is more tactical and less luck driven than Omba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
