			<description>A combination of dominoes, memory and a quiz game. The game consists of square cards, each showing two halves of different pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On their turn, players turn over two cards. If they match and form a complete picture, the player has to choose and answer one of the four quiz questions. If he knows the correct answer, he can either keep the two cards, or try and open up a third card which then has to match to one of the ends of his chain. The player who collected the most cards at the end wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
