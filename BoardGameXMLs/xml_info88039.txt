			<description>From the FFP website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IFOS - Advanced Abilities Supplement is a Web-exclusive for Invasion From Outer Space and features 4 new game cards for the Martian and Hero Decks and 10 new Advanced Ability cards (8 Hero and 2 Martian) as well as the new rules for using them. All pieces are printed on the same high-quality card stock as the boardgame. The cards are exclusive to this supplement and will not be available anywhere else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Advanced Abilities cards can be added to any existing Scenario as a way for both the Heroes and the Martians to gain experience during games unlocking powerful new abilities. There is a unique Advanced Ability for each Hero character, allowing each to level-up and use a super-powered version of his or her Talent (requiring the use of a full 3 Power Tokens), as well as global abilities that the Martians can get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
