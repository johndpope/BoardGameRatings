							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Gee Bee</name>
									
			<description>Gee Bee is Namco's very first arcade game, released in 1978. It was developed by T≈çru Iwatani, who went on to create Pac-Man. It was released in the United States by Gremlin; this version replaces the &amp;quot;NAMCO&amp;quot; letters on the light-up bumpers with Gremlin's distinctive &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; logo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a combination of pinball-style game with that of a ball-and-paddle game where the player bounces a ball into blocks. The goal of the game is to keep the ball from falling to the bottom of the screen for as long as possible and get the high score.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were two sequels, Bomb Bee and Cutie Q, which were also designed by Iwatani and released in the following year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Gee Bee (arcade game),&amp;quot; available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
