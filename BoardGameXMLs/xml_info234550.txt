You can even steal monster&amp;rsquo;s attacks and use them as your own. No one said you had to fight fair.&lt;br/&gt;die die&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to happen. But in the Spiral Shards, every fallen hero leaves behind an echo, which can be called back to life by other heroes. Combine the echoes you raise to form Ancients, epic allies who can deal massive damage or save you from the brink of defeat. All your deaths will not be in vain.&lt;br/&gt;win win&lt;br/&gt;Earn prestige for every game you play, with bonuses for epic monster-slaying. Use your prestige to unlock the most powerful versions of your favorite heroes, for only the strongest of Heroes will be invited to the Champions Trials, your greatest challenge yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
