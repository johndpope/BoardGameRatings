			<description>Deathball is a fast paced and brutal sports game inspired by others such as Dreadball and Blood Bowl. Challenge your friends in a match of this violent sports contest where a well-placed pass is just as important as a well-placed punch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deathball is a single-page ruleset played with Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy, miniatures that was designed to be fast to learn and simple to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Blood Bowl and other sports games the system pits you and your friends in a fast paced competition of violently hilarious ball play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns, where during each turn the coaches activate their players.
