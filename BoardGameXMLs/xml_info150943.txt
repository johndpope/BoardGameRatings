							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Little Book of Big Bads</name>
									
			<description>Supplement for the Nova Roma setting from Avalon games' Heroes Wear Masks for Pathfinder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;Most supervillains are the jobbers of the superhuman community. The pull one or two high profile crimes, get beat up by some heroes, and then spend the rest of their life in Innsmouth. Those villains skilled or lucky enough to be able to reliably escape can aspire to become recurring threats. Perhaps even a member of what cannot legally be called a Rogues Gallery. An Archive of Reprobates?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then there are those threats who stand above the traditional pattern of agitation, incarceration and escape. These are campaign-scale villains who can make their presence felt through potentially dozens of adventures. This book is a small collection of such Big Bads, suitably twisted for the Nova Roma universe. These characters are for use over the span of a campaign (or at least a linked series of adventures). Only very high level characters will be able to take these characters head on (and doing so robs them of some of their charm).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
