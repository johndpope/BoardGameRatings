							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pirates Versus Ninjas</name>
									
			<description>This is a card game based on battles in an epic war between two factions, Ninjas and Pirates.  Players choose a side at the beginning of the game, with at least 1 player representing each faction.  Players have a hand of 5 cards featuring fighter cards (depicting famous Pirates or Ninjas), weapon cards, ability cards, and ambush cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After sides have been selected, players initiate a &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; round where each player draws two cards and may then  take two actions, including playing a fighter from their faction, a weapon on a fighter already in play on their side, an ability on a fighter, or they may discard up to two cards and draw replacements.  Play passes to the left.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all players have drawn and played cards, a &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; round begins where all fighters enter into a battle for supremacy.  The total number of fighters for each player is determined by the lowest number that player controls.  After fighters have been selected the first player may choose to activate an ability or play an ambush card from his or her hand affecting the battle.  This continues until all players have decided to pass.  All players total their attack value for all fighters involved in battle the highest total earns that player a victory point (6 are needed to win).  Then all players roll a die to determine casualties.  If a die roll matches an opponent's fighter, that fighter is discarded from play and the die roller earns a victory point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After battle, a draw phase starts again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
