			<description>Erie Canal is a 2-4 player Print-and-Play game that focuses on transportation in the canal.  The canal board pieces are modular so you can change the canal each time you play the game, offering many possible scenarios.  As a part of the 2012 Historical Themed Board Game Contest, Erie Canal comes with 4 pre-defined scenarios to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Erie canal each player on their turn will be given an allotment of action points, which they will use to perform various actions.  Some of these actions will allow the player to control the locks, which is a new element introduced for this game.  Each player will have to transport goods and people up and down the canal while trying to make effective use of these locks.  The player gains the most victory points by transporting the most people and goods will be declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
