			<description>Teams! Mayhem is a place-your-minis-to-win board game by MiniMishaps Games.  Your chosen team of characters has been pulled into a world that is fraught with portals to other worlds.  The powerful mages here control who comes and who goes.  They have created tasks to help them figure out who to send home.  Use your pieces to accomplish these tasks before the other Players or you will be stuck here in oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has a strategy component, but also a luck component.  It combines pieces that can move and attack with an ever-changing deck of cards that limit or enhance how pieces are played, moved, or captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each Victory card has a task.  The first player to three Victory cards is the winner.  Victory cards are won be being the first player to finish the task, and you also gain a Victory card if you take over another player's portal.  There are even cards that require players to work together before being able to continue to work on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
