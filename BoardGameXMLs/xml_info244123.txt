							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">100 Improvised Weapons to Find During a Zombie Apocalypse</name>
									
			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When players are attacked by zombies, especially during the opening moments of a zombie apocalypse, it is quite possible they may not have any genuine weapons on them, and will be forced to use whatever they can find to hand. They might also be forced to scavenge for weapons at a later date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This list has 100 different things that can be found by players comparatively easily, and which they may try to use as a weapon - with mixed results. Some improvised weapons are not as effective as might be thought; chainsaws, in particular, are not as effective as various media makes out. Most of the items are modern, so these are most suited for a modern setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each entry considers matters like how easy the weapon in question is to use, how likely it is to actually damage a zombie enough, what drawbacks there may from using it, and where these items could be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weapons include things like hammers, baseball bats, kettles and bottles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One page is the front cover, one the front matter, and the Introduction is slightly more than one page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
