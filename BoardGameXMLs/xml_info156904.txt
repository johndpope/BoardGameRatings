			<description>from the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;You are reading Dead Cities, a simple, fast-play post-apocalyptic role-playing game set in 2072, thirty-five years after the majority of humanity was killed by a terrible plague. The players are survivors of that plague or their descendants trying to eke out a living, or, hopefully, rebuild their own pocket of civilization (or even their own empire) out of the vine-choked ruins of the old one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Cities is based on Chris Gonnerman's excellent The Simple Game System rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;user comment:&lt;br/&gt;There are slight differences in character generation from the base game.  This version of the rules offers an additional ability/disability pair, primitive-advanced, and has a system for the generation of mutations, vehicle rules, firearms, and other differences necessary to support the tropes of the post-apocalyptic genre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
