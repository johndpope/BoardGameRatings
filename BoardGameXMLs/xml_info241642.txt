			<description>Freight Wars is a 2-3 player game where you can procedurally generate your game tiles before you print them, giving you a completely unique game set. You are a Victorian industrialist who is looking to build a transportation network. You can do this by placing roads, rivers, or railways to connect towns to other places, as well as block off the routes of your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, you must choose which mode of transportation each player should use. One should use roads, one rivers, the other should use trains. Then, you must shuffle the cards and hand them out to various players. Each player should get a town card, as well as two other cards dealt to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players must place tiles so that the modes of transportation connect to the tiles already placed on the table. These tiles will need to match up for every mode of transportation to be placed, then the player will be able to draw another tile from the deck, so they always have three cards. Players can also skip a turn by discarding all of their tiles to draw a new hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After all of the tiles are placed, players must count up how many connections they have between towns. There are different points depending on how well the transport links are between different places. This can be seen in more detail in the rules of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This print-and-play game has an unusual distribution method - players download a Windows executable program which generates random tiles for printing.  Once printed, the tiles are used for traditional tabletop play.  Because the tiles are programmatically generated with randomization, no two sets will be exactly the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
