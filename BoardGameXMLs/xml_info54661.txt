			<description>In Ribbon Drive, we collectively create a story about a road trip.  We do this in the comfort of a living room, over the course of 3-5 hours.  We each create a character, one of the people going on this road trip.  These characters are our individual jobs; each of us will roleplay one character's decisions and actions.  We'll share the responsibility of narrating the obstacles and scenery that comes up all around out characters.  Ribbon Drive creates stories about letting go on the open road, and we all work to both further and complicate this agenda during the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-From the first page of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes in a DVD case with a mix CD of music to inspire your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
