			<description>Fun, fast-playing cooperative game that that reduces the fantasy RPG experience to fighting a climactic boss battle by rolling dice and playing spell cards. Comes with five characters and five sealed scenarios; stands up to replaying well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The boss stays in an octagon in the centre, and is surrounded by eight spaces that may be occupied by players, or in higher levels fire or minions. Each turn consists of a player phase and a boss phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the player phase, the player on turn rolls 4d6, and rerolls up to 2d6 once. The dice serve two functions: first, they designate through character-specific tables which actions (move, draw spell cards, heal, etc.) or spells you can take; second, the largest set of identical dice determines how much damage you do to the boss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the boss phase, the boss rotates either two 45&amp;deg; steps or to face a player. The current player rolls 3d6, discards the high die, and looks up the two lower dice in a table to determine which octants take how much damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
