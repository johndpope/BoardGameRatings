			<description>When noted 21st century scientist Doc Yoshimaya fell in love with one of his &amp;quot;C-Life&amp;quot; artificial intelligence creations he uploaded himself into his computer where her program core merged with his DNA and half-human, half C-Life, Pulseman was born. Doc Yoshimaya's mind twisted as he emerged back into real life and he became evil Doc Waruyama. Use Pulseman's ability to harness electricity as a weapon and, with his Volteccer attack, as a means of rapid transport to fight Waruyama's Galaxy Gang across 7 crazy stages.
