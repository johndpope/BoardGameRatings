			<description>[User Description]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You Don't Know Jack is a trivia game that uses elements of pop culture to ask entertaining trivia questions to the players.  The game is structured like a television game show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A player chooses the question's category and then the question number is presented in an amusing song/animation of the question number before asking the question.  Questions are read aloud by a host and players must buzz in to choose one of the 4 answers.  Correct answers earn (virtual) cash and incorrect answers lose cash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two rounds of regular questions, with the second round's questions being worth more money.  A third round called the Jack Attack is then presented where players can earn more money.  The winner is the person with the most money at the end of the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
