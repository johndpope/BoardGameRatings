No diagonal moves are allowed&lt;br/&gt;     Once a player has placed four disks around a whirl symbol,he is in possession of that symbol and a marker of the appropriate colour is place on top of the symbol. The disks surrounding the whirl cannot be move any longer. Once a player has made ​​a whirl, he may move an opponent's disk to a different field of his choice.&lt;br/&gt;    Once (or twice, if agreed by the players at the beginning), during the entire playing time, each player can jump over other pieces moving one disk as a chess knight does.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The winner is the player that is able to conquer first three whirl symbols.
