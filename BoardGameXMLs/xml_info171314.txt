							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Golf: A game of Mathing through Hazards</name>
									
			<description>Golf is a simple fast paced card game for 2-7 people in which players take turns solving problems using the four basic arithmetic operators; addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golf is designed to be versatile to fit your play group, with simultaneous or sequential play which will help to keep even the most easily distracted player from becoming distracted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game has some great educational potential, and is a fantastic game for the in-between times during your board game night.  Much like many other filler games in this time range (~30min), the joy is in the exercise and this exercise keeps the downtime low and your mind always active.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
