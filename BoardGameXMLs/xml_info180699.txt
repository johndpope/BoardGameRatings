			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow these seven strangers as they come together for a singular purpose. But, is there something sinister going on behind all of this? What is to become of these masterless warriors? What does it all have to do with these powerful artifacts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And, who is (or, who are) the mysterious benefactor(s)??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KORI NO FUKUSHU!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abandoned as a child, left for dead, stolen away and threatened with slavery, the Icy Vengeance is borne out of struggle. However, this cold maiden chooses to use her abilities to protect her home, her community, and the inhabitants therein. Is there something more to this heroine than meets the eye? How did she get her powers? What will she do with them next? Time, and your adventures, will tell...!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
