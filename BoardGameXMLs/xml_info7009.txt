			<description>&amp;quot;[A] tactical level game, simulating the constant struggle between the forces of the Raj and their various opponents, e.g. Afghan native irregulars and regulars and the fierce Pathan Tribesmen, of the Northwest Frontier. The period depicted here is the mid 1870's through the early 1880's. The scenarios are primarily hypothetical occurrences that are representative of the actions that took place in this area during that time period.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A magazine game published in The Wargamer Magazine #34. Features 10 minute turns, 50 yard hexes, and units comprised of about 10 men. Errata appeared in The Wargamer #35 at page 49.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
