							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Kuala</name>
									
			<description>Kuala has the object of building a tower of five elements height and is played on a 49-cell board. Pieces initially are arranged as shown in the photo. If a piece is standing in front of an opposite man and the cell beyond is occupied by a friendly stone, it may jump on this friendly stone. A stone standing in front of a hostile piece and the cell immediately beyond being empty may capture the enemy piece like in Laska. A column sandwiched between two hostile pieces becomes immobile until one of the two stones is captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
