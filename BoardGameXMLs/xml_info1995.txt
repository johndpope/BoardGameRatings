			<description>&amp;quot;The Excuse-Filled Game When You're Late for Work&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navigate your pawn from home to work, choosing your mode of travel: walking, taxi, bus or train.  The winner is the first player to face the Boss in his office and have the required Good Excuses --as indicated by the Face the Boss card.  The players use the other cards to help themselves along or get each other in trouble.  A good time ensues.   ;-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Canadian bilingual edition has a reversible board (French on one side, English on the other).  Wooden pawns and dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
