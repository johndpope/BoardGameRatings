This Game Master&amp;rsquo;s guide will show you, step by step, how to take your vague-yet-promising ideas and how to sculpt them with precise and careful design decisions (enhanced, if you prefer, by random die rolls), allowing you to conceive an endless mega-dungeon in record time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best of all, the CASTLE OLDSKULL CLASSIC DUNGEON DESIGN GUIDE is also system-neutral.

Learn how to make the most of your ever-dwindling prep time, so that you can spend those saved hours gaming with your friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This old school Guide is filled to overflowing with more than 325 pages of design material and dungeon generation tables.  Highlights include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Hack and slash and beyond.  39 adventure scenarios, with 20 diabolical twists, totaling 780 great ideas for your next campaign.&lt;br/&gt;     A myriad of options.  Over 10,000 unusual benefactors (&amp;ldquo;quest givers&amp;rdquo;), unusual wilderness encounters your players will never forget, and extensive rumor and dungeon history generation systems.&lt;br/&gt;     Every endless labyrinth ever, under one cover.  Extensive details on realistic underworlds, hundreds of dungeon dressing ideas, over 10,000 room types, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;     The imagined made real.  A complete second book is included herein as a detailed example of dungeon design, featuring over 30 pages of specific examples.  The Goblin Head campaign environment supplement reveals exactly how a 13-level mega-dungeon can be conceived in a matter of hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
