							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Romantic Journey</name>
									
			<description>The goal of this game is to experience romanticism in board game form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The host of the game must invite his guest by sending out an invitation with the specific gaming date and time. At the start of the game, players must record their ideal romantic journey that they would receive from the other player should they win the game. Players move together in a 21 room mansion and earn privileges they can perform with their partner who has a right of refusal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rooms in Romantic Journey do not have furniture - they come alive as you fill them with your thoughts, hopes, dreams and desires.  There is only one movement piece because both players share all experiences in Romantic Journey; for instance, it wouldn't be very romantic if you were in the utility room and your partner was in the game room.  There are no losers in our house.  Everyone is a winner who travels through Romantic Journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
