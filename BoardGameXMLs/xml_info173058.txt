			<description>Invent fake endings to real Shakespeare quotes! Great fun for fans of the Bard and ignorant buffoons alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We invented Fakespeare one evening when we meant to play Dictionary but picked up a Shakespeare anthology instead.  The game evolved as the night went until we were crying with laughter.   We knew we were onto something great and decided to make it into a game that we could share with others - thus Fakespeare was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
