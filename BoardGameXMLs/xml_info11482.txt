			<description>Case Green: The War for Czechoslovakia, 1938, is a simulation of the war that might have resulted if Hitler has not won a political victory at Munich in 1938. This is a game of intermediate complexity in which the two players command forces of Germany and Czechoslovakia. The German player must conquer Czechoslovakia within a certain period of time. The Czech player must prevent this from happening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;What if Czechoslovakia has not succumbed to Anglo-French pressure at the conference table at Munich, and decided to call Germany's bluff over the Sudetenland on the battlefield? With the possible exception of Adolf Hitler, no one wanted war at the time, least of all the Czech people. But they were ready, willing and able to fight if the French and the British showed the slightest inclination to support them against the Fuhrer's ill-prepared Third Reich. The resulting war would have been a hard fought affair, especially if German fears of a second front to the West had materialized.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Published in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #152 - Jun 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Scale:&lt;br/&gt;Game Turn: 1-2 days&lt;br/&gt;Hex: 7.5 miles / 12 kilometers&lt;br/&gt;Units: Company to Battalion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Inventory:&lt;br/&gt;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; six color mapsheet&lt;br/&gt;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&lt;br/&gt;One 8-page Case Green booklet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solitaire Playability: High&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Level: Medium-Low&lt;br/&gt;Players: 2-3 or more&lt;br/&gt;Playing Time: 2-8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
