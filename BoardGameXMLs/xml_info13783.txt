							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Cootie Jitterbug</name>
									
			<description>This is a dexterity game for children that uses a large motorized Cootie with holes in its shell. This Cootie Jitterbug is placed on the floor and plastic Cootie balls are scattered around it. Everyone chooses a different colored Cootie catcher that matches 3 of the Cootie balls. When everyone is ready, the Cootie Jitterbug is turned on by pressing its tail and it begins to wiggle and jiggle around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick as they can, players use their Cootie collectors to &amp;quot;snap&amp;quot; up Cootie balls and then drop the balls into a hole on the Cootie Jitterbug's shell. Players must hurry since the Jitterbug will pop the balls back out almost as fast as they put them in. The first one to stop Cootie Jitterbug when all 3 matching Cootie balls are in wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
