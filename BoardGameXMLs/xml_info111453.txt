			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard RPGA Network tournament for a team of four to six 1st-level agents (though the serial&amp;rsquo;s challenges and XP rewards are tiered so that the serial can be played by up to six agents of levels 6, 11, or 16 as well).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Against a backdrop of industrial disputes, a group of violent criminals poses as terrorists in order to take over a nuclear power station. Their objective is solely to acquire money, but they feel that they have a better chance of success if they issue &amp;lsquo;typical&amp;rsquo; terrorist demands as well (e.g. political concessions, release of prisoners, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their spokesman is a Pakistani named Idnan Sabir, a thug with no known terrorist connections. He is not the group&amp;rsquo;s leader (although he thinks he ought to be); their leader is a German named Hans Zimmerman. The rest of the rag-tag group is comprised of lowlives from around the world, none of them particularly pleasant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
