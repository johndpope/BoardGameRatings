							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Open Field Battle</name>
									
			<description>Open Field Battle is a simple wargame portraying generic 17th-century combat; no specific battle is represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player has a force of pikemen, cavalry, musketeers, and cannons. Each turn a player gets a random number of command points to spend on musketeers and cannons firing and on pikemen and cavalry moving and assaulting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is deterministic; the result depends on the formation the defender is in and the status of the defender and any neighboring units. E.g., a lone defender or one at the end of a line is disrupted (or eliminated if already disrupted), but one with two undisrupted neighbors merely retreats. The neighboring units may suffer effects as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional rules allow for different ways of using the command points and the possibility of saving them from turn to turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
