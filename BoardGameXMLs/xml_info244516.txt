							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Mountebank</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mountebank is a sub-class of the thief, an inveterate con-man and huckster, relying more on his skills of misdirection and confusion than on physical pilfering, but not entirely unskilled in many of the more traditional thiefly arts as well. Mountebanks also have a small amount of knowledge of magic, which they use to aid in their confidence games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you need a stand-alone mountebank class for your Old School game? Are you playing a mountebank and want a quick reference book for the table without having to flip through the entire Players Manual? Curious about Adventures Dark and Deep and want to take a look without diving in all the way? Here's your chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mountebank is a complete player class suitable for use with any old-school game. It's an extract from the Adventures Dark and Deep Players Manual, and contains the full class description plus all the spells available to the mountebank class (including a ton of new spells unique to the class).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you already own the Adventures Dark and Deep Players Manual, you don't technically need this pdf. But it can be pretty handy to have a quick reference guide that gives all the essentials in one place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
