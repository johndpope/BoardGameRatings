							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Box Hex</name>
									
			<description>Box Hex is a Hex variant which is played on a three dimensional surface.  The shortest paths of connection travel around the outside of the board - not through the center.  There are four such paths: two for each player.  This solves the strong first move advantage problem of regular Hex, in which there is only one shortest connection path, said path being shared by both players.  There is no need for the pie rule in Box Hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Box Hex, as in regular Hex, one connection must exist in a filled board, and opposing connections cannot exist simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
