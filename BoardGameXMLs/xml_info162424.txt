			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where Are They Now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third volume of Extreme Edge Magazine featured twelve women of strength and beauty.  They posed for cheesecake shots and told us all a little bit about their accomplishments, everything from working as a fortune teller/knife thrower to hunting zombies, vampires, and aliens.  That took place in the world of Hot Chicks in the year 2017.  With the default setting for Near-Modern campaigns in the Victory System taking place in 2025, nine years have passed.  Where are the third volume's Page Five Girls now?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here we have updated all twelve of the third volume's featured models, presenting them in full four-page character sheet format and converted to the Victory System.  Their character histories have been updated as well, letting the world know how their hopes and dreams have worked out in three years of intense game time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring the models from&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 1&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 2&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 3&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 4&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 5&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 6&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 7&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 8&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 9&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 10&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 11&lt;br/&gt;     Extreme Edge Volume 3, Issue 12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time marches on, things change, and people grow.  How has your favorite Page Five Girl faired?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(BONUS:  Includes conversions of the Pryokinesis Psionic Discipline from Hot Chicks: The Roleplaying Game, and a brand new Power!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
