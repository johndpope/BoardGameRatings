			<description>455 CARDS OF &amp;ldquo;SNOT-OUT-OF-YOUR-NOSE&amp;rdquo; LAUGHTER!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not Parent Approved is a kid-friendly word game of fill-in-the-blanks inspired by Cards Against Humanity. This game was created to provide an attention-grabbing, easy-to learn and hilarious alternative to screen time for children and their families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A brilliant screen zombie antidote that&amp;rsquo;s effortless fun at a kids slumber party or Thanksgiving Dinner with Grandma. Bring back the joy of face-to-face engagement and see your kid&amp;rsquo;s eyeballs again. What a concept!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Gameplay is simple - It&amp;rsquo;s Mad Libs gone Bad Libs! Each round, one player picks and reads a question card and everyone else answers with the funniest answer card.&lt;br/&gt;     Not Parent Approved gives kids a feeling of being naughty and cool but within (most) parental boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;     Not Parent Approved makes it okay to put vampire bunnies,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;fart, and Grandma in the same sentence!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
