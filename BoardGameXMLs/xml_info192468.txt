							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Super Secret Spy Agency</name>
									
			<description>(publisher blurb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Game of spies and espionage heavily influenced by films like Mission Impossible and Kingsman. The players are spies working for a self financed, independent spy agency. The characters will have access to special equipment and gadgets that would only ever exist in a spy movie or evil genius lab. With dozens of skills like Offensive Driving and Jump from a tall building and combat skills like Catch and Shoot or Clear a room, the Super Secret Spy Agency lets players live out their James Bond fantasies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game works on a percentile system will point pool and is a full Rpg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was the first RPG ever written by Feralgames, far from perfect but fully playable we invite GM's and Players alike to create what you will from this rule system and have fun with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
