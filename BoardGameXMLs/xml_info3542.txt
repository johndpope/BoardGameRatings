							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">XIII: Le Complot</name>
									
			<description>(from Tilsit's page: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.tilsit.fr/fiches_jeux/xiii.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.tilsit.fr/fiches_jeux/xiii.php&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vance and Van Hamme have created a very successful graphic novel series entitled &amp;quot;XIII&amp;quot; --it currently boasts 20 albums (along with 5 albums in it's spin-off series: XIII mystery).  In Tilsit's game XIII : Le Complot based on that police/thriller world, you play each of the 27 key characters in turn.  Your goal is to surmount all obstacles (traps, ambushes, plots) thrown in your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The board shows 33 of the albums' key locations; by traveling to each, you assemble a team able to complete a maximum of missions.  Each completed mission awards you investigation points which are necessary for victory.  Of course, there aren't enough missions for every player to win...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combat encounters will be bloody, and the combined strength of your agents and characters won't be enough --you'll also need to plan your moves and play your cards right...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;XIII is an amnesiac whose identity is hotly debated throughout the series.  Various agencies (such as the NSA) have tentatively identified him as various notorious hit men / terrorists / secret agents --but XIII isn't an easy man to catch!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
