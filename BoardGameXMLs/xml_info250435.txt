							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">War, or American Generals and their Battles</name>
									
			<description>This set-collection card game features American generals from the Revolutionary, 1812, Mexican and Civil wars, each with cards representing three of their battles with dates and a short description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is unusual in that it has a deck of 60 cards: one set of three (George Washington), 14 sets of four, and a single &amp;quot;Officer&amp;quot; card with the number 16. The rules say this card effectively may be used once, as a wild card, to complete any book. This book will normally count only for the same single point as any other book, but in the event of a tie, the book with the officer counts for 16 points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Games are played over multiple hands, with the winner being the once to get the most total points for completed books, so this card can make a huge difference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
