							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Holy Knight</name>
									
			<description>From the website&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Dark indeed are the nightmares of men, when the year grows old, the light spent, and the winds howl in the snow-capped mountains like an army of cursed men which could invade at any time. When the year is darkest, the hopes of men are at their brightest, shining like stars within their souls. Yet this also makes them the clearest targets for an evil thought to be a mere myth, the very Lord of the Night. His appearance signals the coming of an entire army of darkness, one which nobody has the earthly power to slay, save one as evil as himself, indeed a Knight whose soul he corrupted in days long lost in the darkness of myth and of legend. Can you find this fallen Knight and convince him to fight his own lord and master? Can your greatest foe become your greatest ally?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
