			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mercenary, executioner, murderer ... there isn't an infamous title that Wolfgang hasn't taken to heart. His great physical prowess isn't the only reason that he has become part Gaul's personal forces. The blood of the Naga runs through his veins, making him able to poison his enemies with just a touch of his skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dark Church Mystic &amp;mdash; Lv. 35&lt;br/&gt;At 4 | Dm 2 | Df 8 | Ar 0 | LP 12 | Re 11 | Mo 8/12 | AP 3/4&lt;br/&gt;Summoner Level: 1&lt;br/&gt;Affinity: Light, Dark&lt;br/&gt;oo &amp;mdash; Dark Power (Magic, Effect)&lt;br/&gt; A unit within Damaris' Control Zone gets +2 Attack until the end of the turn and Doom Lv. 1. Effect 16 (only if used on enemy). Limit: Once per turn.&lt;br/&gt;oo &amp;mdash; Spirit Link (Magic, Effect, Reactive)&lt;br/&gt; When a friendly unit within Damaris' Control Zone is destroyed, you may use this ability to have them remain in play until the end of the turn instead of being removed immediately. The destroyed unit gets Intangible and can't be damaged in anyway or removed from the game until the end of the turn.&lt;br/&gt;o &amp;mdash; Life Link (Magic, Effect, Reactive)&lt;br/&gt; When a friendly unit within Damaris' Control Zone is destroyed, another friendly unit, also in Damaris' Control Zone, recovers 1 LP for every 5 levels of the destroyed character.&lt;br/&gt;o &amp;mdash; Death Link (Magic, Effect, Reactive)&lt;br/&gt; When a friendly unit within Damaris' Control Zone is destroyed, all enemy units within Damaris' Control Zone each take 5 damage. Effect 15.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
