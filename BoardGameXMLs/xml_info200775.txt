			<description>Dungeon Bebop is a game built around solo play (but can be played with up to 3 friends). A rogue-like dungeon crawl, in Dungeon Bebop you'll explore up to 15 dungeon rooms, avoid traps, fight monsters, and get loot. Your goal is to reach the 15th room where you will find the Amulet of Eleht and win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play:&lt;br/&gt;You start out with 15 Dungeon Room cards, face down, and one to four Hero Cards (your party). You encounter each room by flipping each Room card over. The room card itself describes the encounter - perhaps you need to avoid a trap; perhaps you'll find unguarded loot; or perhaps you'll have to fight a monster!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monsters appear from a separate Monster deck. Combat is simple: roll a d20 (provided) -- if it meets or beats the target monster's Armor Class, then it's a hit. But beware, if you roll a 1-5, the Monster hits you instead. Combat resolution is handled by a single die roll -- Don't forget to loot the corpse!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the final room your find your prize, the Amulet of Eleht, and you win the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon Bebop contains 54 Room cards, 54 Monster cards, 36 Treasure cards, and 4 Hero Cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, you can play solo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
