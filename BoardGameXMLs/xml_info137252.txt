			<description>A game about Crows;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans are stupid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe there are a few of them who are clever in their own ways, but on the whole they don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the world of the spirits, they don&amp;rsquo;t know what happens to them after they die, they don&amp;rsquo;t even understand the damage they are doing to the world they live in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the other intelligent Animals wrote them off as a lost cause centuries ago, in a few more centuries they&amp;rsquo;ll wipe themselves out. Only a few of us still care about them; but the Dogs have become too close, forgetting their sacred protective duties, the Cats have always had agendas of their own, the Rats have lost their way and many of the wild Beasts are scared to walk into the great canyons of steel and glass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the few old races at home in the cities and the wild, we are still able to do what is necessary. We might not be able to restore the balance, but we can stop it getting too far out of control. By imparting wisdom to the living, and bringing back the dead, we can help the humans get things right. This is still their world, even if they are killing it, but through bringing back the dead ones willing to make a change, imparting wisdom to the ones willing to listen, and leaving the right hints for the inquisitive, we can channel the humans into making the changes that might just save us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
