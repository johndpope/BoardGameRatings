			<description>&amp;ldquo;Combat rules for plastic Army men.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Armies start at opposite ends of the room. Turn Sequence: Each figure gets to move once and attack once per turn. Mortars, machine guns &amp;amp; artillery can either move or attack during a turn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several different combat resolution mechanisms are included in the rules. The mechanism to be used depends on the nature of the attacking unit. For instance, a submachinegun attack is resolved as follows: &amp;ldquo;Standing 15 feet away from the target throw 3 marbles simultaneously.&amp;rdquo; On the other hand, for a flamethrower: &amp;ldquo;Stand over the attacker. Drop a tennis ball from the tip of your nose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, a six-sided die is rolled to determine what means is used to resolve hand-to-hand attacks between infantry units within two inches of each other. The die roll may call for these conflicts to be resolved by means such as arm wrestling, a staring contest, or rock-paper-scissors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Safety Rules&amp;rdquo; note that players should wear goggles at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
