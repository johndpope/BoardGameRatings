							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horizon Survey Craft</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stated mission of the developers was to create a 'light scientific and reconnaissance craft' and in this respect the Horizon proved perfectly suited, able to take a small crew anywhere within the solar system to take samples from asteroids, photograph possible colony landing sites, intercept comets and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With so many available it seemed only natural that the sensors aboard the Horizons would inevitably turned towards sensitive Earth Union installations and vehicles. In the same way that some Russian trawlers in the Cold War were actually spy ships, Horizons were renowned within the Union military for turning up when least expected, and when least wanted...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horizon Survey Craft details a TL 9 spacecraft powered by a fission reactor and a nuclear thermal rocket. It was designed using the rules in Zozer Games&amp;rsquo; setting book called Orbital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
