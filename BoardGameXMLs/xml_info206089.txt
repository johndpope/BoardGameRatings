			<description>The jungle camp will be placed in the middle of the table. Then a player distributes all the cards. Each player puts his cards face down in front of him on the table. In turn, the players each cover the top card of their cards stack. When revealing two cards with same two insects on the discard piles, each player tries to put his hand on the jungle camp as the first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first one gets two stars, the second one gets one star.&lt;br/&gt;If somone acts wrong, it costs one star.&lt;br/&gt;The game ends, when only one or less star is left.&lt;br/&gt;The winner is, who has the most stars.&lt;br/&gt;At the end, the loser rolls to see what penalty he gets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
