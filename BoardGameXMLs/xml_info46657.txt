			<description>Throwing Stones was released as both an RPG and a &amp;quot;board&amp;quot; game. The book was only essential for the RPG - each dice tube came with a sheet of paper detailing arena combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each character has four dice that define him. Four dice of the same type can be used, but that limits the player's abilities. The dice were collectible: there were quite a few different types made, some more powerful than others. All dice are six-sided and have special glyphs on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the glyphs include: Unarmed combat, various magic spells, knockdown, bypass armor, poison, luck (reroll some dice!), roll with the blow, strike again, counterstrike, disarm, berserk, centered, zealous, sword, stun, skill+, and many others. All are described in detail in the 96-page book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
