			<description>A depressing story game about humans who give up on their dreams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is about people giving up on their dreams, due to unseen forces trying to ruin their lives. Players will represent demons that hunger to take dreams away from humans. Each player can spend a round representing a human whose life the other demons are trying to ruin. The demons will take turns interfering with the human&amp;rsquo;s life, trying to convince the human to give up on a dream, while the other demons will offer terrible compromises to let the human cling to hope. The demons who convince the human to give up on a dream get to keep that dream. The demons continue grinding the human down until they have given up all their dreams, and the next player can create a human with their own dreams. At the end of the game, the demons compare who has devoured the most dreams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
