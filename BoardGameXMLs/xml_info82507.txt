			<description>Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ride with Custer and the famed 7th Cavalry or Crazy Horse and the Sioux-Cheyenne Warriors at the Battle of the Little Bighorn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was hot that day. With the temperature hovering near 100 degrees, the thin blue line of cavalry troopers moved in a northwesterly direction. Just off a forced night march, they were weary, but the sense of  imminent battle ignited a combination of fear and excitement that so often accompanies men into combat. They were confident. Led by the golden haired &amp;quot;Boy General&amp;quot;, the man who never sounded a retreat, their victory was certain. With the sun past noon, the Seventh Cavalry and George Armstrong Custer moved forward to their appointment with glory...and death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scale&lt;br/&gt;-Platoon level&lt;br/&gt;-100 yrds per hex&lt;br/&gt;-5 minutes per turn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variants&lt;br/&gt;-Custer divides the 7th&lt;br/&gt;-The 7th United&lt;br/&gt;-The 2nd Rides with the 7th&lt;br/&gt;-Roll out the Gatlin' Guns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play&lt;br/&gt;-Quick turn based, PBEM Capable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System&lt;br/&gt;-Win 95/98/00/Me&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
