							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Village of Osmolt</name>
									
			<description>Designer's Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequel to Denizon's Folly is finally here.  The Village of Osmolt takes the party into a small section of the fey realm that is being assaulted by an encroaching mist.  One day Blasfeemus Tower appeared and a red cap demanded sacrifices or he would summon the mists over the cliff and consume the forest.  Osmolt, the leader of the village, concocted the the way to lure people into his realm so he could offer them as a sacrifice instead of his own people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heartless bastard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this adventure there are random tables to create a time and space effect to keep the party guessing.  The fey are creatures that don't abide by laws within the 4-dimensional world.  Also a table to determine the fickleness of the fey the party encounters.  It will be none too easy to save the children.  But saved they must.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But like all Grimm Fairy Tales, they never end happily ever after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Micro Adventure, published by Tim Shorts on his Patreon page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
