Millions of years of evolution have led to this: colored globs bobbing above and below the ocean, attempting to develop into a higher form of life. Your job: Match the globs to create new creatures and then save them before a hungry fish swallows them whole! As you play, you'll marvel at the eye-popping physics, which link together globs in real-time and reward you for planning your moves in advance. Just watch out for the soap bubbles, which will soar off with your globs, and use the power-ups wisely. Can you beat every level to become the king of the globs?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
