			<description>Promotional game published by an Australian company in the oil and petrol business called Golden Fleece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An old-fashioned race game. Roll the die, move along the track (which is around 100 spaces long). The track weaves around a back design of Australia so you get to visit cities and learn a little about Australian geography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional rules apply. Obey instructions when you land on them, you can't start until you throw a 6, and you need the exact number to cross the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
