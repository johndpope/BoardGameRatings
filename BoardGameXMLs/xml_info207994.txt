							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Reformanda</name>
									
			<description>Reformanda is a collaborative, educational and fun card game for 2-6 players. The players, as pirates, will hone their discernment skills and strategically collaborate, countering heresy with Scripture, using their abilities, weapons, loot and spiritual gifts to rescue those who have been infected with heresies. Let no man deceive you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Players win if at the end of the last Round at least 1 Pirate and 1 Church are standing.  Each round has 3 Phases: Heresy, Dogma and Reckoning Phases.  During the heresy phase, churches lean heretical(you flip over cards with symbols on the bottom and must play cards with matching symbols to discard the flipped over cards); during the dogma phase, the pirates battle the heresies(you play cards and draw back up); during the reckoning phases, any church or pirate containing three heresies becomes heretical.  There are 12 rounds in total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
