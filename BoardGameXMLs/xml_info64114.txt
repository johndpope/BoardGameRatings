			<description>The aim of the game is to test your knowledge on how well you know your friends through a series of questions. The first player to get their token around the board wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You move around the board by correctly guessing who gave which answers to questions based on the four topics Friendship, Romance, Scandal, and True Colours. There is no right answer. Just correctly predict what others have answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like the TV show, you can nominate other players to be evicted. Votes are made in secret and then tallied when the last player passes the eviction point (about half way around the board). The player with the most votes goes back to the beginning. The first player to reach the &amp;quot;Win&amp;quot; spot wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
