							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Operation: Rendezvous Oasis</name>
									
			<description>From the back cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United State Army and Central Intelligence Agency have lost two microdrones on Middle East surveillance missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recovery missions have not found any evidence of microdrone malfunction or disintegration. Internal device tracking shows each microdrone was successfully launched and on its way to its target when it ceased to follow remote control directions. Each moved laterally from the line of flight and to the proximity of Ahmed Pursun El-Karriah. Moment later the tracking systems stopped functioning and camera functions went blank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El-Karriah is a known non-lethal arms and military surplus equipment dealer. Sources have learned he will be attending the annual rendezvous for battlefield scavengers. This year the rendezvous will be held at an oasis located where the borders of Chad, Libya, and Sudan meet. The remote oasis is far from known ground and aerial routes and satellite imagery shows little except irrigated date palms surrounded by a Sand Ridge. It is believed that if El-Karriah has the microdrones, he will sell them to the highest bidders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to attend the rendezvous and retrieve the two microdrones. If possible, find out how the microdrones are being intercepted and by whom. As always, should you or any of your Top Secret force be caught or killed, the Administrator will disavow any knowledge of your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User comment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario originally published in Gygax magazine, issue #4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
