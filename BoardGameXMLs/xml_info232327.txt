							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panther</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cat Burglar!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cordelia was born to a single mom - a successful thief. She learned to be an even better thief and grifter than her own mother. Donning a specially-designed costume, Cordilia struck out on her own as Panther (PL 9) after highschool. She made a vow to only steal from those who could afford to lose what she took... or other criminals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a stint in jail, Cordelia signed up with White Hats, Inc., putting her knowledge of how to break into buildings to her benefit as a &amp;ldquo;security consultant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes you a need a character everyone knows, even if they're meeting them for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
