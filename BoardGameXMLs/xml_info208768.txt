							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pressman Action Baseball</name>
									
			<description>This is an action-dexterity version of baseball, with a pressed-metal field mounted inside a wooden frame. The infield and foul territory are at a higher level than the outfield. There are two foul-out holes in the higher level, and 38 holes across the lower outfield, of which 13 are outs, 1 is a double play, 12 are singles, 8 are doubles, 3 are triples, and 1 is a home run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a thin springy metal loop near 2nd base that the pitching player uses to send the ball toward home plate. There is a spring-loaded 4&amp;quot; wooden bat that the batting player holds back and releases to strike the ball. There is a small bell behind home plate labeled &amp;quot;Automatic Umpire&amp;quot;: if the batter does not swing, a pitch hitting the bell is a strike, while one missing it is a ball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the game is undated, the box is labeled &amp;quot;A Lynn Pressman Original&amp;quot;, suggesting that it was published after her husband Jack Pressman's death in 1959.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
