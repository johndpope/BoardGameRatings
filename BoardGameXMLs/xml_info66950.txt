			<description>This game is played with a standard deck of cards. It is a 3-player version of Bugami. Nines, eights and sevens are removed to use as bid cards, and each player is dealt 13 cards, and also gets a bid card of each suit. They choose a bid card simultaneously and reveal it. That suit will be their bug suit. &lt;br/&gt;You also have the possibility to choose the (currently unknown) suit of the undealt card, for double points, or to announce that you will not take any card of your bug suit, also for double points, but if you cannot make it, you score nothing.&lt;br/&gt;Then tricks are played (they are taken by the highest card of the suit led).&lt;br/&gt;You each count 10 points for each trick you won, and divide this total by the number of bugs they contain, ignoring fractions. If there are no bugs, each trick counts double instead.&lt;br/&gt;The first player to reach 500 points (after several deals), is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Re-implements: Bugami&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
