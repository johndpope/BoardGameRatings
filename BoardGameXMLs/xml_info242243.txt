							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Aliens &amp; Asteroids Quickstart</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aliens &amp;amp; Asteroids is a tabletop roleplaying game with a streamlined mechanic, fast character creation, and easy ways to ratchet up the dramatic tension of every encounter. The rules are focused on allowing you to tell exciting stories around alien encounters, abductions, combats, and horrors, inspired by science-fiction films like Aliens and Starship Troopers, computer games like X-COM: UFO Defense, and television shows like Babylon-5 and The Expanse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aliens &amp;amp; Asteroids is written to evoke the terror of being on a spaceship in the middle of nowhere being stalked by creatures only wanting to survive and thrive. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re a tasty morsel. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re a warm body for hosting the next generation of horrors. But it&amp;rsquo;s definitely going to come down to you or them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setting is a future of hope, wonder, expansion, and profit as humankind stretches beyond the cramped borders of our solar system and branches out to other nearby star systems. The Dominion has but two goals: gather power and gather wealth. To that end, they employ billions of men, women, and robots across multiple star systems to do their bidding. And sometimes those minions get into trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where you come in as members of the Dominion Space Forces (DSF). The &amp;ldquo;suits&amp;rdquo; who run the Dominion call you soldiers but you know you&amp;rsquo;re really expendable space marines, sent out to protect their assets across the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are there aliens? Yes! We&amp;rsquo;ve come into contact with a number of alien species so far, including the Grey Men, the Skaali, and the Gollus. We are far from alone in the greater universe. Some want us for spare parts. Some just want us to leave them alone. But some almost certainly want us all dead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And out there, somewhere waiting in the void, is the Dread: an alien species determined to wipe out life where they find it. Unfortunately for us, the Dominion presents a tasty buffet of worlds to choose from these days and Earth would just be the icing on the cake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Quickstart offers the basics for creating characters, the rules for the Inverse20 system, and a quick scenario with some pre-generated characters for you to play with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
