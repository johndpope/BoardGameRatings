			<description>LegendMUD is a text-based virtual world, or MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) based on &amp;quot;the world the way they thought it was.&amp;quot; It's history with a twist: the game's world and its areas are based on real places on earth, but whatever the people of that age believed in is real on Legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This means that if you travel to ancient Ireland, when the natives believed that magical sidhe roamed the forests, you may stumble upon their enchanted kingdoms deep beneath the emerald canopies. Venture too far out to sea where the old sailors believed &amp;quot;Here There Be Dragons&amp;quot;, and you just may find yourself face to face with a sea serpent. The mythological adventures of Odysseus, the kami of Japan, the foggy, murderous streets of the 19th century Port of London, the infamy of the pirate Blackbeard...at Legend, they all await you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What's more, your own character may be imbued with the very abilities spoken of in those days: the magic of storied Arabia, the unrivaled swordsmanship of medieval knights, or the crack shooting of the American Wild West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three great eras of time are present in Legend: the Ancient, Medieval, and Industrial periods, each with a full complement of areas that you can walk through and explore, based on history, myth and famous literature, and inhabited by villians and monsters, heroes and ordinary folk. This is no ordinary mud, but rather one filled with adventures in a place both familiar and strange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LegendMUD opened officially on February 14, 1994, and has been operating continually since then. It was derived from DikuMUD, though it has been heavily modified over the years to the point where its codebase is now almost completely customized. As of Spring 2007, Legend has over 8,000 rooms making up over 60 areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of Legend's goals is to provide a flexible environment where all different types of MUDders can find the type of gameplay they want. Whether your taste is for hack 'n' slash, roleplay, playerkill, or some combination of all three, Legend has many tools and features to allow you to enjoy the game the way you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
