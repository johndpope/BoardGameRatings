							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FaeGlen Rulebook</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Tellus and the nation of FaeGlen, the last of the great kingdoms that once thrived under the loving eyes of the Gods. The gods gave us life and blessed us with skills and knowledge to make Tellus the perfect world, but jealousy and anger got in the way. The gods turned against one another and bonds were broken. The Elemental Wars caused a great sadness to wash over Tellus that birthed an enemy the likes of which no sentient being could imagine: The Darkness. This entity had no shape or form, but it just was. The Darkness took shelter deep within Tellus&amp;rsquo; core and lurked there, feeding off all of the negative energy it could consume, and it grew stronger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
