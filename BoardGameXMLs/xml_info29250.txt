							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mike Read&#039;s Pop Quiz Game</name>
									
			<description>Form a pop group, make a record and be the first to Number One in the charts by a combination of luck and answering Mike Read's Pop Quiz questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in two parts.  In the first part players roll the dice to move their 'guitarist' piece around the outer track and collect a pop group of six cards comprising: Lead Guitarist, Bass Guitarist, Keyboard Player, Drummer, Vocalist, and P.A.  In the second part players instead move their guitarist piece around the inner track and also move their 'record' piece up and down the charts.  The squares on the inner track either have the players answering pop music related questions (in the general form of &amp;quot;Name X bands/titles with this &amp;lt;word&amp;gt; in the title&amp;quot; or drawing a card and following the instructions.  A sand timer is used for the easy questions (30 seconds) and hard questions (60 seconds).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to have their record piece reach Number One in the charts wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
