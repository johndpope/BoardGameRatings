			<description>Enter the AI universe and fight evil artificial intelligences with a variety of weapons and modifications. AIPD is a top-down coop twin-stick shooter with a visual style that is an homage to 80s neon art styles, pioneered by games like Minestorm on the Vectrex console system or feature films like TRON, which are legendary to this day. Enjoy thousands of possible combinations of enemy and arena permutations that give you an unprecedented and nearly unlimited arcade experience. Enjoy the TRON-style retro graphics of AIPD using the power of Unreal Engine 4 to its limits, combined with a slamming soundtrack and overwhelming sound effects. Choose between weapons like the powerful howitzer, the devastating shotgun or the precise phaser for point attacks. In AIPD you can choose your favorite combination of game mechanic modules and fight action driven coop battles with up to four players on one screen. Enjoy the freedom to create your own experience and adjust the game to suit your needs and skill level. Show them who is the boss in the digital AI world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included Features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Thousands of possible combinations of enemy and arena permutations&lt;br/&gt;     Flexible playstyle thanks to customizable weaponry and modifications&lt;br/&gt;     Local coop mode with up to four players&lt;br/&gt;     Several online leaderboards for fierce competition&lt;br/&gt;     Timeless Neon-Art style powered by Unreal Engine 4&lt;br/&gt;     Smooth 60 fps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
