							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Orri&#039;s Storm</name>
									
			<description>This sister game to Senlac Hill covers King Harold's great victory over the Vikings in York at Stamford Bridge, before his great defeat by the Normans in southern England a little over a week later. Includes rules for Berserk Vikings and uses &amp;quot;untried units&amp;quot; in the Viking setup so that neither player knows their combat value until they fight. This represents the fact that Harold's forced march across England so surprised the Vikings that many of them had left their armor behind at their base. The title refers to Eystein Orri leading Viking reinforcements into the battle. One 11.5x16.5 inch game map, 140 counters that have to be mounted and cut-out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
