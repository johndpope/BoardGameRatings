			<description>Gear Jacket is a print-and-play combat-based game for two to four players.  Each player takes on the role of a Gear Jacket pilot and battle his or her opponents in a variable arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the not-too-distant future, a struggling television network gambled on the idea of a reality show about giant robots battling each other.  The concept was a huge hit.  Across the globe, young men and women dreamed of becoming Gear Jacket pilots and fighting for wealth and fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With Gear Jacket, you can take control of one of the famous Gear Jacket giant robots and take on one to three opponents!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are twelve arena cards, each with six spots on which a player can land.  Any number of these arena cards can be combined in any configuration to create the combat arena in which players will battle.  Terrain tokens can be added to further diversify the arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are twelve different Gear Jackets in the base game, with more planned for future expansions.  Players select the Gear Jacket of their choice.  Each player also takes five combat cards and a damage card.  Each combat card represents a different section of the Gear Jacket--Head, Chest, Arms, etc.  Combat is based on predicting the opponent's moves.  The attacker selects two combat cards, while the defender chooses three.  These cards are simultaneously revealed.  Any cards revealed by the attacker that are not matched by the defender count as hits.  Hits in different sections cause different amounts of damage, and may have extra penalties for the defender, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also rules for game variants such as King of the Hill, Death Race 2000, and Tag that allow for further game diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
