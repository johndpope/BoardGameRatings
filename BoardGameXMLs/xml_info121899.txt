			<description>Each player has a set of pieces consisting of different numbers of assembled cubes (resulting in different shapes). Beginning with a random start player, they take turns placing a piece on the base board. The following rules apply: &lt;br/&gt;- A player maynot play the same piece as the other player immediately afterwards&lt;br/&gt;- The piece may not touch the last piece played by the other player&lt;br/&gt;- The piece may not have any parts hanging in the air, reaching over the edge of the board or reach a height of more than 5 cubes.&lt;br/&gt;When a player has managed to get rid of all his/her pieces (or neither player can legally play another piece), the game ends, and the player(s) who still hold pieces count the number of cubes they have left. This is the negative score. After two plays, the player with the lowest overall negative score is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
