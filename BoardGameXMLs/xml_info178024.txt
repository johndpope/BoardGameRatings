It was intended as the first installment of a planned trilogy of Insane video games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insane was first announced at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards on 11 December 2010 by del Toro and Volition, in the form of a thirty-second teaser trailer. Del Toro said of the game, &amp;quot;With this new series of video games, I want to take players to a place they have never seen before, where every single action makes them question their own senses of morality and reality.&amp;quot; THQ announced the cancellation of Insane on 6 August 2012, with the intellectual property rights transferring to del Toro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Insane (2013 video game)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
