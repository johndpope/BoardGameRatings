			<description>Scrollhammer is an &amp;quot;open source&amp;quot; published set of miniatures rules that derives many concepts from Warhammer Fantasy Wargames while using a setting derived from the Elder Scrolls media franchise.  The game was developed on a public forum and accepted input from users through two major revisions until a final publication date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play uses many methods common to traditional wargaming.  Movement and distances are presented in &amp;quot;inches&amp;quot; and determined with the use of a tape measure.  Modified six-sided dice rolls are used to determine many outcomes.  Various arena tokens are used to denote alterations to the battlefield that occur during play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player controls the units of an opposing force.  Forces are built using a points pool.  As these calculations can become rapidly tedious, numerous armies and forces are provided by a variety of forum users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each unit in each force is represented by a model that is placed on the play surface.  Models have a paper record that tracks various statistics and play values such as speed, armor, ammunition, and so forth.  Units may make attacks on opposing units as long as they have the range, remaining ammunition or power, and line of sight.  Successful attacks deal damage that may destroy, disable, or partially disable targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play proceeds in alternating player turns, each half-turn being sub-divided into movement, fire, and assault phases.  Victory conditions are set before the scenario begins and typically involve force destruction or &amp;quot;capture the flag&amp;quot; goals.  Rules disputes are resolved by a simple die throw.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;user summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
