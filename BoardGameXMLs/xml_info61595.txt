			<description>&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Ya Must Be Cheatin'!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The young Cowpoke had just lost a week's wages, and anger had gotten the better of his good sense. &amp;quot;I said yer a cheat; and I guess if ya won't step outside ta prove me wrong; yer yeller too.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The Gambler slid his chair from the table and stood slowly. Wearing his best poker-face, he walked toward the door. &amp;quot;I'll be waitin' for ya in the street.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;The Cowpoke, beginning to doubt himself, looked around the bar room for support. Finding none, he screwed up his courage and stepped outside.&lt;br/&gt;The Gambler was waiting, ready. The Cowpoke went for his gun first; but before it cleared the holster, he had the Gambler's bullet in his heart.&lt;br/&gt;The Gambler stepped over the body, back into the saloon, and back to his place at the card table. Still poker-faced, he began shuffling. &amp;quot;Now that the kid's gone, we can do some serious gambling...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With DESPERADOS, you could have played that fight in about the time it took to read it. Easy percentile based rules, a hit location system that works, and a character sheet that's the only reference players need for combat, give DESPERADOS ihe spirit and pacing of a classic Western movie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinch up yer gun belt, saddle up yer horse, grab a character sheet and some dice, and come with us now to a thrilling game of yesteryear; to a world where justice comes from the end of a six-shooter; to the game of DESPERADOS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
