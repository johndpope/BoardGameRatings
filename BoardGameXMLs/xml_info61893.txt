			<description>From the publishers website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is a head-on crash into a world on the verge of collapse. Players take the roles of survivors fighting to save everything they have ever loved or villains hell-bent on bringing the Earth to its knees. There are no dice, there are no cards. Each character has a reserve of points they can allocate to the tasks they want to undertake but they better spend them wisely because when a volcano erupts in the middle of their neighborhood, they&amp;rsquo;re going to need all the points they can get just to escape with their lives. It&amp;rsquo;s short and sweet and was created in under 10 hours by an elementary school kid with passion for catastrophes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
