			<description>From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;This is a party game... not a board game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to sit around a table in uncomfortable chairs so you can just sit back and relax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You never have to answer uncomfortable questions so you won't end up in divorce court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to know tons of trivia or how to spell or how to draw or how to act or how to do anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You never have to roll dice, move markers, count change, or jam annoying little plastic pieces together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You simply need to hang out and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Want to show your friends how well you know them? Take out the PersonaliTease party game and have everyone guessing who answered questions like What do you enjoy doing, even though you know it's wrong? One player&amp;mdash;the emcee&amp;mdash;collects personality answers from the group, reads them out loud once or twice, and waits for everyone to guess which answer belongs to which player. There's plenty of bluffing and second-guessing involved here, and (fortunately) little opportunity for hard feelings to develop, as can sometime be the case with other games of this kind. The game can go as quickly as you like, or linger for a long evening of discovery if you want to really explore the mysteries of your friends' minds. What kind of vegetable does the person on your left remind you of? Wild personalities questions... with even wilder answers!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
