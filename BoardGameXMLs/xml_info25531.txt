			<description>The game equipment for Spics consists of 36 pegs, 6 each of 6 colors, and a circular board with 36 holes arranged in 3 concentric rings.  The holes are marked with the same 6 colors as the pegs, and are arranged so that no two holes of the same color are adjacent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 2-player game, one player places 3-12 pegs in holes of matching colors, and the other player attempts to place the remaining pegs correctly from the back of the board - the holes go all the way through, and are not marked on the back.  Points are lost for every incorrectly-placed peg.  The players then switch sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1-player game the player creates his or her own puzzle by placing pegs while trying not to pay attention to the other holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
