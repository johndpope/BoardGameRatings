			<description>&amp;quot;Iconwar&amp;quot; is a card game originally designed as a team-building exercise for tech companies in Silicon Valley.  When the game begins, each player is trying to win on their own.  However, you will soon discover ingenious ways to trade, negotiate, and win as a team. Question: will your group learn how to cooperate, or descend into chaos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
