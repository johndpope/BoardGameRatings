			<description>Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou (大爆笑!!人生劇場?, &amp;quot;Large Bursts of Laughter Theater Life&amp;quot;) is a life simulation game for the Super Famicom. The player starts in infancy and must progress through the school years, and to a rewarding career. The final stage is senior citizenship where the goal is to retire as wealthy and as skilled as possible. Steps with hearts on them increase the player's statistics while steps with sad faces decrease the player's statistics. Up to four players can play and the game has anime-style graphics. Toys can be purchased at a handsome sum that knocks a player back six squares, makes an opponent's wheel spin slower or faster, creates lightning, among other things. Lightning caused the victimized player to lose a turn and one of the major differences between this game and other games based on Jinsei Game is that the individual &amp;quot;boards&amp;quot; function more as a race than an actual simulation of life. The player who gets to the goal square first in the game gets a generous amount of money and all players advance to the next level regardless of how well they developed their characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Bakushou!!
