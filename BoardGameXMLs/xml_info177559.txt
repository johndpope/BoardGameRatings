			<description>&amp;ldquo;It is both the duty and the tradition of the Royal Navy to engage the enemy wherever there is water to float a ship&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A &amp;ldquo;fast play&amp;rdquo; game covering primarily the naval engagements on Lake Tanganyika during the First World War, and also any number of real and hypothetical small craft actions during the period 1910-1920. Written with 1/600 scale models in mind, their inspiration being the models designed by North Head Miniatures of New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as the tactical rules, a set of mini campaign rules is included. Actions fought using the tactical rules tend to be short and sharp, and so the campaign is easily playable in a few evenings, or as a club project for a day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
