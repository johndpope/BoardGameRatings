			<description>The aim of the game is to place company cards as quickly as possible on the board. The board is a map of Brussels. Each square on the map has a different value. The square where to build the companies is chosen by moving two counters by two dice. One dice result is moved vertical the other one horizontal. Whenever the two counters match the same square, one company card can be placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A soon as one player has completed his set of companies on the board the game is over and each player adds up the value of his sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
