			<description>From the box:&lt;br/&gt;The world has never been smaller.  Never before have the people and nations of the world been drawn closer together.  Modern technology, transportation, communications, economics and politics - all have played a part in the creation of our Global Village.&lt;br/&gt;The four map-related games in this series have been designed to interest students in their world.  Students start by learning the geography of a small community,  then move on to explore the United States, the Western Hemisphere, and ultimately the world.  Along the way, students practice a battery of skills useful for the understanding of any map.  In addition, the challenging, action-oriented games will convince students that exploring their world is more than a necessity, it can be a pleasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Objectives:  Students become familiar with the basics of directionality, distance and scale, geographical detail and problem solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Exploring Your World&amp;quot; Geography Games set consists of four (4) games created to provide meaningful and interesting experiences for students in the instruction and application of geography and map reading skills.  The four games, and the instructional objectives of each are:&lt;br/&gt;City Limits - Directionality, distance and scale, land formation, transportation modes, and problem solving.&lt;br/&gt;States Race - Position and shape of the 48 continental United States, capital cities, time zones, geographical and cultural landmarks.&lt;br/&gt;Hemisphere Hunt - Principles of latitude, longitude, political divisions, national capitals and natural resources as they relate to the Western Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;World Wiz - World time zones, latitude and longitude, continents, the International Date Line, the Greenwich Prime Meridian, topographical and meteorological world conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
