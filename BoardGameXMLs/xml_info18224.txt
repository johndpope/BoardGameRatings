			<description>Based on the long-running (1951-56) game show aired on all four networks, in this variation of Hangman the host gives the players a cryptic clue to the phrase in question, such as &amp;quot;Sung by someone with no burning ambition.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first round the players, in turn, ask a yes-or-no question about the phrase. The players then guess letters, with a wrong letter removing that player from the game (hence, &amp;quot;Down You Go&amp;quot;). The first to guess the phrase (in this case, &amp;quot;I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire&amp;quot;) is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with about 100 puzzles, all previously used on the show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
