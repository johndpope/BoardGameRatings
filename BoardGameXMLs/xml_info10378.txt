			<description>A Brazilian adaptation of Tryce, a game by 3M.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This card game is played in seven dealings, divided in three phases. To win a dealing a player has to use all his cards to complete a number (ever increasing) of three types of matches: groups (three or more cards of the same number or color), sequences (four or more number-ordered cards of the same color) or words (four or more cards forming a word). The 4th and the last dealings are called &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot;: only words can be formed (no groups or sequences), and the winner must get rid of his last card without discarding it. After each dealing points are awarded based on the matches made (cards with &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; letters give are worth more).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a fun game for families or groups of friends who enjoy word games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the box:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRAPHOS is an  intriguing  game that combines letters, colors and numbers. With a little luck and a lot of thought, players seek to build groups, sequences and words that are required for each dealing. &lt;br/&gt;Gradually, dealings become more defiant, requiring increasing mental agility for envisioning that combination.&lt;br/&gt;Evah nuf, that is, have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
