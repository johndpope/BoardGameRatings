			<description>Kult Heretic Kingdoms is an isometric computer RPG, combining 3D technologies with the intuitive environment of an isometric game. Developed by Slovakian studio 3D People, the game is built on cutting edge technology with a philosophy that balances ease of learning against depth of play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring an engaging storyline written by a script team lead by critically acclaimed game writer and designer Chris Bateman (Discworld Noir, Ghost Master) , and uniquely immersive game mechanics designed by Chris&amp;rsquo; infamous International Hobo team, the game is certain to appeal to fans of RPGs and fantasy adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the world of the Heretic Kingdoms, a world where God is dead and religion heresy, you are cast as a young female inquisitor, working to stamp out the last remnants of religion. On instructions to destroy a relic which the Inquisition considers to be a significant threat, you are drawn into a war between two warring secret societies &amp;ndash; a conspiracy of mages whose goal is true power, and a shadowy cult who seeks to resurrect the Dead God.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the story progresses, you will be placed in an amoral world and left to decide your own morality. Just like the real world, your actions have consequences, and it is up to you to decide if you can live with them or not. Play as an altruistic heroine, a vicious and selfish egotist or just a woman trying to get her job done &amp;ndash; your actions will lead you to one of six different endings depending on where you decide your loyalties lie. Will you crush religion underfoot, or become its saviour? Only you can decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Game Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
