			<description>The following rules are for the 1910 version of this game done by J.W. Spear. The game was published first in 1909 by McLoughlin Bros. Those rules are slightly different and are included at the end of the Spear rules for completeness purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A roll-and-move race game portraying the hazards faced by Artic explorers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The North Pole Game is to the child what a cinematography lecture by (polar explorer) Sir Ernest Shackleton is to a grown-up. During the game all incidents of a voyage of Polar exploration are met, e.g. sturdily built whaler caught in the ice pack, landing party building snow hut, engaging Eskimos for the journey, shooting Walrus and Seal, admiring the Aurora Borealis as it stretches across the sky. Here they are making a sledge dash for the pole, and at last planting the flag upon the untrod solitudes that surround the Axis of the Earth.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;McLoughlin Bros. rules&amp;quot;...4 different colored men and an indicator are used in order to get to the North Pole and then return. The indicator is spun resulting in a number from one to six (just like a die). Each player uses a route of his color in an attempt to reach the gold spot where the four paths intersect and then proceeds to the NORTH POLE spot and then returns back to the start. Any number of players can come home using the same route. If during that return a piece is jumped over with another's piece that jumped over piece must go back 3 spaces. If that spot is also occupied then another further spot must be retreated....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
