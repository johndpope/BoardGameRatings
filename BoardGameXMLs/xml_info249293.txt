			<description>Be whoever you want to be...without knowing who you are!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Get followers and socialize in this crazy offline social network for Alter Egos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is very simple. You have 200* characters on board, insane and hilarious, some of them explicit. The idea is that all of the players are part of a social network for Alter Egos, where everybody can be whoever they want to be. However, there is a catch - you don't know what your profile image looks like, so when you describe your Alter Ego story it will probably sound crazy and a lot more fun to all other players (because they can see your profile image).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When presenting your Alter Ego story be creative, present your &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; in the most fun way you can and tell everybody what kind of person you are looking for. Then all other players will choose a card from their hands and will suggest a match to your Alter Ego story. You will be the one to choose your friend, soulmate, drinking buddy, partner in crime or a date!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the game is to collect as much winning tokens as you can. The one with most tokens wins the game, because more people have liked his or her Alter Egos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wait! You can win the game instantly even in the first turn!&lt;br/&gt;Each card has a different colored symbol at the top left corner. Each card has a perfect match card with the same color symbol somewhere in the deck.&lt;br/&gt;When the cards are presented to the Alter Ego and he picks the winning card, if this card has a symbol matching the symbol of the Alter Ego's card, the owner of the selected card wins the game automatically. No matter which round of the game it is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*We have designed 180 characters, the other 20 will be suggested by our backers. We will choose the best ones and will include them in the game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
