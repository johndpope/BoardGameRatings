			<description>Back cover summary: Astra&amp;rsquo;s launch occurred without incident, but soon thereafter a problem in the astrogation program developed. Whether it was equipment failure or sabotage will never be known. For several hundred years the Astra drifted through space, off course. Assuming a rogue star to be the planned destination, the ship decelerated and prepared to orbit the star&amp;rsquo;s only planet.  Captain Kashmere and a skeleton bridge crew were the first awakened. Quickly they realized that something had gone very wrong...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brace yourself for action! Here are some of the adventures you&amp;rsquo;ll find in LOST TELEPATHS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Explore an ancient tomb that harbors a strange and powerful telepathic artifact.&lt;br/&gt;     Investigate the rumors of strange beings with supernatural powers. The Eugenicists had been utterly defeated by the Kashmere Lords ... or had they?&lt;br/&gt;     The warship Prometheus waits in orbital spacedock for completion and its shakedown mission. Other provinces -- perhaps even the Emperor -- would stop at nothing to possess it. Can you stop them?&lt;br/&gt;     &amp;quot;Just a simple gun run&amp;quot; the Leaguemaster told you. He forgot to mention the brutally efficient customs officials, and who knows what else the Telepaths might do to stop you....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
