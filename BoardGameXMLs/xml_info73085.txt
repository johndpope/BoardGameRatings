			<description>From the Publisher's Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several states reached a settlement with the Ford Motor Company in December 2002 to resolve allegations of deceptive trade practices relating to the sales and advertising of Ford Sport Utility Vehicles. The outcome of that settlement was a $27 million campaign dedicated to educating the public about the dangers of driving a SUV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESUVEE, the campaign mascot, was designed to evoke the sentiments one holds when they think of an actual sport utility vehicle: exciting, durable and powerful, with subtle characteristics. ESUVEE's prominence on the web and at SUV Safety Days reinforced the message, while providing an entertaining, accessible and non-threatening method of capturing and retaining the intended audience's attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial is undoubtedly targeted at younger males. Take a look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm hardly the target audience. But the campaign's lure was irresistible. The genius of the advertising is indisputable: I want to ride an Esuvee. Or at least, I want to pretend I do in a d20 role-playing game. Which is odd, since I think SUVs are the first sign of the Apocalypse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The esuvee monster listed here is compatible with most d20 systems. Who knows, you might learn something about the dangers of driving a SUV while you're at it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
