			<description>Dual Solo Adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the back of the book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.) Murder on the Latona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breathless and drenched, you cross the threshold of Galutha House. Your elf friend Jurl, supported by his wizard compatriot Churang, Molaton of Masatl, and the birdlike Giko, a khodaga from Hamon's Lair barely draw the attention of the seaport inn's jaded clientele. After a few ales and plates of fish stew you regain your strength and renew your efforts to find a ship to take you north. &amp;quot;Captain Redslate,&amp;quot; the bartender points to a surly dwarf in the corner, &amp;quot;He's the best.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Not rare enough!&amp;quot; Servants cringe as they place plate after plate of spring lamb in front of Redslate's blood-spackled beard. Beggars can't be choosers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability: 3rd to 5th level character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.) Hedrien's Elixir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emeralds worth 1850 in gold... 2000 if you fence them in Masatl. It's the easiest money you ever made,&amp;quot; the oily voice of the wizened dwarf wizard, Grappa, wheedles as he shuts a small wooden box containing the emblem of the house of Khatau. From behind him on a bed in the crude Crabbe Inn, Lord Hedrien emits a pained wheeze as he clutches a pendant engraved with an arcane symbol. Those gems could solve a lot of problems...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suitability: 1st level or newly-created character&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
