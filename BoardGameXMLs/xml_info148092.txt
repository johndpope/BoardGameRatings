							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">SciFi Bars</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SciFi Bars is a set of two full-color, 48 x 30 inch, floor plans of SciFi Bars, with Hex, Square and No overlay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Product includes the VTT files for online play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now includes a 360&amp;deg; View of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Masters need quality maps for their miniatures. DramaScape&amp;trade; is committed to bringing Game Masters the maps they need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sci-Fi Bar Module includes two different sci-fi bar maps. One of them is a seedy bar and dancing club and the other is a more classy establishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of them includes our new 360-degree view allowing you to see the room from a point of view in the middle of the room in 3d. Why describe the room, when you can show them the room!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sci-fi bar was created for sci-fi games in the near or far future. However, this could easily be used as a modern bar that has a sci-fi theme as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sci-fi bar can be placed anywhere you need it. The airlock style doors could lead outside to a planet&amp;rsquo;s surface or even a hangar on an asteroid or moon. The bar could also be located on a starship, star port, or space station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sci-fi bar could be used in many ways. It&amp;rsquo;s a great starting point for a sci-fi campaign for a new game, a seedy bar with dancers and drinks or a classy bar where the new players meet their first patron who has a job for them and offers some insight into what their patron is like. This could be a bar on a space station, star ship, or star port with a crooked owner where anything could be obtained for the right price, even if it would normally be illegal in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
