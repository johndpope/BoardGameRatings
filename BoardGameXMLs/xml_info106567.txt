							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come</name>
									
			<description>&lt;br/&gt;     Heroes - Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come offers five notable personalities to choose from, from the five great nations of medieval Europe, each of them with different background, wealth, fighting skills, goals and dreams. The gradual development of the focus character is familiar from the RPGs: he gains experience, ranks, gets stronger and more effective. The different skills and starting resources of the five main heroes require various tactics in the battles and offer numerous ways to the final victory.&lt;br/&gt;     Huge armies on huge battlefields - Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come offers highly varied terrains that evoke the atmosphere of the faraway lands where the crusaders marched towards Jerusalem &amp;ndash; from the Mediterranean pine forests to the barren rock deserts of the Holy Land. The topographic elements heavily influence the tactics and the outcome of the battles.&lt;br/&gt;     Management - The management screen offers various ways to manage the troops, deal with supporting characters, upgrade heroes, spend the acquired ducats or distribute weaponry among the troops and assemble the army for the next battle. The growing army of the hero gets stronger and deadlier after each battle. Soldiers gain experience and players buy skills for them as well.&lt;br/&gt;     Factions - The crusader army in the game is about just as divided as it had been historically. The various power groups of the army are called factions, each with a strong nation in charge and they all offer various submissions for their allies.&lt;br/&gt;     Faith and relics - In Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come Faith is an idealized concept of the religious background that sparked and legitimized the military campaign. Faith has strong impact on the overall morale. Christian relics have strong relations with the Faith score: the higher a hero&amp;rsquo;s Faith is, the more effective these relics boost their abilities.&lt;br/&gt;     Historical authenticity - Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come wants to be as faithful to the chosen historical era as it is possible in a computer game, which requires some restrictions and necessary modifications. With a colorful cast of supporting characters we present existing historical personalities from the era as antagonists, allies or vassals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Publisher Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
