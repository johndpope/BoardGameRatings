			<description>&amp;quot;The game where knowledge and strategy meet&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a trivia game with an unusual ladder format that requires each player to climb a twisting pathway in order to win. Players answer trivia questions (taken from a booklet) as they advance. Certain spaces on the ladder affect a player's movement options. The first player to reach the peak of the ladder and answer a final challenge is declared the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed for 2, 3, or 4 players age 8 and older. Includes board, pawns, booklet, storage insert, and a die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
