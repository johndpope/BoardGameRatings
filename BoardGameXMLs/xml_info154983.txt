			<description>Salto do Cavalo is a game for two played on a 5x5 grid of 25 squares.  Each player has a one piece in a different shape or color than the other player.  There are 23 neutral pieces that are also used.  Play begins with an empty board but for each player being stationed in an opposite corner of the board.  Players then take turns moving their piece like a Knight in Chess, and placing a neutral piece to mark where the player began their move.  Players may not move onto these neutral pieces.  The last player to make a move wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
