							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stormlands: Assault &amp; Capture</name>
									
			<description>Stormlands is a game of area control and combat with specifc set ups and objectives. Relive a historic battle in the ancient land Keldabore, as the Order of the Fire Plains try to reclaim an overthrown castle from the horrifc Dark Forest Cryptids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fast, two player game is played out across a standard chess board using Tokens, Dice and a Weather Table. There are multiple ways to win including holding locations and killing specific targets. The unique aspect to this game is the added element of weather, which can be used to blast players off the game board, thus drastically changing the layout of your opponent's defences in a single turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Game Components and Basic Gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included: 1 Game Board, 40 Tokens (16 Dark Forest Yetis, 16 Order of the Fire Plains, 4 Spawn Location Markers, 4 Objecive Markers), 1 Weather Table, 2 Dice. Suggested use of your own Chess Board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characers show a base strength rating of 1-5, that score is augmented by a single die roll which then determines outcomes when attacking and defending your position. Additionally, you each have a Leader and a Weather Master, both hold key powers towards the outcome of each battle. The Weather Table is placed next to the game board, the results from a die roll determine which row is affected and which direction the characers in that row are pushed by the weather. Choose a side, choose a scenario and be the first to accomplish one of your objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
