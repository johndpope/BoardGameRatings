							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Knight Court</name>
									
			<description>Knight Court is a tiny chess-like abstract. Each side has a knight, bishop, and rook on a 3x3 board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A captured bishop or rook is returned to its owner, who can re-introduce it onto any open space on a future turn. In contrast, a knight in jeopardy of capture is compelled to move, because checkmating an opponent's knight wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
