			<description>&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The people of modern Exodus fear and distrust psionic powers and those with it. The psion&amp;rsquo;s ability to read or even control minds without even the scant visible trappings of wizardry - the wilder&amp;rsquo;s unpredictable and spontaneous destructive powers - these mindspawned mysteries are the stuff of nightmares for common folk from the Wyldlands of Bal to the deserts of Cordel. Even the widely respected, psionics-using Janissaries of the Imperial Alliance have not been able to dispel such superstitious fears - perhaps because the superstitions are all too often justified. Eventually, the Imperial Alliance with the help of Imperial Senate created an organization to address those fears - and to bring to heel those mentalists who misused their gifts. Thus was born Section Omega - the Imperial Alliance&amp;rsquo;s regulatory and investigatory body for psionic affairs. This supplement includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     History of Section Omega&lt;br/&gt;     Section Omega&amp;rsquo;s Headquarters &amp;amp; Methods&lt;br/&gt;     Organization Effects of Section Omega&lt;br/&gt;     New Prestige Classes: Psychic Overseer and Id Hunter&lt;br/&gt;     New Magic and Psionic Items: Id Weapon, Psychic Annihilator, Psychic Halo, Psychic Restrains, Psychic Shocker&lt;br/&gt;     Nearly 30 New Psionic Feats including Cortical Resonance, Layered Psionic Defense, Psionic Deflection and Vampire Mind&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All this, Plus added on for free: Terrornomicon: Locari. The Locari are a young race, a race of killing machines whose origins are shrouded in mystery &amp;ndash; unlike the deadly danger they pose to all of Exodus, about which no rational being has the slightest doubt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
