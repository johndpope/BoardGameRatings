			<description>designer blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This playset is an accessory for the Fiasco role-playing game by Bully Pulpit Games. Fiasco is copyright &amp;copy; 2009 by Jason Morningstar. All rights are reserved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'Discreet Wetwork. Fast. Clean. No Children!'&lt;br/&gt;Death is always around us, but when is it an accident and when is it orchestrated? How do we know that the dictator of that Middle Eastern country died of a natural heart attack? The &amp;quot;murder for hire&amp;quot; business is a huge necessity and has been currently flooded with killers as of late. Now would be the best time to hang up the silenced sniper rifles and pick up the barbeque cooking utensils. But how does a person whose whole life has been about killing put away those impulses and join up with the regular Joe's of society? Who can you trust and how do you learn to trust? More importantly, how do you keep your past a secret?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movie Night&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by films such as Red (2010), A History of Violence, Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Smith, The Whole Nine Yards, Grosse Point Blank, True Lies, Smokin' Aces, Lucky Number Slevin, Horrible Bosses, and any other film that involves assassins, hitmen, mobsters, lies, spies, and people generally doing heinous acts of murder for money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
