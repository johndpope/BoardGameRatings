							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Pro Football Hall Of Fame Trivia Game</name>
									
			<description>This sports trivia game is designed for 2 players or 4 players... it also supports team play. Contestants move around the outer edge of the board answering football questions covering three historical periods: Early Years, Expansion, and Modern. After answering six questions correctly a player may enter the inner Hall Of Fame section of the board. A player wins the game by answering the Hall Of Fame question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plastic playing pieces represent an old-fashioned leather football helmet, an NFL football, a bronze trophy, and a replica of the Hall Of Fame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes a colorful board, 350 cards, 4 tokens, a single die, and the rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
