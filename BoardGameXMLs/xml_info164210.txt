			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dungeon World is filled with all manner of strange and horrible monsters: marauding orcs, moldering skeletons, shambling zombies, chimeric owlbears, sinister demons, towering giants, fire-breathing dragons, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like spiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, not your normal, run of the mill arachnid that can be easily dispatched with a shoe or broom. We&amp;rsquo;re talking the size of a dog, maybe even a man, capable of weaving webs stronger than steel, and a body capable of deflecting sword blows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why have you scuttled forth from the dark, foreboding forests? Why do you travel with these pale, soft creatures? Would it not be more satisfying to truss them up, and let them marinate with terror before slurping up their insides, leaving only dessicated husks?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, maybe. Time will tell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behold the amazing&amp;mdash;and terrifying&amp;mdash;spider!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do everything a spider can: spin webs of any size, crawl on walls, bind creatures in webbing so that you can more easily inject debilitating venom or digestive juices into them and slurp up their tasty, liquefied innards that you do so crave, because Dungeon World can be a cruel, horrible place sometimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first pdf is a digest-sized document that gives you everything you need to torment both monsters and your own party members (ie, the playbook), as well as the spider trickster compendium class (with guidelines on going with a trickster spirit archetype), guidelines on reskinning the spider as a drider, ettercap, or tsuchigomo, and an explanation of some of the moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second is the actual letter-sized character sheet, perfect for printing, playing, and keeping the rest of the party from making camp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
