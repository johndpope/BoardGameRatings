			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haven or Hotbed? Sometimes adventurers need a safe place where they can restock their supplies and ruminate on the next step of their campaign.

Full of beautiful details, including farm fields and a watchtower, this double-sided map makes the perfect setting for a refuge or a dangerous trap!
