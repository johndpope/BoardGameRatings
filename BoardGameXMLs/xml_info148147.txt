							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">HEX MAP: Canyons I</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land here is rocky an acrid. Surrounded by even higher mountains it still is of some importance though. Some of the very few mountain passes open all year long meet here where the rivers have cut their canyons into the countryside. The river that bisects the nearby mountains pools into a sizable lake here, just past the intersection of the roads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All around the rock rises high, forcing the engineers to come up with some interesting solutions for the course of their roads. One road leads south around the lake towards the lowlands, while another leads northwest along the mountain range. The third road leads east, after crossing a bridge across the lake, through the mountains along the valley the river cut into the rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This map is 14x17 hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
