			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are tracked on a character &amp;quot;sheet&amp;quot; which is about the size of a 3&amp;quot; x 5&amp;quot; card.  Characters have a &amp;quot;Player's Option&amp;quot; which is a Skill the character is good at (examples include &amp;quot;knowing how to pick a lock&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;being a better shot with a pistol&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;knowing how to fly a plane&amp;quot;).  Otherwise, characters only need track wounds, ammunition, and inventory.  Note the Player's Option can be determined prior to play or at any time during play - but once it is declared (&amp;quot;invested&amp;quot;, in game terms) it cannot be changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the game's central action involves combat (usually with zombies), the combat mechanics are simple.  The rules favor a cinematic, exciting pace to realism.  Players roll D6 and compare the result to an action table (which is easily memorized).  Generally, 4-6 indicates a hit.  Damage also is resolved with a D6 and action table (again, easily memorized).  It is suggested the game be played &amp;quot;tactically&amp;quot;, with a map and miniatures - the rules suppose a hex grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic HTML rules include various supporting pages such as a bestiary (Basic Zombie, Strong Zombie, Grabber Zombie, Runner Zombie, Creeper Zombie, Leaper Zombie, Screecher Zombie, Thrower Zombie, Lurker Zombie, Pus Zombie, Stench Zombie, Titan Zombie, Feral Zombie, and a handful of boring non-zombies).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
