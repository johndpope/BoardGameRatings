			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The year is 556 R.T. (3116 AD) and humanity has long since fled a doomed Earth. In 2206 AD a comet was discovered to be on a collision course with Earth&amp;mdash;a harbinger of extinction for the entire human race. Humanity built an enormous ark, the Iron Gaia mobile space station, capable of carrying a small percentage of Earth&amp;rsquo;s population in cryogenic sleep while its governing artificial intelligence&amp;mdash;a constantly evolving neural network known as G.A.I.A.&amp;mdash;oversaw humanity&amp;rsquo;s search for a new home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But something went wrong with the plan&amp;mdash;G.A.I.A. went insane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AI ― seeing itself as a goddess dedicated to saving the human race from itself&amp;mdash;created the Celestials, a race of genetically and cybernetically perfected humans to be its angelic servitors. What followed was a centuries long nightmare for humanity. The Gaia and its Celestials performed horrifying experiments the human passengers and thousands of aliens&amp;mdash;the Xel, a race of Psionic aliens abducted from their homeworld of Xion. These experiments resulted in the creation of human Psionic talents and the discovery of a mysterious energy, connected to living beings, named the Aether, allowing specially trained Adepts to manipulate reality through will alone. A human resistance awakened subjects to fight against the mad goddess but was brutally suppressed by Replicants, human-looking hunter-killer-infiltrators designed by the G.A.I.A.. In 2560 AD (the year 1 B.E.) the G.A.I.A.&amp;rsquo;s core was destroyed, forcing it to crash land on the planet&amp;mdash;Origin&amp;mdash;it was orbiting. This was the work of Armand Carter, engineer, leader, freedom fighter and hero of humanity. So ended the First Exodus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half a millennium later, the human race has come a long way, and undergone great changes. Celestials and Xel have been assimilated into human civilization&amp;mdash;although they are not trusted--and the technologies reverse engineered from the G.A.I.A.&amp;rsquo;s mad genius include FTL communications and travel, cloning, and even Replicants bent to the service of mankind. Humanity has endured a Second Exodus from Origin, established a Confederate government of over a hundred worlds, and seen the rise of interplanetary neo-feudal mega-corporations called Great Houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earth is gone but not forgotten, a memory in the hearts and minds of post-diaspora humanity. The people of the Confederated Colonial Republics have faced enslavement and destruction and will face them again. For in these worlds, there are only three constants:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worlds End, Heroes Die, and Systems Malfunction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems Malfunction is a complete, fully realized Campaign Setting for the Singularity System Roleplaying Game. This book contains a complete setting timeline, in-depth faction overviews, a detailed Galactic Atlas, five unique non-human races, and extensive new rules for Augmentations, Psionic Talents, Aetherial Magic, cloning, and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Systems Malfunction Campaign Setting also introduces over 25 new Character Traits, tons of new weapons and equipment, and 30 brand new vehicles and starships. Everything you need for roleplaying exciting stories in the Systems Malfunction universe is here, including a Behind The Scenes section with over 70 pages of GM support and advice, secret histories, secret factions, 30 fully pregenerated NPCs, 12 new creatures and robots, and numerous &amp;quot;Mission Dossiers&amp;quot; and sample adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
