			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;...the &amp;quot;reel&amp;quot; fan's trivia game.&lt;br/&gt;A movie trivia game for fans of almost all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After watching thousands of movies, you decide that it's time you appeared on screen. You study films. You audition roles. You succeed. You fail. Finally, you get the part you've been after! Will you get your name in lights and become immortal on the screen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Move along the game board on your road to fame and fortune by answering questions about all those movies you loved and you hated. What makes the Cinemasters game unique is it contains over 120 different categories of questions with over 2,000 questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
