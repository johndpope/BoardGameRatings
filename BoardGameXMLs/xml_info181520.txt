			<description>Subtitle: Being the truthful account of a tabletop wargame for wee ships in the Age of Discovery, put down in writing by Nicholas Wright Esq. and accurately rendered through illustrations by Orestis &amp;lsquo;Orestix&amp;rsquo; Ermeides Esq.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galleys and Galleons is a standalone set of naval wargaming rules based on the Song of Blades engine. G&amp;amp;G allows players to fight out fast-paced naval battles without cluttering the table with charts or unnecessary record keeping.  Note that no miniatures are included: players can use any sailing ship miniatures of any scale from any source they want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to learn, fast to play, games concluded in around one hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexible: designed for each player to command up to 6-7 ships, the rules are equally enjoyable playing one-on-one duels or small fleet actions with multiple players per side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the core rules focus on early modern voyages of discovery, mercantile exploitation and piracy, additional rules cater to players wishing to sail for stranger shores with the inclusion of mythical beasts, submersibles and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expansive - includes rosters for 36 historic vessels plus numerous shore forts, monsters and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
