			<description>Jinsei Game (人生ゲーム) is the Japanese version of the board game that is called The Game of Life in North America. Unlike The Game of Life, the player starts in his toddler years and has to go to elementary school, junior high school, and high school before being allowed to either go to university or start his career. However, the board game has been updated numerous times like its North American counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Jinsei Game&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
