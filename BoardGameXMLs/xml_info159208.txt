			<description>The object of the game is to study a card for 10 seconds and then answer a question based on the roll of a die. If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept, and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exciting addition to our BrainBox range enables children to create their own unique BrainBox game. Each card shows a different scene as a line drawing, ready for children to colour in. Coloured pencils are included, but felt-tips could also be used. Some of the questions on the cards will have different answers, depending on the child's choice of colours, and the final question is left for children to write themselves. Encourage your child's creativity, memory and observation skills with this great game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
