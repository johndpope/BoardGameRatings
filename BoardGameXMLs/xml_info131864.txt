			<description>From the Official Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are a full-contact LARP inspired by the Warhammer 40,000 setting with a focus on exploration, swashbuckling and intrigue. Our game is focused around the ever changing world of the Rogue Trader Dynasties who are caught up in a quest for wealth and power on the edges of Imperial society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our players take on the roles of major figures in the dynamic world of the Ruhrort Sector, a partially explored area of Imperial space on the Eastern Fringes of the Galaxy. Characters can be anyone from an exceptional Imperial guardsman to a member of the sector nobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We run major events on a regular basis throughout the year as well as ad-hoc events throughout the year for smaller groups. For our next event, please see our calendar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Official Website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No Rest For The Wicked is a game of swashbuckling rogues and pioneers seeking adventure, fame and fortune at the edge of Imperial space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game and setting is based on the Rogue Trader game published by Fantasy Flight Games and the universe of Warhammer 40,000 (Games Workshop).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a game about rogue traders on the edge of known space, it's a game of exploration, trade, combat, politics, intrigue and ultimately: fame and fortune. Take up with a crew and explore unknown space. Watch out for dragons and exploit the untold bounties that undoubtedly await you - if you get there first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fight and/or bargain with the force of Chaos, mighty Ork hordes, ravenous Tyranid swarms, deadly Eldar raiders and more while you try and get as much as you can for yourself and your dynasty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
