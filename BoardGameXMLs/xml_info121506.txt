			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science-Fiction arcade adventure game. The space pirates have intercepted communications between your mothership and the research centers scattered on the planet below. Sensing you have made an important discovery, they board the mothership in order to steal the research data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Elithios, a member of the research team. You have the only copy of the research data, and  you must get it out before the pirates find you. In order to leave the mothership, you must find the three activation codes of the shuttle bay door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is a classic arcade adventure game. You must explore screen after screen while avoiding enemies and the many traps (mines, explosive cyborgs, flame-shooting pipes...). You start the game unarmed but you can collect ammunition for your weapon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
