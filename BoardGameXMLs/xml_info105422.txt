							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Buzz! Junior: Robo Jam</name>
									
			<description>Buzz! Junior: Robo Jam is a 2007 family game for the Sony PlayStation 2, and is the second game in the Buzz! Junior series of games. Robo Jam was co-developed by Magenta Software and FreeStyleGames. Magenta supplied the engine and nineteen of the twenty five mini-games while Freestyle supplied the remaining six mini-games. Cohort Studios developed a PlayStation 3 version of the game that was released on the PlayStation Store on May 14, 2009 which included trophy support and, for the first time, players could use a DualShock controller as well as the Buzz! Buzzers. Gameplay is based around multiple mini-games, each quite simple and straightforward to play using the four Buzz! controllers. It's primarily aimed at the family market but offers appealing entertainment to almost anyone of any age. Simple game play allows young children to participate while still being entertaining enough for older children and adults. The game is similar in concept to Jungle Party, with robot based mini-games in a space-themed environment. One of the main differences between Jungle Party and Robo Jam is the introduction of AI, allowing players to play against the computer. Unlike Jungle Party there is no solo game mode. A full game can be played with only one human player and three computer players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Buzz!
