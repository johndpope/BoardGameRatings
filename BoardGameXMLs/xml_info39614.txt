			<description>A Chinese game related to Xi Gua Qi but different, although using a similar board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sz'Kwa&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;br/&gt;Jump to: navigation, search&lt;br/&gt;Sz'Kwa is a two-player abstract strategy game from Taiwan. It is a Go, Weiqi, or Baduk variant. The Sz'Kwa board is not an n x n square board like Go or Weiqi. Instead, the board is circular in design. The same board is used by Watermelon Chess and one of the ancient Roman Bear games.&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;[hide]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    1 Goal &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    2 Equipment &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    3 Game Play and Rules &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    4 Related Games &lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull;    5 External Links&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Goal&lt;br/&gt;To capture the most enemy pieces.&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Equipment&lt;br/&gt;The board is composed of a large circle with an inner middle circle. Four semi-circles form a North, South, East, and West arrangement in the interior of the larger circle. The large circle and the smaller middle circle are divided equally into four pie slices. This creates for twenty-one intersection points where the pieces are played upon.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 20 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however, any two colors or distinguishable objects will do.&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Game Play and Rules&lt;br/&gt;1. The board is empty in the beginning.&lt;br/&gt;2. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.&lt;br/&gt;3. Players drop one of their pieces on any vacant intersection point on the board. Only one piece can be dropped per turn. Players alternate their turns.&lt;br/&gt;4. Enemy piece(s) can be captured as long as the enemy piece(s) are surrounded completely by the player's pieces.&lt;br/&gt;5. The game ends when there are no more vacant intersection points to drop a piece onto, or when one player has exhausted all their pieces.&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Related Games&lt;br/&gt;Go, Weiqi, Baduk, Watermelon Chess, Bear games&lt;br/&gt;[edit] External Links&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1196&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1196&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://totmon.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://totmon.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp&lt;/a&gt;;products_id=285&lt;br/&gt;Retrieved from &amp;quot;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%27Kwa&amp;quot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%27Kwa&amp;quot&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
