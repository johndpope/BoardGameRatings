			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Knight and his amazing computer controlled vehicle K.I.T.T. are in Atlanta on yet another dangerous mission. Michael's co-ordinator, Devon, has discovered that a group of international terrorists are planning to alter the precarious status quo between the East and West. It is even possible that for some reason known only to themselves they are trying to trigger a Third World War. Devon has instructed the KNIGHT RIDER to uncover the insidious plot and put a stop to it - but no-one knows exactly what the plot is!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game has three sections - a map screen, a driving section and the operations bases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The map screen allows the player to select the next route towards potential terrorist bases, along with an indication as to whether the route is straight or twisty, and the nature of the terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driving section is innovative in that the player can switch between control of driving K.I.T.T. and control of weapons to shoot down various terrorist targets. When in control of the weapons, K.I.T.T. drives himself, and vice versa. K.I.T.T. is less adept at driving and controlling the weapons, so switching between the two options is crucial. K.I.T.T. cannot be destroyed, but can be damaged, which slows down both his speed, and also how quickly the weapon sights move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terrorist bases each have different objectives, and on completing them a clue to the next objective is given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Driving between locations and repairing damage takes time. The game is failed when time runs out and the terrorists achieve their objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
