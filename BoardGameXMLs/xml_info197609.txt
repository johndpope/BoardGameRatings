			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Life on Earth has become hell. Mega corporations and zaibatsus rule with tyrannical hands. The environment has taken a blunt blow when development and exploitation has been the keywords by leading power figures. But in 2075 a new hope rose for mankind when it began its greatest project, the Space Elevator. To many it became known as Jacob&amp;rsquo;s Ladder, after the Biblical myth of a ladder to the heavens. Some said it would become the fall of man while others spoke of it as the salvation. It took over 50 years of sacrifices and financial hardship to complete the space elevator. It also became the last project of Earth&amp;rsquo;s collected world societies before the collapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
