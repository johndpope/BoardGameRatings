			<description>A tabletop &amp;ldquo;Space Opera Miniature Game&amp;rdquo; based on the designer&amp;rsquo;s story of the same name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is now the dawn of the five hundredth millennium since the birth of Christ. The Empire of Man has reached out into the intergalactic depths of space, and a lost son has been found&amp;hellip;unfortunately. The great Quantumliners of the Scouting Guild has encountered an artificial species completely inimical to humanity. Each alien robot is directly controlled by a single artificial intelligence known as Ladek! The twisted, disembodied mind of the former human scientist now lords over these automaton artifacts of a long extinct race. They have invaded every galaxy controlled by man&amp;rsquo;s glorious Imperium, and have begun a systematic extermination of every human life it encounters. While the Imperial Navy and Marine Corp defends the home galaxies against the attacks of these monsters, it falls to the Scouting Guild to hunt out and destroy Ladek units along the Imperium&amp;rsquo;s frontier worlds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;One player plays the Human Imperial Scouts and the other plays the Ladek Marine Robots. Forces are &amp;lsquo;purchased&amp;rsquo; by means of points. Both sides must decide how many points they should begin with. I highly suggest beginning a campaign (a series of wargames between the same player(s)) with fifty points for each side.&amp;rdquo; The object of the game is to destroy all the opposing units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
