							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stalingrad Inferno</name>
									
			<description>In the Spring of 1942, the powerful Nazi warmachine dominates Europe. With America thrown in the conflict by the Japanese, the spectre of a two fronts war has become true. Hitler needs a decisive victory in Russia to concentrate on one front, or - at least - to deprive the Allies of their unlimited oil reserves. &lt;br/&gt;The outcast sees Hitler setting the goals for the summer offensives which foresees an ambitious plan to seize both the Soviet Caucasus oilfields and the western allied Persian and Iraqi's.&lt;br/&gt;A two pronged advance, one led by Rommel through Egypt, and one led by von Kleist through the Caucasus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;Controlling Persia, Iraq and Caucasus would give the Wehrmacht the needed oil for the technology, research, development, fuel aircraft and panzers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On August 23rd 1942, the German Wehrmacht and other Axis powers started the attack on the city of Stalingrad in a battle that will last for over 5 months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;STALINGRAD INFERNO&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the operational level. It recalls the battle of Stalingrad between the German forces and the Russian Army.&amp;nbsp;Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II.&lt;br/&gt;The game uses a co-op system where the players (up to 2) controls the German forces fighting for the control of the city against the Russian Army.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over a detailed 94x45 cm (30&amp;quot;x20&amp;quot;) full laminated multicolor mapboard. The game features&amp;nbsp;more than 200 wooden/plastic components and over 56 event cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
