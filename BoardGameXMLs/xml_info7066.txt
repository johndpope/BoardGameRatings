							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Shadow Raven</name>
									
			<description>The Object of the Game is to beat your opponent(s) by doing one of two things: destroy his (their) home base(s) by depleting his (their) card library or by winning and claiming five different battle cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting sci-fi card game, with seven types of cards: Character, Weapon, Vehicle, Familiar, Action, Battle and Energy. Shadow Raven CCG (combat card game) was designed, I believe, as a true CCG. However only 99 card 'starter' decks were produced. The game is likely to remain non-collectible. Each player needs a deck of his/her own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
