			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birds are ubiquitous across H&amp;acirc;rn and familiar to all. They are found in cities and keeps, in fields and hedgerows, in the wilds, forests, mountains, and shores. They range in size from the small wren with a wingspan of six inches to the northern eagle, which reaches nearly 20 feet tip to tip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This bestiary article describes how birds are used by man (including falconry) and includes techniques for hunting and capturing birds. Illustrations, details, and statistics are provided for two exceptional species, the Dreadwalker and gigantic Northern Eagle, as well as for 17 other classes of birds (Eagles, Hawks, Falcons, Owls, Scavengers, and many others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The article also includes a table showing species abundance, random encounters, and food and market values. The table is designed to be used with the rules in the H&amp;acirc;rn Hunting article (COL #4841).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
