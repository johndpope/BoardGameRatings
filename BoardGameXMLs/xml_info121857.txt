			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A platform/puzzle game in isometric 3d, in which the player must guide a droid on tiles to collect energy discs, while avoiding hazards. The game manual says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Bouncing Bruce, a service droid has got himself lost on the cosmic energy grid. You must guide him across each square of the grid to the exit gate, collecting any rotating energy discs along the way. Take care though, passage across the square is made hazardous by the presence of direction changing blocks, round ejection discs and moving guards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the energy discs have been collected and Bruce has reached the exit, the square will become neutralised and he can attempt the next chosen square on the grid. Lastly, Bruce being a delicate droid, it's advisable not to bounce him too high as he will shatter on impact.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
