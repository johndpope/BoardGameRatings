			<description>In Fire Drill, each player takes turns placing one of their pieces on any square on the board. The only limitation is that each piece must be at least one square away from a piece of the same color. Once all the pieces have been placed on the board, the starting player chooses any of his pieces to move. Play then alternates between opponents, each moving one of their own pieces. Pieces are moved in the fashion of the robots in Ricochet Robots. A piece travels in a straight line until it hits a wall or another piece, at which time it can turn left, right, or stop. A piece may make any number of turns and travel any distance in a turn, but once it stops, play proceeds to the next player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player to align four of his pieces in a row orthogonally wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
