			<description>You&amp;rsquo;ve been punitively posted to Mars after assaulting your commanding officer, who ordered your unit to fire upon civilians. The Martian marine base acts as security for AGM corporation (AGM), a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phobos is considered by space marines to be the dullest assignment imaginable: &amp;quot;with no action for eighty million miles, your day consisted of suckin' sand and watchin' flicks in the rec room.&amp;quot; This all changes when the AGM experiments go horribly wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely, and &amp;quot;something fragging evil&amp;quot; starts pouring out of the gateway, killing or possessing all AGM personnel. Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent to Phobos to investigate, where you&amp;rsquo;re left to guard the hangar with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside. Over the course of the next few hours, you hear assorted garbled radio messages, gunfire, and screams, followed by silence: &amp;quot;Seems your buddies are dead&amp;hellip;or WORSE&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the last man standing, your mission is to fight through the entire onslaught of demonic enemies by yourself in order to keep them from attacking Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;             *** *** *** &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you liked Doom, you'd like Doom's Knight. All new 36 new levels and new sound track will put you in the middle of the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features:&lt;br/&gt;- 36 new levels&lt;br/&gt;- 9 weapons: Fists, Pistol, Shotgun, Chain gun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Gun, saw, Shotgun, and BFG&lt;br/&gt;- Multiplayer via Wi-Fi&lt;br/&gt;- New soundtrack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
