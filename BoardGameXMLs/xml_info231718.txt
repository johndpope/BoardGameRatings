							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rania&#039;s Curse</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The party is propositioned to clear the road to a new settlement site at Lake Rania. They are also separately tasked with seeking out an oracle rumored to still be alive in the ruins of an ancient elvish temple nearby. Their patron hopes to learn the identity of the mastermind behind a rash of crimes against racial minorities in the town. Unfortunately, the temple has partially sunk into the lake (rendering the entire first floor under water) and the oracle has been transformed into a hideous Medusa. Should the party escape this underwater tomb, they must still face its ghostly guardians who wish to keep its secrets buried. Finally, upon their return to the town, they will be ambushed by a cult of human supremacist who wish to use their death as a justification for a war against racial minorities in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a much-expanded version of Rania's Curse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
