			<description>The players start at the snail's shell in the center of the game board. The game is played with 1 color die. The 1st player to roll his own color, begins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the roll of any color, the meeples advance to the next space of this color. If a player rolls his own color, he may roll again. When a meeple arrives on an occupied space, it throws the other meeple out, back to the snail's shell. There it must start again. From the last space of its color on the track, the meeples advance to the snail's head of its own color, as soon as the player rolls this color. The 1st player to achieve this, wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
