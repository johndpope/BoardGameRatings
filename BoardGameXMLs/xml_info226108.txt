							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ortus Regni: Knight-Errant</name>
									
			<description>A unique way to play Ortus Regni; variantmat for 2-4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are Knights of the Realm, not great Earls. But you hope to rise in stature by having that title bestowed on you and your house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earning the respect of the great peers of the Realm, catching their eye with your strength and guile, will secure your rise.&lt;br/&gt;A Knight wins Knight-errant instantly when they possess any 3 of the unique victory conditions; as mere Knights would dare not touch the person or possessions of a recognized Earl. Status is everything in this world, and all the other great Earls of the land would immediately crush such a challenge to the hierarchy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
