							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mark of Hubris</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This adventure takes place in the region featured in Adventurer's Guide to Cthonia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first adventure in the Feudal Lords' Champion's of Hubris Paragon Adventure Path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world contains many treacherous secrets. Each one of those tantalizing tidbits are far flung in the most foreboding of areas: the dark reaches of an evil heart. As one reveals each vile secret, bringing it into the light, allowing it witnessed by the innocent, it threatens to pervert even those of purest virtue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In The Mark of Hubris, characters discover they have a mystical mark that up until this point remained something of a mystery. However, recent activities spark renewed interest in the mark and it begins to prove troublesome for those that bear its arcane etchings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventurers must discover the purpose of the mark born upon them while navigating dangerous thoroughfares, running from relentless hunters, and discover the whereabouts of a missing inquisitor. The journey takes them from the underbelly of Caldor to the abandoned gypsy market of Ardor via a trek southward into the foreboding Bog of Bones where the secret of the Shield Tree is discovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product provides Players and Game Masters with the following for thrilling play:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     An adventure designed for 10th-level characters set in the exciting Feudal Lords Campaign Setting&lt;br/&gt;     Well-designed encounters, interesting NPCs, and memorable villains&lt;br/&gt;     New monsters and magic items&lt;br/&gt;     Great three-dimensional maps&lt;br/&gt;     New skill challenges and more&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although designed for the Feudal Lords Campaign Setting, this product easily adapts into your favorite campaign or adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
