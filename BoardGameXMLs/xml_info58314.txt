			<description>Laura is traveling to China. Before a round, each player places one or more Laura tokens (depending on the number of players) on different locations on the game board. Each location consists of four puzzle pieces. Afterwards, players take turns flipping open puzzle pieces. When the piece shows a part of a location with a Laura token, the player can take place that piece and take the token. Also, he or she gets the star token.&lt;br/&gt;Some puzzle pieces also depict a piece of the 9-piece star puzzle in the middle of the board. When such a piece is flipped open, it is placed on the star. When the star is complete, the game ends immediately and the player who currently holds the star token is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
