			<description>An &amp;quot;intellectually stimulating variation of Othello&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abridged rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The object of the game is to get to the other side of the game board.&lt;br/&gt;2. The game board is divided into squares, but you're not told how many squares wide or long it is.&lt;br/&gt;3. You can only step on a square if it has a tile on it. You can step on any tile, even if it was made by another player.&lt;br/&gt;4. If you step on an empty square, or the tile you're standing on breaks, then you &amp;quot;fall in&amp;quot; and have to swim back to the nearest tile.&lt;br/&gt;5. Each empty square that either borders a tile or the starting edge of the game board has a question visible on it. The questions are very simple and have single answers, such as &amp;quot;why does water flow downhill?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;why can light pass through glass?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;what is heat?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;6. The only way to make new tiles is by making-up an answer to the question.&lt;br/&gt;7. A tile will only float if you can verify the answer with a reproducible test.&lt;br/&gt;8. A tile can only be broken by proving the answer is wrong with a reproducible test.&lt;br/&gt;9. A test can't break a tile if its results can't be reproduced, a tile can't float if the verifying test's results can't be reproduced.&lt;br/&gt;10. If a tile is broken, then all tiles ahead of it that cannot be connected back to the starting edge by another continuous series of tiles will be broken as well.&lt;br/&gt;11. A player is defined as someone who obeys the rules. If you stop obeying the rules you cease to be a player until you start obeying the rules again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further explanation of the rules can be found at: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.disenchanted.com/technology/game.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.disenchanted.com/technology/game.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
