			<description>Think five. Five colors, five shapes, five minutes to learn. In Q!nto you add tiles from your 5 tile hand to the grid in a single line. All lines must contain tiles in which the colors are either all the same OR all different, AND the shapes are also either all the same or all different. There are also shape-specific Wild tiles which can represent any color, and color-specific Wild tiles which can represent any shape. In addition, there are 2 Q!nto tiles which can represent any shape in any color. Instead of adding tiles to the grid, a player may use his/her turn to swap tiles from his/her hand for already played Wild tiles, as long as they work in that position. Q!nto can be played a few different ways. In Q!nto Classic, players keep score. Q!nto Plus allows players to count valid diagonal lines of 3 or more tiles. In Q!nto Light, the tiles are divided evenly among the players who then race to get rid of all their tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
