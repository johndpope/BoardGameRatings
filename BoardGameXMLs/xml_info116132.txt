			<description>The number and nature of the cards have been calculated to present a game of skill, as near to the true game of golf as possible (says the publisher).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player's ability is affected by the handicap drawn, both in the distance the ball is struck and the number of hazards encountered. The types of club used are represented by club cards. Hazards commonly encountered in the game are represented by hazard cards. The limitations imposed on a player by their handicap, are further controlled by the hazard handicap detail tables. Penalty cards have to be drawn as indicated by some hazard cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are course score cards for three levels of play - Short, Long and Championship. There is also a Pro Golf Game to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game says &amp;quot;As played by John Richardson&amp;quot; , but I have no idea who he is. At least a professional golfer I hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents&lt;br/&gt;2 Packs of Hazard Cards(75 Per Pack).&lt;br/&gt;2 Packs of Club Cards(29 Per Pack).&lt;br/&gt;1 Pack of Handicap Cards.&lt;br/&gt;4 Penalty Cards.&lt;br/&gt;22 Score Cards(3 Types).&lt;br/&gt;Money in Two Denominations.&lt;br/&gt;1 Set of Rules.&lt;br/&gt;2 Sets of Rules For Pro Golf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
