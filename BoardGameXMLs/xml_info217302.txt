							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Planeta Nomino</name>
									
			<description>Story:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;April 2053. A group of space explorers arrives distant planet Nomino. On the spot they discover numerous mysterious objects. Nobody knows what is the purpose of the items they encountered. Yet, the astronauts have to give discoveries appropriate names as soon as possible due to the request of the mighty press syndicate being a sponsor of the expedition. The public is waiting for more news about expedition findings and scientists, threatened by news mogul with financial cuts, must act quickly&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Planet Nomino&amp;rdquo; is a family party game where players match bizarre names to even stranger objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each round the players reveal a thing, put the spinning top in motion and then discuss the best names for it. In order to win player may need to convince other researchers that one of the picks is the best (even if it is obviously the worst one!). As soon as the spinning top stopped, they vote for each proposal and score according to the result of the ballot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two modes of play: Simple, for young scientists, and basic, for more experienced astronauts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In simple mode the player gets the points if she or he voted for most popular name (the one, which according to player&amp;rsquo;s opinion fits the object best and thus got majority of the votes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In basic mode there is one more twist added. Each player gets each round new character card. Each character pursues own secret agenda and gains points if specific names had or had not been used (even if these were better choices than others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game continues until a player reaches 7 victory points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
