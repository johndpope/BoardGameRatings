			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular installment of Exotic Encounters focuses on the centaur. These icons of Greek mythology have fulfilled many roles in fantasy media, from savage barbarian stand-ins for Mongols, Huns, and other nomadic horselords, to fey-like guardians of nature and wilderness, with many roles in between. In Pathfinder, their lowly CR 3 status and the fact that their horselike bodies don&amp;rsquo;t really belong in underground dungeons means that many adventurers may never encounter one, but the new centaurs in this book may just change all that. The first such centaur, the plainsrunner centaur (CR 4) ties into the image of centaurs as steppe-dwelling nomads, and these centaurs are exceptionally fast and agile, making for incredibly maneuverable opponents. The second centaur in the book, the skyborn centaur (CR 6), is partially celestial in nature, and has great white wings that allow it to fly through the air. It specializes in jousting and duels, and is incredibly proficient at charging with a lance. Finally, the nightcharger centaur (CR 8) is the spawn of a night hag and a nightmare, and combines their most dreaded powers in new and unusual ways, as well as having its own curse of doom ability, which blocks its victims from having any lucky breaks, and exacerbates the effects of bad luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
