			<description>Sicilia is a mid-weight strategy game for 2-5 players, with a 6-player expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the middle ages, Sicily was the melting pot of its day. Greeks, Italians, Arabs, French, and Spanish all mixed together on the island. Rarely did the ruling king live on the island. Instead, leaders, such as barons and dukes, were appointed to govern the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such leader, the Baron Beneamato, governed the territory of Sicily. In his advancing years, he wanted to ensure that his people were governed by a good leader&amp;mdash;a person they trusted and loved. So rather than pass his sovereignty to his evil son, he proclaimed that the people would decide who would become the next ruler. The island would now be governed as a democracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players in this game are potential candidates for the throne, trying to earn a majority of support, by influence, strategy, or force. You must also learn to avoid or control the Innominato (the un-named), a secret society predating the modern Mafiosi, who will thwart any ruling power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You all start out in your home village with minimal support and very little transportation. You must work to increase your transportation speed, out guess your fellow players to earn more support of the people, avoid duels with other players, and work out your strategy to succeed. Will you quickly try to grab the smaller villages through education? Or prove your dedication to larger villages with food and wine? Will you earn the trust of a certain region or try to please everyone in all regions? Or will you spend your resources for the benefits of Potenza cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
