			<description>The game board is an 8x8 grid which consists of 16 groups of four holes. Each hole is assigned a number between 1 and 4 (same alignment on the entire board). Each player has 16 playing pieces in his/her color. &lt;br/&gt;At the beginning, the players take turns rolling a four-sided die and can place one of their pieces in any of the holes with the number that was rolled. The aim is to form squares and lines of four pieces either completely in one's own color or in two colors (two pieces each, together with another player). A single color square or line counts 2 points, a shared one 1 point for each of the involved players. &lt;br/&gt;When all holes of one number are filled, the die is put aside and the players place the pieces at their discretion for the remainder of the game (thus the luck factor is eliminated and the game proceeds as a pure abstract strategy game. &lt;br/&gt;When all the holes are filled, the player with most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(User summary by HilkMAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
