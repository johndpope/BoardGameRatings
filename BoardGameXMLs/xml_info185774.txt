			<description>How To Kill A Spider is an easy to learn, fast paced, trick-taking style card game with a dark and hilarious twist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We were inspired to make a game we could play with our friends and family, having easy-to-learn familiar mechanics, but with a twist! How To Kill A Spider fits in the traditional genre of games such as Spades and other trick-taking games, with a bit of inspired &amp;quot;Take That!&amp;quot; flavor from games like Fluxx and Munchkin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In &amp;quot;How To Kill A Spider&amp;quot; players take on the role of roommates, trying to clear their house of those horrible home invaders by using an assortment of completely practical household weaponry! The roommate with the most spider cards in their Squash Pile at the end of 3 rounds is our winner! But be careful, if the house is infested with more spiders than the winner's Squash Pile, all players lose!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The base game comes with 130 cards, including 10 &amp;quot;SWAT&amp;quot; expansion pack cards that modify the game further for additional variance and mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
