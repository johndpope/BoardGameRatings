							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wall Ball</name>
									
			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wall Ball is mainly a dexterity and aiming game where you control a brightly luminescent rectangle. You are at one end of a large rectangular area, at the other end of which there is a brick wall. The brick wall and the area you are standing on are parallel to each other. There also is a rapidly moving ball between the two ends. You must block the ball as it comes towards you, and aim it towards the brick wall. Based on the angle with which you block the ball, it can go straight towards the brick wall, or bounce off on the hypothetical horizontal walls of the area and reach the brick wall at a different angle. Your aim is to knock out as many bricks of the far wall as possible, earning points for doing so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
