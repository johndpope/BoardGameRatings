			<description>Similar to its predecessors, Skylanders: SuperChargers is a &amp;quot;toy-to-life&amp;quot; video game in which players can place toy figurine on the &amp;quot;Portal of Power&amp;quot;, which will allow player to play as the figurine-represented character in-game. The game will introduce a redesigned &amp;quot;Portal of Power&amp;quot;, in which the surface will become larger and wider so as to accommodate vehicles, which is of larger size than typical characters. Vehicles are one of the newly introduced features in SuperChargers. According to Activision, about 50% of the game must be completed through driving. Vehicles are divided into three classes, which include ground vehicles, water vehicles and flying vehicles. With the use of ground vehicles and water vehicles, players can race on land or dive under water on several different tracks, while the flying ship features an &amp;quot;autopilot system&amp;quot; which can guide players to their destination automatically. Players can have the option to accelerate and decelerate the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Skylanders: SuperChargers&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
