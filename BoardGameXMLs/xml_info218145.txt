							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Theories of Everything</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set in the Sindal Subsector featured in the recently released Core Rulebook, Theories of Everything is an exciting and memorable adventure set in the Trojan Reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Reach Adventure 2: Theories of Everything the Travellers are hired as crew and research assistants aboard the laboratory vessel Insight III. The ship is owned by a cooperative of scientists working in a cross-discipline environment to solve problems and discover knowledge as they journey across the vast reaches of space&amp;hellip; or so they claim. In fact, Insight III is basically a jump-capable shouting match as its owners bicker, squabble and argue their erratic way across a dangerous subsector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Travellers&amp;rsquo; mission is thus more than merely running the ship and helping collect data. They will need to be advisors, diplomats and bodyguards too, injecting a little common sense into the heady mix of ego and brilliance aboard Insight III. The storyline of the adventure is as much about the interactions of the scientists and crew as the situations they find themselves in, and it may be that the Travellers&amp;rsquo; greatest challenge will be keeping the scientists from murdering one another&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Includes two new vehicles : the Sealed Air/Raft and the Electric Dirt Bike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
