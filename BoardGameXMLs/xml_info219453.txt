			<description>A fast paced card game where players try to score the least points at the end of the game. The game ends once a player is down to two cards. Points are the number of cards in each player's hand plus 'It's Not Your Turn' cards. &lt;br/&gt;     Players take turns either playing the correct card from their hand (if they have it) face-up, playing a card face-down in an attempt to either bluff or reverse-bluff, or being honest about not having the right card and taking a 'It's Not Your Turn' card. Players can even use a house rule where they can try to steal another player's turn(s) by playing certain number cards at the right moment.&lt;br/&gt;     The game has a lighthearted spoof theme of the stereotypical gamer elitist as shown on the different suit cards and on the game box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
