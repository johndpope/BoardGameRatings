			<description>A space theme game from Greece, made for a chocolate firm called ION probably was as a gift with chocolates. A very rare game !&lt;br/&gt;Your goal is to travel in to our solar system and be the first who will visit all the planets.&lt;br/&gt;You move with the spin on a well track that came with the game.&lt;br/&gt;There are three faces.&lt;br/&gt;At the first face to try to take off from earths gravitation force and travel to the moon.&lt;br/&gt;You spin the well twice, first to to determine the track (lets say you roll 5) so your hight is five.&lt;br/&gt;The second spin determine the speed of the rocket (must be more than 1 to win the gravitation ).That will allow you to move the rocket clock wise ( lets say that you roll 3, so at hight of five you move three spaces clock wise on the track around the Earth's orbit.......&lt;br/&gt;The second face is the moonlanding&lt;br/&gt;This face starts when the first rocket reach the hight of 7, then you place the moon token at the blue spot betwen the hight 7 and 8. And the game continues.&lt;br/&gt;The moon always moves at speed of 1 clockwise at the and of every players turn.&lt;br/&gt;To land on the moon you must be on a parallay with the moon at hight 7, when you reach thisand is your turn you put your space craft at the moon and you spin the well right away to reach the third face of the game....&lt;br/&gt;At the third and last face you must visit the planets in the exact order Afrodite, Hermes, Aris,Zeus, Kronos, Houranos, Posidon, Plouton. You follow the same rule as the first face and some more rules.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
