							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Panzer Dragoon R-Zone</name>
									
			<description>Panzer Dragoon R-zone was a Tiger R-Zone game for the short-lived system. It was one of the few launch titles licensed by Sega, being released just a few months after the original Panzer Dragoon. It was the first game in the series that was not developed by Team Andromeda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no plot, simply a nameless character on an armored dragon attempting to keep a dark dragon from reaching a tower while shooting and dodging robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Panzer Dragoon (series)&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
