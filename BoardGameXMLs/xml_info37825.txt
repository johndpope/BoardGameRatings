							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sword &amp; Sorcery Slugfest</name>
									
			<description>A simple tactical game of fantasy combat between individual wizards and warriors. It has nothing to do with Sword &amp; Sorcery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a hex map with spaces large enough to accommodate miniature figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters are rated for Attack, Damage, Defend, Hits, Speed, and Range (hand to hand). Warriors carry a magical melee weapon with a randomly determined special ability. Wizards have a randomly determined assortment of spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters earn experience by defeating opponents. Experience can be used to enhance traits or to acquire additional spells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
