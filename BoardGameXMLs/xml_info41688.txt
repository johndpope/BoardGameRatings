			<description>Bagua is an abstract strategy game for 2 players. Each player controls 2 pieces and tries to race one of his piece to the opposite of the board, while avoiding being captured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules:&lt;br/&gt;On each turn, a player must move one, and only one of his pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A move consists of holding one square still, while rotating the other square to a row that is at least one space forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capturing occurs, when two squares of the same color come into contact. If the color is black, player one (black player) gets to remove the opposing piece, and vice-versa. If the two pieces belong to the same player, the player has the option of removing one or none of his two pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to be the first player to move one of your pieces across to the opposite edge. (You only need one square to touch the opposite side.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
