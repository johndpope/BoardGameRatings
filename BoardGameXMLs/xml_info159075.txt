			<description>Rocket may sound like a space-themed game, but is actually a game of racing trains.  The game board is printed on the inside of its box, and consists of several tracks that narrow and widen and curve around the board with different obstacles and switches.  Players use a spinner to determine their moves, and race their tin train pieces from the Start to the End of Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
