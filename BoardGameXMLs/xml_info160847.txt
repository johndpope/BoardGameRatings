			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;Jungle Patrol is an action game for Commodore 64, written by Konrad Wieclawski in 1989 and published by CP Verlag in 1990. The player controls a military car that drives through the jungle. The car can jump and also shoot missiles that fly in a curve. The player must destroy mines, pick up fuel, and avoid attacks from the sky. The player does not have more then one life, instead the car has a shield, with a meter showing how much is left. It is not possible to beat the game, it just repeats itself, so the aim of the game is to get the highest points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
