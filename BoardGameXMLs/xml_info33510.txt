			<description>The players travel through Germany with their trains. They have to visit specific cities, answer master questions there, and encounter events in between. Movement allowance is defined by answering trivia questions of all sorts. Several joker cards help on difficult questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player currently doesn't have a destination card, he gets one; correct guessing the city from its description allows a first move in its direction. &lt;br/&gt;On later turns, the player has to answer a trivia question; depending on the difficulty level chosen, a correct answer gives 2 - 6 movement points. &lt;br/&gt;If he encounters a random event space in between, movement stops, and he follows the directions on the event card. &lt;br/&gt;When he reaches the destination city, he has to answer a master question (multiple choice).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first player that has encountered at least 3 events and correctly answered 3 master questions wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
