			<description>Diskfightorient is an advanced version of the game Diskmoon, based on the novels universe &amp;quot;Ge-Volver 1810&amp;quot; by author Marco Ricchini.&lt;br/&gt;In this uchronic XIX century, different ancient races live in secret among humans, often holding important roles in many nations.&lt;br/&gt;Some of these people have the power of the ancient two-faced god Janus, this grants them two different appareances in one body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Diskfightorient, a pirate called Morgan the Obese wrote a ruleset to regularize the rough sport invented by his crew and called it the Diskmoon discipline.&lt;br/&gt;He dictated that all the games would have been played at Skull Island and the item to retrieve would be an ancient preciuos coin, called Diskmoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Diskmoon game series, two players use a team of four miniatures of different races. The two teams start the game in two different sides of the game board, comprised of 17x17 squares that they will build using two-sided tiles, making a different game every time.&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the game is to find the Diskmoon token and bring it to the opponent starting side to score one point. The first player that scores two points wins the game. One team can also win the game if he kills all the opponent's Jollary characters.&lt;br/&gt;The players activate one of their miniatures every turn. Each miniature has 10 action points to spend for movement, attack, passing the diskmagik and using special abilities.&lt;br/&gt;Some characters also has two different sides represented on the miniature and on the cards than represent the two forms that he can switch into during the game to change his abilities and statistics.&lt;br/&gt;The game board has some obstacles like water and lava that can slow or kill some characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diskmagik reimplements the game Diskmoon introducing &amp;quot;grenades&amp;quot; mechanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
