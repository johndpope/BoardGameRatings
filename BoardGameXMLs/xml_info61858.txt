			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Put on those shades, run a self-diagnostic on your implanted chrome and prepare to hit the mean streets with this, the first issue of Daring Tales of the Sprawl!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triple Ace Games&amp;rsquo; new line of cyberpunk, two-fisted tales takes the characters into the sprawl, where extracting corporate employees from under their employers noses, exchanging fire with the scum who inhabit the deregulated zones, whilst trying to stay alive long enough to collect your pay is the order of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This inaugural issue contains two short adventures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Family Affair: A new patron contacts the heroes and pays them a retainer to perform a few odd jobs on a tight schedule: Tampering with food deliveries, &amp;ldquo;rescuing&amp;rdquo; a middle-aged couple from an ambulance, keeping them safe and delivering them to the airport are hardly standard missions, but the patron is paying well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extraction 101: An almost textbook corporate extraction is required. What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot actually, and the heroes are going to be busy trying to ensure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Their mission takes them from the sterile corridors of a corporate tower, to a crosstown race against time, and finally to the ruins of the deregulated zone.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
