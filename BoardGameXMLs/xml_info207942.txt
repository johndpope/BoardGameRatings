			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simon Cassidy struggled for years to develop technology that would allow him to travel through time. He would be able to travel to the future to see what investments to make or to gather information on the winners of big sporting events. He could travel to the past and set up power and riches for himself in the modern day or, better yet, steal away treasures in ways that could never lead back to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He wasn't exactly successful. Although he made great strides in developing devices that could interact with the flow of time, the best he could manage was to be able to slow and stop time around himself. Impatient, he decided to use what he actually had to embark on his super criminal career... and for FREEZE FRAME, crime comes easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
