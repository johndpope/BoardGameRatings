							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ka Ngrej</name>
									
			<description>From Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term KaNgrej serves a dual purpose, referring to a formal race and a constantly expanding menagerie of sub-races. The prime race is the oldest, most commonly encountered archetype, referred to simply as the KaNgrej. The vast array of sub-races possesses formal racial names, such as VaeRdin, IthWra, and TaZoel, seldom referred to simply as KaNgrej.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KaNgrej as a species is similar to humanity, with an ability to thrive in virtually any environment. Where humanity commonly reshapes the environment for comfort, the KaNgrej readily evolve, adapting to new environments over several generations. Rapid adaptability accounts for the great diversity among KaNgrej sub-races, being well adapted to their native environments. However, the prime KaNgrej are more often inclined to follow the approach of humanity, sculpting the environment into habitable settlements, harvesting precious resources, forging powerful nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
