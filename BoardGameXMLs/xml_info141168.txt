			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collection of six Level I BASIC programs on three cassettes. The collection comes in a binder which holds the cassettes and documentation for the games. The BASIC source code listing for each game is also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Manual Excerpts with User Edits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star-Pilot places you in control of an inter-planetary space fighter. Your mission is to destroy a fleet of enemy ships using your limited supply of rockets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Hamurabi you are the exalted ruler of an ancient kingdom. Your objective is to build your kingdom from its present population of 100 poverty-stricken peasants into a wealthy, thriving metropolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Taxi challenges your skill as a pilot on a distant planet. Your mission is to maneuver your craft safely over treacherous and unpredictable terrain to a landing port in the next valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random Tic-Tac-Toe is an exciting and challenging variation of the old school-yard pastime, with the same objective of the regular game, but requiring the logic and foresight of chess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not just a game--it's a means to let your artistic fancy run wild! The Draw cassette contains three programs - DRAW I (instructions), DRAW II (lets you create pictures and designs on the video display and save them to tape), DRAW III (loads your previously created designs and pictures from tape and displays them on the screen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Checkers is a completely electronic version of the classic game--the board and pieces are created and moved on the screen, and the Computer is your never-tiring opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
