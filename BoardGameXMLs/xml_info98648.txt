			<description>Designer's Notes:&lt;br/&gt;These rules are best used for quickly adding an RPG &amp;ldquo;rules-light&amp;rdquo; component to a Battletech game, for playing a convention game that combines RPG and the Battletech boardgame, or if you simply wish to have a quick alternative to the current Mechwarrior role-playing games. The idea is that these rules are simple and that the Game Referee will usually say &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Roll dice&amp;rdquo; to most situations. Not all situations are covered by these rules; a certain amount of flexibility and Game Referee creativity needs to be employed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To have the best &amp;ldquo;rules light&amp;rdquo; RPG/board game experience, my recommendation that you combine these &amp;ldquo;micro&amp;rdquo; rules with the Classic Battletech Introductory Rulebook and the Vehicle and Infantry Combat rules from the Classic Battletech Quick Start. No attempt has been made to include any of the other vehicle types, such as conventional aircraft, Aerotech or Starships. The GM should employ their best judgement and houserule as they see fit to make the characters work within the boardgame in a straightforward fashion. I&amp;rsquo;ve also left out a lot of things that are going to be campaign dependent, such as creating a unit, figuring out Battlemech assignments, dealing with salvage and a 101 more things &amp;ndash; but these are all things that you as a GM would want to figure out either on your own or from existing source materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
