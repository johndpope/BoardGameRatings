			<description>Publisher's blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you help Cherp get across the roadway and river?  He has to dodge trucks and cars to get to the center.  Then help him get across the river.  He can jump floating logs and turtles to get across.  Watch out for gators - they love crickets for lunch.  How many times can you get across?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a challenging game with a cast of characters you will love and hate.  All you have to do is get Cherp from one side of the road to the river and then across the river.  Not so fast though.  First you have to figure out how to dodge the traffic and get to the center.  Then how are you going to get across the river?  Look, here comes a log - even a turtle.  Hitch a ride across the river and jump from one to the other.  Keep a sharp eye out for Ade the Gator.  He loves to have crickets for lunch.  How many times can you get across the road and river?  You will have to work as fast as you can.  Time limit and bonus.  You will find this game addictive and challenging and it will entertain you with hours of fun and enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
