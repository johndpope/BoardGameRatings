							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Battle of Kuortane</name>
									
			<description>A free print-and-play, regimental-level wargame covering the battles of Ruona and Salmi, 1808 (sometimes known collectively as the battle of Kuortane). These battles were the turning point of the Finnish War of 1808-1809 which would lead to Finland being annexed to Russia for over 100 years. Can you change history?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Battle of Kuortane is a classical IGO-UGO wargame with an innovative system for melee attacks and defensive fire, to better capture the feeling of the chaotic bayonet charges of the Finnish War. The game features assymetric goals and reinforcement rules which create different playstyles for the Russian and the Swedish-Finnish armies: whereas the Russian player needs to advance carefully but with a determined pace, the Swedish player needs to wait for the perfect moment to pounce with maximum strength to claim victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is offered as a print-and-play of only two pages: one page for the rules, and one page to mount on cardboard and cut out. No advanced crafting required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
