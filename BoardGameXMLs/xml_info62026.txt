			<description>From the Publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crestfallen is a game of imagination and challenge. A fantasy roleplaying game set in a world with unique races, all involved in a long and colourful mythology and history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crestfallen is set on a planet called Kerun, the most important continent is named Rivanon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though a green and fertile land, Kerun has low metal resources, especially iron. Kerun is a primitive planet, some races and cultures are still living in the stone age, most in the bronze age (c. 500 BC), and a special few are rumoured to be learning the secrets of iron working. ÓÅíe whole purpose of Crestfallen is to evoke a rich atmosphere of primitiveness, raw wilderness, suspicion, fear of the gods, even fear of the next village. But especially fear of hunger and disease. Mighty lords squabble over swine feeding rights, and farmers gaze apprehensively into the darkening sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
