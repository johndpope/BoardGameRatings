			<description>A set-collecting card game with auctioned turn order, based on characters and situations from Project Shrine Maiden, a series of amateur shooting games for Windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gensokyo ritual comes in independent two-deck packages, which all can be played separately with 2&amp;ndash;4 players or together with more players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players are dealt a number of &amp;quot;liquor&amp;quot; cards. Each turn, a number of character cards and event cards are drawn and revealed, and the turn order is auctioned out using these liquor cards. Players then gain one character card of their choice from the ones displayed and may also try to complete any of the face up event cards. The Event are the cards that are worth victory points, and in order to gain them, the player must discard the number of character cards mentioned on the event card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As there never is any hand renewal of the liquor cards, they must be use wisely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
