			<description>A anti-semitic variant of Monopoly, self-published in 1997 in Germany by the neo-Nazis Beate Zsch&amp;auml;pe, Uwe Mundlos and Uwe B&amp;ouml;hnhardt, who later formed the underground terrorist group &amp;quot;NSU&amp;quot;. Several copies were discovered in Zsch&amp;auml;pe's garage in the course of a razzia against neo-Nazi activists in the city of Jena on January 28, 1998. According to newspaper articles referring to an official secret service report, it was sold by Andr&amp;eacute; Kapke to fellow neo-Nazis as a solidary fundraising for 100 German Marks after the trio's disappearance into illegality. Kapke, however, diverted those funds. In the framework of the NSU trial, the game is used by the prosecution as proof for Zsch&amp;auml;pe's political committment and her alleged active involvement in the murder of 9 immigrants and 1 police officer, as well as other capital crimes supposedly carried out by the NSU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; cities (the &amp;quot;streets&amp;quot; in Monopoly) of Jews. Instead of 4 railroads, there are 4 different concentration camps. There are fields for SS and SA (chance and community chest), gasworks (waterworks), and a field depicting Hitler. A couple of dozens of copies are said to exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
