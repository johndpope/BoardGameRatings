			<description>From the publisher's website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VillageWorks (first released in 2003) is the world's first truly modular village construction kit. You don't simply get a few buildings; you get the building blocks to create literally 100's of unique &amp;quot;Hollywood Flats&amp;quot; style (no interiors) building designs in ONE PACKAGE and at one low price. Simply mix and match a variety of bases, second floors, roof designs and building modifiers to create a building of any shape and as large or as small as your heart desires. Create towering multi-storied buildings, sprawling estates, small hovels, long house, mystic guilds, shops, generic homes, mills, farms, bakers, churches... the list goes on and on. The only limit to the amount of buildings you can create is your imagination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you've created your buildings add one of twenty different generic, swappable signs to further customize your dream structure. To further enhance your dream village WorldWorks has included a vast selection of village props, various ground tiles and building modifiers that can be used in countless ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this set is WorldWorks unique and highly functional &amp;quot;Masterboard TM&amp;quot;.
