			<description>Box Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All new graphics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Nine different position players were motion captured for unprecedented realism. All-Pro motion capture athletes include RB Mike Alstott, LB Chad Brow, CD Jason Sehron and QB Ryan Leaf. Every subtle and personalized mover of the NFL is recreated in lifelike detail. See wrap tackles from every angle, defenders standing at the line of scrimmage faking a blitz and more! Revolutionary Stadium Models with all the unique landmarks and backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revolutionary TV style presentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-World Famous Dick Enberg provides the play-by-play and Super Bowl XX MVP/Football Guru Phil Simms covers the color commentary. Beautiful Stadium Fly-Ins, Zoom-Ins and Cut Aways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New authentic football intelligence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Super Bowl XXXII MVP Terell Davis and Pro Bowl LB Hardy Nickerson help recreate the most realistic NFL opponent ever bases on the latest offensive and defensive schemes. The defense will disguise its coverage, audibilize to bump and run coverage out of a zone and execute line shifts to stuff your run tendencies. The offense will read and react to the defensive fronts, put men in motion, throw lob passes over tight man coverage and fire ball under soft zone coverages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unprecedented gameplay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Feel the contact with the Dual Shock controller.
