			<description>From the introduction of the rules set:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;The Maori Wars (called at the time te riri pakeha) were fought between the native people of the New Zealand and British/Colonial troops in the 1840s and 1860s. Being skilled natural engineers, and determined to reclaim their lands, the Maoris constructed forts called 'pahs' (or pas) on disputed territory and dared white men (pakehas) to attack. The British and Colonial troops seemed only too happy to oblige and, when enough losses had been inflicted to satisfy utu ('revenge' or 'payment'), the Maoris simply evacuated their trenches and rifle-pits. The conflict was also marked (later) by some guerrilla fighting, but its main feature was the defence and reduction of these ingenious native forts.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, the game is organized as a skirmish around the taking/defending of a &amp;quot;native&amp;quot; fort of the defending player's design. System uses d6 and d12 for various checks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each figure represents one man. Rules were written to support 25mm figures, but can be adapted to different scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simple system does include rules for Morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rules set appear in Wargames Illustrated #63 (December 1992)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
