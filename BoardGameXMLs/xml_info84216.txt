							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Covert Teamwork</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a team works well together, when they are firing on all cylinders, when the plans come together seamlessly, the formerly impossible becomes all too easy. Corporate takeovers, legendary scams, the kind of small unit military victories that would leave Sun Tzu scratching his head in bewilderment..... put enough planning in and they can all be yours. The small unit tactics presented in this sourcebook are effectively feats. Like feats, these tactics have prerequisites and offer new capabilities to any unit trained in their use. Unlike personal feats, no one person on the team has spent a feat slot purchasing the new capability, nor does any one person have to meet the prerequisite. Instead, the entire team works together to meet the prerequisites, and spends action points in unison to activate their new combat abilities. This 11 page PDF is just the sort of thing needed for GMs to add depth to any great d20 Modern campaign world, including Haven: Full Metal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
