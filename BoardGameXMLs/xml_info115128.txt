							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Amigos and Insurrectos: The Philippine Insurrection 1899-1902</name>
									
			<description>Following Dewey's naval victory, US Officials negotiated with Spain over the surrender of the Philippine capital, Manila, while simultaneously negotiating Filipino independence with Aguinaldo. When US forces occupied Manila, Aguanildo's own larger, and initially better armed veteran force squared off with McKinley's expeditionary force. There followed four years of &amp;quot;official hostilities&amp;quot; (Guerrilla activities dragged on for more than a decade after McKinley declared end to the war). Hostilities raged across the central island of Luzon and several other major island. After Aguinaldo's capture, his regular forces melted into the bush and US troops faced its first major guerrilla war in the Pacific. As with later foreign adventures, it was not a popular war at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amigos and Insurrectos is an area movement game for two players (a US and a Filipino player). Three scenarios will be offered: an eight turn - STAND UP FIGHT, represents the clash of regular forces; an eight turn - INTO THE BUSH, representing the guerrilla phase of the conflict, and a 15 turn CAMPAIGN GAME, combining both. Regular forces will be represented on the regimental level. Abstract jungle movement will be available through guerrilla movement boxes and movement between islands will be possible though trans-island boxes. Originally designed as a Card-Driven game, random historical events will occur based on objective and turn based triggers. Victory will be based on a point swing track that in the extreme, could see Filipino collapse or US withdrawal. This is a topic shown very little attention in the gaming hobby. Luckily, Olivier has seen fit to feature it in the upcoming issue #11 of BATTLES MAGAZINE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
