							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">THOGS - Hunters for the golden Sirbul</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;THOGS - Hunters for the golden Sirbul is an independent, simulationistic fantasy RPG by Ilmari Virtanen based on it's totally own fantasy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THOGS was not designed in an instant, it has been developed since 1989 and has now evolved to it's third version (v3). One prominent feauture of THOGS is the strange and funny names of creatures, that have been a trademark of the game from the beginning. In v2 all the remaining regular names had been changed to suit the world of THOGS. But do not let the names prevent you from enjoying the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VERSION 3&lt;br/&gt;THOGS version 3 returns to it's roots, so all the information is back inside the same covers. So THOGS v3 includes everything from the v2 world book as well. In v3 the rules are same as before, but the descriptions of player character races have been built up. All the races have now official appearance descriptions, preferred professions and age. The skill system taking into account the racial features is established. The magic system has been widened to include subtypes and combinations of elemental magic and over 40 new spells are introduced. The use of weapons is now more free, you just need a combination of strength and hands to use a certain weapon. The professions, special skills and personalities have also been revised. Overall the outlook of book has been improved for better readability and ease of us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
