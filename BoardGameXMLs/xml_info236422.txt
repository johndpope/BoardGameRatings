With this Hero Pack, you now have the possibility to introduce a new, powerful character into your campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes, heroes are shadowy figures dabbling in the dark arts or renegades from their kin... Born into a family of powerful wizards, descendants of Avalon, Onamor can be played as either a Chaotic Necromancer or a Lawful Summoner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Necromancer, Onamor grew up alone, with arcane tomes his only company.

That day, Onamor sworn to spend his life dominating and banishing demons, using them as a weapon against other supernatural entities, because only a demon can inflict anger and pain to another demon...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
