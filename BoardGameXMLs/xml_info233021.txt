			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1863, America was caught up in a civil war. The war would have lasted 2 more years had the grand gate not opened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Battle of Gettysburg, a gate opened. Both sides were convinced this was an attack from the other side, however when they finally realized they were both firing upon the same target, the gunfire ceased. During the confusion, the gate opened and the strange beasts and creatures came forth. Very few soldiers in Gettysburg survived, and the civil war began to erupt into confusion and disarray. The event was labelled as &amp;ldquo;The Gate of Gettysburg&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USA as it is now in 2020 refuses to release information on the process. From the 1800s up until the early 1900s, the USA had racial tensions between various countries and the races which entered through the gate such as Elves, Orcs, and Dwarves. By the mid-2000s, the USA has evolved into the Empire of America (EOA), the geography remains mostly the same save that Florida and some of the area around the border to Mexico is now in the Republic of Mexico&amp;rsquo;s control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
