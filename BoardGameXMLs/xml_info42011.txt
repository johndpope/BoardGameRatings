							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Das Jubil채umsspiel 1200 Jahre M체nster</name>
									
			<description>Trivia game on the occasion of the 1200th birthday of the city of M&amp;uuml;nster/Westfalia in Germany coupled with the occasions of the 300th birthday of Johann Conrad Schlaunn, the 200th birthday of Annette von Droste-H&amp;uuml;lshoff and the 350 years of Westfalian Peace. The game was published by an insurance company for that occasion.&lt;br/&gt;The game comes with a board which has two different prints on both sides several colour coded memory cards depicting events of the city history, pawns, dice and a rule book.&lt;br/&gt;The game allows for four different variations. Two of them are roll and move while the other two require knowledge of the city history.&lt;br/&gt;Variant 1: The players alternate in rolling dice. If they can exactly move their pawn on a field featuring the same colour as the topmost of the cards they can gain it. Whoever has the most at the games end wins.&lt;br/&gt;Variant 2: A team game. Two players each play together. Unlike variant 1 it is only allowed to move one space. The rules for collecting are the same. One team wins if they have six of a colour.&lt;br/&gt;Variant 3: Like variant 2 but you only get the card if you can answer the question printed on the backside.&lt;br/&gt;Variant 4: Not really a competitive game. On the backside of the board are squares to hold each memory card. The cards are randomly shuffled into the squares and the players alternate in trying to put the right card into the right square until all cards are sorted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
