			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It had been a long trip and as Richard approached the Laughing Frog Pub he couldn't wait to grab a pint and wash the dirt from his throat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entering the pub and looking around, Richard&amp;rsquo;s eyes settled on the well-stocked bar with all of its neatly lined-up bottles located on the back wall. Smiling, Richard walked up to the bar and began contemplating what he wanted to slake his thirst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
