							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Close Call</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close Call is designed to be a starting Episode for a full Season of play for Dark Aeons: The Atlantean Chronicles, or it can be a standalone Episode. The Dark Aeons core book is all that is required to use this Episode; however it should be noted that the upcoming Arkham: City of Secrets setting book will expand on the Arkham setting in much greater detail than is presented here. It should also be noted that this Episode is designed to be used with a Cast of Revenants, Thralls, and Dhampir Personas. As such, we have provided a set of pre-made Persona Sheets for this Episode in order for a Director to simply pick this Episode up and run it straight from the presented material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
