			<description>A quick 2-card gambling game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played with a standard deck of cards (without Jokers), divided into two deck -- one red and one black.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn starts with a one coin ante, then each player is dealt one card from each deck, so that each player has one red and one black card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simultaneously each player reveals one card -- either red or black.  Then the player with the lowest card showing decides either to drop out or to force a showdown. Since it goes from lowest to highest, not every player will have the opportunity to drop out before the showdown occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the showdown occurs, everyone shows both of their cards.  The player with the highest black card wins.  Everyone else (except for those who dropped out) then pay the winning player a number of coins equal to the value of the red card (aces are worth 1 coin, and face cards are worth 10 coins). The winner also gets the antes.  If there is no showdown, the surviving player gets the antes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is part of the Cheapass Games Poker Suite that was released on the Cheapass website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
