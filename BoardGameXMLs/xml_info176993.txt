							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Thieves&#039; Cant Dictionary</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thieves&amp;rsquo; Cant is one of the most storied secret languages in history. The English Language version originated in the 16th century and was a mix of Romany, Irish, and Cockney Rhyming Slang. Several &amp;ldquo;dictionaries&amp;rdquo; of the language were released, each one purporting to reveal the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; Thieves&amp;rsquo; Cant, but a full representation of the language was never written down&amp;hellip;until now!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just kidding, this dictionary should serve as a play-aid for your PC and NPC thieves, rogues, and ne&amp;rsquo;er-do-wells as they make their way through the criminal underbelly of the fantasy world. Most of the terms here are taken directly from historical records of Thieves&amp;rsquo; Cant, though some have been modified to reflect fantastic worlds, or to remove specific regional references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are there so many words for &amp;ldquo;sheep&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll note a lot of words in here for animals and everyday objects. There&amp;rsquo;s a simple reason for this &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s what thieves stole. Pickpockets focused on items that came out of pockets, naturally, and livestock was one of the simplest cash items whose provenance was hard to determine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So let your criminal-minded characters pepper their speech with some true slang of the streets! And get your clouts to Uncle before the Scout gives you bracelets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
