							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Tell Me a Story: Animal Village</name>
									
			<description>Join the animals in this village as they dance, sing, and play. Recurring characters, locations and props encourage linking the cards in endless combinations for fresh, new stories every time it&amp;rsquo;s played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variations for gameplay exist, but the basic elements that apply to all are: players are dealt an opening hand of cards. Cards consist of characters, objects, locations. Gameplay consists of some combination of trade/discard/draw from deck in order to complete one's collection with the required elements for the story. The first player to complete his or her story hand of cards, then &amp;quot;tell&amp;quot; the story - wins!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
