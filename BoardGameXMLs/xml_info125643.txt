							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">London: The Board Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a game developed with The Museum of London which takes 2-6 players around a timeline of 2000 years of London's history. It starts with the Romans and ends with The Olympics.&lt;br/&gt;Players throw dice to visit landmarks in the city and each landmark gives the opportunity to collect cards featuring famous people and events. These in turn drive the movement along the time track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
