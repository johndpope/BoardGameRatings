			<description>Author's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hive, The Metropolis, The Mega-City...estimates put the population at almost half a billion, but no one really knows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past, before the Corporate Wars, there were governments, nations, and armies. There were concepts like democracy and freedom...and citizen's rights. But even those things are an uncertainty under the tainted clouds of acid rain and within the barrier walls protecting the cities from the irradiated wastelands that cover 90% of the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing that's certain is that crime is everywhere, and there aren't enough peacekeepers to keep things under control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peacekeepers come in three varieties...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Private security. Well equipped and well paid, but often disturb the peace more than they keep it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vigilantes. Dedicated and dangerous, but often unable to move beyond their focus on a single cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agents of the Law. Outnumbered, but not necessarily outgunned. The ultimate symbols of the justice in the city, but sometimes that justice is obscured in shades of grey. It's their stories we follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Law is a roleplaying game by Vulpinoid Studios and uses the latest evolution of a system that began in the FUBAR roleplaying game. Characters creation is a fast process designed to quickly get players into the action, and storytelling involves a fun game mechanisms where players roll two or more dice then choose which of them indicates their degree of success, and which indicates any sacrifices made in the attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole game is designed in comic book format, illustration heavy, and filled with icons and accessible terms to make it aproachable for new roleplayers and those who are veterans of other systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
