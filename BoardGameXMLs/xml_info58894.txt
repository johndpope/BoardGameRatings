							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Stormhaven: City of a Thousand Seas</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Among the mysteries of the sea, Stormhaven stands proud and defiant, a city built upon the relic of an unknown civilisation. Four great pillars support a disk of preternatural stone, its architects an enigma as great as the means of its construction. The new inhabitants settled centuries ago, giving the city its current name because the solidity and endurance it offers against the surrounding ocean is undeniable. Settlers erected their own dwellings on top of the disk and, when they crowded it too much, engineered a floating city latched to the four pillars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magic is the lifeblood of Stormhaven, coursing through its very foundations and making life comfortable away from the shores of any nation. Its staunch neutrality ensures that the riches keep flowing, making Stormhaven into a monument to unfettered greed and hunger for power. It is the destination of choice for the most ruthless merchants, crime lords and politicians, where a silver tongue, quick wit and a fast blade are invaluable commodities, both on the lowly docks and the glittering palaces. Any adventurer with the right combination of ingenuity, strength and daring will find that Stormhaven embraces him like a lover and that no dream of wealth, no matter how extravagant, is beyond his grasp.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
