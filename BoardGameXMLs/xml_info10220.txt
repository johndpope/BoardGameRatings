							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">Die Ketchup-Vampire</name>
									
			<description>Simple children's board game in which the so called Die Ketchup Vampiere struggle against the evil &amp;quot;Blutwurst Vampiere&amp;quot; to regain the lost book from the woods in the centre of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every player draws a card which either shows a garlic or a tomato. The player has to guess what of these two it will be. If he guessed right he may move his vampire according to the number printed on the card. If he guessed wrong he must move one of the two Blutwurst-Vampiere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both parties race towards the forest in the center of the board, where the lost book is hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
