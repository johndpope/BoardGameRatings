			<description>Board &amp;amp; Pieces&lt;br/&gt;T4 is played between two opponents on a 4x4 square board.&lt;br/&gt;Each player has 16 units of 3 different kinds of pieces, 48 pieces in total. No pieces are placed on the board when the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movements&lt;br/&gt;Players take the following 2 actions in one turn:&lt;br/&gt;    Take one of his/her pieces from outside the board and place it at an empty square on the board, then,&lt;br/&gt;    Move a piece or a set of pieces from one square to another on the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces can be placed at any empty squares or at already-occupied squares in condition that already-placed pieces are different kind(s) from the one that is going to be placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accordingly, how pieces are placed at a square are 7 different ways as follows: 3 different single pieces and 4 different combination (sets) of pieces. ã€€&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After placing a piece on the board, players move a piece or a set of pieces from a square to another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can choose to move either a single piece or a set of pieces together, but cannot move a single piece out of a set of pieces from a square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pieces are moved as Queen in Chess: They can be moved any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jumping over other pieces or moving to an already-occupied square is not allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal&lt;br/&gt;The player who succeeds in placing 3 respective (single) pieces or set of pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player loses when he/she cannot move his/her piece(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who places 4 respective pieces or combination of pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row loses the game.(This rarely happens.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
