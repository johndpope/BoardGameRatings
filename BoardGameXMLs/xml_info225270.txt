			<description>菊花賽 (Kikkasai) is a two-player dice game from Japan that derives a lot from Riichi Mahjong, the Japanese version of Mahjong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name is a pun on the phononym 菊花祭 (Kikkasai), a flower festival where exhibitors show off their prize blooms. 菊 (Kiku) is a popular and lucky formal flower (花 hana, ka) in Japan, and 祭 (sai or matsuri) is a festival. Many flower farmers strive for a better Kiku. There are flower festivals where you can find and buy many flowers, and so a festival focused on Kiku is 菊花祭, especially with plants shown in competition. But 賽 (sai) is dice, so 菊花賽 is also Kikkasai, making a Flower Festival Dice game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game follows the style of Mahjong, drawing dice from a bag, rolling, discarding, trying to complete sets. In this game, you only handle 2 + 1 dice, so your target is to create one single set. Many of the rules match Mahjong; draw 1 discard 1, claiming the dice your opponent discards, or the rule of &amp;quot;trend&amp;quot; which gives you extra points (like the Dora rule in Mahjong).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initially, one die is placed as the &amp;quot;trend&amp;quot;. You get extra points for winning a hand by using a same colored die / same pip with the trend die. Then each player grabs 2 dice from the bag and rolls behind their screen. These dice are the players' hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn, if you can use the last die discarded by your opponent to complete your set, you declare and win the round. If not, you grab a die from the bag and roll. If the 3 dice (2 in your hand and 1 just rolled) completes your hand, you win the round and score points. If not, you must discard 1 die, either from your hand, or the rolled one. Be careful not to toss out a die your opponent wants. Now the turn switches to your opponent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The round ends when any player wins, or the bag is out of dice. Put all the dice back in the bag. If any player has 0 points or less, that player loses. Or else, start a new round, switching the starting player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publisher says:&lt;br/&gt;A 2 player game of dice-Mahjong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game takes place in the Finals of a Flower show competition for prize Chrysanthemum. You aim for the victory by completing your set of Chrysanthemum dice. Both players start from 6 points, and you win by depleting your opponents' points to 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic game set is for 2, but combining 2 sets would allow you to play by 3 or 4 players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publisher's summary&lt;br/&gt;２人用のダイス麻雀ゲームです。&lt;br/&gt;舞台は菊の品評会の決勝戦。&lt;br/&gt;３つの菊ダイスを揃えて優勝を目指します。&lt;br/&gt;６ポイントずつ持ってスタートし、相手のポイントを０にすると勝ちです。&lt;br/&gt;※基本２人用ですが、２セットあると３人プレイ、４人プレイをすることができます。&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
