			<description>Publisher Blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a modern list of 100 different things, with some variations, that could be found by players in a safe deposit box in a bank, whether they are robbing it, looting it or simply looking for evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of these items are valuable in themselves, if sold. Some may have merely sentimental value. Others may be evidence of criminal activity, or be illegal or compromising to the box's owner if discovered, and could be used as leverage against them&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a sample result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;75. Numismatic Coins (Valuable due to age, scarcity or errors and condition, not just the material although they may be gold or silver, possibly 'slabbed' where they are sealed in a transparent plastic holder)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
