							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rugged Kingdom</name>
									
			<description>Rugged Kingdom tells the tale of an adventurer drifting through life, never knowing where he came from or who he really is. With the sudden disappearance of all of the world's heroes, the world begins to fall into shadow. Now our unlikely hero stands as the last hope to overcome the great evil. Can he obtain the courage to dispel the great evil, and in doing so find out who he is? Or will he fail, and see the world he loved descend into chaos?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world of the Rugged Kingdom compromises a variety of landscapes, each inhabited by different races, human, elf, dwarf, and orc. As you play through the game and travel to the various locations, you will see the differences in terrain and architecture favoured by the different races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
