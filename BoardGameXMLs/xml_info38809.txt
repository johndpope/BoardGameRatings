							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Sleepy Hollow</name>
									
			<description>Just outside the limits of the Dutch settlement of Tarrytown, New York, an old Church stands in view of a burying ground surrounded by humble homes, a school and a covered bridge. The year is 1792, and only a decade earlier this secluded glen was the scene of a grisly battle during the American Revolution where a Hessian soldier lost his head to a stray cannonball. Since that fateful day the residents of Sleepy Hollow live in fear of nightfall when the Headless Horseman returns and &amp;lsquo;rides forth to the scene of battle in a nightly quest of his head.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sleepy Hollow is based on the legendary tale of Sleepy Hollow as penned by Washington Irving in 1820. During the game players control residents of Sleepy Hollow, recently shaken by the disappearance of Ichabod Crane, now living in fear that the Headless Horseman will come for them.  Game play is divided into the 10 days leading up to All Hallows Eve, each separated into day and night. During the day, the residents move freely about the glen, finding a safe place to hide before nightfall. At night, the Horseman makes rounds in the village killing residents where they hide. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Each building gives players distinct benefits, but also distinct criterion dictating who is killed if targeted by the Horseman. Sometimes it is wisest to risk leaving yourself exposed, other times it is safer to stay hidden. By the time the sun rises on All Hallows Day, the player with the most points and fewest fatalities wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
