			<description>Kuddelmuddel - wie bei Hempels unterm Sofa&lt;br/&gt;(german pun, means roughly translated chaos in the living room)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the box back: Chaos is nice, chaos is fun. At least family Hempel thinks that. But who looks for something in the mess sweats...The colour die and the sample card show, which kind of thing has to be found in this mess. The players look up their cards quickly to find what is missing and who finds the most gets many things from the living room to his/her victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: rulebook, 12 sample cards, 4 * 12 picture cards, colour die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gameplay: The cards are sorted into piles. 1 pile = sample cards. Then 4 piles which different card backs picture cards. Each child picks one picture card pile, means they have 12 cards now. Each sample card shows 6 pictures with a different coloured frame (example: boat, book, cup, telephone, plane, whale). The die is rolled. The colour rolled is the picture or the thing that the people are looking for. The first child playing his/her card with matching picture wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
