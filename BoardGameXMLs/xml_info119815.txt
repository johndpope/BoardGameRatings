							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Adventure Toolkit: Organizations Book 2 â€“ Amethyst Legion</name>
									
			<description>From Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About a century ago Lord Trespass fought a war against the agiat (see pg. XX) in Skanda Harbor. As the war progressed the agiat retreated to the Bronze Wall, near the Amethyst Gate. There they took root, fortifying themselves in the lush vegetation that grows from water pouring down the metal face of the wall. Trespass studied his military history, so he marshaled his forces and struck at the center of the agiat lines hoping to separate their force into two groups then destroy them piecemeal. The Fifth Legion led his drive to the Bronze Wall. The spearhead thrust turned into a catastrophic failure. Suffering from a constant string of losses, the agiat had replaced their commander with a bright young officer. He wouldn&amp;rsquo;t survive the war (Trespass hunted him down and had him killed) but he saw his position and knew his enemy. When the Fifth Legion drove he gave way. When the third and parts of the fourth legion followed into the open gap he collapsed his wings. Trespass withdrew the third and fourth legions as quickly as possible but that left the Fifth in the midst of the enemy with the Bronze Wall at their backs. With nowhere to go they dug in and sent a force into the Amethyst Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
