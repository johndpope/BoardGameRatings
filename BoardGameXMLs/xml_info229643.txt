			<description>user summary:&lt;br/&gt;A fan-produced sourcebook on necromancy in  WFRP2.  Part of Liber Fanatica's Necromancy Project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;from the Foreword:&lt;br/&gt;This supplement for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay is written primarily for the GM and is intended to enhance their use of the followers of Nagash and the plague of undeath that his vile acts have inflicted upon the Old World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This booklet details the origins of Alchemy as discovered by the Mortuary Cult priests of ancient Nehekhara and the advent of Necromancy as developed by the Great Necromancer himself. Petty and Lesser spells are described within that were used by the Mortuary Cult long ago, as well as those discovered by Nagash as he delved into the practice of Blood Magic. The full Lore of Nagash is presented, complete with Petty, Lesser, and Ritual spells. An alternative Nagash's Curse Chart provides necromantic flavor for spell-casting mishaps, and a Bestiary of over 10 Undead is also included. Lastly, two new Career Paths for the followers of Nagash round off this supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
