							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Ruined Castle</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atop a small hill, partially hidden by trees lie the remains of a small castle. Most of its walls and towers have entirely disappeared over the course of the years and today the foundations and part of the walls of the castle's keep are all that remains. And even those contain almost more holes than stones as many of the heavy blocks got carried off over the years to serve as building material in other structures. Still the walls provide a minimum of protection for the weary traveller looking for a camp site and probably not all mysteries surrounding the castles fall have been solved yet. Some mysteries might indeed still lie buried under the grass slowly growing over the castles remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
