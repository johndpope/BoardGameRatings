							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Downfall (2015)</name>
									
			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Our home is breaking, and we have no one to blame but ourselves. We built a flawed society, and soon it will destroy itself.&lt;br/&gt;        Though most of us can't perceive the coming doom, a Hero arises to fight against the impending collapse.&lt;br/&gt;        Downfall is the story of how we try to save our society and ourselves, and fail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downfall is a collaborative role-playing game for 3 people. The game takes 2-4 hours to play. During play we'll create a fictional society together, then play out its destruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of the game is to find out how our society collapses and to make its downfall tragic, beautiful, and meaningful. Together we'll create a rich world, play characters struggling amidst the growing chaos, and witness the self-destruction of our home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is designed to be played from scratch. You don't need to prepare any plot or character materials beforehand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
