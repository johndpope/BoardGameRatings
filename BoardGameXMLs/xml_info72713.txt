			<description>WorldWorks is proud to bring you CastleWorks Ultimate. The ultimate, open ended castle creation toolset currently available on the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Design, Legendary Detail&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing you can count on with each and every WorldWorks product is our commitment to provide you with professional texture work and production design. Each texture in CastleWorks Ultimate has been painstakingly crafted from scratch and marks a new benchmark in realism for RPG models. Every detail is considered from the smallest nail to how a section of wood or stone might age and wear from weathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CastleWorks Ultimate is perfectly scaled to accommodate both 1-inch &amp;amp; 1.5-inch miniatures. Many items have dual formats to make them cross compatible with both base sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Modularity/Inside &amp;amp; Out&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design literally any style of castle as large or as small as you can imagine! From Keep to Palace, the straight and curved wall sections combine with modular towers to perfectly match your vision. Add hot-swappable crenellations or hoardings wherever you need them most, simply drop them on your wall sections and you&amp;rsquo;re ready for battle. Build double or triple high wall sections and access them with stone staircases or a complex network of ladders and catwalks. And these models aren&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;pretty&amp;rdquo; to look at on the outside either; each tower section opens up to reveal fully detailed interiors with removable flooring. Build your towers as short or as tall as you desire! Finish your curtain walls off with a FULLY FUNCTIONING Gatehouse that will surprise and mystify your players!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Courtyard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CastleWorks Ultimate also includes the most modular courtyard buildings ever devised. With exquisite exterior and interior detail in both brick and whitewash, these room modules can be stacked high or joined together to create massive superstructures or small hovels. Choose between three different roof varieties or decorate with dozens of windows, doors, signs and flag designs. With these elements alone you could potentially create an entire village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Stability and Strength&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With WorldWorks exclusive PaperLinX system you can hold your castle tightly together. A unique system of tabs holds each and every floor tile and wall section firmly in place. For users of our classic Masterboard system we have also included this standard. We also show you the basics behind a technique known as &amp;ldquo;Basing&amp;rdquo;. We&amp;rsquo;ll take you step-by-step and show you how to strengthen and secure your models so that they&amp;rsquo;ll last as long as any plastercast alternative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately Clarity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combined with fully photographed step-by-step instruction for every model, we take you by the hand and make the building process clear and simple for all skill levels. Not only that but many of the models in CastleWorks Ultimate have been created in two or three unique formats to suit all skill levels: simple, moderate and complex. Crenelations, Towers, gatehouse and other items can be constructed as easy or as complex as you feel comfortable with. Make a batch of simple towers or crenelations in no time flat, or if you prefer deck them out in their full 3-D glory!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimate Interaction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Join us in the WorldWorks community forums for your chance to get involved in an immediate follow-up release to CastleWorks Ultimate.
