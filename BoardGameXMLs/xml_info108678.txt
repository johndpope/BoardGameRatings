							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Eyegore&#039;s Eye Blast</name>
									
			<description>Sick and tired of matching jewels and gems? Daydreaming about flinging eyeballs from a rusty cannon? Meet Eyegore. He needs your help to sort his eyeball collection, so he can get back to his evil plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exciting new action puzzle game from the creators of Sneezies brings a whole new spin to a beloved genre. Fire the multi colored eyeballs from Eyegore's cannon into the swinging, spinning clump of eyes he's strung up in his lair. Match 3 or more eyes of the same color to clear them, and try to remove them all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game was designed specifically for the iPhone and iPod Touch, allowing smooth and natural tilting controls to influence the swinging of the eyeballs, so you can always find the best possible shots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With beautiful hand drawn graphics throughout, crazy sounds and music, and endless replay value, Eyegore's Eye Blast will give hours of fun. There are 3 difficulty settings for the main game, and 30 additional puzzle stages to play through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: The Developer Website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
