			<description>In a far away land, magical beings roam the Enchanted Paths &amp;mdash; a fire-breathing dragon and a pure unicorn, a wise wizard and a brave knight, a cackling witch and a beautiful princess... Help the fairytale characters find their way to each other. Fold the game board to connect creatures and items. In order to win, you have to be the first to complete the task, so hurry up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Enchanted Paths board game each player receives a special magical game board, which can be folded in 24 different ways. The goal of the game is to fold your game board correctly, and complete the task faster than the other players. The tasks differ in complexity. There are 90 challenge cards in the game: 30 easy challenges and 60 difficult challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge cards show the number of game characters that need to be seen (or connected by paths) on a game board. In order to complete an easy task, a player needs to fold the game board in such a way, that the required number of creatures or items can be seen on one side of the board. The difficult challenge requires the game characters to not only to be seen on one side of the game board, but also to be connected by paths. The first player to complete the task correctly receives a card, as a reward. The game ends as soon as one player collects 5 cards with competed tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play the game on both levels of difficulty with your friends or alone. Change the magical world of Enchanted Paths as you please, and help the fairytale characters meet. Set new records, and have lots of fun with this fantastic board game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
