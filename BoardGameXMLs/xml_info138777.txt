							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Squirrels Fun House: Lost and Drunk</name>
									
			<description>Squirrel goes out for a few drinks with his friends and ends up getting smashed. When he goes to walk home, he finds himself in a hallucinated alcoholic wonderland!  &lt;br/&gt;     The objective in this game is to be the first one to get Squirrel home. Sounds easy enough, but the twisted trail loaded with booby traps and treasures, along with the drinking challenge, creates a great board game for all drinking game fans.&lt;br/&gt;     First pick a starter. The game comes with some creative ideas for this. Then everybody rolls one dice and moves along the trail accordingly. The trail is filled with short cuts filled with Jail spots. When a player lands in Jail, they must finish their drink before returning to gameplay. On the main yellow trail, players are likely to land on the Golden Acorns. Landing here means the player gets bonus turns by guessing high, low, odd, or even, based on their previous roll, and they keep going untill they guess wrong. Simply follow the yellow trail and everybody will make it to the finish, but the twisted trail makes this an interesting tricky challenge. Luckily the game comes with a map that will show you the way. The game also comes with sober cab rules so everybody can play. If you are a power hour fan, you will definately like the drinking challenge built into this game. The challenge is that every time you land on a &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; Spot, you must take the number of drinks that you rolled to get there. Over all, This is a unique and simple drinking board game that anyone over 21 can easily learn, and start the challenge of being the first player to get Squirrel home alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
