			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players will take turns guiding a third party character through a scenario. Each player will have their own motives as to what outcome they wish for the character or his/her actions. They will be asked to creatively use elements other players have contributed in advance into story telling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During early development this game was titled A Better Place; this title was removed (but not replaced) during Stage Two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
