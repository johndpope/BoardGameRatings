			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;Take a role-playing game, destroy all sense of setting and boundaries of reality, mix in a fair amount of foul language, shake in a smattering of puzzles and what do you get...? As off-kilter beer and pretzel game as there ever was!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will you play the part of the noble housewife, finally at wits end? Or maybe you'll be a disgruntled defense contractor who just wants to eat from the breakfast menu? Who knows - character generation is random!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One thing's for sure - your character is going to go nuts, and they're going to take everyone with them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
