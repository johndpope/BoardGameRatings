			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characters' travel leads them to Maple Grove, a very small village built at the edge of a magnificent forest. However, the daily routine of the villagers has been seriously disturbed recently. The neighboring lumberjacks from Old Lonely Oak have not visited Maple Grove for trade since two weeks, which is quite unusual. Moreover, at least three groups travelling along Green Sprite Trail, the road leading to this thorp, haven't been heard of again. They have simply disappeared, swallowed whole by the green expanse...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gnolls have been spotted in the forest, but are they the true menace? Only some brave adventurers can solve this mystery!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 7th - 9th level characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
