			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Servant of the Sun-Eater&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhan Gaar was an astronomer on the Freespace world of Suul. When he discovered Secundus approaching his home world, he contacted the Sun-Eater and pleaded for him to change his mind. He agreed to spare Suul in exchange for Rhan's service in finding stars appropriate for Secundus to consume. Rhan would be an advocate for Secundus; allowing the planets to evacuate before their star was destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Persuaded by Pendragon to turn against his master, the Outrider was banished from the Sun-Eater&amp;rsquo;s presence. No longer would Secundus be held to any mortal&amp;rsquo;s restrictions of what stars he would consume!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determined to make amends to every race he has harmed, the Outrider (PL 14) now travels the Milky Way Galaxy in search of displaced races and tries to find a new home for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super Powered Legends. Because sometimes what you need is a character everyone will recognize, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never met her before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
