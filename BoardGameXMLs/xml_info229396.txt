							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Whispers of the Dead: Undead Do Tell Tales</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whispers of the Dead: Undead Do Tell Tales is a collection of 7 undead defined less by their powers than by the story of how they came to be. These undead bring color to your world by providing the party with a narrative in the form of enemies and NPCs different than common zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expect the creatures in the document to hint to players what sorts of bad things happened before they were here, as well as provide clues of what is going on, while not being as exploitable as mortal sources of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
