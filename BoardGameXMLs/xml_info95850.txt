			<description>Designer / Publisher blurb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion brings you a comprehensive list of Artifacts and Relics that you might find during your Quests. It is meant to expand and replace the Artifacts and Relics list found in the Core Rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although we presented you with a short list of Artifacts and Relics in the Core Rules, there is obviously more room for expansion. Much more room, in fact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This expansion therefore gives you a much more varied list of enchanted items that your Hero may find during a Quest. With items such as the Sword of the Stars, Fireseeds and the powerful Infinity Amulet, your Hero has never been better equipped to face the dangers of Arax!&lt;br/&gt; This expansion requires the free Chronicles of Arax: Solo Adventure Game Core Rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
