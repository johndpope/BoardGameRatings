			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hideous to behold and labeled as maneaters, your kind have a long and involved history that predates the kingdoms of man, possibly even elves and dwarves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your families are now scattered, but due to your divine origin and powers no less threatening. Some lurk in the forests, tormenting and consuming the flesh of those unfortunate to cross their path. Others are powerful warriors, leading armies of rakshasas and other demons on bloody campaign against the civilized races. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But looks can be deceiving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of you fight for good causes, using your powers to confuse, terrify, and butcher the real monsters that inhabit the lands, ruins, and caverns of Dungeon World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are you, a slayer or savior?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with The Ghoul, The Mummy, The Vampire, The Oni, and The Golem, this class more closely adheres to its mythological roots: you don't have a tiger head (at least not by default) or backwards facing palms, and blessed crossbow bolts aren't going to be more effective than any other weapon (or any other holy weapon, if you take Demon Skin).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead you have powerful claws, can turn invisible, use illusions to change your form, and fly. As you level up, you can choose to become a more powerful warrior or specialize in your abilities, or learn a few new tricks (or grow a few new heads and arms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains four separate pdf files. Two are digest-sized, 20 page pdfs that includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Rakshasa, a complete class with 22 advanced moves: give your illusions substance, draw strength from the flesh of your enemies, instantly appear by your companions in times of need, gird yourself in heavier armor, use your flight to smash into your foes, and more.&lt;br/&gt;    Additional advanced moves, for if you want to focus even more on magic and/or illusions.&lt;br/&gt;    New weapons (like the chakram and katar), mirror armor, dungeon gear, and a new magic item.&lt;br/&gt;    A director's cut that provides an explanation for some of the moves, and even some questions to ask yourself when rolling up a rakshasa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
