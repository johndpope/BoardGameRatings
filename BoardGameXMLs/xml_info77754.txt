			<description>User Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Romba is a small-scale Kegelspiel. Kegeln is roughly the traditional German equivalent to Bowling. &lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a large tilted board with a frame on which nine pins can be placed. The players spin tops (two of different sizes are provided) to topple the pins. Because of the incline of the board, it is easy to miss the pins altogether; and toppling all nine with one strike can be achieved only after much practice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can play it in teams or free for all. Mespi has introduced 3 variants, small (= Mini), medium (= Tiroler Tischkegelspiel) and large (= Meraner Tischkegelspiel), all with similar rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game seems to have been produced since at least 1905 and well into the 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These sort of table games were merely used in pubs (Bavaria, Tirol) during 19th century, often combined with (forbidden) wagering activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
