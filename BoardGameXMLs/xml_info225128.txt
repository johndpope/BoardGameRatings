			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leriel is the largest settlement controlled by a Jarin noble in the Kingdom of Orbaal. Located near the upper reaches of the Anoth River, it is one of the oldest permanent communities in northern H&amp;acirc;rn. The castle is a reminder of the days when the region, then known as Jara, was the domain of the Jarin people, an era that ended with the coming of viking invaders from Ivinia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Leriel Castle article describes the settlement's history, government, religion, economics, and military forces. Details are given for some of the local craftsmen and other locations in the settlement. Includes a full description and color floor plans for the keep, along with color GM and player maps of the settlement. Also includes a 4-page expanded description of the Temple of Ilvir, one of that religion's primary H&amp;acirc;rnic temples and a major stop on the pilgrimage trail to Ilvir's Tower and the Pit of Araka-Kalai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
