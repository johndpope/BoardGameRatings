			<description>Two or 4 players gather to build a monolithic tower by placing a set of unique blocks on a foundation.  The first player to fail to place their block, or to think they can't place their block loses.&lt;br/&gt;This game features head to head play, and team play in partnerships of 2.  There are 2 sets of 24 blocks made of reclaimed wood, a base with a 5&amp;times;5 grid, and two bags for each player's blocks.&lt;br/&gt;The idea in placing a block is to set yourself up with as many future options as possible while trying to eliminate placement options for the opponent.&lt;br/&gt;This game is an excellent tool for teaching small motor skills and spatial recognition.  It can be played by children age 6 and up.  It's one of those games that take 5 minutes to learn, and a lifetime to master.  It offers great replayability as each game is short, and each tower you build is unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
