							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Wire to Wire  The Horse Racing Game</name>
									
			<description>A dice based horse racing game, where you can play multiple roles of a jockey, a handicapper, or an owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horses and Jockeys are rated with a rep value (the higher the value the better the horse or jockey) a common feature of all Two Hour Wargame rules. Horses are also rated by style of running and effectiveness of within their style.  The styles are Frontrunner (breaking hard from the gate), Stalkers (sits off the lead, then tries to close on the home stretch) and Closers (who run hard and the end). Finally it has a Class Rating, that is a race variable, that effects the horse on the day of the race. (making predicting the performance of a horse on any race, more troublesome).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is fulled with horse racing terms and explanations, and comprehensive system for rating a horse to determine the odds of any race, and a full on campaign system, with buying, training and racing your horses and choosing your jockeys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Product Description from the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE SPORT OF KINGS, THE SPORT OF EVERYMAN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a year in early May, the sports world stops and takes note. It's the running of the Kentucky Derby, the first leg of the Triple Crown of thoroughbred horse racing. It's a time where the casual fan and the hardcore handicapper share the rail as they watch to see if there will be another Triple Crown winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But horse racing is much more than the Derby. It's the come from behind winner, the wire to wire runner, the long shot that defies all odds as it bolts across the finish line in dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wire to Wire brings the excitement of thoroughbred horseracing to you in three different ways.&lt;br/&gt;As a jockey you make all the decisions as to setting the pace, moving up, and finally when to make a run for the finish line.&lt;br/&gt;As a handicapper you bet on the horses, not only to win but also in the Daily Double and Exactas.&lt;br/&gt;And as an owner you take your horse from auction to winner&amp;rsquo;s circle by deciding which races to enter and which jockeys to hire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wire to Wire we provide over two hundred horses in thirty races for you to use. And if that&amp;rsquo;s not enough we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to build your own horse! Wire to Wire can be played solo or competitively, head to head. We've included a track, horses, and everything else you need to run your races. In fact, we've provided a Power Point version that you can play right on your computer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So lay out the track, grab some dice and get ready for some fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wire to Wire, THE horse racing game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
