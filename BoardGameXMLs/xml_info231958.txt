							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Furies of the Barrens</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hidden in their towering eyries, near-omnipotent Overlords rule over the Barrens, a rocky desert that was once a fertile land. Armed with psychotronic mind-control devices, they wage petty wars against each other, mustering armies of slaves, monsters, and lab-created humanoids. Scattered communities of Oms, Sluggors, Splitters, Starheads, Lotus Eaters, Blackbills, Spinetails, Goatfolk, Crystal Eyes, White Scales, Redclaws, Fire-Belchers, and Grafters, eke out a bare existence on limited supplies of food and water. But some refuse to live like this. Some dream of lush lands beyond the Barrens. They become outcasts, reavers, explorers, adventurers. They become the Furies of the Barrens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furies of the Barrens is a traditional, pen-and-paper role-playing game by Andrea Sfiligoi, based on the Black Hack by David Hack. No other books are required to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING: This RPG mentions adult themes (sex, slavery, drug abuse, violence). Parental discretion is recommended.
