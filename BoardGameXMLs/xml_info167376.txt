			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMERICA'S JOAN OF ARC!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When first-generation American Patricia Patrios decided to complain about harsh working conditions on the factory assembly line, it started a series of events that would pit her against Nazi agents, gangsters, and other enemies of the American Dream. In 1941, as war-clouds gathered on America's shores, &amp;quot;Pat Patriot&amp;quot; became a symbol of the American spirit for the people to rally around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pat Patriot presents the four best adventures of this largely forgotten Golden Age patriotic female hero, who debuted several months before Wonder Woman. In addition to the classic comic book tales, the book features a complete ROLF! supplement in which sat is teamed with another great American hero, Bronze Terror!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trivia: Pat Patriot (as well as the Bronze Terror) came to be during a long weekend of feverish creation when publisher Lev Gleason crammed writers and artists into a couple of hotel rooms to make content for a follow-up series to the one-shot Daredevil Battles Hitler. She was featured in Daredevil Comics 2 - 11 (Agu. 1941 - June 1942). The series title was intially used on an unrelated one-shot gag strip starring a blond teenaged boy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
