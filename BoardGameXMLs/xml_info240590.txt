			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work is slow in this autumn, and our adventurers have been dispatched by a library of magic to retrieve some sensitive alchemical materials from a hermit-wizard near the village of Gam. Not the most glamorous job, but hey, in this economy. And why not indulge in some cozy cider-tasting on the company dime? Besides, there have been some tantalizing rumors of strange goings-on in the borderlands: sightings of errant gargoyles near the ruins of Athalantar; whisperings of undead rising out of fallen leaves in country churchyards; even tales of household objects coming to life and harassing unsuspecting housewives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will the PCs meet a terrifying animated scarecrow? A strange child with a doll who tells her secrets? Will they stumble upon arcane treasures long-hidden in the tomb of a legendary vanquished lich? Psh, dunno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
