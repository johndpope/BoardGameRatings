							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Heroic Toolkits: Vehicles (Revised)</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heroic Toolkits; Vehicles, is the first in a new line of sourcebooks for the True20 game system. Each product in this series will provide Players and Narrators with exciting resources for their True20 series!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicles make exciting props for a True20 story. They create instant images in the minds of players and represent mobility, travel, passion, conflict, intrigue and virtually any other emotion or concept that the Narrator wishes. When the Narrator describes the villain arriving in a pearl white Aston Martin or escaping in a sputtering Sopwith Camel World War I biplane, a scene is set in the minds of the players! Vehicles help set the scene and help create an image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The True20 rules provide basic statistics for a few common types of vehicles. This supplement provides the Narrator with more. More vehicles, more options, more feats and more suggestions on gameplay. Spice up your True20 story with True20 vehicles&amp;mdash;up in space, below the waves, on the freeways or the muddy dirt track roads of some medieval kingdom. More action and excitement awaits!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicles is a 60 page vehicle sourcebook, providing you with a plethora of vehicles suitable for use in fantasy, golden age, modern, post modern and sci-fi genres. Optional rules are also provided, expanding on the chase rules intriduced in Technothrillers: A True20 Espionage Toolkit. Also included are new vehicle weapons and feats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
