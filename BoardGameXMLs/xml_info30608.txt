							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Great Pyramid</name>
									
			<description>The first player to climb to the top of the Great Pyramid becomes the Pharaoh and rules those beneath him.  This game may be played by two, three, or four players.  Each player moves around the board by rolling dice, following directions on the color coded hieroglyph cards and avoiding being sent to the tomb.  A more refined rule set for adults is included.  A brief history of ancient Egypt and a map are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
