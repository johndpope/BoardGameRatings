							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Guardians of the Past</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prometheans have left many wondrous treasures and technological secrets just waiting to be discovered, but they have also left behind terrible guardians to protect them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sourcebook collects nine of these guardians that are still stalking forgotten ruins and alien installations. Intrepid explorers will have to deal with their advanced energy weaponry and rapid regeneration or join the other treasure hunters that have perished in such areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the vigilant Watchshade to the terrifying Dreadshade, there are more than enough challenges even for a high-level party. Guardians range from level 3 to 9 and have enough tricks to keep even the most seasoned and well-equipped players on their toes!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
