			<description>Mutanter och Maskiner (&amp;quot;Mutants and Machines&amp;quot;) is an MMO (Modestly Multiplayer Offline) board game, developped for the Swedish game convention Lincon in 2011, heavily influenced by the game &amp;quot;Marketeer&amp;quot; (space-themed, designed with Eve Online in mind) from the convention Kattcon 2009 in Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is based on the concept of &amp;quot;a large player base (20-60 persons) that comes and goes&amp;quot; and goes on for about 2-4 consequtive days with a maximum of about 8 players &amp;quot;logged in&amp;quot; at the same time. The game requires a game master who controls the game flow. (Due to the nature of the game being active at all times, there needs to be several game masters taking turns.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a large game board map. Players create characters and move around on the map picking up tokens which allow them to draw cards that represent resources, foes to defeat, missions or certain events. Players form &amp;quot;clans&amp;quot; consisting of 2-4 players and roam around the board, pursuing missions, earning experience points, money and points for their clan. Clan points are rewarded for completing missions that advance the game. Clans with high points may build home bases around the board and earn other privilegies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can &amp;quot;log out&amp;quot; (leave the game) at any time. All cards the player has are saved. The player can come back at any time and re-enter the game by simply reclaiming his cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the convention or set time (2-4 days) is at an end, at which point the clan with the most points wins. The game may also end if players manage to fulfil any end-game requirement set up by the game master(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
