							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jack the Ripper: The game you play before the game</name>
									
			<description>Jack the Ripper is an Engle Matrix Game about hunting down London's most famous mass murderer. The players each champion one of six characters: Jack the Ripper, The Inspector, Lady Coverup, Lord Brutal, Mr. Revenge and Pretty Nell (everyone's victim). Each character has conflicting goals which lead them to try to pin the murders on one another or try to capture or protect Jack. The game plays in a whirl wind of back stabbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn players pick a question from the game board to answer. Another player judges how likely it is to happen. A roll is made and the action happens or doesn't. If it happens it becomes a fact. Facts add up to tell the story. Players can interrupt answers with counter-arguments that are resolved with a dice rolling contest. This is a beginner game that can be played by anyone. It is about a murderer though so there is plenty of violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game consists of a 16x21 color laminated sheet that folds up into a 8x10.5 folio for storage. There is a separate laminated rules sheet that stores in the folio. The back side of the sheet has the front and back of the folio and an example of play. The game board side of the sheet has a game opening narrative, a cast of six characters (each with a picture and short written description) and a large picture with plot driving questions listed on it. The rules sheet includes all the rules needed to play including the &amp;quot;Argument Strength Table&amp;quot; that is used to judge how strong argument are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is available in a PDF and paper version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chris Engle&lt;br/&gt;Hamster Press = Engle Matrix Games&lt;br/&gt;3-15-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
