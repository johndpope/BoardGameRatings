			<description>Ever bought a used car? In Sucker you get to be on the other side of that transaction. Use all the lures and hooks you can to turn that prospect into a buyer and move that inventory. Sucker is a fast paced family oriented game that starts with an exciting auction, and continues as you try to sell more cars than your competitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the auction phase, each player tries to get the most inventory from the used car auction. Then the players choose their sales strategies, everything from free trips to low down dirty tricks are at your disposal. And finally you use those strategies to steal customers from your opponents and make the deal. The one who can move the most inventory wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game gets really intense when you have 5-8 players. It is fully playable with only 3 players, but when you have 5 or more, the auctions become really intense, and that's when you can start seeing some real wheeling and dealing heat up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
