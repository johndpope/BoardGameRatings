							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Indiana Jones: Fortune and Glory</name>
									
			<description>&amp;ldquo;If Adventure has a Name, it must be Indiana Jones.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the 1930s. The world is in the grip of the Great Depression. Across the globe war clouds gather. The Japanese have invaded China. The Italians are in Ethiopia. Adolf Hitler is planning to build an empire while Stalin butchers millions of his own people. Spain is engulfed in civil war. Britain, France, and America are too weak to stop the gathering tide of blood. In these chaotic times Dr. Henry Jones Jr., known by his nickname &amp;ldquo;Indiana,&amp;rdquo; quests after lost artifacts. In doing so he must battle gangsters, cultists, thugs, and worst of all Nazis, who are fanning out across the globe looking for items that will allow them to found a 1,000 year Reich.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;The return of the great adventure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Indiana Jones: Fortune and Glory you play either as Indiana Jones or his adversaries, battling across Africa, Asia, and Europe as you try to recover some of the greatest artifacts of human history. As Indy you rely upon your wits, your weapons, and a small cadre of allies, including Marion, Sallah, Short Round, and Henry Jones Sr. The Villains rely more upon brute force, utilizing a host of henchmen. More importantly, they must use an asortment of talented and morally dubious individuals, including Belloq, Toht, Lao Che, Mola Ram, Elsa, and Vogel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You call this archaeology?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player deploys some cards to locations, battling for either artifacts or an advantage. Some locations have a puzzle rating, which must also be overcome in order to gain artifacts, with each item being worth victory points. Special cards handle the events. While some cards are free, most are deployed by discarding cards from your hand. Each deck is asymmetrical. The Villains rely upon brute force, while Indy must often use event cards to get out of a jam. The game is meant to be played quickly. And of course, some of the greatest lines in the series will have cards&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Indiana Jones. I always knew some day you'd come walking back through my door.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Marion Ravenwood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fr&amp;auml;ulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to...&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Toht&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Snakes. Why'd it have to be snakes?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Indiana Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Indiana, we are simply passing through history. This...this is history.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Rene Belloq&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Indiana Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Drop them, Dr. Jones! They will be found! You won't!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Mola Ram&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Prepare to meet Kali... in Hell!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Indiana Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I'm going home to Missouri where they never feed you snakes before ripping your heart out and lowering you into hot pits!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Willie Scott&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;You lost today, kid. But that doesn't mean you have to like it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Fedora&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;And this is how we say goodbye in Germany, Dr. Jones.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Colonel Vogel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne. Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky...&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Henry Jones Sr.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;He chose poorly.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Grail Knight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
