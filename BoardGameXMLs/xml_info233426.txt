							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hunt for the Oni</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon breaking through a heavy fog, the PCs find themselves in a small hamlet with fourteen homes. A man named Fartoas stops them and tells them that they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here. Two people have disappeared and the denizens are convinced that there is an Oni hiding among them. The problem is, the location these people decided to settle down in is cursed. Fartoas tells them that he is the mayor of the hamlet, not to tell anyone else, and he asks for their help. He explains that they&amp;rsquo;ve all come together from different walks of life and value privacy. All town roles are fulfilled anonymously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
