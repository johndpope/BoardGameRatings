			<description>From the rear cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking for a good Traveller scenario for a convention or a One Shot session? Only have an hour or two before the game, and you've got nothing ready? The One-Act Adventures series offers an evening's worth of great science fiction gaming without the hassles of preparation time. Although this adventure is written for the Traveller OGL system, game masters that are more familiar with other science fiction rules systems should be able to translate the game mechanics of this adventure to the rules system of their choice with relative ease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Vengeance By Proxy, the executive of a local mercantile corporation asks the party to seek out a crime lord and deliver a package for him, all while avoiding the notice of other interested parties. This adventure is designed to appeal to characters with a wide range of skills, although investigative, combat and stealth skills would be beneficial. Also included with this One-Act Adventure are game mechanics for the futuristic sport of Gee-Ball, complete world data and subsector map for the Cepheus Subsector, and two pages of Library Data related to the Azri Drakara Campaign Setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product supplements the 2D6 open-gaming system presented in the Traveller System Reference Document, and requires the use of the Traveller main rules book, which is available from Mongoose Publishing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
