							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Berenstain Bears Nature Walk Game</name>
									
			<description>This is a game for very young children.  Each player takes a pawn representing one of the members of the Bear family.  The goal is to be the first to reach the end of the path.  On his turn, a player moves the number of spaces he spun on the spinner.  If he ends his move on a space with a face-down animal tile, he guesses what kind of animal is shown on the other side of the tile.  He then turns it over to see if his guess was correct.  If so, he gets to take another turn.  Some spaces show the silhouette of an animal.  If a player ends his move on one of these spaces, he can move ahead one extra space if he can correctly identify the animal shown in the silhouette.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
