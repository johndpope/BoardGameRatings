			<description>In World in Four, players try to assemble sets of nation cards by grabbing them from both the table and opponents. Each player starts with twelve cards in hand (or ten, depending on the number of players) and fourteen cards are arranged in a grid on the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a turn, the active player reveals one card from the table to all players; if she thinks she can make a set of four cards (including the revealed one), she attempts to do so, claiming them as a set if she does so and adding one card from her hand to the face-down array if she fails. (She also turns the revealed card face down again.) The player then identifies an opponent and names a country or number. If that opponent has such a card, he must hand it over to her and she takes another turn; otherwise her turn ends and the player she attempted to steal from takes the next turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once all cards have been played as sets, the game ends. Sets numbered 6-13 are worth that many points, the South Korea set is worth 10 points, and all other sets are worth 5 points each. The player with the highest score wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
