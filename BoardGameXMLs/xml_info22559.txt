							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Today I Went to the Market</name>
									
			<description>This is one of the games in the Tiny Tins series by Patch Products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is basically a board game version of I Spy.  Players look at the board and say &amp;quot;Today I went to the market and saw something . . .&amp;quot;  Other players then try to guess what the player saw.  If you guess correctly, you get one of the grocery tokens.  If no one guesses correctly, then you get a token.  The game ends when all of the tokes are gone, with the winner being the player with the most tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
