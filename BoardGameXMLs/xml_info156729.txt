							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Horrid Hallways</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Spaces: Horrid Hallways offers a collection of three tables to offer inspiration and add some detail to the next hallway your PCs have to travel through or explore. Though not all hallways are exciting, occasionally you can add an extra splash to their surroundings and make them wonder what else they've missed. It starts by determining which sense you use for the description, then deciding what element you&amp;rsquo;re describing and gaining some sensory detail about that element.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re detailing a castle hallway filled with mirrors (Smell/Mirrors/Cracking) you might get...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;ldquo;Many small mirrors line the walls of this hallway. Now aged and dirty, if you clean some of the grime away you can see cracks forming in the silver backing of a few. But it's the smell you find odd... a combination of dust and an unfamiliar dampness as though something wet is oozing through those cracks behind each pane of glass...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thousands of possible combinations will inspire an insane number of adventurous encounters and hidden dangers. Your players may wonder if you double as an actor in horror movies with all the crazy things you add to the scene...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the next in a series of short (2- to 4-page), system-neutral supplements from Moebius Adventures designed to encourage more creative descriptions in your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
