							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Blueprint for Imagination: Family Affair</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 20 years the Scalducci Family has dominated the city&amp;rsquo;s racketeering and black market activities, efficiently exiling their rivals from town ... or treating those who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t scram to a new pair of cement shoes down at the docks. Even more storied than the Scalduccis is their secret weapon: a man known only as &amp;ldquo;Mr. Lewis.&amp;rdquo; Lewis is a certified public accountant who has cooked the Scalducci books for close to a decade, keeping the capos out of prison and the don squeaky clean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in the nine years since he took the job, Lewis has never left his private apartment at the Scalducci estate. He&amp;rsquo;s been under armed guard around the clock. No one knows the man, and no one in the city has ever seen his face. However that is all about to change tonight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This great new module from Matthew Cutter is sure to be a hit whether you run this at a gaming convention or as a one-shot at your local gaming store. This module stands alone or could simply be one of the many adventures your players undertake as part of a larger campaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This module uses the &amp;quot;Concentrix: An Average Nightclub&amp;quot; floorplan from Fabled Environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
