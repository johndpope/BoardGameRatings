			<description>Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne (known as Journey to the Moon in the United Kingdom) is a point-and-click adventure game with pre-rendered graphics, developed by Kheops Studio and published by The Adventure Company for the PC in 2005. The game's story focuses on a French adventurer's journey to the moon in the 19th century, and the ancient lunar civilization he finds there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voyage is loosely based on the novels From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon by science-fiction author Jules Verne, and the novel The First Men in the Moon by science-fiction author H.G. Wells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &amp;quot;Intelligence Management System&amp;quot; featured in Voyage is a score assigned to the player by the inhabitants of the moon. For each puzzle the player solves, and for certain actions, the score is increased and the inhabitants of the moon treat the player with more respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voyage is set in the year 1851. President Barbicane of the 'Gun Club' decides to build an enormous cannon in Baltimore to shoot a shell, capable of supporting human life, towards the moon in the hopes of a successful landing. Voyage's protagonist, Michel Ardan, volunteers to travel in the aluminium shell. After the game's brief introduction in the shell, Ardan lands on the moon and discovers the intelligent creatures and lush plant life living there. The main accessible areas in the game are the moon's surface, and the underground Selenite civilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voyage begins as Ardan awakes in the shell and discovers his two dead companions: Barbicane and Nicholl. He finds a note written by Barbicane, explaining that he and Nicholl had sacrificed themselves for Ardan, as there was insufficient oxygen to support three men. Ardan also finds a note that Barbicane had concealed in his hat from Diana, and a love letter from Diana to Nicholl. Once Ardan successfully lands on the moon, he must solve a series of puzzles on the surface in order to gain access the hidden civilization below. There he encounters the Selenite civilization. Then Ardan focusses on finding a way to leave the moon and report his findings to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
