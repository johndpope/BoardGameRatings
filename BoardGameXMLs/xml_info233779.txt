							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Jade Regent Interactive Maps Set</name>
									
			<description>Publisher's blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a compilation of 32 maps from the entire Jade Regent Adventure Path, with special PDF-only interactive features: buttons that allow you to hide map tags and/or grids, or engage a player-friendly view, hiding secret doors and even obscuring secret rooms! These are the exact same maps that appear throughout the Jade Regent Adventure Path, presented at the exact same scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These interactive features are fully supported in current versions of Adobe Reader, but they may not work reliably with other PDF viewers. (In particular, Apple's PDF renderer does not currently support these interactive features, so they won't work with Apple's Preview app or iOS devices, including iPads and iPhones.) If your reader does not support the interactive features, you'll usually be able to see the maps, but the buttons won't hide anything. Adobe Reader is a free download from adobe.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the Interactive Maps for each individual volume of the Adventure Path are already included with the PDF edition of the corresponding book, so if you already have the full set of Jade Regent PDFs, you do not need this collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive maps do not support image extraction in Adobe Reader. The non-interactive versions of the maps can be found in the PDF editions of the individual Adventure Path volumes and may be extracted from those files. See the Interactive Map FAQ for more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
