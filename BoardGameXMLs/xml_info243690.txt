			<description>A game produced in the 1950s, comparable to but significantly different from the game with the same name Dong Wu Qi that's more widely known today. The name just means &amp;quot;Animal Chess&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Animals Game&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a chess-style game played on a 9x13 board, with each player having 16 different animal pieces. The animals are grouped into four different categories with four different movement rules (domestic animals, wild animals, insects and birds): within each group, weaker animals may not capture stronger animals. Each player's Lion piece, the most powerful of the wild animals, is confined to the mountain area at the end of the board, and the object of the game is to capture the opponent's Lion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is described in Cazaux and Knowlton &amp;quot;A World of Chess&amp;quot; (2017) as having been discovered in an online auction in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
