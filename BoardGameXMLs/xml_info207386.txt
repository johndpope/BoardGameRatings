			<description>Love Will Tear Us Apart&lt;br/&gt;A sad little game about dividing your stuff after a divorce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to play: &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;1. Hold the paper up between each other for 5 seconds. The side you are looking at shows your goal items. You then flip the paper over so each player is looking at the other player's side. (maybe draw a little stick figure example?)&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;2. Each player takes turns trying to rip out a single item at a time from the items on their goal side WITHOUT looking at it while the other player holds the page up.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;3. Each item successful ripped off in full, with no pieces of any other item on the same piece is worth one point. Most points when all the items are taken or damaged wins.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;4. Check PrettiestPrincessGames.com for a rules video and more details and variants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll find that in the process of trying to get the most stuff, you'll not only end up destroying what you want by accident, but also knowingly trashing the stuff your ex wants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Prettiest Princess Games Consumable 1-Sheet line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
