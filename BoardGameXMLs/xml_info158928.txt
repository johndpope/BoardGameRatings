			<description>From the inlay:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;NIGEL MANSELL'S GRAND PRIX&amp;quot; is ready to take you and your computer into the fast lane of game excitement. As well as capturing the speed and adrenalin pumping danger of the world's greatest sporting spectacle, the game is the first racing simulation to reflect some of the enormous advances in car design and technology that have taken place recently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yet the game still offers an excellent opportunity for even the most inexperienced novice to blast round the track at excessive speeds with the turbo on maximum boost and not a care in the world for fuel consumption, tyre wear or racing line. However, for those who know, or want to know a little more, there is an opportunity to race a selection of the world's greatest circuits in the quest for valuable championship points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The red lights are on - you snap into gear.&lt;br/&gt;The engine roars - your grip tightens on the steering wheel.&lt;br/&gt;The crowd goes wild as the lights flash to green.&lt;br/&gt;900 brake horsepower is suddenly unleashed and the Williams hurtles to the first bend.&lt;br/&gt;Ahead of you lies 31 weeks of the world's most gruelling and spectacular sporting championship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spectrum cassette versions include a 48k version on one side and a 128k version on the other. The 48k version is multi-load, with each track being loaded separately. The memory limitation also means that the dashboard graphics are loaded from tape and must stay permanently on-screen. The 128k version loads all the tracks in a single load, and also allows the dashboard to be shown only when actually racing. The extra screen real-estate allows larger menus and additional information to be given about each circuit prior to the races. The user can also choose to practice any circuit, rather than being limited to tackling them in order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credits (Spectrum and Amstrad versions):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: Dave Looker&lt;br/&gt;Graphics: John Looker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
