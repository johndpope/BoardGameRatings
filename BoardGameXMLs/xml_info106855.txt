			<description>from the back of the box&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computer&amp;rsquo;s down and it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to fix it. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you and an expert named Charlie Fixit. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s easy. Not by a long shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start by crawling inside. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Into the computer. Stray charges called &amp;quot;transients&amp;quot; zap around your head. Be careful you don&amp;rsquo;t become charged with static electricity or you&amp;rsquo;ll burn out the parts you touch. And make sure you keep your eyes open. Remember, you&amp;rsquo;re in here to find what&amp;rsquo;s wrong. You&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn to spot faulty chips, bad connections, clogged fans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It sounds tough. And it is. But it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad. After all, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen parents play it. One of them even won once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A SPECIAL WORD TO PARENTS. D-Bug is a wonderful way to introduce your children -&amp;ndash; and you -&amp;ndash; to the terminology and basic workings of computers. But beyond this specific knowledge, players also learn to link causes and effects, and to develop their own strategies for solving problems. We are constantly surprised by the ingenious solutions matter-of-factly tossed off by he very young.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
