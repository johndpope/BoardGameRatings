							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Saber of London</name>
									
			<description>Based on the 1950's TV series of the same name. It is a detective game with some similarities to Cluedo in that the aim of the game is to identify the murderer. &lt;br/&gt;Up to 4 players use a telephone shaped spinner to move around the board collecting clues. Clues are recorded on crime sheets and the first player to correctly identify the murderer is the winner. &lt;br/&gt;The board comprises of 6 bedrooms, a bathroom, reception and Sabers office. Squares around these rooms allow players to move around the board depending on the number they spin.&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 wooden playing pieces and a spinner. There are 6 card men (one of which is the murderer) and a card body (a woman). The card men are stood in wooden blocks. There are also 6 clues cards (only 5 used in any one game) and 6 cards keys, silvered on one side and with a letter referring to a bedroom on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
