			<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;UNRELEASED GAME - CANCELLED&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;This game was cancelled in development. Please only submit images if you own a copy or have legal access to this item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dead Rush was a cancelled video game that was designed by Treyarch and would have been published by Activision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game would have taken place in the town of Eastport where a massive earthquake has destroyed most of humanity. As Jake, a character suffering from memory loss, the players job was to try to find out exactly what happened in Eastport, which is now overflowing with zombies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game's main claim to fame was the fact that as Jake players could operate one of several vehicles scattered around town. Not only would this provide the player with a means of transportation but it would also serve as armor of sorts. The zombies in Eastport would try to wreck whatever car Jake was driving. Luckily the player could create new vehicles out of parts of previously demolished cars. A female mechanic could also put new parts and items on cars that would be more powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game would have featured few load times, as after an initial boot up the game would never pause to load data from the disc again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was announced at E3 2004 and set to be released in 2005. It was cancelled shortly thereafter. An E3 preview in Nintendo Power magazine dubbed the gameplay &amp;quot;Grand Theft Undead&amp;quot;, while Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine called it &amp;quot;Grand Theft Evil.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Dead Rush&amp;quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
