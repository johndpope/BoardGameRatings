							<name primary="true" sortindex="5">The Hero System Genre by Genre</name>
									
			<description>From the introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the best things about the HERO System is that once you learn the rules, you can use it to create games for any genre, time period, or setting. Campaigns as diverse as gritty modern espionage, fantasy tales featuring demigods, epic science fiction wars with starships and battlemechs, and crimefighting four-color superheroes all work with the HERO System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help you get started learning the HERO System and deciding what sort of game you want to run, this chapter provides a brief overview of the major genres common to roleplaying games, and shows you how to play characters and campaigns in them using the HERO System. It reviews some of the major elements or important features of each genre, and explains how you can simulate them with the HERO System rules. Each section also includes one or two sample characters you can use as guidelines for creating your own characters or NPCs for scenarios you plan to run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, what are you waiting for? It&amp;rsquo;s time to learn how to be a Hero!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
