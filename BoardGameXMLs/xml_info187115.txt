			<description>User summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potestas has an interesting development history that involves several commercial game systems.  It began as a series of user customization changes to Corgi Books' Dragon Warriors game.  The game continued to progress and incorporate elements of Hero Games' Champions game.  As the system continued to evolve the author decided to re-tool the entire game into Potestas, a new and original system that subsequently was published as free HTML consisting of several major pages.  Potestas continued to evolve for some time before it was once again re-written and presented as revised Potestas, this time as a series of rules modifications (&amp;quot;house rules&amp;quot;) and extensions to Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 3rd Edition game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Potestas system described here is the pre-revised version of the standalone, original game system as published in mid-2001 and essentially finalized in early 2002.  It was developed alongside the author's Selentia Campaign and setting and the two comprise a matched game and genre setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
