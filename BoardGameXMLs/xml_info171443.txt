							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">My Big Break</name>
									
			<description>My Big Break is a board game about auditioning in musical theatre. Components of the game are pawns, dice, money, credits, bitter cards, closing cards, and the board pieces. The general idea is that players go on gigs and accumulate a resume in the form of credits so that they eventually are qualified and ready to audition for their 'Big Break'. Booking this gig wins the game.&lt;br/&gt; Player take turns. Each turn has four phases. The first is an income phase, where players earn credits and/or money (except when in NYC, where they have to pay to live there). The second phase is an audition phase where they roll dice to see if they are cast in a gig. The third phase is a movement phase. The last phase the players either can play a 'bitter card' or they 'take class'. Playing a bitter card generally has a detrimental effect on another player. Taking class involves exchanging money and other resources to gain special advanced credits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bitter cards are generally earned by failing to book auditions. Closing cards are earned by completing professional gigs. Specialty Credits are required to audition for more advanced gigs, such as Cruise Line and Bus 'N Truck. A player must possess all three specialty credits (acting, vocal, and dance) and must have 15 total credits or more to audition for their 'Big Break'. If a player fails this audition, he/she loses an advanced credit, a generic credit, and gains two bitter cards. Play continues until somebody books their 'Big Break'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A future expansion of My Big Break is planned which will contain the option to work for a Theme Park and a Dinner Theatre. Players will also be able to wait tables in NYC and take an agent there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
