			<description>While Prof Von Neumann's Mechanikal Marvels may be much admired in academic circles, inside his lab it appears these clockwork amobeas are locked in a brutal struggle for survival!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This game is intended for small parties of up to 8, but the game achieves maximum cerebral satisfaction between a pair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each turn a player, gentlemen or lady, may place or move tiles that add to their amobea, strengthening, attacking or shielding it from the predations of others. If they were fortunate enough to have overlapped (and thus devoured) tiles of their opponent on the previous turn, their amobea's increased vitality is expressed by the placement (or movement) of extra tiles in this turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is simplicity itself, but brings to mind the mental challenge faced by two wrestlers of that delicate Oriental sport, Sumo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
