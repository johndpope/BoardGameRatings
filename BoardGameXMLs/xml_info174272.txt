							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Imperial Heroes: Pregenerated Characters</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight amazing Asian-flavored pregenerated characters!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imperial Heroes is our second set of 8 society-legal, fully fleshed-out, ready-to-play pregenerated 1st level characters created specifically to shine in a Far East Adventure Path or any campaign with Asian influences, written Neil Spicer and the Legendary Games Design Team, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Akobi Thiesson, honor guard cavalier&lt;br/&gt;    Jin Thiesson, human rogue&lt;br/&gt;    Masato Koshin, martial artist monk&lt;br/&gt;    Caladrel Qoervari, bladebound magus&lt;br/&gt;    Saroune Anzoletta, scrollmaster transmuter&lt;br/&gt;    Kieyanna Waide, cleric of the Goddess of Love&lt;br/&gt;    Ragnar Bralgweir, invulnerable rager barbarian&lt;br/&gt;    and last but not least... Nurch, goblin ninja!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Path campaigns are designed to provide heroic challenges. That means players participating in those campaigns have to create a party of PCs able to handle any situation thrown at them by Paizo&amp;rsquo;s amazing stable of writers. That&amp;rsquo;s where we at Legendary Games come in. Let those very same writers provide you with the characters you need to succeed, all rules-legal and fully compliant!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built using the 20-point-buy method for use in organized play scenarios as well as home campaigns, with scaling notes for 15-point builds, these characters are not just a pile of stats. Each pregen is as much about story as combat, but rest assured that when it&amp;rsquo;s time to thrown down, none of these pregens will be stepping to the sidelines. Print these heroes out and double-dip them in the stuff adventures are made of. Each PC also includes a backstory, a trait selection from the specific campaign&amp;rsquo;s Player&amp;rsquo;s Guide, some special equipment, links to how the character fits into the campaign, and some roleplaying tips. To top it all off, each character comes with preselected choices as they advance in the first few levels, and also include notes about their ultimate design goals so you know what you are working towards. We haven't even mentioned the terrific full-color character portraits by Tanyaporn Sangsnit, Frank Hessefort, and Colby Stevenson!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of our products are geared for the hardworking GM, but this one is for every gamer out there. If you are a player, these PCs should provide endless opportunities for adventure. If you are a GM, you can use these pregenerated characters as NPCs or rival adventuring parties. And if you play or run Pathfinder Society adventures, with a few tweaks these PCs will work for you, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This download includes two files: a &amp;ldquo;full color&amp;rdquo; version, with color backgrounds, and a &amp;ldquo;color ink&amp;rdquo; version that has white backgrounds with color ink, giving you multiple ways to print out these characters for your game table. Permission is included to photocopy and use them for your home games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
