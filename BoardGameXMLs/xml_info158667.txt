			<description>From the Introduction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Covetous Poet's Adventure Creator and Solo GM Guidebook is a resource meant to help roleplaying enthusiasts create their own brand new adventures, as well as to allow them to play their favorite group roleplaying games all by themselves. It doesn't provide any particular roleplaying system, nor rules for how to play. Instead it works in conjunction with roleplaying systems you already own: you'll be able to make up tales for your PCs to play through, and possibly even play those tales solo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Adventure Creator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're still the author when you use the Adventure Creator to make up a roleplaying adventure, but you will have a very powerful friend helping you. The Adventure Creator guides you through the structure used by professionally written adventure supplements, and the Story Charts, found in the middle of this book, can provide you countless combinations of ideas to inspire you and beef up the ideas you already have. Once you've read through the chapter covering the Creator, you'll know all you need to know to go ahead and give adventure writing a try.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chapter that comes after, Variations on the Act Structure will cover several different ways you can build your adventures beyond what you first learn with the Adventure Creator. One of the great things about every system presented in this book is that they are all modifiable and adaptable to whatever you want them to be. No one writes adventures the exact same way, or plays their games the exact same way, so you're always encouraged to make the book adapt to what you want it to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solo GM Guidebook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the Adventure Creator as its primary tool, the Solo GM Guidebook is a system that assists solo roleplayers in playing their games all by themselves. It will show you how to create your adventures as you play them, scene by scene, improvising everything as you go, playing both as the PCs and as the GM. Thanks to the framework provided by the Adventure Creator even improvised adventures can maintain a consistent and coherent narrative that, with a little practice, can be very much like playing with a prewritten supplement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the story of your roleplaying adventure, the Guidebook also has suggestions, tips, and charts to help you make PC personalities, NPCs, improvise conversations, create clues, devise mysteries, and more. Once you have read the chapter you can immediately begin adopting the tools you like to help facilitate your gameplay, and enjoy your favorite RPGs as a solo GM!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
