							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">FREE-O Card Game</name>
									
			<description>This card game is based on the FREE THE BOX board game (now available for purchase!). It is a very easy game to learn and also very addictive for younger players who it is designed for. The idea is that you are hiding in your neighborhood and another team is trying to find and capture you. Deal cards to all players and, in turn, play a &amp;ldquo;Seek and Match&amp;rdquo; card (house, mailbox, fence, etc.) to try and capture your opponents. They have to match the same card or play a &amp;ldquo;Capture&amp;rdquo; card or a &amp;ldquo;Wild&amp;rdquo; card to escape capture. Each round ends when one player finishes their hand and all other players add points for any left-over cards. The game ends when one player reaches 60 points but the lowest score wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
