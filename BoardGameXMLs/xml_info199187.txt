							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rhune: Dawn of Twilight Campaign Guide</name>
									
			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the snowy, icy fields of the North, entire tribes of barbarians &amp;ndash; disease-bound servants of the Thrall Lords &amp;ndash; amass, mustering for Ragnar&amp;ouml;k. Their ears tuned to whispers sane men cannot hear, these horrid foes wait only for the guttural command of their masters. Further south, the dead gather among the ruins of pulverized cities, growing stronger in shadows of the Ghoul Stone, the necromantic bridge between Midgard and Neinferth. All the while, the good people of the South stand divided against their aggressors &amp;ndash; the City-States of Vallinar embracing technology as a means to win Ragnar&amp;ouml;k, while the &amp;aelig;lves and their allies battle to eradicate every trace of it. All the while, the daily tick of the Ragnar&amp;ouml;k Clock marks the passing of another season, bringing every branch of Yggdrasil closer to Ragnar&amp;ouml;k &amp;ndash; the final battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-awaited Rhune: Dawn of Twilight Campaign Guide contains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed look at the world of Rhune, from the lands of the Middle Court to the various realms beyond, including information on:&lt;br/&gt;        Brigl&amp;aelig;ss, the Glimmering Lands&lt;br/&gt;        Grimh&amp;aelig;m, Realm of the Fel &amp;amp; Fallen&lt;br/&gt;        Nachtland, the Shadow Realm&lt;br/&gt;        Neinferth, the Yawning Gap&lt;br/&gt;        Nifl&amp;aelig;heim, the Realm of All-Winter&lt;br/&gt;        Sommerf&amp;aelig;th, the Forest Unburning&lt;br/&gt;        Thodheim, Realm of the Dishonored Dead&lt;br/&gt;        Tieferh&amp;aelig;m, the Underhall of Velash&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    Important information on the technology of Rhune, including details on ambient power fields, dragon towers, as well as how storm tech impacts the various people &amp;ndash; both on Midgard and on other branches of the Great Tree.&lt;br/&gt;    Details on all of the races native to Rhune, including: the &amp;aelig;lves, the aryandai, the automata, the clockwork elves, the dwarves, the glitterfane, the malaran, and the j&amp;ouml;tunfolk.&lt;br/&gt;    Over 90 new unique traits for PCs to choose from.&lt;br/&gt;    Rules for earning and spending both honor and wyrd points.&lt;br/&gt;    Information for any PC that wants to learn to use the runes, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t have arcane or divine abilities.&lt;br/&gt;    Six new classes for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game including: the Blood Skald, the Clockwork Adept, the Gjallarhorn, the Gun Priest, the Juggernaut (of Blind Fury), and the Plague Bringer.&lt;br/&gt;    A greater look at the City-States of Vallinar and the various factions that operate within and beyond them.&lt;br/&gt;    A detailed look at both the &amp;AElig;ssinyr and the Thrall Lords &amp;ndash; the gods who ready for the final battle over Yggdrasil, the Great Tree.&lt;br/&gt;    New rules for extraordinary devices &amp;ndash; items designed to merge magic and technology together.&lt;br/&gt;    A bestiary filled with new monsters for your heroes to fight.&lt;br/&gt;    New spells, incantations, gear, guns, alchemical recipes, and other options unique to the lands of Rhune.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hi, I'm Jaye, creator of Rhune: Dawn of Twilight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When asked to describe Rhune, I tend to call it &amp;quot;Stormpunk.&amp;quot; But what is, exactly, Stormpunk?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally inspired by some of the greatest campaign planar and steampunk settings, Rhune: Dawn of Twilight is truly its own genre, one we affectionately call stormpunk. It is a genre inspired&lt;br/&gt;by steampunk, but one that took a radically different turn, both in terms of culture and technology. While it certainly has some similarities to steampunk as a genre, stormpunk trades steampunk's monocle, Victorian sensibilities, and top hat for a drinking horn, a gear-shaped torque, and a gun-sword. It embraces electricity, but throws off the yoke of Earth's normal history and asks the question&amp;mdash;what if Tesla had been a magician? What if magic and electricity had developed side by side? What if &amp;quot;steam&amp;quot; had lost the technological race and man learned to call power from the very sky itself? All of these questions, alongside the explorations they give birth to, are what give life to stormpunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, that's how I describe it in the book, at least. The fact is, Stormpunk for me is something intensely personal and, in its own way, an extension of my own exploration into alternate fantasy futures, a sort of &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; that plays out in my own pet universe. Except I've invited all of you to come and play, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cheers,&lt;br/&gt;Jaye&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(and yes, if this looks similar to what exists on the Rhune page it is, because I copied it here for consistency). ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
