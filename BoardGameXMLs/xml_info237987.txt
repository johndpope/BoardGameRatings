			<description>From publisher blurb:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind closed doors, our enemies plot our downfall. They grow in strength, hone their blades, search for weakness. They wait for any chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind closed doors, the digital gods count down the hours. They look for the signs, plan our fate, move their pieces into position. They watch from every camera.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behind closed doors, madmen build tools to scar the world. Weapons that cannot be countered, plagues that cannot be cured, codes that cannot be breached. They rush heedless towards ruin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is why we hired you, Agent; why we augmented your body, hardened your mind, forged your weapons. To find the doors closed against us. And tear them down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Incorporated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorporated Volume 2 is a compilation of previously unpublished content which only appeared in PDFs and on the website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a host of brand new material written especially for the book.
