			<description>From the Editors Notes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to issue #8 of The Shadowrun Supplemental! This issue comes out at the worst of times for me &amp;ndash; Final Tests. This means between spending time doing that horrible studying stuff and actually attending all my classes, there&amp;rsquo;s also the end of year and graduation parties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this means I don&amp;rsquo;t have as much time for Shadowrun or the internet as I would like, but since it&amp;rsquo;s been a little more than 2 months since #7, I figured it&amp;rsquo;s time to throw the submissions into the magazine that apparently a whole pile of people love!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two design notes &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped using Bodini BT as the main body font in favour of Times New Roman, which looks better onscreen and is more universal. Also, the large amount of tables and suchlike in some areas of the documents means that they occasionally become invisible in MS Word. To fix this, just minimize and then maximize the document, and it should clear up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not much big news in this issue, although we do have the folks at Ral Partha bringing us excellent discounts on Shadowrun miniatures, this time with a slant towards the corporations, to tie in with FASA&amp;rsquo;s theme of the year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shadowrun Supplemental 1997 Compilation has been delayed gain, and I&amp;rsquo;m feeling apathetic towards the whole thing. I might just wait for Shadowrun 3 to come out, then release all the issues in a compilation updated for Shadowrun 3 mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the Necromancy supplement is online at the TSS Productions web page, but has not yet made its way to DOC and PDF format. Hopefully this will be done by sometime in July.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
