							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Chrome Magic (D20)</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some worlds, Magic may not be seen as a force in and of itself. In some philosophies, magic can not be classed by types of effect, like Evocation, Illusion or Abjuration. Instead, it might be seen as a result of fundamental aspects of arcane metaphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One such theory holds that all magic is a result of the principles of Colour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chrome is not one colour, but rather is a sheen or refraction effect; a rainbow of brightness that might dance at the corner of ones eye, or leap suddenly into view when least expected. Chrome is meta-colour; it shows how the effects of a universe in which spectrum magic manifests upon the very fundamental aspects of the self. It is the colour of alignments and alignment magic, but also the colour that supersedes all the others and yet binds them all together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no Chrome Mages? not exactly. However, some mages do learn powers that affect or transgress the normal chromatic order of the universe. These Prestige classes of Chromatic Arcana are all gathered here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in this product:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    1 new Clerical and Mystical domain &lt;br/&gt;    a linked reclassification of one twelfth of the spells of the players handbook, with some new spell effects to fit the spells into Chromatic Magic Theory, gathered under one uniform domain. &lt;br/&gt;    Six new prestige character classes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ArcMage (Spectromancer) After learning the base powers of several universal chromatic elements, a mage may uncover secrets to the full spectrum of magical power. Sometimes also called Rainbow Magicians, they have the capacity to cast almost all spells available as arcane spells and advanced spell progression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binarist (Meld-Mage) For those that seek mastery of two colours simultaneously, a particular path of development is available (providing those colours are not opposed). They might learn to focus on two separate universal elements, and find ways to mesh them together to develop powerful spell abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monomancer (Coherence Mage) When a specialist chooses to align themselves to the principle of one colour absolutely, to the exclusion of all else, they might become a Monomancer. Such single mindedness has certain advantages, but also affects one?s perspective to some extent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prismatician (Diffraction Mage) The magic of Light has particular relevance to the nature of Colour, and as such it is possible that a Red mage might learn deeper secrets of arcane power through the creation and manipulation of light itself. Their learning gives them access to abilities that are less like spells and more akin to supernatural powers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pulsar (Oscillation Mage) Should a specialist learn that their focus on one chromatic element has made them blind to the opposite, they might seek a balance between the two opposing colours. This often results in fluctuations of ability, but eventually can end in a unique set of powers dependant upon which duality they attempt to bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultramancer (UV Mage) The darker end of the spectrum contains many secrets and vast power. Those that master it might develop a kind of magic from the Shades that is different and yet related to the abilities that Grey Magicians utilise. Some say this represents a hidden colour, or one invisible to the mortal eye that tells of an underlying structure to reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
