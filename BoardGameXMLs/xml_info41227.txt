							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Piecepack Fan Tan</name>
									
			<description>This is a piecepack port. Fan Tan is believed to have been invented by Kwan Chung, a renowned statesmen of antiquity who died in 645BC. There is a likelihood that the game was invented for soldiers as a way for them to pass the time in camp. The name means spreading out, as the real life version involves spreading out coins or buttons in groups of four until there is a remainder of none to three. San Francisco's large chinese community had dozens of Fan Tan Houses in the 19th century. Fan tan is still played at Macau casinos, where play goes on day and night, every day of the week, and bets can be made from 5 cents to 500 dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
