							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Darwin&#039;s Catalogue: The Outsiders</name>
									
			<description>From the PDF:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Victoriana is a world of many sentient races, only a few dominate European society. There are certainly others that are a bit more prevalent elsewhere around the world; some, like the Oni ond the Orcs, are only found in large numbers elsewhere, while the Karakon and Steppegoblins form small but distinct groups. The Giants were once numerous but are now limited to scattered tribes and individuals across the globe. When members of these races do appear in European society they are lumped together under a single sobriquet: the Outsiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darwin's Catalogue: The Outsiders fleshes out four races that are mentioned in the Victoriana Core Rulebook to make them suitable as adventurers in a Victorian world of fantasy and steam. In addition a new race, the diminutive but magical Karakon, are presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Darwin's Catalogue: The Outsiders includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Five new playable races for Victoriana&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; An NPC chart for using these new races as Supporting Cast&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;bull; Rules for Corporeal Mediums (first presented in Jewel of the Empire)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
