							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Luxor: Queenie 3 – Secret Missions</name>
									
			<description>Secret mission tiles give you extra opportunities to earn points by exchanging treasures, keys, scarabs and progression to get even more rewards for them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once a player fulfills the requirements of the mission tile, he puts the needed tiles back into the game box, along with the mission tile, and advances his scoring marker on the track accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player gets one randomly drawn mission tile at the start of the game with an opportunity to get three more during the course of the game. Every time a new adventurer enters the game by crossing over one of the Anubis statues, the player chooses one of the remaining mission tiles associated with that statue and leaves the rest for the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission tiles award many points, but you have to discard the required tiles. So better be sure if it's worth it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contents: 16 mission tiles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
