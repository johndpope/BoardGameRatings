			<description>Fill in the blank, is a word association card game that is as family friendly as you want it to be. The game centers around story cards and each player attempting to figure out which of 3 options the active player picked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As players take turns reading story cards, and matching answers, players collect Fruit Cards until a single player has collected six different fruit and is declared the winner. Of course there are plenty of ways to make sure that your opponent doesn't have an easy time of that, and a group of cheesy bad guys want those Fruit Cards for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players take turns drawing a story card, and reading it aloud. This is where your &amp;quot;Naughty or Nice&amp;quot; decision comes into play - because YOU get to decide what fills in that blank. You also draw a Fruit Card, which will indicate whether the other players need to match the choice of the Story Card reader, or not match it. For instance if a Apple card had been drawn, the other players would need to decide which of the three &amp;quot;blank&amp;quot; options was NOT choosen. We do that with... Letter Cards! After you've read your Story Card aloud all players, including the Story Card reader, play one of their Letter Cards indicating which of the three Story Card options they're choosing this turn. Of course hidden throughout the Fruit Card deck are action cards, and pesky fruit thieves. These cards are resolved immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
